"NOTE 1: 
5G synchronicity budget is the time error between ingress and egress of the 5G system on the 
path of clock synchronization messages (as described in Clause 5.6.0). For indirect network 
connection, 3 cases are considered: 
1) 
If the path of clock synchronization messages is between device and network side, ingress 
and egress of the 5G system are the remote UE and the corresponding UPF on the network 
side. 
2) 
If ingress and egress of the 5G system are at the device side, the 5G synchronicity budget is 
the time error between the involved remote UE and the 5G sync master. 
3) 
If the sync master is inside the 5G system, the 5G synchronicity budget ingress is the sync 
master in the 5G system and egress is the remote UE. 
NOTE 2:  Service Area for indirect network connections between UEs (length x width x height).","","","",""
