"NOTE 1:	One or more retransmissions of network layer packets may take place in order to satisfy the communication service availability requirement.
NOTE 2:	Unless otherwise specified, all communication includes 1 wireless link (UE to network node or network node to UE) rather than two wireless links (UE to UE).
NOTE 3:	Length x width (x height).
NOTE 4:	(void)
NOTE 5:	Communication includes two wireless links (UE to UE).
NOTE 6:	This covers different transfer intervals for different similar use cases with target values of 1 ms, 1 ms to 10 ms, and 10 ms to 50 ms.
NOTE 7:	The transfer interval deviates around its target value by < ±25 %.
NOTE 8:	The transfer interval deviates around its target value by < ±5 %.
NOTE 9:	Communication may include two wireless links (UE to UE).
NOTE 10:	The first value is the application requirement, the other values are the requirement with multiple transmission of the same information (two or three times, respectively).
NOTE 11:	Service Area for direct communication between UEs. The group of UEs with direct communication might move throughout the whole factory site (up to several km²). 
NOTE 12:	Maximum straight-line distance between UEs. 
NOTE 12a:	It applies to both UL and DL unless stated otherwise.
NOTE 13:	It applies to both linear movement and rotation unless stated otherwise. 
NOTE 14:	The mobile operation panel is connected wirelessly to the 5G system. If the mobile robot/production line is also connected wirelessly to the 5G system, the communication includes two wireless links.
NOTE 15:	Service bit rate for one energy storage station.
NOTE 16:	Activity storage nodes/km2. This value is used for deducing the data volume in an area that features multiple energy storage stations. The data volume can be calculated with the following formula (current service bit rate per storage station) x (activity storage nodes/km2) + (video service bit rate per storage station) x (activity storage nodes/km2). 
NOTE 17:	One-way delay from 5G IoT device to backend system. The distance between the two is below 40 km (city range).
NOTE 18:	Typical connection density in today’s city environment. With the evolution from centralised meters to socket meters in the home, the connection density is expected to increase 5 to 10 times. 
NOTE 19:	When the distributed terminals are deployed along an overhead line, there are about 54 terminals per square kilometre. 
NOTE 20: When the distributed terminals are deployed in power distribution cabinets, there are about 78 terminals per square kilometre.
NOTE 21: Service bit rate of the smart metering application between the smart distribution transformer terminal and the energy end equipment. Once there are multiple smart grid applications, the required service bit rate will be higher.
NOTE 22:	The end-to-end latency depends on the applications supported by the smart distribution transformer terminal. The lower the end-to-end latency, the more applications can be supported.
NOTE 23:	The service area is circular with a radius between 100 m and 500 m (0.031 km2 to 0.79 km2).
NOTE 24:	During the normal working phase of the feeder system, the heartbeat packet is transmitted periodically with a 1 s transfer interval. When a fault occurs, the heartbeat is sent with a 2 ms transfer interval.
NOTE 25: The maximum allowed delay between two protection relays would be between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [aa]). For some legacy systems, the end-to-end latency is usually set to 15 ms.
NOTE 26: For a sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms. For 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms."
