The group of UEs with direct communication might move throughout the whole factory site (up to several km²). \\nNOTE 12:\\tMaximum straight-line distance between UEs. \\nNOTE 12a:\\tIt applies to both UL and DL unless stated otherwise.\\nNOTE 13:\\tIt applies to both linear movement and rotation unless stated otherwise. \\nNOTE 14:\\tThe mobile operation panel is connected wirelessly to the 5G system.

This value is used for deducing the data volume in an area that features multiple energy storage stations. The data volume can be calculated with the following formula (current service bit rate per storage station) x (activity storage nodes/km2) + (video service bit rate per storage station) x (activity storage nodes/km2). \\nNOTE 17:\\tOne-way delay from 5G IoT device to backend system.

With the evolution from centralised meters to socket meters in the home, the connection density is expected to increase 5 to 10 times. \\nNOTE 19:\\tWhen the distributed terminals are deployed along an overhead line, there are about 54 terminals per square kilometre. \\nNOTE 20: When the distributed terminals are deployed in power distribution cabinets, there are about 78 terminals per square kilometre.\\nNOTE 21: Service bit rate of the smart metering application between the smart distribution transformer terminal and the energy end equipment. Once there are multiple smart grid applications, the required service bit rate will be higher.\\nNOTE 22:\\tThe end-to-end latency depends on the applications supported by the smart distribution transformer terminal.

When a fault occurs, the heartbeat is sent with a 2 ms transfer interval.\\nNOTE 25: The maximum allowed delay between two protection relays would be between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [aa]). For some legacy systems, the end-to-end latency is usually set to 15 ms.\\nNOTE 26: For a sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms. For 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms.'"
