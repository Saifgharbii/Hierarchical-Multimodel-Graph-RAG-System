"NOTE 1:  The clock synchronicity requirement refers to the clock synchronicity budget for the 5G system, as described in Clause 
5.6.1. 
NOTE 2:   When the distributed terminals are deployed along overhead line, about 54 terminals will be distributed along overhead 
lines in one square kilometre. The resulting power load density is 20 MW/km2. 
NOTE 3:   When the distributed terminals are deployed in power distribution cabinets, there are about 78 terminals in one square 
kilometre. The resulting power load density is 20 MW/km2,","","","",""
