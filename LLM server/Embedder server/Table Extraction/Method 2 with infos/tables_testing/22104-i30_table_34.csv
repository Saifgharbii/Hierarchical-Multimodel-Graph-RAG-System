"NOTE 1: 	It is the smart metering application data rate between the Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal and energy end equipment. Once there are multiple smart grid applications, it is required more data rate.
NOTE 2: 	It depends on different applications supported by the Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal. The less the latency is, the more applications can be supported.
