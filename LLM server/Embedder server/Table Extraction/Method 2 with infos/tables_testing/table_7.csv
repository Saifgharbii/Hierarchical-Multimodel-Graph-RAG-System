"NOTE 1:  The transfer interval deviates around its target value by < ± 25 %. 
NOTE 2:  The traffic is predominantly mobile originated. 
NOTE 3: 
Industrial sensors can use a wide variety of batteries depending on the use case, but in general they are highly constrained in terms of battery size. 
NOTE 4:  Distance between the gNB and the UE. 
NOTE 5:  The application-level messages in this use case are typically transferred over Ethernet. For small messages, the minimum Ethernet frame size of 64 bytes applies and dictates 
the minimum size of the PDU sent over the air interface.

It applies to both UL and DL unless stated otherwise.
