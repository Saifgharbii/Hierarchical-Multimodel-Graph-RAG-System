        "0":"NOTE 1:\tOne or more retransmissions of network layer packets may take place in order to satisfy the communication service availability requirement.\nNOTE 2:\tUnless otherwise specified, all communication includes 1 wireless link (UE to network node or network node to UE) rather than two wireless links (UE to UE).\nNOTE 3:\tLength x width (x height).\nNOTE 4:\t(void)\nNOTE 5:\tCommunication includes two wireless links (UE to UE).\nNOTE 6:\tThis covers different transfer intervals for different similar use cases with target values of 1 ms, 1 ms to 10 ms, and 10 ms to 50 ms.\nNOTE 7:\tThe transfer interval deviates around its target value by < \u00b125 %.\nNOTE 8:\tThe transfer interval deviates around its target value by < \u00b15 %.\nNOTE 9:\tCommunication may include two wireless links (UE to UE).\nNOTE 10:\tThe first value is the application requirement, the other values are the requirement with multiple transmission of the same information (two or three times, respectively).\nNOTE 11:\tService Area for direct communication between UEs. The group of UEs with direct communication might move throughout the whole factory site (up to several km\u00b2). \nNOTE 12:\tMaximum straight-line distance between UEs. \nNOTE 12a:\tIt applies to both UL and DL unless stated otherwise.\nNOTE 13:\tIt applies to both linear movement and rotation unless stated otherwise. \nNOTE 14:\tThe mobile operation panel is connected wirelessly to the 5G system. If the mobile robot\/production line is also connected wirelessly to the 5G system, the communication includes two wireless links.\nNOTE 15:\tService bit rate for one energy storage station.\nNOTE 16:\tActivity storage nodes\/km2. This value is used for deducing the data volume in an area that features multiple energy storage stations. The data volume can be calculated with the following formula (current service bit rate per storage station) x (activity storage nodes\/km2) + (video service bit rate per storage station) x (activity storage nodes\/km2). \nNOTE 17:\tOne-way delay from 5G IoT device to backend system. The distance between the two is below 40\u00a0km (city range).\nNOTE 18:\tTypical connection density in today\u2019s city environment. With the evolution from centralised meters to socket meters in the home, the connection density is expected to increase 5 to 10 times. \nNOTE 19:\tWhen the distributed terminals are deployed along an overhead line, there are about 54 terminals per square kilometre. \nNOTE 20: When the distributed terminals are deployed in power distribution cabinets, there are about 78 terminals per square kilometre.\nNOTE 21: Service bit rate of the smart metering application between the smart distribution transformer terminal and the energy end equipment. Once there are multiple smart grid applications, the required service bit rate will be higher.\nNOTE 22:\tThe end-to-end latency depends on the applications supported by the smart distribution transformer terminal. The lower the end-to-end latency, the more applications can be supported.\nNOTE 23:\tThe service area is circular with a radius between 100 m and 500 m (0.031 km2 to 0.79 km2).\nNOTE 24:\tDuring the normal working phase of the feeder system, the heartbeat packet is transmitted periodically with a 1 s transfer interval. When a fault occurs, the heartbeat is sent with a 2 ms transfer interval.\nNOTE 25: The maximum allowed delay between two protection relays would be between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [aa]). For some legacy systems, the end-to-end latency is usually set to 15 ms.\nNOTE 26: For a sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms. For 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms."
