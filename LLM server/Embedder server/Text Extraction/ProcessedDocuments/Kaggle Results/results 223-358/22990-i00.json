            "description": "The present document is a 900 series Technical Report (TR) written by 3GPP TSG SA WG1 (SA1). Such a TR is not normative, i.e. cannot be used for implementation directly. It is primarily written by SA1 to summarise the high-level Off-Network communication needs of the railway community and to identify the corresponding requirements.\nRail Context\nFuture rail communication is an important part of the digitalization of rail operations. In addition to network-oriented communication, this also includes that without involving the network. GSM-R already used this and was called Direct Mode to describe the ability of a User Equipment to communicate directly with each other, independent of the network.\nOff-Network is a new terminology for the Rail sector, already introduced within 3GPP MCX specifications. UIC will promote the use of Off-Network to replace Direct Mode. But unfortunately, the terminology has slight differences in the meaning. For example, the Rail sector considers use of Off-Network communications where no network services are available either due to network failure (e.g. coverage, capacity, etc.) or due to lack of coverage (remote area's). In 3GPP MCX specifications, Off-Network communications can be setup even when network services are available.\nIn addition to voice communication, Off-Network communication will also increasingly be used for the exchange of train safety data in the future.\nExamples of use cases which require Direct Mode:\nAutomatic Train Protection (ATP) data communication\nAutomatic Train Operation (ATO) data communication\nCritical real-time video\nVirtual Coupling data communication\nVirtual Coupling data communication is the only use case where Off-Network is the intended mode of operation (also called “default mode”) even if the network is available.\nAll other use cases shall consider Network-Oriented mode as the default mode when the network is available (for the first and following attachments) and shifting to Off-Network when the network is not available.\n",

                            "text_content": "Generally, trackside maintenance occurs during daily train operation. For safety reasons, trackside maintenance staff need to be informed about approaching trains entering the worksite. Thus, the intention of a trackside warning system is to inform trackside staff about the approaching train to keep rail capacity available while working on the tracks.\nThe trackside maintenance warning system consists of a single or multiple train detector entity(ies) (sensors, lookout man or interlocking station information + communication device), and a single or multiple warning entity(ies). The train detector entity is responsible to detect the approaching train and to trigger the alarm to the warning entities (as an option, the alarm should be triggered to a central/control entity also that relays the alarm to all warning entities). The warning entity indicates trackside workers about the approaching train on existing or adjacent tracks in form of visual signal e.g. flashing light and audio signal e.g. tone/horn. In large worksites or areas of high-speed trains, multiple warning entities can be spread out along the worksite to repeat the train approaching indication. In addition, the trackside maintenance staff will receive the train approaching indication on its FRMCS Equipment (i.e. wearable device).\nWhen the train has cleared the warning zone, the indication is withdrawn automatically by the warning system, by the interlocking or manually by an authorised operator located inside or at the edge of the warning zone.\nThe Trackside Maintenance Warning System (TMWS) in Figure 5.2.1-1 is a comprehensive system designed to alert maintenance personnel of potential trackside hazards. The system utilizes a combination of visual and auditory cues to provide real-time information about trackside conditions, such as trackside debris, trackside equipment, and trackside personnel. The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to operate, with a user-friendly interface that allows maintenance personnel to quickly and efficiently identify and address trackside hazards. The system is also designed to be scalable and adaptable, with the ability to be expanded and updated as needed to meet the changing needs of the railway industry.\nFigure 5.2.1-1: Description of the Trackside Maintenance Warning System\nTrain detector entities and warning entities constitute the warning system that requires secured/safe continuous radio transmission of data between the sensors and the warning entities (e.g. keep alive messages for robustness and location information of entities/workers to differentiate between the tracks with a lateral distance accuracy of less than 1 meter). In addition, it encompasses the secured/safe radio transmission of the train approaching indication (i.e. start/stop transmitting the indication to the track workers) among the warning system and the FRMCS Equipment of the trackside staff. Train detection is outside scope of the warning system.\nDue to the fact that such a warning system deployment is temporary and on-network communication services are not always available at the track, the FRMCS System provides necessary off-network communication services for the trackside warning system. Trackside maintenance warning system in off-network mode is well suited for small, short-term construction sites but should also be relevant for large and long-term construction sites.\nThe maximum train speed in the warning zone is 500 kmph.\nNote: no speed limit applies in worksites in some Countries.\nCommunications between train detector entities located at both edges of the warning zone are not supported by the Trackside maintenance warning system.\nAs a deployment option, communication between the approaching train and the trackside warning system should be supported to e.g. avoid train detectors.\nFixed and moving worksites e.g. carrying out inspection work are supported by the Trackside maintenance warning system.\nOne-way (i.e. one train detector entity) and two-way (i.e. two train detector entities) traffic protection are supported by the Trackside maintenance warning system.\nThe minimum configuration of a warning system is:\n-\tOne train detector entity located closed or inside the worksite (i.e. detection by visual detection)\n-\tOne warning entity located inside the worksite\nThe maximum configuration of a warning system is:\n-\tTwo train detector entities located at both edges of the warning zone\n-\tThe maximum number of warning entities is 30, located inside the worksite\n-\tThe maximum number of workers (e.g. wearing warning devices through FRMCS Equipment) located inside the worksite is 50.\nDifferent groups of workers can work at the same time along the worksite.\nWorkers or work group can join/leave the worksite based on their locations.\nThe warning system shall be flexible enough to easily setup.\nEnergy efficiency of the warning system for battery-powered entities is not supported.\nConfiguration and control of the warning system shall be available locally.\nConfiguration and control of the warning system should be available through on-network communication.\nPositioning of the train detectors with accurate distance from the worksite is in the scope of the warning system with distance accuracy of +/- 1 meter.\nThe trackside maintenance warning system communication shall be reliable in tunnels, in bad weather conditions and in unfavourable geographical conditions.\nMultiple and flexible use of spectrum bands shall be supported.\n",

Only one communication from the remote driver to the onboard system is required.\nA remote driver having the capability to control more than one engine should have a mean to prevent simultaneous control over more than one locomotive.\nIf on-network mode is available, the remote driver shall be able to exchange data with the traffic control system to automatically operate the track switches to free the tracks before remotely operating the train.\nIf on-network mode is available, trains have to be geographically tracked by the traffic control system to prevent from traveling past predetermined boundaries (i.e. remote control zones to e.g. avoid other train movements).\nIf on-network mode is available, the system shall alert the traffic control system when a safety case happens to the remote driver (e.g. remote driver down) including the accurate location of the remote driver.\nAs an option, real-time video monitoring of tracks from onboard system in the cab or from trackside to the remote driver should be required simultaneously to the transmission of data for remote control of engines.\nThe remote control of engines is designed to be fail-safe so that if communication is lost the vehicle is brought to a stop automatically.\nDue to the fact that very low latency is required, and on-network communication services are not always available at the depot, the FRMCS System provides necessary off-network communication services for the remote control of engines even if on-network communication services are available.\nThe maximum speed of the train remotely controlled shall be restricted not to exceed 40 kmph.\nThe remote control of engines shall be flexible enough to easily setup.\nConfiguration and control of the remote control of engines shall be available locally.\nIt shall be possible for a remote driver to awaken an onboard entity.\nThe remote control of engines communication shall be reliable in depots, in tunnels, with clear line of sight.\nMultiple and flexible use of spectrum bands shall be supported.\nAs an option, the remote control application should be used to remotely control by maintenance staff other equipment such as overhead cranes in depots, see below:\nFigure 5.3.1-3: Alternative of Remote Control Application\nThe remote control of overhead cranes has the same requirements on communication characteristics as the remote control of engines.\n",

Train integrity consists concretely in monitoring the status of the train’s tail to check that last wagon is regularly advancing in a coherent way in relation to the movement of the remaining train. The event of accidental train separation constitutes a serious danger for the next train, being a possible unexpected obstacle on the line, and therefore it needs to be promptly reported to the rail signalling system.\nThe main difference between train integrity monitoring in on-network mode and off-network mode consists in train integrity criteria that (1) is based on communication liveliness in on-network mode, whereas (2) requires verifying train tail coherent movement respect to front cabin, based on train tail odometry data (i.e. position, speed or acceleration of train tail and front cabin) in off-network mode. In fact, off-network communication between train tail and front cabin could be present also after train splitting with limited distance of separated waggons.\n\n",

UEs may not be dedicated to On-board Train Integrity.\nJames powers on the front cabin before starting to operate the train. The OTI entities establish communications with each other and begin exchanging status (i.e. position, speed or acceleration information, and if supported wagon diagnostic information) via the connected UEs in off-network mode. The train integrity status is “Confirmed” (all wagons connected and operational). The Train Integrity system shall avoid pairing James’ OTI entities with other trains’ OTI entities in proximity.\nTrain Integrity data exchanges are encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.\nTrain Integrity data exchanges are recorded in case something bad happens (e.g. wrong pairing between OTI entities) and somebody wants to review the incident later.\nJames starts running its train to its destination on non-electrical lines where there is no network coverage. The Train Integrity Monitoring procedure restarts every 30 seconds (configurable timer) until the train stops running.\nThe figure depicts a train with its wheels and axles clearly visible, indicating that the train is in good condition and has not experienced any significant damage. The presence of the train's wheels and axles is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of the train, as it ensures that the train can move smoothly and safely. The image also shows the train's headlights and taillights, which are essential for visibility and signaling. Overall, the image provides a clear and detailed view of the train's condition, allowing for a better understanding of its overall condition and safety.\nFigure 5.4.3-1: Train integrity confirmed\nFor some reason, the train tail splits off of James’ train. The Train Integrity system detects the event and the train integrity status becomes “Lost”.\nIn the meantime, James is communicating with its train operating centre to prepare its next mission. The Train Integrity system informs on-board signalling system about train integrity status. The on-board signalling system takes priority on James ongoing communication to inform him thus allowing him to intervene rapidly and appropriately (e.g. reducing the speed and breaking the train in a safe location).\nThe figure depicts a train with its integrity lost, indicating a potential issue with the train's electrical or mechanical systems. This could be due to a malfunction, a defect in the train's components, or a failure in the train's control system. The presence of the train in the image suggests that the issue is of concern to the railway system, as it could potentially lead to accidents or disruptions in the transportation of passengers or goods.\nFigure 5.4.3-2: Train integrity lost\n",

Bob receives confirmation upon successful reception of the message for all shunting members.\nService Flow#1 (shunting movements ordered by human): James, located in the front cabin (indoor) and without direct line-of-sight of the track, pushes a group of wagons (i.e. going backwards), continuously and securely ordered by Bob, located at train tail (outdoor or indoor) as a lookout man. To do so, Bob enables an assured safety link function that periodically send tones or keep alive messages to the shunting members. Bob may shout orders periodically into his Shunting device. Bob’s orders take priority on the periodic assured safety link tones and every team member is able to hear him.\nIf the voice/data can not be exchanged for more than 2 seconds (configurable time), every member of the shunting team is informed, thus allowing them to intervene rapidly and appropriately (e.g. James breaking the train).\nWhen Bob orders James to stop its train, he disables the assured safety link function and invites Dave, a member of another shunting team located on the trackside, to be part of their shunting team to couple James’ train to the rest of the wagons. Shunting team members of both teams are now part of the same shunting team.\nDave, James and Bob are simultaneously talking to each other to couple James’ train safely.\nDave notices that another worker is in the area and, to avoid collision with James’ train shouts a warning into his UE. Dave’s warning takes priority, and member of the shunting team is able to hear him to intervene rapidly and appropriately (e.g. James breaking the train).\nShunting communications are recorded (e.g. shunting members composition) in case something bad happens and somebody wants to review the incident later.\nService Flow#2 (shunting movements self-controlled using video by the driver): James, located in the front cabin (indoor) and without direct line-of-sight of the track, pushes a group of wagons (i.e. going backwards), continuously and securely monitoring the track using video communication with camera connected to a UE located at the train tail.\nIf the video can not be exchanged for more than 2 seconds (configurable time), James is informed, thus allowing him to intervene rapidly and appropriately (e.g. James braking the train).\nShunting video communications are recorded (including metadata e.g. timestamp, originator, receiver, roles) in case something bad happens and somebody wants to review the incident later.\nFigure 5 illustrates various examples of shunting communication signals, highlighting the importance of proper signal routing and management in 5G networks.\nFigure 5.5.3-1: Examples of Shunting communications\n",

In legacy train control systems, trains typically decide its movement by interacting with trackside devices (e.g. track circuits, balise, radio block system) or communicating with a trackside server. If a train can autonomously figure out the positions of the nearby trains and decide its movement authority, the transport capacity of the railway will be enhanced. In the autonomous train control system whose service concept is aligned to the eV2X service, trains share its position by exchanging the information without any centralized server, and each train decides how far it can be authorized to move based on the position information. It is expected that main application area will be mass transportation such as subway.\nThe figure depicts a 7.1-1 autonomous train control scenario, illustrating the various components and their interactions. The train is depicted in a dynamic pose, with the driver's cab visible at the top, while the train's wheels and other components are shown in a more detailed view.

                            "text_content": "One of the important missions that the future railway service should achieve is to increase its transport capacity. A straight-forward solution is to minimize the distance between successive trains so that train interval is reduced. It is difficult to do so in a legacy train control system, because the successive trains need to have distance as much as a safety margin, which should be larger than the full braking distance.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a safety-critical system, specifically focusing on the sharing of acceleration and braking control information to shorten the safety margin. This system is designed to ensure that the vehicle maintains a safe speed and deceleration, reducing the risk of accidents. The figure shows the flow of information between different components, such as the accelerator and brake pedal, and the steering wheel, to ensure that the vehicle's control system can react quickly and effectively to changing conditions. The figure also highlights the importance of communication between the different components, as well as the need for redundancy to ensure the system's reliability. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise representation of the safety-critical system's design and operation.\nFigure 5.8.1-2 Sharing acceleration and braking control information to shorten safety margin\nThis safety margin can be further shortened if the successive trains share control information (acceleration and braking) and apply it to its own train control. As shown in Figure 5.8.1-1, the safety margin can be shortened if the following train (T1) immediately knows that the leading train (T2) starts braking and also triggers braking. This is the fundamental principle and the main purpose of virtual coupling. Figure 5.8.2 shows the basic concept of the virtual coupling scenario. Multiple trains which are in close distance move together as they are physically coupled. As the distance between two trains gets smaller, the control information of a train should be delivered to the other in shorter time.\nThe figure depicts a virtual coupling scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the concept of virtual coupling between base stations (BSs) and users. The diagram shows the various components involved, such as the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Virtual coupling is a technique used to improve the performance of 5G networks by allowing the BSs to share resources with the UE, reducing the need for additional infrastructure. The figure highlights the importance of proper design and implementation of virtual coupling in 5G networks to ensure optimal performance and reliability.\nFigure 5.8.1-2 The concept of virtual coupling scenario\n",

The two trains, which are far enough to allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, are initially connected through the on-network.\n2. As the following train approaches to the leading train, they start exchanging the information about movement control and each train then controls itself while considering the control of the other train. The two trains, which are still far enough to allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, keep the connection through the on-network.\n3. As the following train further approaches to the leading train, the safe braking distance gets shorter and they are required to have a connection of which end-to-end latency is very short for delicate train control. At this moment, they seamlessly switch the connection from the on-network to off-network. Each train can maintain the on-network connection, as an auxiliary connection, as long as it is within the coverage.\n4. As the following train even further approaches the leading train so that the distance between the tail-end of the leading train and the front-end of the following train becomes shorter than the safe braking distance, the off-network connection requires extremely high reliability as well as short end-to-end latency to prevent potential accidents. In this case, two trains can be regarded as if they are physically coupled, communicating via wireless train backbone (WLTB).\n",

James is located in the front cabin (indoor).\nBefore leaving the Harbour area, James has to run its train through many level crossings. In order to run safely the level crossing (LX), James has to detect vehicles in the level crossing area using fixed video camera of this area.\nJames is equipped with an onboard device with display connected to a UE. LX surveillance camera is also connected to a UE. James and the camera are operating their UEs in off-network mode and have selected their role to enable video exchanges. The video communications are encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.\nWhen James approaching the LX, James enables video from LX surveillance camera to detect vehicles. James primarily relies on the remote LX surveillance camera vision to identify obstacles (e.g. vehicles) and to make decision on whether to enter the LX area. When no vehicles are detected, James is allowed to run its train through the LX area. When the train has left the LX area, James disable videos from LX surveillance camera.

Some open points identified as part of the gap analysis of the use cases have been collected and detailed in clause 8 (e.g., communication range, MCX support).\nA further step is necessary to identify limitations, missing requirements and gaps in existing functionalities supported by 3GPP before any potential normative work. This step could be performed by external bodies involved in the definition of Rail Off-Network use cases (e.g., UIC, ETSI TC RT).\nIt is therefore recommended to wait for further gap analysis before finalizing consolidated requirements in this TR and trigger potential subsequent normative work (if deemed necessary).\n\n\n",
