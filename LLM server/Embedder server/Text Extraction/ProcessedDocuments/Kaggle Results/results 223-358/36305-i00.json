            "description": "The present document specifies the stage 2 of the UE Positioning function of E-UTRAN, which provides the mechanisms to support or assist the calculation of the geographical position of a UE. UE position knowledge can be used, for example, in support of Radio Resource Management functions, as well as location-based services for operators, subscribers, and third-party service providers. The purpose of this stage 2 specification is to define the E-UTRAN UE Positioning architecture, functional entities and operations to support positioning methods. This description is confined to the E-UTRAN Access Stratum. It does not define or describe how the results of the UE position calculation can be utilised in the Core Network (e.g., LCS) or in E-UTRAN (e.g., RRM).\nUE Positioning may be considered as a network-provided enabling technology consisting of standardised service capabilities that enable the provision of location applications. The application(s) may be service provider specific. The description of the numerous and varied possible location applications which are enabled by this technology is outside the scope of the present document. However, clarifying examples of how the functionality being described may be used to provide specific location services may be included.\nThis stage 2 specification covers the E-UTRAN positioning methods, state descriptions, and message flows to support UE Positioning.\n",

                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] apply.\nAs used in this document, the suffixes \"-based\" and \"-assisted\" refer respectively to the node that is responsible for making the positioning calculation (and which may also provide measurements) and a node that provides measurements (but which does not make the positioning calculation). Thus, an operation in which measurements are provided by the UE to the E-SMLC to be used in the computation of a position estimate is described as \"UE-assisted\" (and could also be called \"E-SMLC-based\"), while one in which the UE computes its own position is described as \"UE-based\".\nBoth standalone LMU and LMU integrated into an eNB are supported. As used in this document, LMU refers to both cases of a standalone LMU and an LMU integrated into an eNodeB unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.\nPositioning integrity: A measure of the trust in the accuracy of the position-related data and the ability to provide associated alerts.\nProtection Level (PL): A statistical upper-bound of the Positioning Error (PE) that ensures that, the probability per unit of time of the true error being greater than the AL and the PL being less than or equal to the AL, for longer than the TTA, is less than the required TIR, i.e., the PL satisfies the following inequality: \n\tProb per unit of time [((PE>AL) & (PL<=AL)) for longer than TTA] < required TIR\nWhen the PL bounds the positioning error in the horizontal plane or on the vertical axis then it is called Horizontal Protection Level (HPL) or Vertical Protection Level (VPL) respectively.\nA specific equation for the PL is not specified as this is implementation-defined. For the PL to be considered valid, it must simply satisfy the inequality above.\nNOTE:\tthe PL inequality is valid for all values of the AL.\nState Space Representation (SSR): The state space representation provides information on the status of individual GNSS error sources. State parameter values are transmitted to UE. The user corrects his own observations of a single GNSS receiver with SSR corrections computed from these state parameters for his individual position, and performs RTK positioning with corrected observations. This contrasts with Observation Space Representation (OSR) which uses a lump-sum of distance-dependent GNSS errors instead of individual GNSS error sources. For OSR the representation of RTK network corrections in the observation space always uses GNSS observation of an actual reference station, which are then applied by the user to the conventional RTK algorithm.\nTransmission Point (TP): A set of geographically co-located transmit antennas for one cell, part of one cell or one PRS-only TP. Transmission Points can include base station (eNode B) antennas, remote radio heads, a remote antenna of a base station, an antenna of a PRS-only TP, etc. One cell can be formed by one or multiple transmission points. For a homogeneous deployment, each transmission point may correspond to one cell.\nPRS-only TP: A TP which only transmits PRS signals for PRS-based TBS positioning and is not associated with a cell.\nPositioning integrity: A measure of the trust in the accuracy of the position-related data and the ability to provide associated alerts.\n",

                    "text_content": "The stage 1 description of LCS at the service level is provided in TS 22.071 [3]; the stage 2 LCS functional description, including the LCS system architecture and message flows, is provided in TS 23.271 [2].\nPositioning functionality provides a means to determine the geographic position and/or velocity of the UE based on measuring radio signals. The position information may be requested by and reported to a client (e.g., an application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached to the core network. The position information shall be reported in standard formats, such as those for cell-based or geographical co-ordinates, together with the estimated errors (uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if available, the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain the position estimate.\nRestrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the 'position information' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The EPS, including E-UTRAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in LTE and, in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined for a specific LCS client type in relevant national standards. For example, in the US, national standard J-STD-036-B restricts the geographic shape for an emergency services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle and confidence\" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].\nIt shall be possible for the majority of the UEs (active or inactive) within a network to use the LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or signalling capabilities of the E-UTRAN.\nThe uncertainty of the position measurement shall be network-implementation-dependent, at the choice of the network operator. The uncertainty may vary between networks as well as from one area within a network to another. The uncertainty may be hundreds of metres in some areas and only a few metres in others. In the event that a particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].\nThe uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE. Several design options of the E-UTRAN system (e.g., size of cell, adaptive antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing accuracy, eNode B surveys) shall allow the network operator to choose a suitable and cost-effective UE positioning method for their market.\nThere are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the EPS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not exclusively for emergencies.\nThe E-UTRAN is a new radio system design without a pre-existing deployment of \"legacy\" UEs operating according to the radio interface. This freedom from legacy equipment enables the location service feature design to make use of appropriate techniques to provide the most accurate results. The technique must also be a cost-effective total solution, must allow evolution to meet evolving service requirements, and must be able to take advantage of advances in technology over the lifetime of E-UTRAN deployments.\nDesign of the E-UTRAN positioning capability as documented in this specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are either adapted from capabilities already supported for UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. The proportion of the latter is higher than if the UTRAN and GERAN capabilities had been designed to provide forward compatibility to other access types. In contrast to GERAN and UTRAN, the E-UTRAN positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to other access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the amount of additional positioning support needed in the future. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([17], [18]), for which E-UTRAN positioning capabilities are intended to be compatible where appropriate.\nAs a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in E-UTRAN, the following assumptions apply:\n-\tboth TDD and FDD will be supported;\n-\tthe provision of the UE Positioning function in E-UTRAN and EPC is optional through support of the specified method(s) in the eNode B and the E-SMLC;\n-\tUE Positioning is applicable to any target UE, whether or not the UE supports LCS, but with restrictions on the use of certain positioning methods depending on UE capability (as defined within the LPP protocol);\n-\tthe positioning information may be used for internal system operations to improve system performance;\n-\tthe UE Positioning architecture and functions shall include the option to accommodate several techniques of measurement and processing to ensure evolution to follow changing service requirements and to take advantage of advancing technology;\n-\tLMU aspects are left for implementation and are not standardized in this release.\n",

Enhanced Cell ID (E-CID) positioning refers to techniques which use additional UE and/or E-UTRAN radio resource and other measurements to improve the UE location estimate.\nAlthough E-CID positioning may utilise some of the same measurements as the measurement control system in the RRC protocol, the UE generally is not expected to make additional measurements for the sole purpose of positioning; i.e., the positioning procedures do not supply a measurement configuration or measurement control message, and the UE reports the measurements that it has available rather than being required to take additional measurement actions. For NB-IoT, when the UE goes to Idle state to perform positioning measurements, the UE may be required to take additional measurement actions, as specified in clause 7.1.3.\nIn cases with a requirement for close time coupling between UE and eNode B measurements (e.g., TADV type 1 and UE Tx-Rx time difference), the eNode B configures the appropriate RRC measurements and is responsible for maintaining the required coupling between the measurements.The operation of the Enhanced Cell ID method is described in clause 8.3.\n",

The MME then sends a location services request to an E-SMLC. The E-SMLC processes the location services request which may include transferring assistance data to the target UE to assist with UE-based and/or UE-assisted positioning and/or may include positioning of the target UE. For the Uplink method, the E-SMLC processes the location services request which includes transferring configuration data to the selected LMU(s). The E-SMLC then returns the result of the location service back to the MME (e.g., a position estimate for the UE and/or an indication of any assistance data transferred to the UE). In the case of a location service requested by an entity other than the MME (e.g., UE or E-SMLC), the MME returns the location service result to this entity.\nThe SLP is the SUPL entity responsible for positioning over the user plane. Further details of the relationship of the user-plane positioning entities to the E-UTRAN control-plane positioning architecture are described in Annex B.\nAn eNodeB may control several TPs, such as remote radio heads, or PRS-only TPs for support of PRS-based TBS.\nThe figure depicts the positioning architecture for the use of E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) in a 5G network. It illustrates the positioning of the base station (gNB) and user equipment (UE) to ensure optimal signal coverage and interference mitigation.

The overall sequence of events applicable to the UE, E-UTRAN and E-SMLC for any location service is shown in Figure 5.1-1.\nNote that when the MME receives Location Service Request in case of the UE is in ECM-IDLE state, the MME performs a network triggered service request as defined in TS 23.401 [19] in order to establish a signalling connection with the UE and assign a specific eNodeB. The UE is assumed to be in connected mode before the beginning of the flow shown in the Figure 5.1-1; that is, any signalling that might be required to bring the UE to connected mode prior to step 1a is not shown. The signaling connection may, however, be later released (e.g. by the eNode B as a result of signaling and data inactivity) while positioning is still ongoing.\nThe figure depicts the location service support by E-UTRAN, illustrating the various components and their roles in the network. The figure includes the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, highlighting the importance of these elements in ensuring reliable location services. The figure also shows the use of E-UTRAN technology, which is designed to provide location services over a wide area, and the use of redundant paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 5.1-1: Location Service Support by E-UTRAN\n1a.\tEither: the UE requests some location service (e.g. positioning or delivery of assistance data) to the serving MME at the NAS level.\n1b.\tOr: some entity in the EPC (e.g. GMLC) requests some location service (e.g. positioning) for a target UE to the serving MME .\n1c.\tOr: the serving MME for a target UE determines the need for some location service (e.g. to locate the UE for an emergency call).\n2.\tThe MME transfers the location service request to an E-SMLC.\n3a.\tThe E-SMLC instigates location procedures with the serving eNode B for the UE – e.g. to obtain positioning measurements or assistance data.\n3b.\tIn addition to step 3a or instead of step 3a, for downlink positioning the E-SMLC instigates location procedures with the UE – e.g. to obtain a location estimate or positioning measurements or to transfer location assistance data to the UE.\n3c.\tFor uplink positioning (e.g., UTDOA), in addition to performing step 3a, the E-SMLC instigates location procedures with multiple LMUs for the target UE – e.g. to obtain positioning measurements.\n4.\tThe E-SMLC provides a location service response to the MME and includes any needed results – e.g. success or failure indication and, if requested and obtained, a location estimate for the UE.\n5a.\tIf step 1a was performed, the MME returns a location service response to the UE and includes any needed results – e.g. a location estimate for the UE.\n5b.\tIf step 1b was performed, the MME returns a location service response to the EPC entity in step 1b and includes any needed results – e.g. a location estimate for the UE.\n5c.\tIf step 1c occurred, the MME uses the location service response received in step 4 to assist the service that triggered this in step 1c (e.g. may provide a location estimate associated with an emergency call to a GMLC).\nLocation procedures applicable to E-UTRAN occur in steps 3a, 3b and 3c in Figure 5.1-2 and are defined in greater detail in this specification. Steps 1a and 5a are also applicable to E-UTRAN support because of a capability to tunnel signalling applicable to steps 3a and 3b. Other steps in Figure 5.1-2 are applicable only to the EPC and are described in greater detail and in TS 23.271 [2].\nSteps 3a and 3b can involve the use of different position methods to obtain location related measurements for a target UE and from these compute a location estimate and possibly additional information like velocity. Positioning methods supported in this release are summarized in clause 4.3 and described in detail in clause 8.\nThe case that the eNode B functions as an LCS client is not supported in this version of the specification.\n",

                            "text_content": "The LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) is terminated between a target device (the UE in the control-plane case or SET in the user-plane case) and a positioning server (the E-SMLC in the control-plane case or SLP in the user-plane case). It may use either the control- or user-plane protocols as underlying transport. In this specification, only control plane use of LPP is defined. User plane support of LPP is defined in [17] and [18].\nLPP is a point to point positioning protocol with capabilities similar to those in UMTS RRC (TS 25.331 [15]) and GERAN RRLP (TS 44.031 [16]). Whereas RRLP supports positioning of a target MS accessing GERAN and RRC supports positioning of a target UE accessing UTRAN, LPP supports positioning and location related services (e.g. transfer of assistance data) for a target UE accessing E-UTRAN. To avoid creating new positioning protocols for future access types developed by 3GPP, and to enable positioning measurements for terrestrial access types other than E-UTRAN, LPP is in principle forward-compatible with other access types, even though restricted to E-UTRAN access in this specification.\nLPP further supports the OMA user plane location solution SUPL 2.0, as defined in the OMA SUPL 2.0 standards ([17], [18]), and is intended to be compatible with the successor protocols of SUPL 2.0 as well.\nLPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate network interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., S1-AP over the S1-MME interface, NAS/RRC over the Uu interface). The LPP protocol is intended to enable positioning for LTE using a multiplicity of different position methods, while isolating the details of any particular positioning method and the specifics of the underlying transport from one another.\nThe protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device and a server, with each transaction taking place as an independent procedure. More than one such procedure may be in progress at any given moment. An LPP procedure may involve a request/response pairing of messages or one or more \"unsolicited\" messages. Each procedure has a single objective (e.g., transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP related capabilities, or positioning of a target device according to some QoS and use of one or more positioning methods). Multiple procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can be used to achieve more complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target device in association with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP related capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one positioning attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate is being obtained with higher delay).\nAn LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target device, the details of its relation with transactions are described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 36.355 [25].\nA single LPP transaction may be realised as multiple procedures; e.g., a single transaction for provision of assistance data might comprise several Provide Assistance Data messages, with each such message constituting a separate procedure (since there is no \"multiple unsolicited messages\" procedure type).\nFor the 3GPP EPS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.271 [2], the UE is the target device and the E-SMLC is the server. For SUPL 2.0 support, the SUPL Enabled Terminal (SET) is the target device and the SUPL Location Platform (SLP) is the server. The protocol does not preclude the possibility of future developments in control plane and user plane solutions (e.g., possible successors of SUPL 2.0, as well as possible future 3GPP control plane solutions).\nAll LPP operations and procedures are defined with respect to the target and server, and thus the LPP operations and procedures defined here with respect to a UE and an E-SMLC can also be viewed in this more generic context by substituting any target for the UE and any server for the E-SMLC.\nLPP further supports multiple positioning methods as defined in clause 4.3.\nLPP supports hybrid positioning, in which two or more position methods are used concurrently to provide measurements and/or a location estimate or estimates to the server. LPP is forward compatible with the later addition of other position methods in later releases (e.g., position methods associated with other types of terrestrial access).\nLPP also supports RRC broadcast of location assistance data information using data types defined in relation to LPP which are embedded in positioning SIBs. This enables an E-SMLC and a UE to support broadcast location assistance data using the same data structures which are used for point to point location.\nThe operations controlled through LPP are described further in clause 7.1.\n",

These capabilities are defined within the LPP protocol and transferred between the target and the server using LPP transport.\nThe exchange of capabilities between a target and a server may be initiated by a request or sent as \"unsolicited\" information. If a request is used, the server sends an LPP Request Capabilities message to the target device with a request for capability information. The target sends an LPP Provide Capabilities message.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the LPP (Layer 1-Layer 2) capability transfer procedure, illustrating the steps involved in transferring data between the two layers of a network.

The figure includes a flowchart with arrows indicating the sequence of actions, such as data transmission, error detection, and retransmission. The figure is used to demonstrate the process of determining the path to a destination in a network, which is crucial for ensuring reliable data delivery.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-2: LPP Assistance Data Delivery procedure\nThis procedure is unidirectional; assistance data are always delivered from the server to the target.\nThe term \"location information\" applies both to an actual position estimate and to values used in computing position (e.g., radio measurements or positioning measurements). It is delivered either in response to a request or unsolicited.\nThe figure depicts a location information transfer procedure for LPP (Location Privacy Protocol) in a wireless network. It illustrates the steps involved in transmitting location information, including the use of LPP, the location of the transmitter, and the receiver's location.

It illustrates the steps involved in delivering location information to the UE (User Equipment) and the network infrastructure. The figure includes various components such as the LPP server, the LPP client, and the network infrastructure, all of which are crucial for the successful delivery of location information. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing management in ensuring efficient and reliable location information delivery.\nFigure 7.1.2.3-2: LPP Location Information Delivery procedure\nMultiple LPP transactions may be in progress simultaneously between the same target and server nodes, to improve flexibility and efficiency. However, no more than one LPP procedure between a particular pair of target and server nodes to obtain location information shall be in progress at any time for the same position method.\nIn this example, the objective is to request location measurements from the target, and the server does not provide assistance data in advance, leaving the target to request any needed assistance data. A message flow is shown in Figure 7.1.2.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a complex network setup with multiple LPP procedures, illustrating the various steps involved in the process. The diagram includes LPP procedures such as LPP-1, LPP-2, and LPP-3, each with their respective steps and outputs. The figure also includes a flowchart to guide the process, with arrows indicating the flow of data and the sequence of steps. The use of different colors for each procedure helps to distinguish between them, making it easier to understand the process. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the LPP procedures and their interconnections, making it a valuable tool for understanding the network setup.\nFigure 7.1.2.4-1: Example of multiple LPP procedures\n1.\tThe server sends a request to the target for positioning measurements.\n2.\tThe target sends a request for particular assistance data.\n3.\tThe server returns the assistance data requested in step 2.\n4.\tThe target obtains and returns the location information (e.g., positioning method measurements) requested in step 1.\nLPP procedures are not required to occur in any fixed order, in order to provide greater flexibility in positioning. Thus, a UE may request assistance data at any time in order to comply with a previous request for location measurements from the E-SMLC; an E-SMLC may instigate more than one request for location information (e.g., measurements or a location estimate) in case location results from a previous request were not adequate for the requested QoS; and the target device may transfer capability information to the server at any time if not already performed.\nDespite the flexibility allowed by LPP, it is expected that procedures will normally occur in the following order:\n1.\tCapability Transfer;\n2.\tAssistance Data Transfer;\n3.\tLocation Information Transfer (measurements and/or location estimate).\nSpecific examples for each positioning method are shown in clause 8.\nThe procedure is used to notify the sending endpoint by the receiving endpoint that the receiving LPP message is erroneous or unexpected. This procedure is bidirectional at the LPP level; either the target or the server may take the role of either endpoint in Figure 7.1.2.6-1.\nThe figure depicts a detailed error handling system in a telecommunication network, illustrating various error conditions and their corresponding responses. The system includes a set of error codes and their corresponding error messages, as well as a flowchart to guide the user through the process of error detection and resolution. This system is crucial for maintaining the reliability and functionality of the network, ensuring that users can continue to communicate despite any technical issues.\nFigure 7.1.2.6-1: Error handling\n1.\tThe target or server (indicated as \"Target/Server\" in Figure 7.1.2.6-1) sends a LPP message to the other endpoint (indicated as \"Server/Target\").\n2.\tIf the server or target (\"Server/Target\") detects that the receiving LPP message is erroneous or unexpected, the server or target transfers error indication information to the other endpoint (\"Target/Server\").\nThe procedure is used to notify the other endpoint by one endpoint to abort an ongoing procedure between the two endpoints. This procedure is bidirectional at the LPP level; either the target or the server may take the role of either endpoint in Figure 7.1.2.7-1.\nThe figure depicts a network diagram with various components, including a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, with key components such as the base station, user equipment, and scatterers. The figure highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and it shows the fiber-optic backbone architecture with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 7.1.2.7-1: Abort\n1.\tA LPP procedure is ongoing between target and server.\n2.\tIf the server or target (\"Server/Target\") determines that the procedure must be aborted, and then the server or target sends an LPP Abort message to the other endpoint (\"Target/Server\") carrying the transaction ID for the procedure.\n",

Augmentation systems, such as SBAS, are navigation satellite systems that provide regional coverage to augment the navigation systems with global coverage.\nBy definition, GNSS refers to satellite constellations that achieve global coverage, however, in 3GPP specifications the term GNSS is used to encompass global, regional, and augmentation satellite systems. The following GNSSs are supported in this version of the specification:\n-\tGPS and its modernization [6], [7], [8]; (global coverage)\n-\tGalileo [9]; (global coverage)\n-\tGLONASS [10]; (global coverage)\n-\tSatellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), including WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, and GAGAN [12]; (regional coverage)\n-\tQuasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) [11]; (regional coverage)\n-\tBeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [28], [34], [37], [38]; (global coverage)\n-\tNAVigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) [35]. (regional coverage)\nEach global GNSS can be used individually or in combination with others, including regional navigation systems and augmentation systems. When used in combination, the effective number of navigation satellite signals would be increased:\n-\textra satellites can improve availability (of satellites at a particular location) and results in an improved ability to work in areas where satellite signals can be obscured, such as in urban canyons;\n-\textra satellites and signals can improve reliability, i.e., with extra measurements the data redundancy is increased, which helps identify any measurement outlier problems;\n-\textra satellites and signals can improve accuracy due to improved measurement geometry and improved ranging signals from modernized satellites.\nWhen GNSS is designed to inter-work with the E-UTRAN, the network assists the UE GNSS receiver to improve the performance in several respects. These performance improvements will:\n-\treduce the UE GNSS start-up and acquisition times; the search window can be limited and the measurements speed up significantly;\n-\tincrease the UE GNSS sensitivity; positioning assistance messages are obtained via E-UTRAN so the UE GNSS receiver can operate also in low SNR situations when it is unable to demodulate GNSS satellite signals;\n-\tallow the UE to consume less handset power than with stand-alone GNSS; this is due to rapid start-up times as the GNSS receiver can be in idle mode when it is not needed;\n-\tallow the UE to compute its position with a better accuracy; RTK corrections (for N-RTK) and GNSS physical models (for SSR/PPP) are obtained via E-UTRAN so the UE can use these assistance data, together with its own measurements, i.e., code and carrier phase measurements, to enable computation of a position with a high accuracy;\n-\tallow the UE to determine and report the integrity results of the calculated location; the UE can use the integrity requirements and assistance data obtained via E-UTRAN, together with its own measurements, to determine the integrity results of the calculated location.\nThe network-assisted GNSS methods rely on signalling between UE GNSS receivers (possibly with reduced complexity) and a continuously operating GNSS reference receiver network, which has clear sky visibility of the same GNSS constellation as the assisted UEs. Two assisted modes are supported:\n-\tUE-Assisted: The UE performs GNSS measurements (pseudo-ranges, pseudo Doppler, carrier phase ranges, etc.) and sends these measurements to the E-SMLC where the position calculation takes place, possibly using additional measurements from other (non GNSS) sources;\n-\tUE-Based: The UE performs GNSS measurements and calculates its own position location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non GNSS) sources and assistance data from the E-SMLC.\nThe assistance data content may vary depending on whether the UE operates in UE-Assisted or UE-Based mode.\nThe assistance data signalled to the UE can be broadly classified into:\n-\tdata assisting the measurements: e.g. reference time, visible satellite list, satellite signal Doppler, code phase, Doppler and code phase search windows;\n-\tdata providing means for position calculation: e.g. reference time, reference position, satellite ephemeris, code and carrier phase measurements from a GNSS reference receiver or network of receivers;\n-\tdata increasing the position accuracy: e.g. satellite code biases, satellite orbit corrections, satellite clock corrections, atmospheric models. RTK residuals, gradients;\n-\tdata facilitating the integrity results determination of the calculated location.\nA UE with GNSS measurement capability may also operate in an autonomous (standalone) mode. In autonomous mode the UE determines its position based on signals received from GNSS without assistance from the network.\n",

IRallocation may be chosen freely by the client based on the desired Bound, therefore the network should ensure that Equation 8.1.1a-1 holds for all possible choices of IRallocation. The Residual Risk and IRallocation components may be mapped to fault and fault-free cases respectively, but the implementation is free to choose any other decomposition of the integrity risk probability into these two components.\nThe validity time of the integrity bounds is set as equal to twice the SSR Update Interval for the given SSR Assistance Data message, i.e. the time period between the SSR Epoch Time and the SSR Epoch Time plus twice the SSR Update Interval in the GPS time scale.\nEquation 8.1.1a-1 holds for all assistance data that has been issued that is still within its validity period. If this condition cannot be met then the corresponding DNU flag must be set.\nEquation 8.1.1a-1 holds at any epochs for which Assistance Data is provided. Providing Assistance Data without the Integrity Service Alert IE or Real Time Integrity IEs is interpreted as a DNU=FALSE condition. For any bound that is still valid (within its validity time), the network ensures that the Integrity Service Alert and/or Real Time Integrity IEs are also included in the provided Assistance Data if needed to satisfy the condition in Equation 8.1.1a-1. It is up to the implementation how to handle epochs for which integrity results are desired but there are no DNU flag(s) available, e.g. the Time To Alert (TTA) may be set such that there is a \"grace period\" to receive the next set of DNU flags.\nOnly those satellites for which the GNSS integrity assistance data are provided are monitored by the network and can be used for integrity related applications.\nWhere:\nTime-to-Alert (TTA): The maximum allowable elapsed time from when the Error exceeds the Bound until a DNU flag must be issued.\nError: Error is the difference between the true value of a GNSS parameter (e.g. ionosphere, troposphere etc.), and its value as estimated and provided in the corresponding assistance data as per Table 8.1.2.1b-1\nBound: Integrity Bounds provide the statistical distribution of the residual errors associated with the GNSS positioning corrections (e.g. RTK, SSR etc). Integrity bounds are used to statistically bound the residual errors after the positioning corrections have been applied. The bound is computed according to the Bound formula defined in Equation 8.1.1a-2. The bound formula describes a bounding model including a mean and standard deviation (e.g. paired over-bounding Gaussian). The bound may be scaled by multiplying the standard deviation by a K factor corresponding to an IRallocation, for any desired IRallocation within the permitted range.\nBound for a particular error is computed according to the following formula:\nBound = mean + K * stdDev\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Equation 8.1.1a-2)\nK = normInv(IRallocation / 2)\nirMinimum <= IRallocation <= irMaximum\nwhere:\tmean: mean value for this specific error, as per Table 8.1.2.1b-1\nstdDev: standard deviation for this specific error, as per Table 8.1.2.1b-1\n\nDNU: The DNU flag(s) corresponding to a particular error as per Table 8.1.2.1b-1. Where multiple DNU flags are specified, the DNU condition in Equation 8.1.1a-1 is present when any of the flags are true (logical OR of the flags).\nResidual Risk: The residual risk is the component of the integrity risk provided in the assistance data as per Table 8.1.2.1b-1. This may correspond to the fault case risk but the implementation is permitted to allocate this component in any way that satisfies Equation 8.1.1a-1.\nThe Residual Risk is the Probability of Onset which is defined per unit of time and represents the probability that the feared event begins. Each Residual Risk is accompanied by a Mean Duration which represents the expected mean duration of the corresponding feared event and is used to convert the Probability of Onset to a probability that the feared event is present at any given time, i.e.\nP(Feared Event is Present) = Mean Duration * Probability of Onset of Feared Event\t\t(Equation 8.1.1a-3)\nirMinimum, irMaximum: Minimum and maximum allowable values of IRallocation that may be chosen by the client. Provided as service parameters from the Network according to Integrity Service Parameters.\nCorrelation Times: The minimum time interval beyond which two sets of GNSS assistance data parameters for a given error can be considered to be independent from one another.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause defines the information (e.g., assistance data, measurement data) that may be transferred between E-UTRAN elements.\nTable 8.1.2.1-1 lists assistance data for both UE-assisted and UE-based modes that may be sent from the E-SMLC to the UE.\nNOTE:\tThe provision of these assistance data elements and the usage of these elements by the UE depend on the E-UTRAN and UE capabilities, respectively.\nTable 8.1.2.1-1: Information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to UE\n\nReference Time assistance provides the GNSS receiver with coarse or fine GNSS time information. The specific GNSS system times (e.g., GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BDS system time) shall be indicated with a GNSS ID.\nIn case of coarse time assistance only, the Reference Time provides an estimate of the current GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID). The E-SMLC should achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this time including allowing for the transmission delay between E-SMLC and UE.\nIn case of fine time assistance, the Reference Time provides the relation between GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID) and E-UTRAN air-interface timing.\nReference Location assistance provides the GNSS receiver with an a priori estimate of its location (e.g., obtained via Cell-ID, downlink positioning, etc.) together with its uncertainty.\nThe geodetic reference frame shall be WGS-84, as specified in TS 23.032 [4].\nIonospheric Model assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to model the propagation delay of the GNSS signals through the ionosphere. Ionospheric Model parameters as specified by GPS [6], Galileo [9], QZSS [11], BDS [28], [34], [37], [38] and NavIC [35] may be provided.\nEarth Orientation Parameters (EOP) assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters needed to construct the ECEF-to-ECI coordinate transformation as specified by GPS [6].\nGNSS-GNSS Time Offsets assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to correlate GNSS time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS-1 ID) of one GNSS with other GNSS time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS-2 ID). GNSS-GNSS Time Offsets parameters as specified by GPS [6], Galileo [9], GLONASS [10], QZSS [11], BDS [28], [34], [37], [38] and NavIC [35] may be provided.\nDifferential GNSS Corrections assistance provides the GNSS receiver with pseudo-range and pseudo-range-rate corrections to reduce biases in GNSS receiver measurements as specified in [13]. The specific GNSS for which the corrections are valid is indicated by a GNSS-ID.\nEphemeris and Clock Models assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to calculate the GNSS satellite position and clock offsets. The various GNSSs use different model parameters and formats, and all parameter formats as defined by the individual GNSSs are supported by the signalling.\nReal-Time Integrity assistance provides the GNSS receiver with information about the health status of a GNSS constellation (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID).\nFor integrity purposes (as per Clause 8.1.1a), a GNSS satellite and signal combination should be considered as being marked \"Do Not Use\" (DNU) if the satellite ID and signal are present in the list of unhealthy (bad) signals.\nNOTE:\tThe absence of the Real Time Integrity assistance from any Provide Assistance Data message is interpreted as DNU=FALSE for all satellites and signals that are monitored for integrity.\nData Bit Assistance provides the GNSS receiver with information about data bits or symbols transmitted by a GNSS satellite at a certain time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID). This information may be used by the UE for sensitivity assistance (data wipe-off) and time recovery.\nAcquisition Assistance provides the GNSS receiver with information about visible satellites, reference time, expected code-phase, expected Doppler, search windows (i.e., code and Doppler uncertainty) and other information of the GNSS signals (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID) to enable a fast acquisition of the GNSS signals.\nAlmanac assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to calculate the coarse (long-term) GNSS satellite position and clock offsets. The various GNSSs use different model parameters and formats, and all parameter formats as defined by the individual GNSSs are supported by the signalling.\nUTC Models assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters needed to relate GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID) to Universal Coordinated Time. The various GNSSs use different model parameters and formats, and all parameter formats as defined by the individual GNSSs are supported by the signalling.\nRTK Reference Station Information provides the GNSS receiver with the Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates of the Reference Station´s installed antenna´s ARP, and the height of the ARP above the survey monument. Additionally, this assistance data provides information about the antenna type installed at the reference site.\nNOTE:\tWith the MAC N-RTK technique this assistance data is used to provide information regarding the Master Reference Station (see clause 8.1.2.1a).\nRTK Auxiliary Station Data provides the GNSS receiver with the location for all Auxiliary Reference Stations (see clause 8.1.2.1a) within the assistance data. These values are expressed as relative geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and height) with respect to a Master Reference Station (see subcaluse 8.1.2.1a) and based on the GRS80 ellipsoid. This type of assistance data is relevant only with the MAC N-RTK technique [33].\nRTK Observations provides the GNSS receiver with all primary observables (pseudo-range, phase-range, phase-range rate (Doppler), and carrier-to-noise ratio) generated at the Reference Station for each GNSS signal. The signal generation from the reference station is in compliance with [33]: as an example, the phase measurements of different signals in the same band must be phased aligned. More examples can be found in [33].\nThe pseudo-range is the distance between the satellite and GNSS receiver antennas, expressed in metres, equivalent to the difference of the time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the GNSS receiver) and the time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the satellite) of a distinct satellite signal.\nThe phase-range measurement is a measurement of the range between a satellite and receiver expressed in units of cycles of the carrier frequency. This measurement is more precise than the pseudo-range (of the order of millimetres), but it is ambiguous by an unknown integer number of wavelengths.\nThe phase-range rate is the rate at which the phase-range between a satellite and a GNSS receiver changes over a particular period of time.\nThe carrier-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the received modulated carrier signal power to the noise power after the GNSS receiver filters.\nNOTE:\tWith the MAC N-RTK technique this assistance data is used to provide raw observables recorded at the Master Reference Station (see clause 8.1.2.1a).\nRTK Common Observation Information provides the GNSS receiver with common information applicable to any GNSS, e.g. clock steering indicator. This assistance data is always used together GNSS RTK Observations (see clause 8.1.2.1.15).\nRTK Bias Information provides the GNSS receiver with information which is intended to compensate for the first-order inter-frequency phase-range biases introduced by the reference receiver code-phase biases. This information is applicable only for GLONASS FDMA signals. In the case that the MAC Network RTK method is used, GLONASS RTK Bias Information defines the code-phase biases related to the Master Reference Station [33].\nRTK MAC Correction Differences provides the GNSS receiver with information about ionospheric (dispersive) and geometric (non-dispersive) corrections generated between a Master Reference Station and its Auxiliary Reference Stations [33].\nRTK Residuals provides the GNSS receiver with network error models generated for the interpolated corrections disseminated in Network RTK techniques. With sufficient redundancy in the RTK network, the location server process can provide an estimate for residual interpolation errors. Such quality estimates may be used by the target UE to optimize the performance of RTK solutions. The values may be considered by the target UE as a priori estimates only, with sufficient tracking data available the target UE might be able to judge residual geometric and ionospheric errors itself. According to [33], RTK Residual error information should be transmitted every 10-60 seconds.\nRTK FKP Gradients provides the GNSS receiver with horizontal gradients for the geometric (troposphere and satellite orbits) and ionospheric signal components in the observation space. According to [33], RTK FKP gradient information should be typically transmitted every 10-60 seconds.\nSSR Orbit Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with parameters for orbit corrections in radial, along – track and cross – track components. These orbit corrections are used to compute a satellite position correction, to be combined with satellite position calculated from broadcast ephemeris (see clause 8.1.2.1.7).\nNOTE 1:\tThe orbit corrections define an offset between the broadcast ephemeris orbit and a satellite antenna reference point (ARP) to which the other corrections refer. The exact definition of the reference point along the satellite antenna is implementation-defined by the Network and use of all corrections together shall yield a consistent solution.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE should not apply any additional corrections for the Satellite Antenna Phase Center (APC) such as Phase Center Offset (PCO) or Phase Center Variation (PCV), except when provided by the Network in which case the UE may optionally apply the additional PCV residuals contained in the SSR Satellite PCV Residuals correction. The Network may form the SSR corrections (e.g. SSR Phase Bias) to minimise the magnitude of the SSR Satellite PCV Residuals correction, i.e. for Network implementations that do not provide this correction or to minimise the impact on the UEs that do not consume this correction.\nFor integrity purposes, SSR Orbit Corrections also provides the correlation time for orbit error and orbit error rate, and the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Orbit Error and its associated error rate. The SSR Orbit Corrections also includes the satellite and constellation residual risks. These residual risks are the aggregate residual risk for the satellite or constellation Signal in Space including Orbit, Clock, Bias and all other satellite or constellation feared events, but excluding atmospheric effects.\nWhen applying the integrity bounds as per 8.1.1a, the mean and stdDev must be calculated by projecting the Orbit error mean and variance along the line-of-sight vector between the satellite and the user, according to the following formula:\nstdDevorbit =\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Equation 8.1.2.1.21-1)\nmeanorbit =\n\nwhere:\tI: 3-D line of sight vector from the user to the satellite in the WGS-84 ECEF coordinate frame.\nR: the rotation matrix from satellite along-track (AT), cross-track (CT) and radial (RA) coordinates into the WGS-84 ECEF coordinate frame. RT denotes the transposed matrix.\nv: the 3-D Orbit error variance vector expressed in satellite along-track, cross-track and radial coordinates.\n: the Mean Orbit Error vector expressed in satellite along-track, cross-track and radial coordinates.\n\nThe vector v is expressed in the SSR Orbit Corrections as the three elements in the Variance Orbit Residual Error Vector.\nSSR Clock Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to compute the GNSS satellite clock correction applied to the broadcast satellite clock (see clause 8.1.2.1.7). A polynomial of order 2 describes the clock differences for a certain time period: clock offset, drift, and drift rate.\nFor integrity purposes, SSR Clock Corrections also provides the correlation time for clock error and clock error rate, and the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Clock Error and its associated error rate.\nSSR Code Bias provides the GNSS receiver with the Code Biases that must be added to the pseudo range measurements of the corresponding code signal to get corrected pseudo ranges. SSR Code Bias contains absolute values, but also enables the alternative use of Differential Code Biases by setting one of the biases to zero. A UE can consistently use signals for which a code bias is transmitted. It is not reliable for a UE to use a signal without retrieving a corresponding code bias from the assistance data message. For integrity purposes, SSR Code Bias also provides the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Code Bias Error and its associated error rate.\nSSR Phase Bias provides the GNSS receiver with the GNSS signal phase bias that are added to the carrier phase measurements of the corresponding signal to get corrected phase ranges. An indicator used to count events when phase bias is discontinuous is provided. An optional indicator is also provided to indicate whether fixed, widelane fixed or float PPP-RTK positioning modes are supported on a per signal basis.\nNOTE 1:\tOn the UE side, phase bias corrections of appropriate type are needed to restore the integer nature of the phase ambiguities in PPP-RTK. Their absence will affect the quality of the positioning solution and prevent a fast convergence time.\nNOTE 2:\tPPP-RTK Fixed position mode corresponds to the UE fixing the carrier phase ambiguity to an integer value. The PPP-RTK Widelane Fixed positioning mode corresponds to forming the widelane combination of carrier phase measurements and fixing the resulting ambiguity as an integer value. In PPP-RTK Float positioning mode the carrier phase ambiguity is not treated as an integer value.\nNOTE 3:\tThe SSR Phase Bias values must be consistent with a satellite yaw angle of zero as per [36].\nFor integrity purposes, SSR Phase Bias also provides the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Phase Bias Error and its associated error rate.\nSSR STEC Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with the parameters to compute the ionosphere slant delay correction based on a variable order polynomial on a per satellite basis and applied to the code and phase measurements.\nFor integrity purposes, SSR STEC Corrections also provides the ionosphere residual risk parameters, correlation time for ionosphere range error and range error rate, and the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Ionospheric Error and its associated error rate.\nSSR Gridded Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with STEC residuals and Troposphere delays at a series of correction points and expressed as hydrostatic and wet vertical delays.\nNOTE:\tThe final ionosphere slant delay (STEC) consists of the polynomial part provided in SSR STEC Correction and the residual part provided in SSR Gridded Corrections.\nFor integrity purposes, SSR Gridded Corrections also provides the troposphere residual risk parameters, correlation time for troposphere range error and range error rate, and the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Tropospheric Error and associated its error rate in the Vertical Hydro Static Delay and Vertical Wet Delay components.\nSSR URA provides the receiver with information about the estimated accuracy of the corrections for each satellite.\nThe SSR Correction Points provides a list of correction point coordinates or an array of correction points (\"grid\") for which the SSR Gridded Corrections are valid.\nIntegrity Service Parameters provide the range of Integrity Risk (IR) for which the associated GNSS integrity assistance data is considered to be valid.\nIntegrity Service Alerts provide information on whether the service can be used for integrity. A Do Not Use (DNU) flag indicates that the corresponding assistance data is not suitable for the purpose of computing integrity. If an Integrity Service Alert is issued and the DNU flag is false, then the corresponding assistance data may be used for the purpose of computing integrity. The DNU flags are defined to be applicable to the specified epoch time only.\nSSR IOD Update is used to link assistance data elements based on their Issue of Data (IOD) values, especially for elements which are infrequently updated. The elements with a matching IOD are linked and valid while the SSR IOD Update element is valid, i.e. during the SSR IOD Update and SSR Update Interval and with respect to the IOD SSR.\nNOTE:\tIt is up to the network to ensure that the Update Interval of the SSR IOD Update and the other SSR assistance data elements are configured so as to prevent inconsistent data being used together, i.e. that when the IOD values within the SSR IOD Update change, it does not cause an inconsistency with existing data that is still within its Update Interval, or the change occurs on a boundary where the other assistance data are expiring.\nSSR Satellite Phase Center Variation (PCV) Residuals provide only the nadir angle dependent variations of the satellite APC which can be combined with SSR Orbit Correction and SSR Phase Bias to determine the location of the effective center of the satellite antenna. SSR Satellite PCV Residuals may include residual PCO errors that have not been corrected in the SSR Orbit Correction and SSR Phase Bias.\nThis clause provides recommendations for the different high-accuracy GNSS service levels: RTK, N-RTK, PPP and PPP-RTK.\nThe high-accuracy GNSS methods can be classified as:\n-\tSingle base RTK service: RTK is a technique that uses carrier-based ranging measurements i.e., phase-range to improve the positioning accuracy in a differential approach. The basic concept is to reduce and remove errors common to a Reference Station, with known position, and UE pair. When only pseudo ranges (code-based measurements) are used to compute the UE location, this method is known as DGNSS (Differential GNSS).\nTable 8.1.2.1a-1: Single base RTK service: Specific information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to the UE\n\n-\tNon-Physical Reference Station Network RTK service: In this approach the target UE receives synthetic observations from a fictitious Reference Station. The Network RTK software at the location server is performing the error estimation and creates a virtual Reference Station close to the initial location of the target device (provided a priori to the location server). The target UE interprets and uses the data just as if it had come from a single, real Reference Station. Additionally, the target UE can also receive network information such as RTK Network Residuals (see clause 8.1.2.1.19) or even FKP gradients (see clause 8.1.2.1.20).\nTable 8.1.2.1a-2: Non-Physical Reference Station Network RTK service: Specific information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to the UE\n\n-\tMAC Network RTK service: In MAC network RTK, a group of Reference Stations are used and one of them is chosen as a Master station. The other stations are then called Auxiliary stations. In this service, the location server sends full raw observations and coordinate information for a single Reference Station, the Master Station. For all Auxiliary stations in the network (or a suitable subset of stations) the information is provided to the UE in a highly compact form: their reduced ambiguity-levelled observations, coordinate differences (to the Master Station observations and coordinates), and network residuals. Two Reference Stations are said to be on a common ambiguity level if the integer ambiguities for each phase range (satellite-receiver pair) have been removed (or adjusted) so that the integer ambiguities cancel when double-differences (involving two receivers and two satellites) are formed during processing. The maintenance of a common ambiguity level at a specific set of stations rather than across the whole GNSS network will lead to a grouping in network clusters or subnetworks of all ambiguity-levelled Reference Stations. If one network has only one subnetwork, this indicates that an ambiguity level throughout the whole network is established. When subnetworks are predefined, the assistance data can be broadcast to all UEs located in the assigned sub-network. More details on the usage of subnetworks can be found in [33].\nTable 8.1.2.1a-3: MAC Network RTK service: Specific Information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to the UE\n\n-\tFKP Network RTK service: With the concept of FKP, horizontal gradients of distance-dependent errors like ionosphere, troposphere and orbits are derived from a network of GNSS Reference Stations and transmitted to a target device together with raw or correction data of a corresponding Reference Station (physical or non-physical). The target UE may use the gradients to compute the effect of the distance-dependent errors for its own position.\nTable 8.1.2.1a-4: FKP Network RTK service: Information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to the UE\n\n-\tPPP service: This concept uses precise satellite orbit and clock parameters derived from global networks of Reference Stations as well as atmospheric models to perform single station positioning [33]. Compared to RTK and Network RTK, PPP is not a differential technique as there is no baseline limitation. When the orbits and clocks assistance data elements are provided in real-time, with no latency, the method is called Real-Time PPP.\nTable 8.1.2.1a-5: SSR PPP service: Information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to the UE\n\n-\tPPP-RTK service: This concept uses precise satellite orbits and clock parameters, the satellite signal biases derived from global networks of Reference Stations as well as ionosphere and troposphere corrections to perform single station positioning [36]. Therefore, PPP-RTK services compensate the global and local corrections for a more accurate location information. Compared to PPP, PPP-RTK requires the UE to be located within the region covered by the ionosphere and troposphere corrections.\nTable 8.1.2.1a-6: SSR PPP-RTK service: Information that may be transferred from the E-SMLC to the UE\n\nTable 8.1.2.1b-1 shows the mapping between the integrity fields and the SSR assistance data according to the Integrity Principle of Operation (Clause 8.1.1a). The corresponding field descriptions for each of the field names listed in Table 8.1.2.1b-1 are specified under Clause 6.5.2.2 of TS 37.355 [39].\nTable 8.1.2.1b-1: Mapping of Integrity Parameters\n\nThe information that may be signalled from the UE to the E-SMLC is listed in table 8.1.2.2-1.\nTable 8.1.2.2-1: Information that may be transferred from the UE to the E-SMLC\n\nThe GNSS measurement information reported from the UE to the E-SMLC depends on the GNSS mode (i.e., UE-based, autonomous (standalone), or UE-assisted).\nIn UE-based or standalone mode, the GNSS receiver reports the latitude, longitude and possibly altitude, together with an estimate of the location uncertainty, if available.\nIf requested by the E-SMLC and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report its velocity, possibly together with an estimate of the uncertainty, if available.\nIf requested by the E-SMLC and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report the relation between GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID; the specific GNSS system time may be selected by the UE) and E-UTRAN air-interface timing. This information may be used by the E-SMLC to assist other UEs in the network.\nThe UE should also report an indication of which GNSSs and possibly other location methods have been used to calculate a fix.\nIn UE-assisted mode, the GNSS receiver reports the Code Phase and Doppler measurements together with associated quality estimates. These measurements enable the E-SMLC to calculate the location of the UE, possibly using other measurements and data.\nIf requested by the E-SMLC and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report Carrier Phase measurements (also called Accumulated Delta Range), together with associated quality measurements, if available.\nIf requested by the E-SMLC and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report the relation between GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID; the specific GNSS system time may be selected by the UE) and E-UTRAN air-interface timing. This information may be used by the E-SMLC to assist other UEs in the network.\nAdditional non-GNSS measurements performed by E-UTRAN or UE may be used by the E-SMLC or UE to calculate or verify a location estimate. This information may include downlink positioning measurements, path loss and signal strength related measurements, etc.\n",

In the case of high-accuracy GNSS positioning techniques (e.g., RTK), the E-SMLC can provide unsolicited periodic assistance data to the UE and the UE can request periodic assistance data from the E-SMLC.\nFigure 8.1.3.2.1-1 shows the Assistance Data Delivery operations for the network-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the E-SMLC.\nThe figure depicts a simplified diagram of the E-SMLC (Enhanced Service Mobility Lifecycle) initiated Assistance Data Delivery Procedure. It illustrates the steps involved in initiating assistance data delivery, including the initiation of the E-SMLC, the initiation of the SMLC (Service Mobility Lifecycle), and the initiation of the D-SMLC (Data Mobility Lifecycle). The figure is used to demonstrate the flow of data from the E-SMLC to the D-SMLC, highlighting the importance of data mobility in the E-SMLC-initiated assistance process.\nFigure 8.1.3.2.1-1: E-SMLC-initiated Assistance Data Delivery Procedure\n(1)\tThe E-SMLC determines that assistance data needs to be provided to the UE (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and sends an LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. This message may include any of the GNSS assistance data defined in clause 8.1.2.1.\nThe Periodic Assistance Data Delivery procedure allows the server to provide unsolicited periodic assistance data to the target and is shown in Figure 8.1.3.2.1a-1.\nNOTE:\tIn this version of the specification, periodic assistance data delivery is supported for HA GNSS (e.g., RTK) positioning only.\nThe figure depicts a data delivery procedure for LPP (Layer 1 Packet Pacing) in a network. It illustrates the steps involved in ensuring data delivery in a timely manner, with periodic assistance from the network. The figure shows the data flow from the source to the destination, with the assistance of the network's LPP mechanism.\nFigure 8.1.3.2.1a-1: LPP Periodic Assistance data delivery procedure\n(1)\tThe E-SMLC determines that assistance data needs to be provided to the UE and sends an LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. This message includes information to identify the type of periodic assistance data and a duration for ending the assistance data delivery.\n(2)\tWhen the first periodic message is available, the E-SMLC sends an unsolicited LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE containing the periodic assistance data announced in step (1).\n(3)\tThe server may continue to send further LPP Provide Assistance Data messages to the target containing the periodic assistance data announced in step (1) when each additional periodicity condition occurs. When the duration for ending the periodic assistance data transfer occurs, the last LPP Provide Assistance Data message transferred indicates the end of transaction. Additionally, the session can be ended on request by the UE or by the E-SMLC with the help of an Abort message.\n\nFigure 8.1.3.2.2-1 shows the Assistance Data Transfer operations for the network-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.\nThe figure depicts the UE-initiated assistance data transfer procedure, illustrating the steps taken by the UE to initiate the assistance data transfer process. The figure includes various components such as the UE, the assistance data, and the network infrastructure, highlighting the importance of network reliability and the role of the UE in ensuring data transfer.\nFigure 8.1.3.2.2-1: UE-initiated Assistance Data Transfer Procedure\n(1)\tThe UE determines that certain A-GNSS assistance data are desired (e.g., in case the UE requires its own location with autonomous self location or as part of a positioning procedure when the E-SMLC provided assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfill the request) and sends a LPP Request Assistance Data message to the E-SMLC. This request includes an indication of which specific A-GNSS assistance data are requested for each GNSS, possibly together with additional information (e.g., for which GNSS signal types, or satellites, or times the assistance is requested, etc.). Additional information concerning the UE's approximate location and serving and neighbour cells may also be provided in the Request Assistance Data message and/or in an accompanying Provide Location Information message to help the E-SMLC provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include the UE's last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE serving eNodeB and possibly neighbour eNodeBs, as well as E-CID measurements.\n(2)\tThe E-SMLC provides the requested assistance data in a LPP Provide Assistance Data message, if available at the E-SMLC. The entire set of assistance data may be delivered in one or several LPP messages, e.g., one message per GNSS. In this case, this step may be repeated by the E-SMLC several times. If any of the UE requested assistance data in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE shall assume that the requested assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at the E-SMLC. If none of the UE requested assistance data in step (1) can be provided by the E-SMLC, return any information that can be provided in an LPP message of type Provide Assistance Data which includes a cause indication for the not provided assistance data.\nFigure 8.1.3.2.2a-1 shows the Periodic Assistance Data Transfer operations for the high-accuracy GNSS methods (e.g., RTK) when the procedure is initiated by the UE.\nNOTE:\tIn this version of the specification, periodic assistance data transfer is supported for HA GNSS (e.g., RTK) positioning only.\nThe figure depicts a periodic assistance data transfer procedure initiated by an UE (User Equipment) in a 5G network. The diagram illustrates the steps involved in the data transfer process, including the initiation of the assistance, the transmission of the data, and the completion of the assistance. The figure also highlights the use of various signaling protocols, such as the 5G Core Network (C-RAN) and the 5G Core Network (C-RAN) Core Network (C-RAN), to ensure efficient data transmission.\nFigure 8.1.3.2.2a-1: UE-initiated Periodic Assistance Data Transfer Procedure\n(1)\tThe UE determines that certain periodic A-GNSS assistance data, specific to one or more RTK-service levels, are desired and sends a LPP Request Assistance Data message to the E-SMLC. This request includes an indication of which specific A-GNSS assistance data are requested for each GNSS. Additional information like desired periodicity for sending the assistance data and a duration for ending the periodic session shall also be provided in the LPP Request Assistance Data message.\n(2)\tThe E-SMLC responds with a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. If the UE request can be supported, the message contains information which may confirm or redefine the type of assistance data or periodicity parameters requested at step (1). This response indicates the end of the control transaction.\n(3)\tWhen available, the E-SMLC provides unsolicited the requested assistance data in a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. If any of the requested assistance data in step (1) or redefined in step (2) are not provided in step (3), the UE shall assume that the requested assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at the E-SMLC.\n(4)\tThe E-SMLC may transmit one or more additional LPP Provide Assistance Data messages to the UE containing further periodic assistance data confirmed or redefined in step (2). When the duration for ending the periodic assistance data transfer occur, the last LPP Provide Assistance Data message transferred indicates the end of the transaction. Additionally, the session can be ended on request by the UE or by the E-SMLC with the help of an Abort message.\nThe purpose of this procedure is to enable the E-SMLC to request position measurements or location estimate from the UE, or to enable the UE to provide location measurements to the E-SMLC for position calculation (e.g., in case of basic self location where the UE requests its own location).\nFigure 8.1.3.3.1-1 shows the Location Information Transfer operations for the network-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the E-SMLC.\nThe figure depicts the E-SMLC (Enhanced Service Mobility Link Control) initiated Location Information Transfer procedure, which is a crucial component of the 5G network. It illustrates the steps taken by the E-SMLC to initiate the location information transfer, ensuring efficient communication between the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE). The figure highlights the use of optical fibers and optical line terminals (OLTs) to facilitate the transfer of location information, which is essential for providing location-based services in 5G networks.\nFigure 8.1.3.3.1-1: E-SMLC-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure\n(1)The E-SMLC sends a LPP Request Location Information message to the UE for invocation of A-GNSS positioning. This request includes positioning instructions such as the GNSS mode (UE-assisted, UE-based, UE-based preferred but UE-assisted allowed, UE-assisted preferred, but UE-based allowed, standalone), positioning methods (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BDS, NavIC, etc. and possibly non-GNSS methods, such as downlink positioning or E-CID), specific UE measurements requested if any, such as fine time assistance measurements, velocity, carrier phase, multi-frequency measurements, and quality of service parameters (accuracy, response time), and possibly integrity requirements.\n(2)\tThe UE performs the requested measurements and possibly calculates its own location. The UE may also determine the integrity results of the calculated location. The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the E-SMLC before the Response Time provided in step (1) elapsed. If the UE is unable to perform the requested measurements, or if the Response Time provided in step 1 elapsed before any of the requested measurements have been obtained, the UE returns any information that can be provided in an LPP message of type Provide Location Information which includes a cause indication for the not provided location information.\nFigure 8.1.3.3.2-1 shows the Location Information delivery operations for the UE-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.\nThe figure depicts a UE-initiated location information delivery procedure, illustrating the steps involved in delivering location information to the UE. The figure includes a diagram of the communication path, highlighting the steps such as the UE initiating the location information delivery, the network routing the data, and the UE receiving the location information. The figure also includes a legend to explain the different symbols used in the diagram, such as the location marker, the location information, and the location information delivery.\nFigure 8.1.3.3.2-1: UE-initiated Location Information Delivery Procedure\n(1)\tThe UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the E-SMLC. The Provide Location Information message may include any UE measurements (GNSS pseudo-ranges, carrier phase-ranges, and other measurements) already available at the UE.\n",

The figure includes a request message, a response message, and a list of required information. The Uplink Information Request Procedure is an essential component of 5G network architecture, ensuring efficient communication between the network and the user.\nFigure 8.5.3.1-1: Uplink information request procedure\n1.\tThe E-SMLC sends an Information Request message indicating to the eNodeB the need to invoke periodic SRS (see 5.2.2) for target UE. The E-SMLC may provide the eNB with a number of SRS transmissions. The final decision of SRS transmissions to be performed and whether to take into account this information is entirely up to the eNB implementation.\n2.\tThe eNodeB determines the resources to be allocated for the UE and sends an Information Response to the E-SMLC that includes the allocated resources and the associated parameters. The eNB may decide (e.g., in case no resources are available) to configure no resources for the UE and report the empty resource configuration to the E-SMLC.\n3.\tIf in step 2 the eNodeB determines that resources will be allocated, the eNodeB then allocates the resources to the target UE.\n4.\tThe E-SMLC selects a set of LMUs to be used for the UTDOA positioning and sends a measurement request with the SRS configuration to each one of them (via SLm).\n5.\tLMUs report back to E-SMLC the uplink measurement reports.\nThis procedure is used to notify the E-SMLC of a change to the UE SRS transmission configuration for one or more cells with respect to a previously sent UTDOA INFORMATION RESPONSE message. If the configured SRS transmission for the target UE has been modified, or if a handover of the target UE has been triggered, the eNB uses the Uplink Positioning Information Update procedure to inform the E-SMLC.\nThe figure depicts a Uplink Positioning Information Update Procedure, which is a crucial component of a 5G network.

In the case of handover, the source eNB sends the update message after deciding to perform handover execution for the UE.\n2.\tIf the UE SRS transmission configuration has changed for one or more cells, the eNB sends an Uplink Positioning Information Update message to the E-SMLC carrying the UE SRS transmission configuration information for all cells with SRS configured.\n",

This request includes positioning instructions such as the positioning mode (UE-assisted, UE-based, standalone), specific requested UE measurements if any, and quality of service parameters (accuracy, response time).\n(2)\tThe UE performs the requested measurements and possibly calculates its own position.

            "description": "This clause describes interworking between the control-plane LCS architecture, as defined in the main body of this specification, and SUPL 2.0. The E-SMLC either includes or has an interface to an SPC function as defined in OMA SUPL V2.0 ([17], [18]). It can thus provide a consistent set of positioning methods for deployments utilizing both control-plane and user-plane.\nThe interworking does not enable use of user-plane signalling for part of a control-plane positioning session. The user plane in the interworking here is not intended as an alternative path for control-plane signalling that would be needed between UE and eNodeB for mechanisms such as A-GPS in a standalone C-plane solution.\nThis interworking does enable the SPC to retrieve measurements (e.g., GNSS-to-RAN time relations) from eNodeB.\nThe underlying architecture is shown in Figure B.2-1. Note that, for interworking between user-plane and control-plane positioning, no new interfaces need to be defined as compared to those in the figure, assuming the SPC is either integrated in the E-SMLC or attached to it with a proprietary interface.\nThe figure depicts a system architecture underlying positioning, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The system includes a base station (BTS), a mobile terminal (MT), and a positioning network (PN). The BTS receives signals from the MT and decodes them to determine the position of the MT. The PN then uses the decoded signals to determine the position of the MT. The figure also shows the use of satellite communication for positioning, with a focus on the satellite constellation and the satellite link.\nFigure B.2-1: System architecture underlying positioning\nThe Lup and Llp interfaces shown in this architecture are part of the user-plane solution only and are not required for control-plane positioning. The SLs interface is required for both control-plane and user-plane positioning, and needs to be capable of querying eNode Bs for information not related to a UE connection.\nSUPL, including the use of LPP over SUPL, takes place as part of the general user-plane protocol stack shown in Figure B.2-2. SUPL occupies the application layer in the stack, with LPP (or another positioning protocol) transported as another layer above SUPL.\nFigure B.2 -2: User-plane protocol stack\nFigure B.2-2: User-plane protocol stack\n",

            "description": "This clause indicates how an LPP session relates to the SUPL structure. Figure B.3-1 shows how SUPL and LPP can be combined within a SUPL positioning session. Step 4 here is repeated to exchange multiple LPP messages between the SLP and SET.\nThe figure depicts a LPP session over SUPL, illustrating the communication between two devices over a shared physical-layer protocol. The session is depicted in a simplified manner, with the devices represented as nodes and the protocol represented as a line. The figure highlights the use of the SUPL protocol, which is a key component in the LPP protocol, allowing for efficient communication over shared physical-layer resources.\nFigure B.3-1: LPP session over SUPL\nFor positioning operations which take place entirely within an LPP session (step 4 in Figure B.3-1), the flow of LPP messages can be the same as in the control-plane version of LPP; the role of the (LPP) target is taken by the target SET, and that of the (LPP) server by the SLP. An example LPP flow, including exchange of capabilities, request and delivery of assistance data, and request and delivery of positioning information, is shown in Figure B.3-2.\nThe figure depicts a LPP session over SUPL, illustrating the communication between two devices over a shared physical-layer protocol. The session is characterized by the use of a shared physical medium, which allows for efficient data transmission. The figure also highlights the use of a shared physical layer protocol, which is crucial for ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure B.3-2: LPP session over SUPL\n",

            "title": "B.4\tProcedures combining C-plane and U-plane operations",
            "description": "Since SUPL is by definition carried over the user plane, it is not really applicable to operations terminating at the eNode B. Thus, in some cases where information from the eNode B and UE needs to be merged for a positioning operation, SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over LPPa.\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by various eNode Bs. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as a running example.\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is of course the SLP, the existence of the Llp interface means that the SLP can communicate freely with the E-SMLC via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that were delivered to the E-SMLC via LPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\nSeveral ways to realise this general behaviour are possible. In the simplest case, the E-SMLC could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that they can be supplied to the SLP without any actual LPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\nThe figure depicts the transfer of OTDOA assistance data to an UE via SUPL (Space-Time Multiplexed Packet). The data is transmitted over a satellite link, with the UE receiving the data through a satellite antenna. The figure illustrates the use of satellite communication technology for providing real-time navigation and positioning services to users.\nFigure B.4-1: Transfer of OTDOA assistance data to UE via SUPL\nIn the event that the E-SMLC does not have the required assistance data available, however, it would need to retrieve them from appropriate eNode Bs once it was made aware that they were needed.\nThe figure depicts a transfer of OTDOA assistance data to the UE via SUPL (Synthetic Orthogonal Pollicular) of OTDOA assistance data not already available at the E-SMLC. This figure illustrates the process of transferring data from the satellite to the ground station, which is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable communication.\nFigure B.4-2: Transfer to the UE via SUPL of OTDOA assistance data not already available at the E-SMLC\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be looked on as an independent external process.\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\n\n\n\n",
