It illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the SBI, SBI-S, and SBI-D, which are used to authenticate users. The figure also highlights the role of the SBI-S in the authentication process, as it is responsible for generating the SBI and SBI-D. The SBI-D is used to authenticate the user's identity, while the SBI is used to authenticate the user's credentials. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the Naf_Authentication service's architecture, making it easier to understand and interpret.\nFigure 4.2.1.2-1: Reference architecture for Naf_Authentication service: SBI representation\nThe figure depicts a reference architecture for the Naf_Authentication service, illustrating the reference point representation used in the service. The architecture includes a reference point, which is a point in the network where the authentication service can be accessed. The figure shows the various components and their connections, including the reference point, the authentication service, and the authentication service's client. The architecture is designed to ensure that the authentication service can be accessed from any point in the network, regardless of the user's location.\nFigure 4.2.1.2-2: Reference architecture for Naf_Authentication service: reference point representation\nThe functionalities supported by the USS are listed in clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.256 [14].\nThe UAS service supplier (USS) application provides authentication and authorization for the UAV.\nThe UAS service supplier (USS) allows NF consumers to exchange communication messages needed for authentication and authorization procedure. It also notifies NF consumers about reauthentication, reauthorization or revocation of the UAV.\nThe Uncrewed Aerial System network function (UAS NF):\n-\tsupports authentication and authorization of the UAV with the USS;\n-\tsupports subscription for notification of reauthentication, reauthorization and revocation of the UAV from the USS.\n",
