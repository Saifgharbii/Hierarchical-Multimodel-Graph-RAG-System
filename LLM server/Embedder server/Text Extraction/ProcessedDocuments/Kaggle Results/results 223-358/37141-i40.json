For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.1.5.5-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.1.5.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III, E-UTRA Band 3 or NR Band n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements are 1805 – 1850 MHz and 1710 – 1755 MHz respectively.\nNOTE 4:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations(except in Band 46), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 6:\tFor Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 7:\tFor Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.1.5.5-2: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with PHS\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 41 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nFor Band 41 NR operation, the additional BS spurious emissions limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over all antenna connectors.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable .5.5-3: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for BS operating in Band 41\n\nIn addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.1.5.1 to 6.6.1.5.4 and above in the present clause, the BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [8], when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 30 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.1.5.5-4: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 30\n\nIn certain regions the following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 45. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Table 6.6.1.5.5-5.\nTable 6.6.1.5.5-5: Emissions limits for protection of adjacent band services\n\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 48 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.1.5.5-6: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 48\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to BS operating in Band 54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.1.5.5-7 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,B54,a, PEM,B54,b, PEM,B54,c, PEM,B54,d, PEM,B54,e and PEM,B54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.1.5.5-7: Declared Band 54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.1.5.6-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [14].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.1.5.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\n",

When the Test Tolerance is zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.\nTest requirements which are included by reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS 25.142[12], TS 36.141[9] or TS 51.021[11] have been calculated within the referred test specification using the Test Tolerances defined therein.\nThe Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.\nThe test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).\nNote that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined in this Annex.\nUnless otherwise stated, the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2 apply to the Test System for testing E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT MSR BS.\n",
