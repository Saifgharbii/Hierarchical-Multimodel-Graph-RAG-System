The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.\nThe figure depicts a 2-1-1 layout of radiated reference points for a SAN type 1-O, illustrating the distribution of radio frequency (RF) signals within the network. The layout includes two reference points (R1 and R2) at the top and bottom of the figure, with one point at the center of the network. The RF signals are represented by dashed lines, and the network is represented by a network diagram with nodes and lines connecting them. The figure is used to understand the spatial distribution of RF signals within the network, which is crucial for network planning and design.\nFigure 4.3.2-1: Radiated reference points for SAN type 1-O\n\n",
