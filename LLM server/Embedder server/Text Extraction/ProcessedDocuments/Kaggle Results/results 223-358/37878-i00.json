            "description": "The present document is the Technical Report on TR on band combinations for con-current operation of NR/LTE Uu bands/band combinations and one NR/LTE V2X band in Release 18.\nThe purpose of the present document is to study the extension of the band combinations for V2X service to grow the NR V2X ecosystem. Operators propose new band combinations for con-current operation of NR/LTE Uu bands/band combinations and one NR/LTE V2X band. Whether to specify con-current operation of LTE/NR CA/DC band combinations and V2X band depends on requests in Rel-18. Specifically, the self-desensitization problem of con-current operation band combinations will be analysed including harmonics, IMD problem, etc.. Also the candidate solutions will be studied to solve the self-desensitization problem.\nTable 1-1: Release 18 NR V2X band combinations\n\nNote:\tAll band combinations in table 1-1 that are release independent from Rel-16 are optional\n",

Up to the 3rd harmonics of band 3 are provided since the frequency range of the 4th harmonics is higher than 5.9GHz. The harmonics of band n47 are not listed as the harmonics distributed in the frequency range much higher than 5.9GHz have no impact on GNSS and ISM bands. Based on the harmonics analysis, it is observed that the 3rd harmonics of band 3 have no impact on band n47.\nTable 6.2.2.3-1: Harmonics analysis for V2X_n3A-n47A\n\nThe IMD analysis for V2X_n3A-n47A is specified in table 6.2.2.3-2. Up to the 5th order IMDs of band 3 and band n47 are provided. Based on the IMD analysis, it is observed that no IMD products fall into the associated bands. So there is no IMD issue causeds by the band combination.\nTable 6.2.2.3-2: IMD analysis for V2X_n3A-n47A\n\nThe harmonics and intermodulation products should be evaluated when V2X inter-band con-current operating UE coexists with other systems such as GNSS and ISM. The harmonics and IMD analysis of V2X_n3A-n47A for GNSS and ISM bands is shown in table 6.2.2.3-3. Based on the analysis for GNSS and ISM bands, band n47 and the 3rd harmonics of band 3 have an impact on the ISM band (5GHZ).\n\nTable 6.2.2.3-3: Harmonic and IMDs analysis of V2X_n3A-n47A UE for GNSS and ISM bands\n\nTable 6.2.2.4-1: ΔTIB,c for inter-band con-current V2X operation (two bands)\n\nTable 6.2.2.4-2: ΔRIB,c for inter-band con-current V2X operation (two bands)\n\n",
