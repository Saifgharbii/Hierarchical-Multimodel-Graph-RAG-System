Both the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are supported by access either to the public network's own SIP database or the VAL service provider's SIP database.\n-\tCan provide the application service selection for all SIP transactions, possibly based on application service selection information stored by either the public network's own SIP database or the VAL service provider's SIP database.\n-\tPerforms SIP signalling security.\nNOTE:\tIn the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the S-CSCF as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [15].\nThis functional entity acts as a proxy agent for Diameter messaging as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24].\nThe Diameter proxy, when used on the AAA-2 interface, is collocated with the migration management server.\nOther instances of the Diameter proxy may also be present in the SIP core / IMS.\nNOTE:\tThe number of instances of the Diameter proxy is deployment specific.\nThe SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP core, and such information as application service selection.\nIn deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this database is provided by the HSS.\nIn deployment scenarios where the VAL service provider provides the SIP core, the SIP database may be provided by the VAL service provider.\nAccess to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.\nNOTE:\tThe SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.\nThe SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related information:\n-\tsignalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;\n-\tsignalling plane security information: SIP core access control information for authentication and authorization;\n-\tVAL UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information, etc.; and\n-\tsignalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).\nThe SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.\nBased on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the call control and session management entities of the SIP core.\nThe SIP database consists of the following functionalities:\n-\tsupport for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to access the SIP core; and\n-\tauthentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the VAL UE.\nThe SIP database provides the following logical functions:\na)\tmobility management;\n-\tprovides the UE mobility through the SIP core.\nb)\tregistrar assignment support;\n-\tprovides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for VAL services based on VAL service provider requirements on a per-user basis, (e.g. whether a particular registrar within the PLMN operator's network (e.g. a registrar reserved for VAL service use or a registrar in a secure location) or a registrar within the VAL service provider network is assigned.\nc)\tcall and/or session establishment support;\n-\tprovides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core. For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently hosts the user.\nd)\tuser security information generation;\n-\tprovides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data for the SIP core.\ne)\tsignalling plane security support;\n-\tprovides authentication procedures to access VAL services by storing the generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.\nf)\tuser identification handling;\n-\tprovides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public identities.\ng)\taccess authorisation; and\n-\tprovides authorisation of the user for mobile access when requested by the registrar e.g. by checking that the user is allowed to roam to that visited network.\nh)\tservice authorisation support.\n-\tprovides basic authorisation for terminating call/session establishment and service invocation. The SIP database may update the registrar with filter criteria to trigger the VAL server(s).\nThis functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.\nThis functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the VAL UE allowing the HTTP client to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with multiple HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.\nThe HTTP proxy terminates the HTTP-3 reference point that lies between different HTTP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP entities outside the trust domain of the VAL system.\nThe HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP servers that are located within a VAL service provider's network. There can be multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.\nNOTE:\tThe number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.\nThis functional entity acts as the HTTP server for all hypertext transactions.\nThis functional entity acts as the light-weight protocol client for all transactions of the SEAL client executing in a constrained UE. A SEAL client executing in an unconstrained UE may choose to use the LWP client if it is available.\nThis functional entity acts as a proxy for transactions between the LWP client and one or more LWP servers. The LWP proxy typically terminates a secure transport protocol (e.g. DTLS, TLS or secure WebSocket) session on LWP-1 reference point with the LWP client of the VAL UE allowing the LWP client to establish a single secure session for transactions with multiple LWP servers that are reachable by the LWP proxy.\nThe LWP proxy can act as a cross-protocol LWP-HTTP proxy to enable LWP clients to access resources on HTTP servers via the LWP-HTTP-2 reference point.\nThe LWP proxy terminates LWP-3 reference point that lies between different LWP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from LWP entities outside the trust domain of the VAL system.\nThe LWP proxy can also terminate LWP-HTTP-3 reference point for interworking with another HTTP proxy. In this role it provides cross-protocol mapping and may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP entities outside the trust domain of the VAL system.\nThe LWP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the LWP clients and LWP servers that are located within a VAL service provider's network. There can be multiple instances of a LWP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.\nThis functional entity acts as the LWP server for all LWP transactions of the SEAL server.\nNOTE:\tA SEAL client can act as LWP server for certain transactions as required by the SEAL service.\nLWP is a generic representation of a light-weight protocol for use in constrained environments. Realizations of the light-weight protocol (LWP) functional entities and reference points to a particular protocol are defined in the annexes of this specification.\nLWP is a representation of a protocol to be used by the SEAL service enablers on their respective SEAL-UU reference points when the SEAL client is executing in a constrained UE. In this case the SEAL client should use the LWP-1 reference point with the LWP proxy and should use either the LWP-2 or the LWP-HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling with the SEAL server.\nEditor's note: Which procedures of a SEAL service enabler are not necessary to be supported for a constrained UE is FFS.\nA SEAL client executing in a non-constrained UE may choose to use the LWP-1 reference point with the LWP proxy and may use either the LWP-2 or the LWP-HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling with the SEAL server.\nLWP may be used for interactions between SEAL servers on their respective SEAL-E reference points. For this usage the SEAL-E reference point shall use the LWP-1 and either the LWP-2 or the LWP-3 reference point depending on the trust relationship between the interacting SEAL servers.\n",

The decision to report location information can be triggered at the location management client by different conditions, e.g., the reception of the location reporting configuration, initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI change, MBMS session change, leaving a specific MBMS bearer service area, tracking area change, PLMN change, call initiation, or other types of events such as emergency. The location report can include information described as ECGI, MBMS SAIs, geographic coordinates and other location information.\nFigure 9.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching location reporting configuration.\nPre-condition:\n-\tIf multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is activated by the location management server.\n-\tThe location management client is aware that the location reporting configuration is available at the location management server.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step process for fetching location reporting configuration, including the steps to configure the location reporting system, the steps to configure the location reporting system, and the steps to configure the location reporting system.\nFigure 9.3.3.2-1: Fetching location reporting configuration procedure\n1.\tThe location management client sends location reporting configuration request message to the location management server.\n2.\tThe location management server sends location reporting configuration message to the location management client(s) containing the initial location reporting event triggers configuration (or a subsequent update) , e.g. minimum time between consecutive reports, SAI changes, access RAT changes, or ECGI changes for reporting the location of the VAL UE. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to a specific location management client or as a group message over an MBMS bearer to update the location reporting configuration for multiple location management clients at the same time.\nNOTE 1:\tThe location reporting configuration information can be made part of the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.\nNOTE 2:\tDifferent location management clients may be given different location reporting criteria.\n3.\tThe location management client stores or updates the location reporting event triggers configuration.

The update involves updating the location reporting system, which is essential for accurate positioning and location services. The figure shows the steps involved in the update process, including the selection of the reporting system, the configuration of the reporting system, and the submission of the update. This ensures that the location reporting system remains accurate and reliable, enabling 5G services to provide accurate location-based services to users.\nFigure 9.3.3.4-1: Location reporting configuration update procedure\n1.\tBased on the local configurations or the location information request from other entities (e.g., another location management client, VAL server) or if the VAL server updates the geographical location information of the existing VAL service area ID and there is triggering criteria corresponding to the updated VAL service area ID, the location management server decides to update the location reporting configuration and informs the updated information to the location management client.\n2.\tThe location management server sends location reporting configuration update request message to the location management client(s) which may contain the updated location reporting configuration, e.g. the event triggers, the minimum time between consecutive reports, the requested location access type and positioning methods when VAL UE fetches the UE location report. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to a specific location management client or as a group message over an MBMS bearer to update the location reporting configuration for multiple location management clients at the same time. If the location reporting trigger from VAL server contains the triggering criteria based on the VAL service area ID, then the location management server converts those triggers into geographical area based triggers while sending it to the location management client.\nNOTE:\tDifferent location management clients may be given different location reporting criteria.\n3.\tThe location management client(s) reply with location reporting configuration update response to the location management server with the update result.\n4.

How such mapping is configured is implementation specific and out of the scope of this specification.\n5.\tThe group management server announces the VAL group to the group management clients. For a 5GVN group the announcement includes the communication type (IP or Ethernet), DNN, and S-NSSAI corresponding to the 5GVN group.\n6.\tThe group management client registers to VAL group communication using the VAL Group ID.\n7.\tThe group management server records the users who have registered to be the members of the group.\n8.\tThe group management server sends a VAL group registration response to the group management client.\n9.\tThe group management server sends a configure VAL group response to the VAL server.\nNOTE 5:\tStep 9 may occur any time after step 5.\n10.\tThe group management server sends identity list notification about the newly registered users to the other members of the group and VAL server, whose subscription to receive notifications of newly registered VAL UE IDs is successful in step 8 and step 9 respectively.\n11.\tThe group management client may inform VAL client about the updated identity list.\n",

It includes network elements such as network resources, network functions, and network services, as well as their respective responsibilities and interactions. The model provides a comprehensive overview of the network's resource management process, enabling network operators to optimize network performance and ensure efficient resource allocation.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-1: On-network functional model for network resource management\nThe network resource management client communicates with the network resource management server over the NRM-UU reference point. The network resource management client provides the support for network resource management functions to the VAL client(s) over NRM-C reference point. The VAL server(s) communicate with the network resource management server over the NRM-S reference point.\nThe network resource management server obtains and controls the multicast/broadcast resource from the underlaying 3GPP network system by communicating with the BM-SC via MB2-C and xMB-C reference points towards LTE eMBMS and with the 5G MBS control plane functions via Nmb13, Nmb10 or N33 towards the 5GS. The network resource management server communicates with the PCRF via Rx reference point or communicates with the PCF via N5 reference point to control the unicast resources from the underlying 3GPP network system. The network resource management server communicates with the SCEF via T8 reference point or communicates with the NEF via N33 reference point to perform event monitoring procedures from the underlying 3GPP network system. The network resource management server interacts with NEF via N33 to obtain QoS monitoring information from the 5GS.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-2 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and consuming group management services. The network resource management server could provide service to VAL server and network resource management client through interface Snrm.\nThe figure depicts a network resource management architecture, specifically focusing on service-based representation. It illustrates the various components and their interactions, such as network functions virtualization (NFV), network function orchestration (NFSO), and network function abstraction (NFA). The architecture is designed to support service-oriented networking (SON), enabling the creation and management of network services.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-2: Architecture for network resource management – Service based representation\nFigure 14.2.2.1-3 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].\nThe figure depicts a network architecture for network resource management, utilizing the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA (Service-based Architecture) model. It illustrates the various network services, such as network slicing, network slicing, and network slicing, which are essential for managing network resources efficiently. The figure also highlights the use of SDN (Software-Defined Networking) principles, which allows for the automation and orchestration of network services.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-3: Architecture for network resource management utilizing the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA – Service based representation\nFigure 14.2.2.1-4 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the Core Network northbound APIs via CAPIF.\nThe figure depicts a detailed representation of the utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF (Core Application Programming Interface for the Internet of Things). It illustrates the service-based representation of the APIs, highlighting the various APIs used for different services such as IoT, M2M, and M2M/IoT. The figure also includes a flowchart to illustrate the process of accessing these APIs, with arrows indicating the flow of data between different APIs. The use of CAPIF ensures that the APIs are designed to be service-based, allowing for a more efficient and scalable network.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-4: Utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF – service based representation\nThe Network resource management server and VAL server act as authorized API invoker to consume services from the Core Network northbound API entities like NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nThe architecture for integration of the 5G with TSN [36] is depicted in Figure 14.2.2.2-1. The SEAL Network Resource Management (NRM) server acts as a TSN AF (defined in [10] in clause 5.28.1). TSN CNC (defined in [35]) via the NRM-S reference point configures the TSN flows in the 5GS. In this case the NRM-S supports the IEEE 802.1Qcc management protocol. As a TSN AF the SEAL NRM server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N5 reference point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS.\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed on-network functional model for network resource management in TSN, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It includes network elements such as network resources, network functions, and network services, as well as their respective responsibilities and interactions. The model provides a comprehensive understanding of how network resources are managed and utilized within the TSN environment.\nFigure 14.2.2.2-1: On-network functional model for network resource management for TSN\nNOTE: Whether DS-TT and UE are combined or are separate is up to implementation.\nActing as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS 23.502 [11] Annex F.1.\nNRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] Annex F.2.\n5G TSC refers to time sensitive communication service offered within the 5G system (i.e. without integration with a TSN system) by the 5GS for the UEs connected to the 5GS. The architecture for the 5G TSC is depicted in Figure 14.2.2.3-1. The SEAL NRM server acts as an AF towards the 5G Core Network and performs coordination of QoS flows to fulfill the end-to-end QoS requirements for the UEs involved in the TSC communication. It combines the roles of TSCTSF and TSC CNC (similar to the TSN CNC in the TSN integration case), which means that it controls the allocation of resources of TSC communication within the boundaries of the 5G domain.\nUpon request from a VAL server via the NRM-S reference point it configures the TSC end-to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. In line with other SEAL service enablers the SEAL NRM server provides a RESTful interface on the NRM-S reference point. As a TSCTSF the SEAL NRM server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N84 reference point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS.\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed on-network functional model for network resource management in 5G TSC, illustrating the various components and their interactions.\nFigure 14.2.2.3-1: On-network functional model for network resource management for 5G TSC\n\n",

The NRM server sets up bearers and may need to modify the bearers for an already established VAL service communication.\nCharacteristics that may need to be modified include:\n-\tactivation and deactivation of the bearer;\n-\tmodification of the QoS characteristics of the bearer (e.g. bearer priority adjustment); and\n-\tmodification of GBR due to application requirement\nNOTE:\tA VAL service communication can consist of both unicast and multicast bearers which can all need modification due to the same event.\nVertical application layer specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by functional entities in performing these procedures are specified in the respective vertical application layer TS (e.g. for V2X application layer, see 3GPP TS 23.286 [7]).\nUnicast resource management is supported with PCC interactions with SIP core and PCC interactions with NRM server. The PCC procedures for EPS are specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [18] and the PCC procedures for 5GS are specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 [19].\nThe procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are requested at VAL service communication establishment. If concurrent sessions are used the NRM server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified for underlying network policy and charging functions. The request for resources includes application type, bandwidth, priority, application identifier and resource sharing information.\nThe procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires requests for network resources.\nProcedures in figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the requesting resource at session establishment.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe VAL client has requested VAL service communication with the VAL server.\nThe figure depicts a resource request at the VAL service communication establishment, illustrating the process of requesting resources for communication services.\nFigure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1: Resource request at VAL service communication establishment\n1.\tThe VAL server sends request for resources to the NRM server.\n2.\tThe NRM server evaluates the need for network resources and use of resource sharing.\n3.\tThe NRM server sends a session progress request containing request for resources.\n4.\tPCC procedures are initiated from SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy.\n5.\tThe SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy sends a OK message to the NRM server.\n6.\tThe NRM server sends a resource response to the VAL server.\n7.\tThe VAL service communication is established, and resources have been allocated.\nTo modify unicast bearers, the NRM server shall send a resource modification request containing the parameters to be modified for the UE.\nPossible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:\n-\tModify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;\n-\tRelease and resume resources in-between VAL service communications; or\n-\tRelease and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the VAL service communications over multicast transmission\nProcedures in figure 14.3.3.2.2.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the modification of a unicast:\nPre-condition:\n-\tA VAL service communication is already in progress;\nThe figure depicts a Bearer modification request, which is a crucial step in the process of updating a bearer's information.

Pre-allocation of additional bearer resources already at VAL service communication establishment could be useful.\nThis subclause describes the procedure for network resource adaptation using PCC procedures. This procedure satisfies the requirements for requesting unicast resources and modification to already allocated unicast resources to VAL communications.\nFigure 14.3.3.3.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the network resource adaptation.\nThe figure depicts a network resource adaptation scenario, showing how the network adapts to changing network conditions. Key elements include the network's topology, the number of nodes, and the number of links. The figure illustrates the network's ability to adjust its resources to meet changing demands, such as increasing the number of links or adding new nodes. This adaptation is crucial for ensuring the network's reliability and performance.\nFigure 14.3.3.3.1.2-1: Network resource adaptation\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a network resource adaptation request to the NRM server for one or more users belonging to one or more VAL services, and may comprise one or more VAL UEs that will have updated resource requirement. This requirement may be in the form of exact resources /resource pools to be used or indication of bandwidth increase/decrease for the corresponding VAL UEs or set of VAL UEs.\n2.\tThe NRM server processes the request and applies / enforces the resource adaptation per VAL UE.\n3.\tThe NRM server retrieves UE IP address by using event monitoring capability for PDU session status (or PDN connectivity status) and initiates the PCC procedures for each VAL UE.\n4.\tThe NRM server provides a network resource adaptation response to the VAL server, providing information on the fulfilment of the network resource adaptation request. This will include information either per VAL UE or per set of VAL UEs, as indicated by the request of the VAL server in step 1.\nThe procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are requested at VAL service communication establishment. If concurrent sessions are used the NRM server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified for underlying network policy and charging functions. The request for resources includes application type, bandwidth, priority, application identifier and resource sharing information.\nThe procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires requests for network resources.\nProcedures in figure 14.3.3.3.2.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the requesting resource at session establishment.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe VAL client has requested VAL service communication with the VAL server.\nThe figure depicts a resource request at the VAL service communication establishment, illustrating the process of requesting resources from the network. The figure shows the various steps involved in the communication establishment, including the request, response, and the status of the request.\nFigure 14.3.3.3.2.2-1: Resource request at VAL service communication establishment\n1.\tThe VAL server sends request for resources to the NRM server.\n2.\tThe NRM server evaluates the need for network resources and use of resource sharing.\n3.\tThe NRM server retrieves UE IP address by using event monitoring capability for PDU session status (or PDN connectivity status), and then PCC procedures are initiated from NRM server.\n4.\tThe NRM server sends a resource response to the VAL server.\n5.\tThe VAL service communication is established, and resources have been allocated.\nTo modify unicast resources, the NRM server shall send a resource modification request containing the parameters to be modified for the UE.\nPossible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:\n-\tModify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;\n-\tRelease and resume resources in-between VAL service communications; or\n-\tRelease and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the VAL service communications over multicast transmission\nProcedures in figure 14.3.3.3.3.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the modification of a unicast:\nPre-condition:\n-\tA VAL service communication is already in progress;\nThe figure depicts a Bearer modification request, which is a crucial step in the process of updating a bearer's information. This request is typically sent to the bearer's owner or the system administrator to update the bearer's information, such as the bearer's name, address, and other relevant details. The figure shows the process of sending the request, including the sender's information, the recipient's information, and the request's content. The figure also includes a diagram of the system's architecture, which helps to understand the flow of information and the roles of different components involved in the process.\nFigure 14.3.3.3.3.2-1: Bearer modification request\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a resource modification request to the NRM server.\n2a.\tThe NRM server decides to modify the parameters of a unicast bearer.\n2b.\tIf the media bearer modification is not required, the NRM server sends a resource modification response to the VAL server.\n3.\tPCC procedures are initiated from NRM server.\n4.\tThe NRM server sends a resource modification response to the VAL server.\n5.\tThe VAL service communication continues with the modified unicast resources.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the VAL service communication is transferred to multicast transmission, the unicast resources could be temporarily be released.\nNOTE 2:\tIf multiple VAL service communication streams are sent to the UE, additional bearer resources could be required during an established VAL service communication. Pre-allocation of additional bearer resources already at VAL service communication establishment could be useful.\nThis subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring subscription. This procedure satisfies the requirements for monitoring of unicast QoS for already allocated unicast resources to VAL communications.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.1.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring subscription.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe VAL UE has an established connection in the 5GS\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a QoS monitoring subscription, which is a crucial component of network management. It shows a subscription interface with various options for monitoring and managing QoS parameters, such as bandwidth, latency, and jitter. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing network administrators to easily configure and monitor their network's QoS performance.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.1.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring subscription\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring subscription request to the NRM server either in conjunction with a request for unicast network resources requiring QoS or when the unicast QoS connection is already established. The NRM server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the unicast QoS monitoring request for the requested target VAL UEs, VAL group ID, or VAL stream IDs.\nNOTE:\tIt is left for stage 3 to decide whether to combine the QoS monitoring subscription request with the request for unicast resources.\n2.\tThe NRM server interacts with the NEF to establish relevant QoS monitoring subscriptions. The NRM server uses the NEF procedures for the AFsessionWithQoS described in clause 5.2.6.9 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and the NEF procedures for the AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and in particular the UE Communication Analytics described in clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP TS 23.288 [34] and DN Performance Analytics described in clause 6.14 of 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]. Based on the input received from the VAL server in step 1, the NRM server determines the relevant NEF subscription procedures and the parameters for these subscriptions, such as the QoS parameters to be measured (e.g. packet delay, data rate, traffic volume), the frequency of reporting etc. For the frequency of reporting which can be event triggered, periodic, or when the PDU Session is released, the NRM server determines the following:\na)\tif the reporting frequency is event triggered:\ni)\tthe corresponding reporting threshold to each QoS parameter;\nii)\tminimum waiting time between subsequent reports;\nb)\tif the reporting frequency is periodic, the reporting period.\n3.\tThe NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring subscription response indicating the subscription status.\nThis subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring notification.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.2.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS monitoring notification event.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe VAL server has an active unicast QoS monitoring subscription with the NRM server\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for unicast QoS monitoring notification in a network. It illustrates the steps involved in notifying network operators of any issues with QoS, such as packet loss or delay, ensuring that network performance is maintained. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the sequence of actions and the communication between different components of the network, such as the network operator, the network monitoring system, and the network equipment. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different colors and symbols used in the flowchart. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the unicast QoS monitoring notification procedure in a network.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.2.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring notification procedure\n1.\tThe NRM server receives QoS monitoring data by means of notifications provided by the NEF. The NRM server coordinates and combines the information from the NEF notifications and determines whether to send a notification to the VAL server based on the VAL server subscription's frequency of reporting. For a VAL group or a list of VAL UEs, the NRM server aggregates QoS monitoring data for each UE belonging to the group or the list; for a VAL stream, the NRM server aggregates the QoS monitoring data for the stream. The NRM server stores the QoS monitoring data as needed for later retrieval.\n2.\tThe NRM server sends a unicast QoS monitoring notification including the measured QoS data to the VAL server. If the reporting termination criteria is met (e.g. number of reports reached, threshold reached), NRM server shall also terminate the subscription.\nThis subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.3.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe VAL server has an active unicast QoS monitoring subscription with the NRM server\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed process for unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination, including the steps taken by the subscriber to initiate the termination procedure.

The BTS is responsible for transmitting data to the UE, while the UE is responsible for receiving and processing the data. The NE is a device that collects and stores data for later analysis. The figure also shows the network topology, with the BTS at the top, the UE at the bottom, and the NE at the bottom right. The data is retrieved from the NE, which is connected to the BTS and UE. The figure is used to monitor unicast QoS, which is a type of QoS that is specific to a single user or device.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.4.2-1: Retrieval of unicast QoS monitoring data\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring data request to the NRM server specifying the details of the requested data and the time period of interest. The NRM server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the unicast QoS monitoring data request for the requested target VAL UEs, VAL group ID, or VAL stream IDs.\n2.\tThe NRM server determines if it has the requested data stored internally or whether it needs to interact with the NEF to fetch the data using the AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and in particular the UE Communication Analytics described in clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP TS 23.288 [34] and DN Performance Analytics described in clause 6.14 of 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]. The NRM server collects and processes the collected data to match the measurement data requirement provided in the VAL server request.\n3.\tThe NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring data response with the requested data or with a failure indication, and optionally the cause of the failure, in case the requested data is not available.\nThis subclause describes the high-level procedure to update unicast QoS monitoring subscription. This procedure updates the parameters to be monitored of an already existing unicast QoS monitoring subscription.\nFigure 14.3.3.4.5.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring subscription update.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe VAL UE has an established connection in the 5GS\n-\tUnicast QoS monitoring subscription has successfully been invoked established for the VAL UE\n\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a QoS monitoring subscription update process in a network.

When a user originates a request for a VAL service group communication session for one of these areas, the pre-established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL VAL service communication.\nThe following steps need to be performed prior to the start of the VAL service group communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:\n-\tPre-establish MBMS bearer(s)\n-\tAnnounce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM clients\nWhen these preparation steps have been done the VAL service group communication session using MBMS bearer can start.\nThe vertical application level communications are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the application level control messages, due to different bearer characteristic requirements.\nThe procedure figure 14.3.4.2.2-1 shows only one of the receiving VAL clients using an MBMS bearer. There might also be VAL clients in the same VAL service group communication session that receive the communication on unicast bearers.\nThe figure depicts a network setup with multiple MBMS bearers, each equipped with a unique identifier. These bearers are used to establish a re-established connection, ensuring reliable communication in the event of a failure. The figure illustrates the use of MBMS bearers in a network, highlighting their importance in maintaining communication continuity.\nFigure 14.3.4.2.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a MBMS bearers request to the NRM server including service description(s) for which the MBMS bearers are requested.\n2a.\tThe NRM server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer in EPS is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. This bearer will be used for the VAL service communication. If local MBMS is requested in step 1, the NRM server uses the local MBMS information provided by VAL server in step 1 or the local MBMS information configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31].\n2b.\tOptionally, the NRM server may also activate an MBMS bearer dedicated for application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. If local MBMS is requested in step 1, the NRM server uses the local MBMS information provided by VAL server in step 1 or the local MBMS information configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31].\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is implementation specific.\n3a.\tThe NRM server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service description associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service description.\n3b.\tThe NRM server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service description associated with the application control MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service description.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 3a and step 3b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement message.\n4.\tThe NRM client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The NRM service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the VAL UE. The NRM client shares the MBMS bearer related information with the VAL client.\n5.\tThe NRM client that enters or is in the service area of at least one announced TMGI indicates to the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to receive VAL service communication over MBMS, whereby the NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for VAL service communication sessions based on available information at the NRM server including the MBMS listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 5 is optional for the VAL UE on subsequent MBMS bearer announcements.\n6.\tThe NRM server provides a MBMS bearers response to the VAL server.\n7.\tA VAL service group communication session is established.\n8.\tAs the VAL server transmits the VAL service communication over the MBMS bearer, the VAL service communication packets are detected and delivered to the VAL client.\nIn this scenario, the VAL server uses a unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the DL at the start of the group communication session. When the VAL server triggers to use an MBMS bearer in EPS for the DL VAL service communication, the NRM server decides to establish an MBMS bearer in EPS using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. The NRM server provides MBMS service description information associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL VAL service and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL VAL service communication.\nFigure 14.3.4.3.2-1 illustrates the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment.\nThe figure depicts a dynamic MBMS bearer establishment, illustrating the process of establishing a bearer in a dynamic network environment. The figure shows the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment, which is a key component in ensuring network reliability and performance. The figure includes various elements such as the MBMS bearer, the network, and the user equipment (UE), highlighting the importance of this process in modern telecommunications.\nFigure 14.3.4.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment\n1.\tA VAL service group communication session is established.\n2.\tThe downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.\n3.\tThe VAL server sends MBMS bearers request to the NRM server.\n4.\tThe NRM server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the VAL service group communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from the BM-SC. If local MBMS is requested in step 3, the NRM server uses the local MBMS information provided by VAL server in step 3 or the local MBMS information configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31].\n5.\tThe NRM server provides service description information associated with the MBMS bearer to the UE. The VAL UE obtains the TMGI from the announcement message. This message may be sent on an application level control signalling bearer.\n6.\tThe VAL UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI, while in the service area associated with the TMGI.\n7.\tThe VAL UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated with the TMGI.\n8.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server the MBMS listening status associated to the monitored TMGI, (e.g. that it is successfully receiving the TMGI). The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of the TMGI. The NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for VAL service communication sessions based on available information at the NRM server including the MBMS listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5.\n9.\tThe NRM server provides an MBMS bearer response to the VAL server with the dynamic MBMS bearer(s) information. The VAL server stops sending VAL service communication data over unicast way to the VAL client.\nNOTE:\tThe MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make an efficient decision to switch again to a unicast transmission or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).\n10.\tA VAL service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is established.\n11.\tThe VAL server sends the downlink VAL service communication for the VAL service group communication session over the MBMS.\nThe MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer. Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive way of doing announcement. The NRM server will send the MBMS bearer announcement message to the NRM client regardless if there is an MBMS bearer active or the VAL client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it gives a secure way to inform the NRM client about the MBMS bearer and how to retrieve the data on the MBMS bearer.\nWhen there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for VAL service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for additional MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application level control signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.\nThe MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting compared to an MBMS bearer used for VAL service communication, since application signalling messages are more sensitive to packet loss.\nFigure 14.3.4.4.2-1 illustrates a procedure that enables the NRM server to announce a new MBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn MBMS bearer used for VAL service application control messages must have been pre-established and announced to the NRM client.\n2.\tAdditional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the NRM client.\nThe figure depicts a bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for application control messages, illustrating the communication between the MBMS bearer and the application control message.\nFigure 14.3.4.4.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for application control messages\n1.\tThe NRM client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for VAL service application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.\n2.\tThe NRM server activates a new MBMS bearer.\n3.\tThe NRM server announces the MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The bearer may have just been activated or may have already been running for some time. The step may be repeated as needed.\n4.\tThe NRM server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer used for VAL application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement contains the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally include additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and optional MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In this case the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer details.\n5.\tThe NRM client start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.\n6.\tIf requested by the NRM server, the NRM client sends an acknowledgement of the MBMS bearer to the NRM server.\n7.\tThe NRM server de-announce the MBMS bearer.\n8.\tThe NRM server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that contains the identity of the MBMS bearer.\n9.\tThe NRM client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.\nThe same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.\nThe NRM client and NRM server use this procedure to report and take action on the MBMS bearer quality towards VAL service communications. A NRM client monitors an MBMS bearer to enable receiving VAL service communication. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality), the NRM client needs to inform the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality, the NRM client may notify the NRM server at which MBMS reception quality level it has received the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer.\nThe issue can be more complex since the NRM client needs to estimate the quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently transmitted on the MBMS bearer. The reason for this is that an NRM client that has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even notice that a VAL service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the NRM server still assumes that the VAL UE can receive the VAL service communication being broadcasted.\nTo estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g. RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.\nBased on the MBMS bearer quality reported from the NRM clients, the NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer for a group communication if a certain number of NRM clients located in the MBMS service area are able to receive the VAL service communication. And if a NRM client is not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer, the NRM server may decide to switch the user plane deliver mode for the NRM client from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer.\nThe NRM client shall indicate the ability of the NRM client to receive the MBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThere is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is announced to the NRM client\n2.\tThe NRM client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area\n3.\tThe VAL UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the modulation and coding scheme\n4.\tThe VAL UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer quality detection system, which is a crucial component in ensuring the quality of communication between the sender and receiver. The system uses a combination of hardware and software to detect and analyze the quality of the MBMS bearer signal. This is important for ensuring reliable communication in various network scenarios.\nFigure 14.3.4.5.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection\n1.\tThe NRM client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be reported to the NRM server. The NRM client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the NRM server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The NRM client may also map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality level the VAL service communication has been received.\nEditor's note:\tThe set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the NRM client sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been acceptable or not to receive a specific VAL service communication. If the MBMS bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the NRM client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception quality level. Based on the MBMS listening status, if MBMS reception quality level is received, then the NRM server may efficiently decide to switch to another bearer (e.g., MBMS bearer or unicast bearer) or to take measures to prepare such a switch and further notify the VAL server.\nNOTE 2:\tPrior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer of the communication to unicast.\nNOTE 3:\tThe threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on VAL service type (i.e. V2X, MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.\n3.\tThe NRM server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g. information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS bearer announcement message.\n4.\tThe NRM server may send user plane delivery mode to VAL server based on the MBMS listening status to preserve the service continuity as described in clause 14.3.4.6 and clause 14.3.4.9.\nThis subclause specifies service continuity scenarios when MBMS bearers are used. There are different solutions for different scenarios.\nThe service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a larger area. In VAL communications several VAL service communication streams may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one VAL service communication stream may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. A VAL UE that is interested in receiving a VAL service communication stream that is broadcasted in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2.\nThe figure depicts two MBMS bearers using overlapping MBSFN areas, illustrating the use of multiple frequency bands and the potential for increased spectral efficiency.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-2 illustrates the procedure:\nThe figure depicts a service continuity scenario when moving from one MBSFN (Multi-Building Service Facade Node) to another. It illustrates the various paths that a service can take, including the use of MBSFNs, MBSFNs, and MBSFNs, to ensure that the service is available to the end user.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another\n1.\tThe VAL UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional MBMS bearers that the NRM client is interested in are active in the current cell.\n2a.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 1. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.\n2b.\tThe NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\nNOTE:\tThe MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer, or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).\n3.\tThe VAL UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast the same service on both TMGIs.\n4.\tThe NRM client sends a location information report to the NRM server. For that, the UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block (SIB) transmitted by the radio cells.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends to the NRM client a MBMS bearer announcement with information related to TMGI 2 (if the NRM server had not done it before). Hence, the NRM client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same VAL service communication.\n6a.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server that it is successfully receiving TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level per TMGI.\n6b.\tThe NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n7.\tThe VAL UE may receive the VAL service communication over both MBMS bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The VAL UE may also verify that it is the same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to perform error corrections.\n8.\tThe VAL UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is active.\n9a.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.\n9b.\tThe NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n10.\tThe VAL UE receives the VAL service communication only over TMGI 2.\nThis service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may occur if the VAL UE would request to transfer the VAL service communication stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still required that the NRM client sends a location report (and MBMS listening report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the MBMS listening report by the NRM client to the NRM server a unicast bearer is needed. The location report from the NRM client is required, since the NRM server must know that the VAL UE has entered a new area and can only listen to MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the VAL server might send a VAL service communication stream that the VAL UE is required to listen to on the MBMS bearer 1, since the NRM server still assumes that the VAL:UE is located in the MBSFN area 1.\nThe solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 14.3.4.6.2-3. In this case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS bearers are used only for VAL service communication. An application level signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is used for application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS bearer TMGI 9. By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9) the VAL UEs can receive application control messages for all VAL service communication going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A VAL UE that is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a VAL service group transmission (e.g. V2X) only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that specific VAL service communication over a unicast instead. Without the information received over TMGI 9 the NRM client must immediately report that the VAL UE has left the broadcast area that the NRM server assumes that the VAL UE is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for the NRM client to inform the NRM server of a location change.\nThe figure depicts two MBMS bearers using overlapping MBSFN areas, with a separate application signalling bearer. The overlapping MBSFN areas allow for efficient use of the available spectrum, while the separate application bearer ensures that the application signals are not interfered with by the MBMS bearers.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a separate application signalling bearer\nThe procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in this subclause. However, in this scenario the NRM client is not required to initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report). The VAL UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area (i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all application control messages for all VAL service communications ongoing in both areas. If the VAL UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that does not transmit the VAL service communication of interest the VAL UE can report to the NRM server that it is not able to listen to the VAL service communication over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the NRM server to switch to a unicast bearer instead.\nIn this procedure the NRM client is requested by the NRM server to send a MBMS suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can be included in the MBMS bearer announcement and the NRM server may choose to only send this request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all NRM clients.\nFigure 14.3.4.7.2.-1 illustrates a procedure in which the NRM client notifies the NRM server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.\nThe NRM server can decide on a subset of all VAL UEs in the MBMS broadcast area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the NRM server makes the decision of the VAL UE subset, consideration shall be taken to the location of the VAL UEs, since VAL UEs' location is dynamically changed. This means that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be updated regularly based on the VAL UEs mobility.\nPre-condition:\n-\tIt is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer\nThe figure depicts a MBMS suspension notification system, showing the various components involved in the suspension process. The system includes a central controller, a network of MBMS nodes, and a communication network. The central controller manages the suspension process, while the MBMS nodes communicate with the controller to update the suspension status. The communication network connects the MBMS nodes to the central controller, ensuring the suspension process is carried out efficiently.\nFigure 14.3.4.7.2-1:\tMBMS suspension notification\n1.\tThe NRM server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to the NRM client.\nNOTE:\tThis message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.\n2.\tRAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].\n3.\tAn MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].\n4.\tThe NRM client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS suspension report.\n5.\tBased on the MBMS suspsension report received, the NRM server determines whether to switch to a new bearer (unicast or MBMS). If NRM server determines to switch to unicast bearer, then the NRM server sends the user plane delivery mode message to VAL server , and the VAL server sends the downlink data over the new bearer.\nThe NRM client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report shall still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). A NRM client shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS listening reports).\nThe same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that may be detected by the NRM client.\nThe NRM server is an instantiation of a GCS AS. For the NRM server to know the status of the MBMS bearer, and thus know the network's ability to deliver the VAL service, it is required that the network provides MBMS bearer event notifications to the NRM server. The different events notified to the NRM server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios.\nEditor's note:\tThe procedure defined in this sub clause requires an enhancement to GCSE and RAN and is therefore subject to implementation in EPC and RAN.\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4.8.2-1 shows notification information flows from NRM server to BM-SC.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer event notification, which is a crucial component of the MBMS (Multi-Band Massive MIMO) technology. The figure shows the MBMS bearer event notification process, including the MBMS bearer, the event notification, and the response from the MBMS system. This figure is crucial for understanding the MBMS technology and its role in enhancing communication systems.\nFigure 14.3.4.8.2-1: MBMS bearer event notification\n1.\tThe NRM server activates an MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].\n2.\tThe BMSC will respond to the activation with an Activate MBMS bearer response message, according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].\n3.\tThe EPC and RAN will initiate the MBMS session start procedure according to 3GPP TS 23.246 [17]. This procedure is outside the scope of this specification.\n4a.\tAt the first indication of a successful MBMS session start procedure, the BM-SC sends a MBMS bearer event notification, indicating that the MBMS bearer is ready to use.\n4b.\tThe NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n5.\tThe VAL server starts to use the MBMS bearer according to the MBMS procedures in this specification.\n6.\tAn event from RAN related to the MBMS session is received by the BM-SC.\n7a.\tThe BM-SC notifies the NRM server of certain MBMS related events including references to affected MBMS services areas or list of cells. Example of such events may be radio resources not available, overload, MBMS suspension.\n7b.\tThe NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n8.\tThe NRM server may decide, based on the received events, to switch to unicast transmission for relevant VAL UEs.\nNOTE:\tSteps 6-8 should be seen as example events from the network that may occur and possible actions taken by the NRM server. These steps may be done at any time and repeatedly during the life time of an MBMS bearer.\nThe NRM server monitors the bearers used for VAL service communications and decides to switch between MBMS and unicast bearers.\nFigure 14.3.4.9.2-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is about to move out of MBMS coverage or getting into good MBMS coverage by switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer.\nPre-condition:\n-\tIt is assumed that a bearer (unicast or MBMS) has been activated by the VAL server for downlink delivery.\nThe figure depicts a switch that allows for the delivery of multimedia broadcast messages (MBMS) over a network, with the ability to switch between unicast and multicast delivery modes. This switch is part of a larger network infrastructure, as indicated by the presence of other switches and routers. The switch's design is based on the principles of SDN, which allows for the efficient management and control of network resources.\nFigure 14.3.4.9.2-1: Switching between MBMS delivery and unicast delivery\n1.\tThe VAL UE detects changing MBMS bearer condition (good or bad MBMS coverage) for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is implementation specific.\n2.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server about the MBMS bearer condition for the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS listening status report.\nNOTE 1:\tTo efficiently notify the NRM server, e.g., when the NRM client detects that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services, the NRM client proactively may send to the NRM server a MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception quality level.\n3.\tThe NRM server makes the decision to switch between MBMS delivery and unicast delivery based on available information at the NRM server including the MBMS listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n4.\tThe VAL server sends the downlink data over the new bearer (unicast or MBMS) to the VAL client as per step 3.\nNOTE 2:\tThe new bearer (unicast or MBMS) may be set up on demand after step 3 or before.\n5.\tDuring the switching, the VAL client simultaneously receives downlink data through both bearers (unicast bearer and MBMS bearer). If there is no downlink data to the VAL client, this step can be skipped.\n6.\tThe VAL client ceases to receive the downlink data through previous bearer but continues receiving data through new bearer.\n",

Shared and individual delivery from the VAL server to multiple VAL users is supported either as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint over the radio. The MBS session which consist of one or multiple QoS flows for different service requirements are either broadcast or multicast type. For the broadcast MBS session or local MBS session, the MBS service area is configured with the MBS session.\nNOTE 1:\tSupport of MBS and specific session types is an implementation choice.\nWithin this arrangement, the VAL server decides whether to create broadcast or multicast MBS sessions to be associated with certain VAL service groups or area. The 5GC adaptively decides whether to deliver the MBS traffic from the MB-UPF in the form of shared delivery or individual delivery, where the latter is applicable to multicast MBS sessions. The NG-RAN decides to utilize point-to-point or point-to-multipoint delivery methods applicable for shared delivery only. MBS provides reliability enhancements and minimizes loss of information, e.g., due to mobility and handover.\nMBS group scheduling mechanism enables simultaneous reception of MBS and unicast user traffic by the VAL UEs. The UEs can receive broadcast MBS sessions irrespective of their RRC state (i.e., connected, inactive or idle) and multicast sessions only in RRC-CONNECTED state.\nThe following capabilities (non-exhaustive list) provided by MBS could be used by NRM server:\n-\tMBS session creation;\n-\tMBS session update;\n-\tMBS session release;\n-\tMBS session ID allocation;\n-\tDynamic PCC control for MBS session.\nThe first phase to utilize MBS sessions for VAL media transmission is to reserve the network resource by creating a MBS sessions. The MBS session creation is initiated by the VAL server towards the NRM server, and the NRM server further interacts with the 5GS to complete the whole process. The UE’s capabilities and service related information e.g., UE’s MBS capabilities, location, MBS listening status report, UE session join notification sent by group members are considered when deciding to create or use MBS sessions. During the interaction with NRM server, the necessary information related to the requested session is determined, e.g., MBS session mode (either a broadcast or a multicast session) and the required service profile. This interaction between the NRM server and the 5GS depends on the configuration option under consideration, i.e., whether the NRM server is in trusted domain (limited operations), and whether the session creation is done with or without a dynamic PCC rule.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation specific whether the VAL server decides to use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation specific whether the VAL decides to create (one or multiple) MBS sessions for VAL media for VAL group communications associated to a certain VAL group or create (one or multiple) dynamic MBS sessions once the need has emerged, e.g., dynamic MBS sessions to be associated for an ad hoc group.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is implementation specific whether an MBS session is associated to one or multiple VAL service groups, and whether it is re-assigned to other VAL service groups.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the NRM server uses the UE’s capabilities and service related information in order to create and use the MBS session is implementation specific.\nThe information elements describing the MBS session under consideration is then sent to the NRM clients via MBS session announcement, where the latter need to react according to the announced session mode.\nIf eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist for VAL services, the NRM service server may decide to trigger the establishment of an eMBMS bearer to deliver the VAL media associated to the VAL service group communications, if the target VAL service group(s) consists of members with MBMS capable RAT. As a result, the NRM server subsequently needs to send an eMBMS bearer announcement towards the clients camping on LTE.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is implementation specific whether the NRM server triggers an eMBMS bearer or a unicast bearer to serve VAL clients camping on LTE.\n\n\nThe procedures in this clause describe how MBS session creation and MBS session announcement can be used for the transmission of VAL service group communication data over either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions. The MBS session can either be created with or without dynamic PCC rule, where the latter requires less interaction done by the NRM server towards the 5GC (either directly or via NEF).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe NRM server has decided to use an MBS session for VAL service group communications associated to a certain VAL servive group based on transport only mode.\n-\tThe NRM server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either directly or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tNRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS service server with or without dynamic PCC rule.\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a MBS session, highlighting the use of pre-created sessions for efficient network management.\nFigure 14.3.4A.1.2-1: Use of pre-created MBS session.\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a multicast/broadcast resource request towards the NRM server including the VAL server identity, service description(s), multicast resource type (e.g,. multicast type or broadcast type), service announcement mode (i.e., service announcement is sent by NRM or the VAL itself), Endpoint of the VAL server.\n2.\tThe NRM server initiates an MBS session creation procedure towards the 5GC as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The procedure starts once the NRM server initiates a TMGI allocation request (either directly to MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF). Upon the reception of the TMGI allocation response, the NRM server sends an MBS session creation request, including further information related to the MBS session, e.g., MBS session ID, MBS session mode and the QoS requirements if dynamic PCC rule is not considered. However, if dynamic PCC rule is considered, the NRM server defines these requirements at a later step, namely it sends an MBS authorization/policy create request towards PCF (either directly or to the NEF) indicating the QoS requirements.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the NRM server may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in clause 14.3.4 (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by the VAL service group members in the VAL service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the NRM server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF.\n3.\tThe NRM server provides the NRM clients of the VAL service group X with the information related to the created MBS session via the MBS session announcement. The MBS session announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type) and SDP information related to the MBS session under consideration.\nNOTE 3:\tThe NRM server may send an MBS session announcement at an earlier step during the MBS session creation procedure towards the NRM clients once the VAL service group associated to the MBS session is known.\nOptionally, the NRM server includes the information elements related to the established eMBMS bearer, as indicated in table 7.3.2.2-1. The NRM clients which camp on LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related to the eMBMS bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\n4.\tNRM clients store and process the received MBS session information.\n5.\tNRM clients may provide an MBS session announcement acknowledgment to the NRM server to indicate the reception of the corresponding MBS session announcement.\n6.\tBased on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the following actions take place;\n6a.\tFor multicast MBS sessions, NRM clients initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the session is in an active state. The established session can either be in active or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The NRM clients sends a UE session join notification towards the server as indicated in the MBS session announcement. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, NRM clients report the monitoring state (i.e. the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server; or\n6b.\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, if the NRM client is accessing over 5G, the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39], and the network resources are reserved both in 5GC and NG-RAN. The NRM clients start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, NRM clients report the monitoring state (i.e. the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server.\nNOTE 4:\t\tIt is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.\n7.\tThe NRM clients provide a listening status notification related to the announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS listening status report.\n8.\tThe NRM server provides a multicast/broadcast resource response to the VAL server.\n9.\tAn VAL service group communication setup takes place and uses the pre-created MBS session for this group communication packet DL delivery.\nIn this scenario, the VAL service group communication is already taken place and a unicast PDU session is utilized for  DL transmission. When the NRM server decides to use an MBS session for the transmission under consideration, the NRM server interacts with 5GC to reserve the necessary network resources.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NRM server logic for determining when to create a dynamic MBS session is implementation specific.\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.2.3-1 shows one NRM client receiving the DL media. There might also be NRM clients in the same VAL service group communication session that receive the communication on a PDU session.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM client is attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to a certain VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS session with or without dynamic PCC rule.\n-\tThe NRM server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either directly or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tNo MBS session exists, or the existing multicast MBS session fails to satisfy the QoS requirements.\nThe figure depicts a dynamic MBS session, illustrating the use of dynamic MBS sessions in a network. The figure shows a network with multiple MBSs, each with its own set of parameters and parameters for the session. The session is designed to adapt to the network conditions, ensuring that the network remains stable and efficient.\nFigure 14.3.4A.2.3-1: Use of dynamic MBS session.\n1.\tAn VAL service group communication session is established and the DL media packet is delivered to the VAL client via unicast.\n2.\tThe VAL server sends a multicast/broadcast resource request towards the NRM server including the VAL server identity, service description(s), multicast resource type (e.g,. multicast type or broadcast type), service announcement mode (i.e., service announcement is sent by NRM or the VAL itself), Endpoint of the VAL server.\n3.\tThe NRM server decides to create an MBS session. The MBS session creation procedure takes place as described in clause 14.3.4A.1.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the NRM server may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by the affiliated members in the VAL service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the NRM server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF.\n4.\tThe NRM server provides the NRM client with the information related to the created MBS session via an MBS session announcement. As described in table 7.3.2.2-1, the session announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type), and SDP information related to the MBS session.\nOptionally, the NRM server includes the information elements related to the established eMBMS bearer once the NRM server has determined the need, as indicated in table 7.3.2.2-1. The NRM clients which camp on LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related to the eMBMS bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\n5.\tThe NRM client stores the MBS session ID and other associated information.\n6.\tThe NRM client may send an MBS session announcement ack back to the NRM server.\n7.\tBased on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the following actions take place:\n7a.\tFor multicast MBS sessions, NRM client initiates a UE session join request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the session is in active state. The established session can either be in active or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The NRM client sends a UE session join notification towards the server as indicated in the MBS session announcement. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, NRM clients report the monitoring state (i.e. the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server; or\n7b.\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, if the NRM client is accessing over 5G, the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39], and the network resources are reserved both in 5GC and NG-RAN. The NRM clients start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, NRM clients report the monitoring state (i.e. the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server.\nNOTE 4:\t\tIt is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signaling such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.\n8.\tThe NRM clients provide a listening status notification related to the announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS listening status report.\n9.\tThe NRM server provides a multicast/broadcast resource response to the VAL server.\n10.\tAn VAL service group communication via dynamic MBS session is established. The VAL server sends the downlink packet for the VAL service group communication session over the MBS session.\nThe VAL server can create one or several MBS sessions via the NRM server, based on certain service requirements, a certain service area, or the activity status of multicast MBS sessions. However, during the life cycle of the MBS sessions, the VAL server may need to trigger the update of the sessions via the NRM server to meet emerging needs, including the service requirements, service area related parameters.\nThe procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.3.2-1 presents an MBS session update procedure triggered by the VAL server via the NRM server (either directly interacting with the MB-SMF, or indirectly with NEF/MBSF). Within the update request, either the service requirements, MBS service area, activity status of multicast MBS session, or all three are done, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same active VAL service group.\n-\tThe NRM server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.\n-\tThe MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced to be associated with the VAL service group for group communication purposes.\nThe figure depicts a MBS session update without dynamic PCC, illustrating the process of updating the session information in a mobile broadband system. The figure shows the MBS session update process, including the update of the session ID, the update of the session information, and the update of the session status. The figure also includes a visual representation of the update process, such as the update of the session ID and the update of the session information.\nFigure 14.3.4A.3.2-1: MBS session update without dynamic PCC\n1.\tAn MBS session is established as described in in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39] (either a multicast or a broadcast session), and associated with a certain active VAL service group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS session, the NRM clients have already joined the session.\n2.\tThe VAL server invoke the multicast resource update request to the NRM server once the need has emerged to modify some aspects for the given MBS session under consideration. The updated parameters are included, e.g., service requirements, service area or both. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the VAL server may as well include the status (active or inactive) of the multicast MBS session to be set.\n3.\tThe NRM server performs an MBS session update procedure with the 5GC as described in 3GPP 23.247 [39]. Based on the needed requirements, the corresponding MBS session is accordingly modified at the 5GS. The update may lead to QoS Flow(s) addition, modification, or removal. The NRM server receives an MBS session update response once the requested modifications are performed, and the indicated MBS session is updated accordingly.\n4.\tThe NRM server may initiate a session announcement towards the NRM clients associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the updated information, if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the configured MBS session providing the required information to receive the media related to the established VAL service group communication.\n6.\tThe NRM clients process the received information over the MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated VAL media over the specific MBS session stream.\n7.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast resource update resonse to the VAL server.\n8.\tVAL client 1 sends media to the VAL server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n9.\tThe VAL server distributes the VAL media to the VAL clients 2 to n over the indicated streams.\nThe procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.3.3-1 presents an MBS session update procedure triggered by the NRM server to the 5GC, either directly or via NEF/MBSF. Based on the required updates to be done, the NRM server needs to interact with the MB-SMF to update the MBS service area and multicast activity status, with the PCF to update the required QoS requirements, or sequentially both to update all the above, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same active VAL service group.\n-\tThe NRM server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.\n-\tThe MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced to be associated with the VAL service group for group communication purposes.\nThe figure depicts a session update process in a mobile broadband service (MBS) with dynamic power control (PCC) enabled. The MBS session is shown in a 3D view, with the PCC process highlighted in red. The process involves the MBS sending a session update to the PCC, which then updates the session parameters. The figure illustrates the process in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the details of the session update process.\nFigure 14.3.4A.3.3-1: MBS session update with dynamic PCC\n1.\tAn MBS session is established as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [29] (either a multicast or a broadcast session), and associated with a certain active VAL service group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS session, the NRM clients have already joined the session.\n2.\tThe VAL server invoke the multicast resource update request to the NRM server once the need has emerged to modify some aspects for the given MBS session under consideration. The updated parameters are included, e.g., service requirements, service area or both.\nNOTE 1:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n3.\tThe NRM server, based on the update requirements from step 2, perform the MBS session update with PCC procedure towards the 5GS as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [29].\n4.\tThe NRM server may initiate a session announcement towards the NRM clients associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the updated information if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session providing the required information to receive the media related to the established VAL service group communication.\n6.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast resource update resonse to the VAL server.\n7.\tThe NRM clients process the received information over the MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated VAL media over the specific MBS session stream.\n8.\tVAL client 1 sends media to the VAL server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n9.\tThe VAL server distributes the VAL media to the VAL clients 2 to n over the indicated streams.\nThe VAL server can decide to release a certain MBS session once it is no longer further utilized for the associated VAL service group communication, e.g., the VAL service group is no longer active, the VAL media transmission is over and no further VAL media to be delivered, group communication is terminated. The MBS session deletion procedure leads to releasing the network resources associated to that MBS session.\nNOTE:\tIt is up to implementation of VALserver to decide whether to release the MBS session or re-use it for subsequent group operations.\nTo delete the MBS session, the VAL server invokes the multicast/broadcast resource release service of NRM server which further triggers the NRM server to send an MBS session deletion request to the 5GS providing the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion request is sent to the MB-SMF (directly or via NEF/MBSF) when PCC is not used. However, if dynamic PCC rule is utilized, a policy authorization deletion request is initially sent to the PCF. Further details of the MBS session deletion are provided in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\nNRM server further informs the NRM client with the MBS session de-announcement, so that the VAL UE stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session or leaves the multicast MBS session. This procedure is applied for both broadcast MBS session and multicast MBS session.\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.4.2-1 describes the MBS session deletion aspects for group communication.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same active VAL service group.\n-\tAn MBS session is configured to address the corresponding VAL service group with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The session is announced and established for group communication purposes for the VAL service group.\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the MBS session deletion procedure, which is a crucial step in the network management process. It shows the steps involved in deleting a session from a MBS (Mobile Backhaul System) to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the network resources. The figure includes a flowchart, which visually represents the sequence of actions, and a list of steps, providing a clear and concise overview of the procedure.\nFigure 14.3.4A.4.2-1: MBS session deletion procedure.\n1.\tThe VAL server decides to delete the MBS session for the associated VAL group communication, either multicast or broadcast session.\n2.\tThe VAL server invokes the multicast/broadcast resource release service of the NRM server by sending the multicast/broadcast resource release request.\n3.\tUpon receiving the multicast/broadcast resource release request, the NRM server sends an MBS session de-announcement message with the MBS session ID towards the NRM client(s). Upon receiving the MBS session de-announcement message, either 4a or 4b is performed.\n4a.\tIf the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a broadcast MBS session, the UE(s) stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session and removes the broadcast MBS session related information.\n4b.\tIf the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a multicast MBS session, the joined UE(s) initiate an MBS session leave procedure to leave the indicated MBS session in order to release the respective network resources, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\n5. Subsequently, the NRM clients may send an MBS session de-announcement acknowledgement message to the NRM server indicating the status of MBS session.\n6.\tThe NRM server initiates the MBS session deletion procedure with the 5GC (either directly or through NEF/MBSF) in order to stop using the configured MBS session and release the corresponding network resources. The NRM server indicates within the MBS session release request the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion procedure can either be with or without a dynamic PCC rule, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\n7.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast/broadcast resource release response to the VAL server indicating the result.\nIn case of multicast MBS sessions, the members affiliated to a certain VAL service group need to initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC in order to receive the VAL media sent via the associated MBS session. The UE session join request enables the reservation of NG-RAN resources for the members of the VAL group. However, it is not necessary that the VAL media is delivered over the whole time the multicast MBS session is associated to the group under consideration. Therefore, the VAL server is able to efficiently utilize and control the reservation of radio resources based on the availability of VAL data to be delivered via the activation and de-activation procedure with NRM server. This presents more flexibility and efficient use of resources different from LTE.\nThe most suitable scenario to activate/de-activate a certain multicast MBS session is based on whether there is a VAL group communication, taking place over that associated session to the VAL service group. In this manner, the VAL server can activate the associated multicast session once a VAL group communication takes place, then deactivate it once the VAL group communication is over. Whether the multicast session is activated (i.e., in an active state), or de-activated (in an inactive state), the VAL group is associated to the multicast session and its members are within a UE session join.\nThe activation or de-activation request is initiated by the VAL server towards the NRM server which further interacts either directly with the MB-SMF or indirectly with NEF/MBSF.\nNOTE:\tThe activation of de-activation procedure may also be triggered by MB-SMF based on receiving notification from MB-UPF based on the availability of VAL data to be transmitted.\nThe procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.5.2-1 presents the multicast MBS session activation procedure initiated by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tThe multicast MBS session for NRM group communications associated to VAL service group X.\n-\tThe MBS session is created and announced to address VAL group communication related to the associated VAL service group X with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain service area.\n\n\nThe figure depicts the multicast MBS session activation procedure, illustrating the steps involved in initiating a multicast session on a wireless network. The figure shows the network interface card (NIC) and the associated hardware components, such as the network interface controller (NIC) and the network management system (NMS). The figure also includes the multicast MBS session activation procedure, which involves configuring the network settings and initiating the session. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the process, making it easy to understand the steps involved in initiating a multicast session on a wireless network.\nFigure 14.3.4A.5.2-1: Multicast MBS session activation procedure.\n1.\tThe multicast MBS session is established as the first UE session join request, which is initiated by the first VAL UE towards 5GC, is granted. At this stage, the multicast MBS session is established with an inactive state.\n2.\tThe VAL server decides to activate the multicast MBS session as VAL data is needed to be transmitted over the session to the VAL service group X, as a VAL group communication is to take place over the associated MBS session.\n3.\tThe VAL server invokes the multicast resource activation request provided by NRM server, the MBS session ID is included.\n4.\tUpon receiving the request in step 3, the NRM server sends an MBS session activation request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the TMGI to be activated.\n5.\tThe 5GC changes the session status to \"active\" and finds the list of joined VAL UEs associated with the session and activates the NG- RAN resources for VAL data delivery.\n6.\tThe 5GC may send an MBS session activation response to the NRM server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been activated.\n7.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast resource activation response to the VAL server.\nThe procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.5.3-1 presents the multicast MBS session activation procedure initiated by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tA multicast MBS session is created and announced to address the corresponding VAL service group with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain multicast service area.\n-\tThe VAL UE have already joined the multicast MBS session and are able to receive the VAL data over the associated MBS session.\nThe figure depicts a multicast MBS session deactivation procedure, illustrating the steps involved in terminating a multicast session. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the sequence of actions to be taken, and a list of steps, providing a clear and concise visual representation of the procedure.\nFigure 14.3.4A.5.3-1: Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure.\n1.\tThe group communication associated with VAL service group X takes place, and the corresponding VAL data is delivered over the associated multicast MBS session, hence the MBS session has an active state.\n2.\tThe VAL server decides to deactivate the multicast MBS session, as no further VAL data to be delivered to the associated group, or the VAL group communication is over, and no further VAL media is to be delivered.\n3.\tThe VAL server invokes the multicast resource deactivation request provided by NRM server, the MBS session ID is included.\n4.\tUpon receiving the request in step 3, the NRM server sends an MBS session deactivation request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the TMGI to be deactivated.\n4.\tThe 5GC changes the session state to \"inactive\" and deactivates the radio resources associated with the joined VAL UEs.\n5.\tThe 5GC may send an MBS deactivation response to the server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been inactivated.\n7.\tThe NRM server may return the multicast resource deactivation response to the VAL server.\nThe VAL server can decide to configure an MBS session per VAL service group to transmit the media related to the corresponding VAL group communications. Such group communications can comprise different service requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the NRM server. For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a group communication can comprise different QoS requirements. Also, different type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g., emergency group communication should be handled with a higher priority than normal group communication.\nThe configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g., different ports) within an MBS session.\nThe established multicast MBS session can either be in active or inactive state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence transmitting the VAL media to the associated VAL service group, and the latter indicates their deactivation as no VAL media is being transmitted. The VAL server may initiate the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the VAL service group is established and active, as well as once the VAL media is available for transmission. For this purpose, the VAL server sends a multicast MBS session activation request towards the NRM indicating the MBS session ID to be activated, and the NRM server further interacts with the 5GS to complete the MBS session activation.\nSimilar to the use of eMBMS, the NRM server shall provide the associated information between a specific group communication and the stream to be used within an MBS session to the UE. This information could be sent in advance in an MBS session announcement or could be provided on demand in an additional signalling message for the MBS session, e.g., MapGroupToSessionStream (similar to the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS).\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.6.2-1 describes how media related to a specific group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session which consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service requirements. The procedure is applicable for both the pre-created MBS session case as described in 14.3.4A.2.2 and the dynamic MBS session case as described in 14.3.4A.2.3. For simplicity, the figure 14.3.4A.6.2-1 shows that the MBS session is pre-created prior to the group communication establishment.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tVAL UE 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe VAL server has decided to use an MBS session for VAL service group communications associated to VAL service group X.\nThe figure depicts a media transmission over MBS sessions in a VAL service group, illustrating the various media types and their respective paths.\nFigure 14.3.4A.6.2-1: VAL service group media transmission over MBS sessions\n1.\tThe VAL server creates a multicast or a broadcast MBS session targeting group communications associated to VAL service group X via the NRM server, as being specified in clause 14.3.4A.2. Therefore, the VAL server can provide default service requirements to be addressed by the MBS session.\nThe MBS session is announced by NRM server and received by NRM client 2 to n. The NRM server has identified that VAL UE 2 to n can receive media over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from NRM clients indicating the successful join of the multicast MBS session or a monitoring report of the broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening status report used for MBMS).\n2.\tA new VAL group communication is established for the VAL service group X consisting of a specific required service requirements, e.g. a VAL service emergency group communication. The group communication setup can be done over unicast.\n2a. For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\n2b. For multicast MBS session, the session is established upon the acceptance of the first UE session join request initiated from the VAL UE towards the 5GS, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The multicast session can then have either an active or an inactive state.\n3. \tThe VAL server may initiate the multicast MBS activation towards the NRM as described in clause 14.3.4A.5 in order to activate the multicast MBS session in case the session has an inactive state.\n4.\tConsidering that the established group communication requires a specific QoS, e.g. an VALemergency group communication which requires higher priority (i.e. better ARP), the VAL server initiates an MBS session update to the NRM to provide the new required service requirements, if not done during the MBS session creation in step 1, as described in clause 14.3.4A.2. The MBS session should then be updated and an additional QoS flow may be configured.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to NRM clients 2 to n over the configured MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the specific established VAL group communication within the MBS session.\n6.\tNRM clients process the MapGroupToSessionStream information to receive the related media over the specific MBS session stream.\n7.\tThe NRM server sends the user plane delivery mode message to the VAL server to instruct the VAL server to switch to MBS delivery.\n8.\tVAL client 1 sends media to the VAL server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n9.\tThe VAL server distributes the media to VAL clients 2 to n over the indicated stream within the established MBS session.\nNOTE:\tThe VAL server can stop the unicast delivery (if ongoing) towards the VAL clients considering the UE session join notification or the MBS listening status report.\n10.\tThe VAL server may initiate the multicast MBS session deactivation towards the NRM as described in clause 14.3.4A.5, in order to deactivate the multicast MBS session.\n11.\tThe NRM server may further trigger the UE to leave multicast MBS session.\nThe VAL server may use an 5G MBS session for application level control signalling. An 5G MBS session for application level control signalling is typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for using 5G for resource efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance (KPIs), handling of high load scenarios.\nSimilar to the usage of eMBMS, both broadcast and multicast 5MBS session for application level control signalling may be used to transmit the following messages, for example:\n-\tMBS session announcement for media sessions\n-\tGroup application paging\n-\tGroup dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)\n5G MBS session for application level control signalling is created in a service area that is larger than the estimated service for media MBS session. The service area for the media sessions is mainly based on counting of group members in each defined service area. The MBS session for application level control signalling is also created with a QoS that is better than MBS media session since the packet loss requirements are much stricter.\nThe NRM client shall not send responses to group-addressed application level control signalling unless instructed or configured to respond.\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.7.2-1 shows only one of the receiving VAL UE using a 5G MBS session.\nThe figure depicts a 5G MBS (Multi-Access Edge Computing) network, illustrating the use of 5G MBS for application-level control signalling. The network is designed to support various applications, including IoT, smart city, and industrial automation, by providing efficient and reliable control signals. The figure highlights the importance of 5G MBS in enabling seamless communication and control between devices, ensuring a high-quality user experience.\nFigure 14.3.4A.7.2-1: Use of 5G MBS for application-level control signalling\n1.\tThe VAL server determines to create MBS session for application-level control signalling, the VAL server initiated the 5G MBS session establishment via the NRM is done according to clause 14.3.4A.2.\n2.\tThe NRM server passes the 5G MBS session info for the service description associated with the 5G MBS session to the NRM client. The NRM client obtains the MBS session ID, from the service description.\nNOTE:\tFor 5G MBS and 4G MBMS co-existence, the MBMS bearers activation and MBS session announcement are performed as specified in the procedure for pre-created MBS session and session announcement.\n3.\tThe NRM client stores the information associated with the MBS session ID. The NRM client uses the MBS session ID and other 5G MBS session related information to enable monitoring of the 5G MBS session by the VAL UE.\n4.\tSteps 4 to 6 defined in clause 14.3.4A.2 are performed.\n5.\tThe VAL server transmits MC application control messages over the MBS session.\nThis clause addresses the issue of VAL data delivery over MBS session, specifically, to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS delivery and unicast delivery.\nThis solution provides the procedure which allows the NRM client to report the broadcast reception quality to the NRM server which is used to make the decision whether to use the unicast delivery to the VAL UE(s) which are suffering bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., move out of the broadcast service area.\nAn NRM client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive VAL data. Based on the received quality (e.g., radio level quality, RTP packet loss), the NRM client needs to inform the NRM server that the NRM client is able to receive the VAL data on the broadcast MBS session with sufficient quality or not.\nThis estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on, for example, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the received VAL data.\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.1-1 illustrates the VAL UE which is receiving VAL data via broadcast MBS session is switched to unicast delivery because the VAL UE suffers from bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area. It shows only one of the receiving VAL UEs receiving the broadcast MBS session.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL group communication is ongoing and the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS session.\n2.\tThe NRM client is receiving the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the broadcast MBS session.\n3.\tThe NRM client(s) already have the associated information (e.g., SDP) to receive the unicast delivery during the group communication establishment phase.\n4.\tAn VAL group communication session is ongoing and the DL VAL data is transmitted over broadcast MBS session.\nThe figure depicts a service continuity diagram for broadcast to unicast transmissions in a 5G network. It illustrates the path taken by the signal from the source to the destination, highlighting the importance of service continuity in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast\n1.\tThe NRM client detects that it suffers bad broadcast reception due to e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session ID. The NRM client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).\n2.\tThe NRM client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not sufficient to receive media. The NRM client may also map the determined broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception quality level the VAL data has been received.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.\nNOTE 2:\tThe set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.\nNOTE 3:\tThe frequency of VAL UE sending listening reports can be limited to prevent signalling congestion. E.g., the VAL UE can stop monitoring the broadcast reception quality and send the MBS listening status report only once when it moves outside of the broadcast service area.\n3.\tThe NRM server based on the report from the participant, determines that the UE is not able to receive the media or the QoS requirements is not satisfied. The NRM server determines the VAL media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) needs to be delivered via the unicast delivery to the reported NRM client.\n4.\tIf the unicast QoS flow is not satisfied, the NRM server interacts with the 5GC to update the QoS requirements.\n5.\tThe NRM server informs the VAL server to send the VAL data via the unicast delivery towards the reported NRM client by sending a user plane delivery mode message.\n6.\tThe NRM server sends the VAL media via the unicast delivery towards the NRM client which suffers bad broadcast reception quality.\n7.\tThe NRM client then receives the DL VAL data via both broadcast MBS session and unicast delivery.\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.2-1 illustrates the VAL UE receiving VAL data via unicast delivery being switched to broadcast MBS session as the UE enters the broadcast service area where the NG-RAN is broadcasting the VAL media of the ongoing group communication.

The usage of 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method is transparent to the NRM server and VAL server.\nThe VAL server delivers the VAL data to the VAL UE(s) without being aware of the mobility of the VAL UE with the assistance and guidance of the NRM server. When working in transport only mode, the NRM server guides the NRM clients throughout the VAL data transmission for switching between the LTE and 5G systems. For this purpose, the location management client may send location related information to the location management server, similar to the one defined in clause 9, which is triggered due to its location change – in this case due to Radio Access Technology (RAT) change, to inform the NRM server hence the latter provides guidance related to how to receive the VAL data after the location update.\nThe procedures cover both the deployment scenarios with/without MBSF/MBSTF. The procedures specify four inter-system switching related scenarios as follows:\n1.\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer, as in 14.3.4A.10.2\n2.\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer, as in 14.3.4A.10.3\n3.\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session, as in 14.3.4A.10.4\n4.\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session, as in 14.3.4A.10.5\nIn all the inter-system switching related scenario described in 14.3.4A.10.2, 14.3.4A.10.3, 14.3.4A.10.4 and 14.3.4A.10.5, the functional entity that resides in 5GS may be NEF, or MBSF, or MB-SMF for session creation and together with PCF or PCC related interaction.\nNOTE:\tThere will be a service interruption when the VAL server performs path switch between 5G and LTE bearers or sessions.\nThe procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.2-1 describes how the NRM server handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from 5G to LTE network, where the NRM server is able to provide the VAL data to the clients over eMBMS bearer(s).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered.\n-\tThe VAL service can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\n-\tThe NRM client(s) is within the eMBMS service area.\n-\tIt is assumed that the NRM client(s) has not received the eMBMS bearer announcement while camping in 5GS.\nThe figure depicts a 5G MBS session switching to an LTE eMBMS bearer, illustrating the inter-system switching process.\nFigure 14.3.4A.10.2-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer.\n1.\tAn VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is associated to the VAL group X.\n2.\tThe VAL UE performs handover to EPS.\n3.\tLocation information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided to the NRM server. VAL UE`s location information is provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server, where the latter provides the location information to the NRM server.\tAlso, location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the network to the NRM server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10], 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]. For that, the NRM server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the network. For instance, the NRM server can subscribe to PCF related notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g., access network information notification and change of access type. Also, when SCEF+NEF is deployed, the NRM server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.\n4.\tThe NRM server analyses the RAT change and decides how to deliver the DL VAL data. If the NRM server decides to serve the client via eMBMS bearer, it may send an eMBMS bearer announcement. This step is optional as the bearer announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).\n5.\tIf not already available, the NRM client stores the announced TMGI(s), service area, and any relevant information to the eMBMS, which is delivered via the bearer announcement. As a result, the NRM client starts monitoring the bearer.\n6.\tThe NRM server may inform the VAL server to stop sending DL VAL data via the MBS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., when the last UE leaves the MBS session or move out of the MBS service area.\n7.\tThe NRM client sends an eMBMS listening status report to inform the server of its ability of receiving DL VAK data over the specified bearer.\n8.\tThe NRM server sends the necessary information related to receiving the DL VAL data in the form of the MapGroupToBearer.\n9.\tThe NRM server may inform the VAL server to start sending DL VAL data via the eMBMS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., the first UE(s) enters the eMBMS service area.\n10.\tThe VAL group communication takes place over EPS, and the VAL data is transmitted over an eMBMS bearer.\nThe procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.3-1 describes how the NRM server handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from 5G to LTE network, where the VAL server is unable to provide the VAL services to the VAL UE over eMBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same VAL group X.\n-\tThe VAL services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a 5G MBS session is switched to an LTE unicast bearer, illustrating the inter-system switching process.\nFigure 14.3.4A.10.3-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer.\n1.\tAn VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is associated to the VAL group X.\n2.\tThe VAL UE performs handover to EPS.\n3.\tLocation information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided to the NRM server. VAL UE`s location information is provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server, where the latter provides the location information to the NRM server.\nAlso, location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the network to the NRM server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10], 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]. For that, the NRM server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the network.

This process is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable communication in the 5G network.\nFigure 14.3.4A.10.4-1: Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).\n1.\tAn VAL group communication takes place, and the DL VAL data is delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the VAL group X.\n2.\tThe VAL UE performs handover to 5GS.\n3.\tLocation information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided to the NRM server.

If the NRM server decides to serve the client via 5G MBS session, it may send an MBS session announcement indicating information among others the session mode to serve the NRM client and the corresponding MBS session ID. This step is optional as the session announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).\n5.\tThe VAL UE acts according to the MBS session mode provided to receive the DL media.\n5a.\tIn case of multicast MBS sessions, the VAL UE performs a UE session join towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to join. It may as well send a UE session join acknowledgement to the NRM server.\n5b.\tIn case of broadcast MBS sessions, the VAL UE starts monitoring the broadcast MBS session. 6.\tThe NRM server may inform the VAL server to stop sending DL VAL data via the eMBMS bearer by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., when the last UE moves out of the MBMS service area.\n7.\tThe NRM client sends an MBS listening status report to the server indicating its ability to receive media over the indicated MBS session.\n8.\tThe NRM server sends a MapVALGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the group communication.\n9.\tThe NRM client processes the received information related to the DL VAL data over the MBS session.\n10.\tThe NRM server may inform the VAL server to start sending DL VAL data via the 5G MBS session by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., the first UE(s) enters the MBS service area or joins the multicast MBS session.\n11.\tThe VAL group communication takes place over 5GS, and the DL VAL data is delivered over the broadcast or multicast MBS session.\n14.3.4A.10.5\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session\nThe procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.5-1 describes how the NRM server handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from LTE network to 5G, where the NRM server is able to provide the VAL services to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same VAL group X.\n-\tThe VAL services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\nThe figure depicts the inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G unicast PDU session, illustrating the process of transitioning between different communication systems.\nFigure 14.3.4A.10.5-1: Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G unicast PDU session.\n1.\tAn VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the VAL group X.\n2.\tThe VAL UE performs handover to 5GS.\n3.\tLocation information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided to the NRM server.

Such capability may be required for guaranteeing end-to-end QoS fulfilment (primarily for meeting end-to-end latency requirements) in network assisted UE to UE communications and may accommodate various vertical-specific application services, e.g.:\n-\tNetwork-assisted Command and Control (C2) communications in UASAPP [TS 23.255], where the UAV controller navigates its UAV over the 5GS;\n-\tTeleoperated Driving (ToD) in eV2XAPP [TS 23.286], where the a V2X UE acting as server may remotely control a further V2X UE over the 5GS;\n-\tNetwork-assisted Device-to-Device communications in Factory of the Future (FF) use cases, such as control-to-control communications.\n-\t5G LAN-Type communication within a 5G VN group as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].\nThis procedure provides a mechanism for initiating the capability at the NRM server for managing the end-to-end application QoS requirement fulfilment for a network-assisted VAL UE to VAL UE session (comprising a PDU session for each of the constituent links, e.g. VAL UE 1 to PLMN, and PLMN to VAL UE 2). The request may come from NRM client of either of the VAL UEs within the service and will trigger the end-to-end QoS/resource management by the NRM server. The triggering the end-to-end QoS management request can be initiated by the VAL application at the VAL UE, and the conditions may depend on the requirements of the VAL service, e.g. for UAS such triggering may be needed when a UAV is in-flight, or for V2X such trigger may be initiated when a controlled VAL UE enters an urban area, or for 5G LAN-type service such trigger may be initiated by the AF (e.g. on VAL UE1) that manages the corresponding 5G VN group.\nThe clause 14.3.5.2.1 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of UEs.\nThe clause 14.3.5.2.2 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a group of UEs.\nFigure 14.3.5.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server is initiating the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of UEs.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NRM client is connected to the NRM server.\n2.\tThe VAL UEs involved in the end-to-end session (VAL UE 1 and VAL UE 2) are connected to one or more PLMNs and have ongoing PDU sessions.\n3.\tNRM server has used the \"Setting up an AF session with required QoS procedure\" (clause 4.15.6.6 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11]).\nThe figure depicts a detailed end-to-end QoS management request/response process in a 5G network. It illustrates the various stages, including the initiation of the request, the transmission of the request, the response from the network, and the verification of the response. The figure highlights the importance of QoS management in ensuring reliable and high-quality communication services in a 5G network.\nFigure 14.3.5.2.1-1 end-to-end QoS management request / response\n1.\tThe NRM client 1 (of VAL UE 1) sends to the NRM server an end-to-end QoS management request for managing the QoS for the end-to-end application session.\n2.\tThe NRM server configures the application QoS parameters by decomposing the end-to-end QoS requirements (VAL UE 1 to VAL UE 2) to application QoS parameters for each individual session (e.g. network session for VAL UE 1 -and network session for VAL UE 2) which are part of the end-to-end application session.\n3.\tThe NRM server sends to the NRM client 1 an end-to-end QoS management response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request.\n4.\tThe NRM server may also send a notification to NRM client 2 (of VAL UE 2) to inform about the end-to-end QoS management initiation by the NRM server.\nFigure 14.3.5.2.2 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server is initiating the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a group of UEs.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NRM client is connected to the NRM server.\n2.\tThe VAL UEs involved in the end-to-end session (VAL UE 1 and a group of VAL UEs) are connected to one or more PLMNs and have ongoing PDU sessions.\nNote :\tThe NRM client2 (of VAL UE 2) can be any VAL UEs in the group of VAL UEs.\nThe figure depicts a detailed end-to-end QoS management request/response process for a group of UEs, illustrating the various stages and interactions involved in managing QoS requirements. The diagram includes a flowchart, which outlines the steps from the sender to the receiver, highlighting the use of different protocols and technologies to ensure QoS is maintained throughout the network.\nFigure 14.3.5.2.2 end-to-end QoS management request / response for a group of UEs\n1.\tThe NRM server receives from the AF on NRM client 1 (of VAL UE 1) the end-to-end QoS management request for managing the QoS on UE-to-UE traffic for a group of UEs.\n2. The NRM server retrieves from 5GC or subscribe to 5GC to obtain additional VAL-UE associated information for each member in the group identified by the VAL group ID, which is account for decomposition. The VAL-UE associated information could be from the 5GC (NEF Monitoring Events as in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], QoS sustainability analytics as in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]) or SEAL LMS (on demand location reporting).\n3.\tThe NRM server configures the application QoS parameters by decomposing the end-to-end QoS requirements (UE-to-UE traffic for any two UEs in a group) to application QoS parameters for each individual session (uplink network session for ingress group member and downlink network session for egress group member). The NRM server needs to take the additional VAL-UE associated information into account for evaluation during such decomposition.\n4. The NRM/SEAL server, acting as AF, sends to the 5GC a \"Procedures for AF requested QoS for a UE or group of UEs not identified by a UE address\" to set the application QoS parameters respectively for uplink network session for each ingress group member in the group and for downlink network session for egress group member.\nAdditionally, the NRM/SEAL server may activate monitoring of the performance to receive QoS monitoring event notifications from 5GC by setting the (optionally with Alternative QoS Profiles) in the request, in this case the AF may receive the QoS downgrade notification for e.g. latency thus to initiate the NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for 5G LAN-Type  communication in clause 14.3.5.3.x\n5.\tThe NRM server sends to the NRM client 1an end-to-end QoS management response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request.\n6.\tIf the NRF server receives the end-to-end QoS management request including VAL UE2 as any of the List of VAL UEs, then the NRM server may also send a notification to NRM client 2 (of VAL UE 2) to inform about the end-to-end QoS management initiation by the NRM server.\nThis procedure provides a mechanism for ensuring the end-to-end application QoS requirement fulfilment for the application service (which is between two or more VAL UEs), considering that the QoS of one of the links may downgrade. It is assumed that the application session is ongoing, and both the source and target VAL UEs are connected to 3GPP network (the same or different). The communication between the VAL UEs is assumed to be in-direct / network-assisted; hence two PDU sessions are established respectively (one per VAL UE).\nThe clause 14.3.5.2.1 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of UEs.\nThe clause 14.3.5.2.2 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a group of UEs.\nFigure 14.3.5.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server supports the coordinated QoS provisioning for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of UEs.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tNRM server has activated the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability, as described in 14.3.5.2.1\n2.\tNRM server, acting as AF, has registered to receive QoS monitoring event notifications from 5GC and notifications from VAL UEs (from both UEs), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].\nThe figure depicts a network-based approach to QoS provisioning for communication between two C2 (Control-to-Control) nodes. It illustrates the use of NRM (Network Resource Management) to manage network resources and allocate them to the communication paths based on the QoS requirements. The figure shows the network topology, including the control nodes, communication paths, and the network resources allocated to each path. The figure also highlights the use of QoS metrics to determine the allocation of resources, such as bandwidth, latency, and jitter. This approach ensures that the communication paths are prioritized based on the QoS requirements, leading to better network performance and user satisfaction.\nFigure 14.3.5.3.1-1: NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for C2 communication\n1a.\tA QoS downgrade trigger event is sent from the NRM client of the VAL UE 1 to the NRM server, denoting an application QoS degradation (experienced or expected) e.g. based on the experienced packet delay or packet loss for the Uu link (e.g. packet loss great than threshold value). The conditions for triggering the QoS downgrade indication from the NRM client is based on the threshold that may be provided in advance by the NRM server (at the end-to-end QoS management response by the NRM server in 14.3.5.2.1).\n1b.\tAlternatively, the NRM server receives a trigger event from the 5GC (SMF/NEF), denoting a QoS downgrade notification for the VAL UE 1 session. (described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b of 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]).\n2.\tThe NRM server evaluates the fulfilment/non-fulfilment of the end-to-end QoS based on the trigger event.

It illustrates the use of NRM to ensure efficient and reliable network performance, particularly in scenarios where traditional QoS provisioning may not be sufficient.\nFigure 14.3.5.3.2-1: NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for 5G LAN-Type communication\n1.\tThe NRM server receives a trigger event from the 5GC (SMF/NEF), denoting a QoS downgrade notification for the network session of any group member in a group.

The NRM server maps the VAL group ID (if received) to the External Group ID known to the 3GPP core network.\nNOTE:\tThe mapping between Monitoring profile ID and event details in the NRM server can be pre-configured and/or dynamically built based on VAL server request with explicitly sent event details, which is implementation specific.\n3.\tBased on the events of interest information in the subscription request message, if applicable, the NRM server shall subscribe to the UE monitoring events (LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATION_FAILURE, etc.) for the set of UEs (VAL UEs) in the subscription request, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].\n4.\tBased on the events of interest information in the subscription request message, if applicable, the NRM server shall subscribe to the UE analytics events (like ABNORMAL_BEHAVIOUR etc.) for the set of UEs (VAL UEs) in the subscription request, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].\nThe NRM server receives the events related to VAL UE(s) from the 3GPP core network. The NRM server reports the monitoring events information to the VAL server.\nThe procedure for NRM server notifying the VAL server with VAL UE(s) related events is described in figure 14.3.6.3.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe VAL server has subscribed with NRM server using Monitoring Events Subscription Procedure as specified in clause 14.3.6.2;\nThe monitoring events notification procedure in Figure 14.3.6.3.2-1 is depicted in the figure, illustrating the steps taken to alert the system when certain events occur. The procedure is crucial for maintaining system stability and ensuring timely response to potential issues.\nFigure 14.3.6.3.2-1: Monitoring Events Notification Procedure\n1.\tIf applicable, the NRM server receives the VAL UE related monitoring event notifications from the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].\n2.\tIf applicable, the NRM server receives the VAL UE related Analytics event notifications from the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].\n3.\tThe NRM server notifies the VAL server about the events related to the VAL UE in Notify Monitorng Events message.

The traffic classes are configured on each DS-TT.\n2.\tThe NRM server has collected the 5GS TSC bridge management and port management information. The latter is related to the Ethernet ports located in the DS-TTs including bridge delay per DS-TT Ethernet port pair per traffic class.\n3.\tNRM server has calculated the bridge delay for each port pair, i.e. composed of (ingress DS-TT Ethernet port, egress DS-TT Ethernet port) including the UE-DS-TT residence time, packet delay budget (PDB) and propagation delay for both UL from sender UE and DL to receiver UE.\n\nThe figure depicts a TSC (Time-Sensitive Congestion Control) stream availability discovery procedure, which is a crucial component of network management. The figure shows a flowchart with various steps, such as checking the status of the TSC stream, determining the current status, and determining the next steps. This procedure is used to ensure that the network is functioning correctly and that the TSC streams are available for use.\nFigure 14.3.7.2-1: TSC stream availability discovery procedure\n1.\tThe NRM server receives a request from a VAL server on NRM-S reference point to discover the connectivity and available QoS characteristics between DS-TTs identified by the stream specification.\n2.\tThe NRM server validates the connectivity between the DS-TTs connected in the same 5GS TSC bridge based on the collected 5GS TSC bridge management and port management information, identifies the traffic classes supported by the DS-TTs and determines the end-to-end latency (including the UE-DS-TT residence times, PDBs and propagation delay).\n3.\tNRM server responds to the VAL server with the stream specification and a list of traffic specifications with the available end-to-end latency and the traffic classes supported by the DS-TTs.\nThis procedure allows the VAL server to create a TSC stream. The TSC stream creation procedure enables the VAL server to establish TSC connectivity with the required QoS between the UEs connected to the 5GS after the stream discovery procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tEach UE has an established Ethernet PDU session for its DS-TT port MAC address.\n2.\tConnectivity between the DS-TTs has been validated by the TSC stream availability discovery procedure specified in clause 14.3.7.2.\n3.\tThe NRM server maintains mapping from the traffic class to TSC QoS.\nThe figure depicts the TSC (Time-Sensitive Compression) stream creation procedure, which is a crucial step in the compression process. The figure shows the process of creating a TSC stream, which is used to compress data in a network. The TSC stream is created by compressing the data in the network, and then the compressed data is sent to the TSC stream. The TSC stream is then used to compress the data in the network, and the compressed data is sent to the destination. The figure provides a visual representation of the TSC stream creation procedure, which is an important step in the compression process.\nFigure 14.3.7.3-1: TSC stream creation procedure\n1.\tThe NRM server receives a TSC stream creation request from a VAL server to create a TSC stream identified by a VAL Stream ID, between DS-TT ports in the stream specification and for the traffic class in the traffic specification.\n2.\tThe NRM server calculates the schedule for the VAL Stream ID based on the information collected earlier from the 5GS via N5. It provides per-stream filtering and policing parameters (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [36]) used to derive the TSC QoS information and related flow information. NRM server also provides the forwarding rule (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [36]) used to identify the DS-TT MAC address of the corresponding PDU session. Based on the 5GS bridge delay information it determines the TSC QoS information and TSC Assistance information for the stream.\n3. \tBased on the Traffic specification (from the TSC stream creation request in step 1), the SEAL NRM server determines whether time synchronization needs to be activated for the TSC stream on the DS-TTs. If the DS-TTs are time synchronized, then the NRM does not activate the time synchronization for the corresponding DS-TT.\n4.\tAs a TSCTSF, the NRM server triggers via N84 the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] for the TSC stream for both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge) and DL QoS flow (UPF/bridge to receiver UE). The Policy Authorization request includes the DS-TT port MAC address, TSC QoS information, TSC Assistance Information (3GPP TS 23.501 [1], cl.5.27.2.3), flow bit rate, priority, Service Data Flow Filter containing flow description including Ethernet Packet Filters. The QoS flow will be assigned for the PDU session for the source MAC address for the UL direction and for the PDU session for the destination MAC address for the DL direction. This information is delivered to the DS-TT by the 5GS.\nIf time synchronization is determined to be needed for the TSC stream on the DS-TTs in step 3, the NRM server uses the procedures in clause K.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] to activate the time synchronization via the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation. The procedure includes the configuration and initialization of the PTP instance in the DS-TTs, the construction of PMICs to each DS-TT/UE to activate the time synchronization service in the DS-TT and to subscribe for the port management information changes in the DS-TTs.\nEditor's note: Using gate control parameters for hold and forward buffering is FFS.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends TSC stream creation response to the VAL server with the result of TSC stream creation for the VAL Stream ID.\nThis procedure allows the VAL server to delete a TSC stream.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe TSC stream is configured in the 5GS and the DS-TTs.\n\nThe figure depicts a TSC (Time-Sensitive Compression) stream deletion procedure, which is a crucial step in the compression process. The figure shows the steps involved in deleting a TSC stream, including the deletion of the stream, the deletion of the associated data, and the deletion of the associated metadata. This procedure is used to reduce the size of the TSC stream, which is essential for efficient compression and transmission of data.\nFigure 14.3.7.4-1: TSC stream deletion procedure\n1.\tThe NRM server receives a request from VAL server to delete a TSC stream for with a VAL Stream ID.\n2.\tThe NRM server identifies the MAC addresses of the DS-TTs involved in the stream based on the stored information for the VAL Stream ID. If none of the streams require to keep the time synchronization activated, the NRM server deactivates the time synchronization for the corresponding DS-TTs, otherwise keeps the time synchronization activated if the time synchronization for the DS-TTs was activated by the NRM server.\n3.\tAs a TSCTSF, the NRM server triggers via N84 the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] for MAC addresses referred to by the VAL Stream ID. The NRM server uses the procedure to delete both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge) and DL QoS flows (UPF/bridge to receiver UE) from the PDU sessions of the UEs referred to by the VAL Stream ID. Before invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete procedure, if the time synchronization service for the DS-TTs needs deactivation, the NRM server deactivates the time synchronization for the DS-TTs as described in clause K.2.2 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] via the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation.\n4.\tThe NRM server sends TSC stream deletion response to the VAL server with the result of TSC stream deletion for the VAL Stream ID.\n",

It illustrates the steps taken by the bridge to report its status to the network. The figure includes various elements such as the bridge's interface, the reporting protocol, and the reporting mechanism. This information is crucial for network management and troubleshooting, as it allows network operators to monitor and manage the bridge's performance.\nFigure 14.3.8.2-1: TSN Bridge information reporting procedure\n1.\tActing as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS 23.502 [11] Annex F.1.

The diagram includes various components such as the TSN bridge, TSN protocol, and TSN protocol configuration. The TSN protocol is a key component of the TSN network, enabling the efficient transmission of data over the network. The TSN bridge is a crucial component that facilitates the communication between the TSN nodes and the TSN protocol.

The NRM server triggers the establishment of application-level direct service connectivity between two UEs via Uu, based on the information provided by the UEs and static configuration information available to the NRM server prior to the UE interaction. Note that service connectivity among VAL clients is established over the Uu, without device-to-device direct radio connectivity (e.g. PC5) requirement.\nThe procedure for establishing Uu-based application-level direct communications between two UEs, with application service requirements is as illustrated in figure 14.3.9.2.1-1. In this procedure the source and destination VAL clients correlate their triggering of the procedure establishment before the NRM Server provides the service.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM client 1 and NRM client 2 are provided configuration information for the VAL clients served e.g. connectivity requirements, which destination UEs to connect to over Uu, etc.\n-\tThe NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 are configured with the information of the NRM server and have connectivity enabled to communicate with the NRM server. The information is provided via pre-configuration.\n-\tThe NRM server is configured with policies and information of the UEs to determine authorization of the UEs requesting connectivity via Uu.\n-\tThe VAL clients associated with NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 have triggered the establishment of connectivity.\nThe figure depicts a communication setup with various components, including a base station (BTS), a mobile terminal (MT), and a network element (NE). The BTS is responsible for transmitting and receiving signals, while the MT is the device that receives the signal and sends it to the NE. The NE is the device that receives the signal from the MT and sends it to the BTS. The figure also shows the network's architecture, with the BTS, MT, and NE forming a communication chain. The figure is used to establish communication with application service requirements, which is an essential step in the communication process.\nFigure 14.3.9.2.1-1: Establishing communication with application service requirements\n1a.\tThe NRM client 1 sends the application connectivity request (source identity and IP address, destination identities, service requirements) to the NRM Server. The service requirement from the source includes packet size, packet transmission interval, packet E2E latency, allowed packet loss rate/packet loss amount/packet error rate, etc. The destination may be multiple UEs (devices). The identity of source and destination may be the application user identity or the MAC address.\n1b.\tThe NRM server determines whether the UE of NRM client 1 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs for direct service communications via Uu. If UE of NRM client 1 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs, then a response is provided to the NRM client 1 indicating acceptance of the request.\n2a.\tThe NRM client 2 sends the application connectivity request (destination identity and IP address, source identity, service requirements) to the NRM server. The service requirements from the destination includes the service requirements as described in step 1a.\n2b.\tThe NRM server determines whether the UE of NRM client 2 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs for direct service communications via Uu. If UE of NRM client 2 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs, then a response is provided to the NRM client 2 indicating acceptance of the request.\n3.\tBased on the service requirements received in step 1 and step 2, the NRM server determines the parameters and patterns for direct service connectivity between the UEs via Uu and also the transport requirements, i.e., QoS requirements for the 3GPP system (e.g. 5GS). This step may also include retrieving the direct link status of the UEs (e.g. PDU Session Status, UE reachability). If the NRM server determines that direct service connectivity via Uu is not authorized or not possible with the given connectivity requirements, it skips step 4 and proceeds to steps 5 and 6, informing each NRM client accordingly.\nNRM server will process E2E connectivity establishment between NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 only after it receives the request from NRM client 2. There can be several NRM clients (destinations) which will perform step 2 and NRM server will process their E2E connectivity with NRM client 1 (source) as and when the requests are received by the NRM server.\n4.\tThe NRM server triggers 3GPP system to establish Uu connectivity between the UE of NRM client 1 and UE of NRM client 2 with required QoS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].\n5.\tThe NRM server sends the application connectivity notification (connectivity/session information) to NRM client 1 indicating successful establishment of the connectivity. The connectivity/session information may contain the accepted destination identities.\n6.\tThe NRM server sends the application connectivity notification (connectivity/session information) to NRM client 2 indicating successful establishment of the connectivity.\nThis procedure is used for establishing Uu-based application-level direct communications between two UEs, based on a single client initiating and providing  application requirements. The procedure is as illustrated in figure 14.3.9.2.2-1. The NRM Server provides the service by coordinating with the destination client.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM client 1 and NRM client 2 are provided configuration information for the VAL clients served e.g. connectivity requirements, etc.\n-\tPre-processing determines that network assisted UE-to-UE communications is required. VAL application policies and destination information for NRM clients are available at the NRM server.\n-\tThe VAL client associated with NRM client 1 triggers the establishment of connectivity and provides information about (one or more) destination VAL client(s).\nThe figure depicts a network coordination scenario where a UE (User Equipment) communicates with its neighboring UE (User Equipment) to fulfill application requirements. The figure illustrates the communication process, including the use of VAL (Value-Aware Link) technology, which is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 14.3.9.2.2-1: Coordination UE-to-UE communications with VAL application requirements\n\n1.\tThe NRM client 1 sends the application connectivity request (source identity and IP address, destination identities, application requirements) to the NRM server to establish connectivity for VAL client 1 on UE 1. The destination VAL client(s) may be hosted on one or multiple UEs (devices).\n2.\tThe NRM server determines whether VAL client 1 is authorized to connect to VAL client 2 for application-level direct UE-to-UE communications. If VAL client 1 is authorized to connect to VAL client 2, the NRM server performs the get application connectivity context request to  retrieve  VAL UE-to-UE connection coordination context procedure as described in clause 14.3.2.56. This step can be skipped if the NRM server is already aware of VAL client 2's context information.\nNOTE:\tThe signaling and functionality for handling the cases when NRM client 2 will be temporarily unavailable for establishing the direct service connection are implementation dependent.\n3. The NRM client 2 sends the get application connectivity context response to the NRM server, 2.\tUsing the request information and local policies, the NRM client 2 determines whether context information is to be provided for establishing application-level direct connectivity to the counterpart UE for the VAL application indicated. If the NRM client determines that context information is to be provided, it responds to the NRM server and provides the VAL connection coordination context data for the VAL client served.\n4.\tThe NRM server sends the application connectivity response to NRM client 1.\n5.\tThe NRM server uses VAL client 1's and VAL client 2's context information, their application-level direct UE-to-UE connectivity requirements, location information, and network context as input, checks connectivity service policies, and determines the parameters and patterns for application-level direct UE-to-UE connectivity between  the VAL clients. The NRM server may also determine transport requirements, e.g. QoS requirements, for the 3GPP system (e.g. 5GS).\nIf network provided location information is used, location information may be obtained from the SEAL location management server. Alternatively, Location Reporting monitoring as described in 23.502[12] may be used. This step may also include a request for direct link status (e.g. PDU Session Status, UE reachability, etc. as described in 23.502 [12]).  This action may be skipped if  the clients provide location information or if there are no location requirements for establishing the application-level direct UE-to-UE connectivity.\nIf the NRM server determines that UE-to-UE application-level direct connectivity is not authorized or not possible with the given connectivity requirements, it skips step 5 and proceeds to steps 6 and 7, informing each NRM client accordingly.\n6.\tThe NRM server may request the 3GPP system to establish or modify the 3GPP system level connectivity that enables the application-level direct UE-to-UE connection for VAL client 1 and VAL client 2 services, e.g. via modification of existing radio bearers. NRM server provides the necessary information (e.g. identifiers of VAL client 1 and VAL client 2, transport requirements) in this request message.\n7.\ta. The NRM server notifies NRM client 1 of the established UE-to-UE connection b. The NRM server notifies the NRM client 2 of the established UE-to-UE connection.\nEach NRM client notifies the corresponding VAL client of the established application-level direct UE-to-UE connection.\n",

The request may also include Management subscription indications which indicate to the NRM Server which management and 5GC exposure procedures the VAL server allows the NRM Server to perform on its behalf.\n2.\tUpon receipt of the request, the NRM server sends a UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring  management subscription response as detailed in clause 14.3.2.54.\n3.\tThe NRM Server aggregates UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription requests from different VAL servers and determines the UE unified traffic pattern per UE (using the traffic patterns of all the  communicating with the UE).\n4.\tDepending on the subscription requests received and local policies, the NRM Server executes one or more management and 5GC exposure procedure (per UE).  Management and 5GC exposure procedures are detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.\nThe NRM Server determines the management procedures required to be executed on behalf of the VAL Servers based on the  received management subscription indications as follows:\n-\tIf the UE unified traffic pattern monitoring management indication is provided, the NRM Server executes steps 1-3 of the UE unified traffic pattern monitoring procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.2.\n-\tIf the UE unified traffic pattern monitoring update notification indication is provided, the NRM Server executes the steps 1-4 of the UE unified traffic pattern monitoring procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.2.\n-\tIf the Network parameter coordination indication is provided, the NRM executes the network parameter coordination procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.3.\nNOTE:\tThe NRM Server translates the management subscription indications received from different VAL Servers into per-UE management indications based on local policies and configurations. For example, an NRM Server may be configured to execute a management procedure for a UE if at least one VAL Server indicates it. Another NRM Server may be configured to provide all the management procedures for the UEs using the platform independent of VAL Server subscription indications.\nAn NRM Server can provide updated UE unified traffic pattern information to VAL servers by sending UE unified traffic pattern update notifications as shown in figure 14.3.12.3-1. The UE unified traffic pattern management procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.2. is an example of procedure which may result in UE unified traffic pattern updates at the NRM server, based on which UE unified traffic pattern update notifications are provided.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has subscribed for UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management services, requesting to receive UE unified traffic pattern update notifications\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the unified traffic pattern update notification procedure for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a 4G network. The UAV is shown as a single unit, with the signal path and the UE (User Equipment) highlighted. The figure illustrates the process of updating the traffic pattern of the UAV, which is crucial for ensuring efficient communication in a 4G network. The UAV's signal path is shown as a dashed line, indicating the path it takes to reach the UE. The UE is shown as a single unit, with the signal path and the UAV's signal path highlighted. The figure also shows the UE's unified traffic pattern update notification procedure, which is a key component of the 4G network's communication system.\nFigure 14.3.12.3-1: UE unified traffic pattern update notification procedure\n1.\tThe NRM server sends the UE unified traffic pattern update notification when either of the following occurs:\n-\tMonitoring events lead to updates in the UE unified traffic pattern (e.g., to schedule elements in Table 14.3.2.55-1) the NRM server sends a corresponding notification to the  VAL server. Other notifications may be provided, e.g., if the stationary indication changes.\n-\tAn NP Configuration Notification is received with a new set of applied network parameters and if the NRM Server determines that the new configuration is incompatible with the current UE unified traffic pattern (see also clause 14.3.12.4.2 step 3).\nThe management and 5GC exposure procedures in this clause show NRM processing and its interactions with 5GC in support of the functionality described in clause 14.3.12.2\nThe UE unified traffic pattern management procedure is used to determine and manage a unified traffic pattern applicable to a specified UE. The NRM Server then uses the 5GC exposure of UE monitoring events to update the UE unified traffic pattern.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NRM Server determines to provide the service for a specific UE if either of the following conditions is true:\na)\tIt receives UE unified traffic pattern monitoring management indications in UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription requests; or\nb)\tIt determines to provide Network parameter coordination services for the UE.\nThe figure depicts a unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription procedure for an UE, illustrating the various steps involved in managing traffic and monitoring.\nFigure 14.3.12.4.2-1: UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription procedure\n1.\tThe NRM Server determines an initial UE unified traffic pattern, e.g. by using all Traffic pattern configurations received for the UE .\n2.\tThe NRM Server determines, based on local policy that UE monitoring events are to be configured and executes the corresponding Monitoring procedure as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] clause 4.4.2.\n3.\tThe NRM Server updates the UE unified traffic pattern based on the received monitoring events as follows:\n-\tIf a Monitoring Notification report for UE_REACHABILITY is received, and idleStatusInfo information is provided in the report, the NRM Server changes the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern such that the duration of activity is set to the value of the activeTime parameter configured in the idleStatusInfo.\n-\tIf a Monitoring Notification report for AVAILABILITY_AFTER_DDN_FAILURE is received after UEs transition to idle mode, the NRM Server updates the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern such that:  the start of an activity window is based on the Idle Timestamp, with a periodicity equal to the TAU/RAU Timer; the duration of the activity window indicates the Active Time value.\n-\tIf a Monitoring Notification report for COMMUNICATION_FAILURE is received The NRM updates the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern to indicate that no communications are currently available (e.g. by using a keyword such as \"NULL\"). Local policies may specify events/ thresholds further defining when the NRM may provide a UE unified traffic pattern update based on monitoring events. For example, the update may be provided only after repeated communication failures are received within a timespan, or only if high reliability communications are expected.  It is recommended that UE Reachability monitoring is also enabled in conjunction with the Communication Failure monitoring. This enables the NRM to provide updated timing information once the UE becomes reachable again.\n-\tIf a Monitoring Notification report for LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY is received, the NRM Server changes the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern to indicate that no communications are currently available\n4.\tConditional: The NRM Server notifies subscribers of the UE unified traffic pattern updates, as described in clause 14.3.2.55\nThe network parameter coordination  procedure uses UE unified traffic pattern information  to influence aspects of UE/network behaviour such as the UE's PSM and extended idle mode DR14. For this purpose, parameter values may be suggested for Maximum Latency and Maximum Response Time for a UE. 5GC may choose to accept, reject or modify the suggested configuration parameter value.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NRM Server determines to provide the service for a specific UE after receiving Network parameter coordination indications in UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription requests, subject to policy.\n2.\tThe NRM Server determines and manages UE unified traffic patterns as described in clause 14.3.12.4.2.\nThe figure depicts a network parameter coordination procedure, illustrating the steps taken to ensure the proper synchronization of network parameters. The diagram includes various components such as network parameters, network parameters coordination, and network parameters synchronization. This procedure is crucial for maintaining network stability and efficiency.\nFigure 14.3.12.4.3-1: Network parameter coordination procedure\n1.\tThe NRM Server determines to provide Network parameter configuration to 5GC. This determination can be based on updates to the UE unified traffic patterns resulting from interactions with VAL Servers (e.g. Traffic pattern configuration updates), on local policies, etc.\nThe NRM Server determines parameters the needed for NpConfiguration data structure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] from the UE unified traffic patterns as follows:\n-\tmaximumLatency – This value tells the network how long the UE is allowed to sleep.  Setting it to 0 will disable PSM, extended idle mode DRX, and extended buffering. The NRM Server can extract the periodicity derived from the UE unified traffic pattern, which includes the schedule elements for the UEs communications with all VAL servers. The NRM Server sets Maximum Latency to be approximately the periodicity of the active periods derived from the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern.\n-\tmaximumResponseTime – When the UE uses PSM, Maximum Response Time tells the network how long the UE should stay reachable after a transition to idle.  When the UE uses eDRX, Maximum Response Time is used by the network to determine when to send a reachability notification before a UE's paging occasion.  The NRM Server extracts a duration of activity from the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern and sets Maximum Response Time to reflect the duration of activity, indicating how long the UE should stay reachable for downlink communications.\n2.\tThe NRM Server performs the Network Parameter Configuration procedure as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] clause 4.4.12.\nNOTE:\tThe values provided by NRM Server to 5GC in the Network parameter configuration procedure may or may not be accepted by the network. If they are not accepted, 5GC responds accordingly and the previous values apply, or new values are provided. The new values are used by NRM Server as described in this clause when they were provided via monitoring event notifications.\n",

                            "text_content": "The Background Data Transfer (BDT) feature requires an initial step in which BDT policies are requested and negotiated. BDT Policy requests to the 3GPP network are based on an expected time window and UE set, with additional optional information e.g., expected data volume per UE. The UE set may be indicated as an expected number of UEs, a group ID or geographical area.\nThe feature allows for the NRM server involved to negotiate the BDT policies proposed by the network. It also allows the NRM server to enable notifications to be sent, should network conditions affect future BDT policies.\nBased on the BDT policies obtained using the procedures detailed in this clause, a VAL server can initiate a data transfer to the client at the negotiated time and with the negotiated charging rates. The data transfer between the VAL Server and the VAL Client is performed without NRM Server enablement. Service layer functionality for the purpose of facilitating the data transfer with the negotiated BDT policy is not in scope of this specification.\nFigure 14.3.13.2-1 depicts a general procedure for the request and configuration of traffic policies for BDT initiated by a request from a VAL Server.\nThe figure depicts a general procedure for configuring background data transfer in a network. It shows the steps to set up a background data transfer, including the necessary parameters and configurations. The figure is essential for network administrators to ensure efficient and reliable data transfer in the background.\nFigure 14.3.13.2-1: General Procedure for configuration of Background Data Transfer\n1.\tA VAL Server requests the NRM Server to negotiate with the 3GPP network a background data transfer policy using the BDT_Configuration_request (see clause 14.4.2.15).\nThe request includes expected data volume, expected number of UEs, expected time window for the background data transfer. The request may also include group ID, geographic information for the UEs, a request expiration time, guidance for policy selection. If guidance for policy selection is not included, the VAL Server indicates if the NRM Server may choose independently from among multiple transfer policies.\n2.\tBased on the request expiration time and Service Provider policies, NRM Server may determine to delay interactions with the 3GPP network in order to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers.\nThe NRM Server performs the procedure for negotiation of background data transfer policy as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.2. The procedure requires that expected data volume, expected number of UEs, and expected time window are provided by the NRM Server. If the NRM Server determines to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers, the parameters included reflects a superset of the individual VAL Server requests.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NRM Server determines to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers based on implementation options and local policies. For example, if the request expiration time and expected time window are sufficiently large and, respectively, far away in time, the NRM Server may be allowed to delay the negotiations with the 3GPP network in case another request is received, targeting the same group of UEs. If another request is received with expected time windows sufficiently close and if the guidance for policy selection allows, a single policy/time window may be negotiated instead. This allows the UE group to wake up only once for multiple background data transfers.\nThe 3GPP network determines one or more applicable BDT policies based on the requesting Background Data Transfer parameters. A list of BDT policies and a mandatory BDT Reference ID is provided to the NRM Server. Each BDT policy includes charging rating group reference and allocated time window and optional maximum UL and DL bandwidth as specified by 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]. The NRM Server uses ASP policies and the transfer selection guidance (if available) to select a BDT policy. The NRM Server informs the 3GPP Network of the selected BDT policy.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on 3GPP TS 23.503 [12] clause 6.1.2.4. it is assumed that the NRM server is configured to understand the charging rating group reference based on agreements with the operator.\nNOTE 3:\tThe NRM server utilizes the BDT warning notification from 3GPP network based on local policies.\n3.\tThe NRM Server stores the BDT configuration information with the information received from VAL server in step 1 along with the BDT Reference ID and selected BDT policy. The NRM server responds to the VAL Server, providing the BDT Reference ID and allocated time window of the selected background data transfer policy.\nFigure 14.3.13.3-1 depicts a procedure for reselecting BDT policies after BDT warning.\nThe figure depicts a selection of Bayesian decision tree (BDT) policies after a BDT warning, illustrating the process of selecting the most appropriate policy based on the warning. The figure includes a legend to help understand the different BDT policies and their corresponding probabilities.\nFigure 14.3.13.3-1: Reselecting BDT policies after BDT warning\n1.\tThe 3GPP Network, via NEF, sends the BDT warning (BDT Policy negotiate) notification to the NRM server as specified in step 10, clause 4.16.7.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11]. The notification includes the affected BDT Reference ID and list of candidate BDT policies.\nEach of the BDT policies in the candidate BDT list includes charging rating group reference and time window, as well as optional maximum UL and DL bandwidth.\nThe NRM Server checks the new BDT policies included in the candidate list of the BDT warning notification. The NRM Server determines whether the notification affects multiple VAL Servers or not. The NRM Server uses ASP policies and the transfer selection guidance (if available) provided with the initial VAL Server request to select a policy.\nThe NRM Server informs the 3GPP Network of the selected transfer policy or that no new policy has been selected by using steps 11-16 of the procedure for BDT warning notification in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.3.\n2\tThe NRM server updates the BDT configuration information with the newly selected BDT policy or no BDT policy is selected for the BDT Reference ID. The NRM Server sends a BDT_Negotiation_notification (see clause 14.4.2.16), to the VAL server, providing information about the newly selected BDT policy, or that no BDT policy is selected for the BDT Reference ID. If a new BDT policy is selected by the NRM server, the information provided to the VAL Server includes the BDT Reference ID and the granted time window.\nFigure 14.3.13.4-1 illustrates a procedure for retrieving the BDT configuration on the NRM server by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has performed the BDT configuration request as specified in clause 14.3.13.2.\nThe figure depicts a BDT configuration get command, which is a command used in the BDT (Bunching and Division Tool) configuration process. The command is used to retrieve the configuration settings for a BDT. The figure shows the command prompt, the input field, and the output field, which are used to input and retrieve the configuration settings. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different options available in the command.\nFigure 14.3.13.4-1: BDT configuration get\n1.\tA VAL Server requests the NRM Server to retrieve its background data transfer policy configuration using the BDT_Configuration_Get_request (see clause 14.4.2.19).\nThe request includes identifier for the BDT policy configuration stored at the NRM server.\n2.\tThe NRM Server provides a response to the VAL server indicating success or failure of the operation and the BDT configuration data available at the NRM server.\nFigure 14.3.13.5-1 illustrates a procedure for updating the BDT configuration on the NRM server by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has performed the BDT configuration request as specified in clause 14.3.13.2.\nThe figure depicts a BDT configuration update, which is a crucial step in the process of managing and optimizing the performance of a distributed system. The update involves updating the configuration of the BDT, which stands for a Bayesian Decision Tree, to ensure that it is performing optimally. This can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the BDT, such as the number of decision trees, the number of leaves, and the number of samples. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different components of the BDT, such as the number of decision trees, the number of leaves, and the number of samples. The update process is shown in a step-by-step manner, with each step represented by a different color, making it easy to follow and understand. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the BDT configuration update process, which is essential for ensuring the optimal performance of the system.\nFigure 14.3.13.5-1: BDT configuration update\n1.\tA VAL Server requests the NRM Server to update its background data transfer policy configuration using the BDT_Configuration_Update_request (see clause 14.4.2.20).\nThe request includes identifier for the BDT policy configuration stored at the NRM server and one or more updated information like expected data volume, expected number of UEs, expected time window for the background data transfer, geographic information for the UEs, a request expiration time, guidance for policy selection.\n2.\tThe NRM Server may perform the BDT policy negotiation update as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.2. The request for update of the BDT policy configuration by the VAL server may provide several updates to the requirements of the VAL server to perform BDT to the VAL UE or group of VAL UEs. This may impact the selected BDT policy.\n3.\tThe NRM Server provides a response to the VAL server indicating success or failure of the operation.\nFigure 14.3.13.6-1 illustrates a procedure for deleting the BDT configuration on the NRM server by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has performed the BDT configuration request as specified in clause 14.3.13.2.\nThe figure depicts a BDT configuration delete, which is a crucial step in the process of data backup and restore. The BDT stands for Backup Data Tree, and it is a crucial component of the backup and restore process. The figure shows the deletion of a BDT, which is a tree-based data structure used to store and manage backups. The deletion of a BDT is a critical operation that ensures the integrity and reliability of the backup process. The figure provides a visual representation of the BDT structure and the process of deleting it, which is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the backup process.\nFigure 14.3.13.6-1: BDT configuration delete\n1.\tA VAL Server requests the NRM Server to delete its background data transfer policy configuration using the BDT_Configuration_delete_request (see clause 14.4.2.21).\nThe request includes identifier for the BDT policy configuration stored at the NRM server.\n2.\tThe NRM Server may perform the BDT policy negotiation update as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.2. If NRM server is currently serving only one VAL server, then BDT policy delete is performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.3. The request for deletion of the BDT policy configuration by the VAL server removes the requirement of the VAL server to perform BDT to the VAL UE or group of VAL UEs. This may impact the selected BDT policy.\n3.\tThe NRM Server provides a response to the VAL server indicating success or failure of the operation.\n",
