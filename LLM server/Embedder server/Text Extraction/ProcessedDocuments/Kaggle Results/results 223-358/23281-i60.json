                            "text_content": "Entities within the application plane of MCVideo service provide application control, media transmission control and distribution functions.\nThe description of the common services core entities are contained in common functional architecture for MC services over LTE in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].\nThe MCVideo client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCVideo application transactions.\nThe MCVideo client is responsible for remote device control. This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-network operations.\nThe MCVideo server functional entity provides centralised support for MCVideo services.\nAll the MCVideo clients supporting users belonging to a single group are required to use the same MCVideo server for that group. An MCVideo client supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with multiple MCVideo servers.\nThe MCVideo server is an instantiation of a MC service server in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].\nThe MCVideo server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] to control multicast and unicast operations for group communications.\nThe MCVideo server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.\nThis MCVideo server provides support for centralised media transmission control for on-network and distributed media transmission control for off-network operation.\nThe MCVideo server is responsible for managing and providing the device information that can participate in MCVideo communications. The device information is further associated to MCVideo users to manage remote device control authorization. The device information is provisioned to the MCVideo server by the MCVideo service provider, mission critical organization and the MCVideo user.\nThe MCVideo server performing the functional alias controlling role is responsible for:\n-\tinterfacing with the functional alias management server for functional alias policy;\n-\tfunctional alias activation, deactivation, take over and interrogation support for MCVideo user.\nThe controlling roles for group call, private call and functional alias are independent with each other.\nThe media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media to MCVideo clients. By means of information provided by the MCVideo server (e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following functionality:\n-\tprovide for the reception of uplink MCVideo UE media transmission by means of the MCVideo-7 reference point;\n-\tstoring the received media stream as MCVideo content files;\n-\treplicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using unicast transport;\n-\tdistribute downlink media to MCVideo UEs by IP unicast transmission to those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCVideo-7 reference point;\n-\tdistribute downlink media to MCVideo UEs using multicast downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCVideo-8 reference point; and\n-\tprovide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined into a single media stream for transmission to the MCVideo UE.\nNOTE 1:\tIf media mixing function occurs within the media distribution function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tA media mixing function within the media distribution function is not possible where the media is end to end encrypted.\nThis functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for sending and receiving one or multiple media streams. It also provides support for combining multiple media streams into one media stream through the enforcement of media policy information. It supports the storing of a media stream as MCVideo content files.\nThis functional entity contains information of the MCVideo user profile associated with an MCVideo ID that is held by the MCVideo service provider at the application plane. The MCVideo user profile is determined by the mission critical organization, the MCVideo service provider, and potentially the MCVideo user.\nThe MCVideo ID is a MC service ID as described in clause 8 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]. The MCVideo user profile is a MC service user profile as described in clause 10.1.4 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].\nThe MCVideo user profile can be co-located with other MC service user profiles and stored in a common MC service user database.\nThis functional entity provides support for centralised transmission control for on-network and distributed transmission control for off-network operation. It may schedule transmission requests according to uplink criteria from different transmission control participants, send an notification to all transmission control participants to allow them to receive the video according to downlink criteria if the transmission request is granted, and provide queuing in cases of contention. Transmission control applies to all MCVideo communications including group call and private call. For on-network operation, this functional entity is located with the MCVideo server. For off-network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.\nThe transmission control participant functional entity is responsible for handling outgoing transmission requests and the incoming video stream invitations and notifications. This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-network operations.\nThe MC gateway server provides support for MCVideo interconnection services with a partner MCVideo system in a different trust domain whilst providing topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCVideo servers in the partner MCVideo system without needing to expose the MCVideo servers in the primary MCVideo system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCVideo system. It may be a role of the MCVideo server described in subclause 6.2.2.3.2 of the present document.\nThe MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor control signalling messages, and media between MCVideo servers within the MCVideo system and the interconnected MCVideo system.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [14]\n",

SIP signalling is used to setup and release pre-arranged group calls.\n7.1.2.3.1.1.2\tPre-arranged group call setup\nThe procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo client is initiating an MCVideo group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated members of that group.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo group call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCVideo users on client 1, client 2 and client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the group management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA pre-arranged group is an MCVideo group that is pre-defined with MCVideo group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the group belong to the same MC system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and affiliated.\n3.\tThe MCVideo client 1 may have an activated functional alias to be used.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n5.\tThe MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 may have bound a functional alias to the MCVideo group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [6]).\nThe figure depicts a pre-arranged group call setup, with participants arranged in a specific order to facilitate a smooth conversation. The visual elements include the participants' names, the order in which they are seated, and the arrangement of the room. This setup is crucial for maintaining a professional and efficient conversation, as it ensures that each participant has a clear view of the other and can easily communicate with them.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo group call with a selected group (identified by MCVideo group ID). The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo group call.\nNOTE 1:\tThe selected functional alias is not changed during the group call, i.e. a MCVideo client uses the same functional alias until the group call is released or the MCVideo client has left the group call.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCVideo server via the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCVideo group ID. The group call request also contains the MCVideo group ID and an SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters. If the MC service user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional alias. If there is a transmit media request, then the group call request contains an indication for the implicit transmit media request. If the group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\n3.\tMCVideo server checks whether the user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initiate a group call for the selected group. If a functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether it is allowed to be used and if it has been activated for the user. If authorized and the group call is ongoing for that MCVideo group ID, the MCVideo server adds the requesting MCVideo client 1 to the existing MCVideo group call and notifies the MCVideo client 1 that the MCVideo group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCVideo server resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCVideo server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCVideo server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nNOTE 2:\tMCVideo server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally cached on the MCVideo server then MCVideo server requests the user/group configuration data from the MCVideo user database/group management server.\n4.\tMCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group call request via the SIP core towards the MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated group members. MCVideo users are notified about the incoming group call and, if present, the functional alias of the initiating MC service user is displayed. The MCVideo server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the call.\n5.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients accept the group call request, and a group call response is sent to the group host MCVideo server. This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be based on configuration.\n6.\tMCVideo server sends the group call response including the selected media parameters to the MCVideo client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n7.\tIf the initiating MCVideo user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated MCVideo group members, and the required MCVideo group members do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the MCVideo server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the initiating MCVideo user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to group policy. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo group call.\n8.\tMCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media plane and transmission control for communication.\n7.1.2.3.1.1.3\tRelease pre-arranged group call\nThe procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo server initiates the termination of an ongoing MCVideo group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo group call.\nThe figure depicts a release pre-arranged group call, with the participants arranged in a specific order. The visual representation shows the participants' names and the time of the call, with the call duration and the status of the call displayed.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged group call setup).\n2.\tMCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo group call which is ongoing e.g., last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated group members are not present.\n3.\tMCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and generates group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tMCVideo server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call.\n5.\tMCVideo users are notified about the release of the group call.\n6.\tMCVideo client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards the MCVideo server by sending a group call release response.\n7. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the media transmission control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is terminated.\n7.1.2.3.1.1.4\tLate entry pre-arranged group call\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo server requesting a newly affiliated member or a member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCVideo group call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the same MC system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n are on an ongoing call.\n3.\tOptionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have activated functional alias to be used.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a late entry pre-arranged group call, with participants arranged in a specific order. The visual representation shows the participants' positions relative to each other, with the most recent participant at the top, followed by the second-most recent, and so on. The figure is labeled with the figure number, which is 7, followed by the group number, which is 1, and the time, which is 2:31. The figure is a visual aid for understanding the timing and sequence of the call, which is crucial for managing late entries in a group call.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call\n1.\tMCVideo server determines that MCVideo client 1 which is newly affiliated or coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group call (late entry).\n2.\tMCVideo server generates group call request including the information such as MCVideo service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCVideo server), MC service group ID of the group invited to join, offer one or more media types and sends towards the MCVideo client 1 via SIP core.\n3.\tMCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is notified about the incoming group call.\n4.\tUpon MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 accepting the incoming group call request, MCVideo client 1 sends the group call response including the selected media types to the MCVideo server through the signalling path. If the incoming group call request is rejected by the MCVideo client 1, the MCVideo server should not resend the group call request\n5.\tMCVideo client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about the MCVIDEO client 1 joining the group call.\n6.\tA notification with the information of media transmissions in the group call is sent to MCVideo client1.\nEditor's Note: Checking of functional alias of MCVideo client 1 by the MCVideo server is FFS.\n7.1.2.3.1.1.5\tRejoining call\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client to rejoin an ongoing MCVideo group call (e.g. coming back from out of coverage).\nPre-condition:\n1\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n are on an ongoing call.\n2.\tOptionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have activated functional alias to be used.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a call rejoin scenario in a telecommunications network, showing the steps taken to rejoin a call after a failed connection. The diagram illustrates the process of rerouting the call to a different network or device, and the steps involved in the rejoin process, such as reconfiguring the network, updating the call log, and ensuring the call is successfully completed.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group call, then the MCVideo client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including the ongoing group call information. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo rejoin request.\n2.\tMCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo client 1 can rejoin the ongoing call (e.g. based upon affiliation status) and checks the functional alias, if present.\n3.\tMCVideo client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by sending a group call rejoin response.\n4.\tMCVideo client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about the MCVideo client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCVideo client 1 may be displayed.\n5.\tA notification with the information of media transmissions in the group call is sent to MCVideo client 1.\n7.1.2.3.1.2.1\tGeneral\nIn a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCVideo user individually joins a group call without being explicitly invited by the MCVideo server. The establishment of a chat group (restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCVideo client initiating an MCVideo group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call model. The chat group (restricted) call model can be used to realize the video conferencing service where only users that have been configured as participants for the video conferencing group are allowed to join the group communications for the given group.\nChat group join mechanism:\n-\tEach MCVideo client sends a group join request when the MCVideo user wants to participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not impact the MCVideo user's membership in the group; the MCVideo server will verify that the MCVideo user is an authorized member of the group.)\n-\tThe group join request may include a transmit media request. If the group join request includes a request to transmit media it may also include location information. It is assumed that the group join request will be delivered from MCVideo client to MCVideo server using SIP.\n-\tIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call.\n-\tThe group join request is used to indicate to the MCVideo server that the MCVideo user associated with the given MCVideo client wishes to participate (begin to receive notifications for media transmissions) from the group.\n-\tThe group join request shall cause the MCVideo server to generate an implicit affiliation for the MCVideo user to the group, if the user is not already affiliated to the group.\n-\tThe group join request contains the information needed to negotiate media parameters (on demand) or to associate a pre-established session between MCVideo server and MCVideo client for the group call. The group join request can take the form of a SIP invite.\n-\tA selected functional alias is not changed by a MCVideo client during the whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCVideo client uses the same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat group call is released or the MCVideo client leaves the chat group call.\nSubsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat model:\n-\tOnce an MCVideo client successfully joins a group call which is using the chat model, the MCVideo client connects to the media plane for the media transmission if the media transmission is currently ongoing.\n-\tIf the MCVideo group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCVideo clients on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between transmission control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCVideo client will only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.\n-\tIf the newly joined MCVideo user wishes to transmit media to the other joined users of the group using the chat model, then the MCVideo client shall use a normal transmission control procedure for transmitting the media.\n-\tSubsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using transmission control signalling.\n-\tThe MCVideo server may tear down the media plane between successive group calls using the chat model, or the MCVideo server may allow the media plane to remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on resources.\nLeaving and releasing a chat group:\n-\tWhen a user wants to leave a chat group call, the client shall send a group call leave request to the server and release the media plane.\n-\tThe server can release a chat group call by sending a group call release to all joined clients. A server initiated release also releases the media plane for all joined clients.\n7.1.2.3.1.2.2\tChat group call setup\nMCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCVideo service provider in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCVideo user 2 and MCVideo user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the group call. MCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users (MCVideo user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to use the MCVideo service.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may have activated functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call communication. No call is currently in progress for the group.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n4.\tThe MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 may have bound a functional alias to the MCVideo group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [6]).\nThe figure depicts a video call group call setup, with multiple participants connected to a single video call. The participants are arranged in a circular formation, with the central participant being the main focus. The figure shows the participants' avatars, their position relative to each other, and the video call interface. The layout is designed to facilitate easy navigation and interaction between the participants.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCVideo chat group call\n1.\tMCVideo user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group. This may include a transmit media request.\n1a.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a group join request with the MCVideo group ID of the desired group. It contains the MCVideo user's MCVideo ID and the MCVideo client media parameters. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo group join request. If there is a request for media transmission, then the group join request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media request. If the group join request includes an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\n1b.\tThe MCVideo server receives the group join request. MCVideo server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCVideo user is not already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCVideo user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure for MCVideo. If a functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether it is allowed to be used and if it has been activated for the user.\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group join request, or via binding, the MCVideo server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group join request and via binding, it is up to the MCVideo server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call.\n1c.\tThe MCVideo server replies with a group join response indicating the acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCVideo server selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.\n2.\tIf MCVideo user 1 requests to transmit media by sending transmit media request to MCVideo server, the MCVideo server establishes the media plane (if not already established) for the call.\n3.\tTransmission control will continue to be used by the transmission control participants associated with MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 for the duration of the call. .If present, the functional alias of MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 are displayed where appropriate.\n7.1.2.3.1.2.3\tRelease chat group call\nThe procedure describes the case where the MCVideo server releases an ongoing MCVideo group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to chat duration expiry, last participant leaving or initiator leaving.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure for an MCVideo user leaving the group call is a different procedure.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCVideo server initiating the release of an ongoing MCVideo group call.\nThe following precondition applies:\n- A group call is ongoing between MCVideo clients 1, 2 and 3\nThe figure depicts a release chat group call, showing a group of participants engaged in a conversation. The participants are represented by different colored dots, with each dot representing a participant. The conversation is represented by a line connecting the dots, indicating the flow of the conversation.

The user's position is marked by a red dot, and the group's center is marked by a green dot. The figure shows the user's position relative to the group's center, indicating that the user is leaving the group call.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.3-1: MCVideo user leaving a group call\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a group call leave request to the MCVideo server.\n2.\tMCVideo server sends a group call leave response to MCVideo client 1.\n3.\tRelease of transmission control and media plane resources associated with the group call for MCVideo client 1.\nNOTE 1:\tMCVideo server checks if group call termination conditions are met, e.g. last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present . If at least one of the group call termination conditions is met, the MCVideo server releases the group call for all participants (see subclauses 7.1.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call and 7.1.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat group call).\n4.\tMCVideo users at MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n may be notified that the MCVideo user of client 1 has left the group call.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MCVideo server does not perform late entry for MCVideo users that have left the group call.\n\nA broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCVideo user expects no response from the other MCVideo users, i.e. no response from the recipients is required to start media transmission and the call ends when the media transmission is complete.\nOnly the call originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call and the broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete.\nFigure 7.1.2.4.2-1 illustrates the common procedure both for group-broadcast group call and user-broadcast group call.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are members of a group-broadcast group/user-broadcast group.\nThe figure depicts a group call scenario on B road, with participants on the left and right sides of the call.

The signalling procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause 7.1.2.3.1.1 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call indicator.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 starts to transmit media.\nNOTE 1:\tOnly the call originating MCVideo user is allowed to transmit media on broadcast group call.\nNOTE 2:\tA broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over group calls on its subordinate groups.\n3.\tIf the media transmission from call originating MCVideo user is complete, the broadcast group call is released.\nThe procedure describes the case where an MCVideo client is initiating an MCVideo emergency group call with the affiliated MCVideo group members of that MCVideo group. An MCVideo client in the MCVideo emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCVideo user's mission critical applications. Initiating an MCVideo emergency group call puts the MCVideo group into the in-progress emergency state. While in the in-progress emergency state, all MCVideo group calls in the MCVideo group are processed as MCVideo emergency group calls by the MCVideo server until the emergency state of the MCVideo group is cancelled.\nFigure 7.1.2.5.1.1-1 shows the procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo emergency group call with an MCVideo group i.e., MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 belong to the same MCVideo group which is defined on group management server.\nNOTE 1:\tFor simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.\n3.\tThe initiating MCVideo client 1 has been provisioned with an MCVideo group that has been designated via provisioning as the MCVideo emergency group.\n4\tMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may have an activated functional alias to be used during the emergency group communication.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nNOTE 2:\tAlternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency behaviour on the selected group.\nThe figure depicts a group call setup in a MCVideo emergency call system, with various components such as the emergency call button, the call center, and the call center operator. The call center is equipped with a speaker, microphone, and a display screen, while the call center operator has a headset and a microphone. The emergency call button is located at the bottom of the screen, and the call center operator can initiate the call by pressing the button. The system is designed to handle multiple calls simultaneously, ensuring a smooth and efficient call center experience.\nFigure 7.1.2.5.1.1-1: MCVideo emergency group call\n1.\tThe user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency group call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of MCVideo client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.\nNOTE 3: While MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo emergency calls.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo emergency group call request towards the MCVideo server. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo emergency group call request. The request contains an indication of the MCVideo emergency. The MCVideo server records the identity of the MCVideo user that initiated the MCVideo emergency group call until the MCVideo emergency state of the group is cancelled. Once an MCVideo emergency call has been initiated, the MCVideo group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until the emergency state of the group cancelled. If configured to send an MCVideo emergency alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency group call, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo emergency alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit media request.\nNOTE 4:\tWhile the MCVideo group is in the in-progress emergency state, all MCVideo group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by the MCVideo server. MCVideo group members that are not in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group call requests but can set the requested priority of all group call requests to high priority.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server implicitly affiliates MCVideo client 1 to the emergency group if the client is not already affiliated.\n4.\tMCVideo server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the MCVideo user, and whether the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized for initiation of MCVideo emergency calls on the indicated MCVideo group, and if authorized, it resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that MCVideo group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group management server.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all participants in the MCVideo group.\nNOTE 5:\tSuccessive calls during the MCVideo group's in-progress emergency state will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.\n6.\tMCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert.\n7.\tMCVideo users are notified of the incoming MCVideo group call, and, if available, the functional alias of the initiating user is displayed.\n8.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo emergency group call request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n9.\tThe MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the MCVideo user 1 to inform the successful MCVideo emergency call establishment.\nNOTE 6:\tStep 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\nMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully established media plane for communication. MCVideo transmission control participant 1, transmission control participant 2 and transmission control participant 3 exchange transmission control information e.g., MCVideo client 1 receives the transmit media granted information over the established media plane, while the other MCVideo client's receive media available notification with forced reception information. MCVideo client 1 indicates to the MCVideo user that the permission is granted to transmit media, while the other MCVideo clients in the MCVideo emergency group call will be receiving that media. MCVideo client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are also in the MCVideo emergency state.\nThe procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is upgrading an MCVideo group call to an MCVideo emergency group call while the MCVideo group call is already in progress.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client upgrading an MCVideo group call on an MCVideo group to an MCVideo emergency group call.\nNOTE 1:\tFor simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.\n3.\tAn MCVideo group call is already in progress.\n4.\tThe initiating MCVideo client 1 has been configured to send an MCVideo emergency alert when upgrading an MCVideo emergency group call.\nThe figure depicts a group call upgrade from MCVideo to an emergency group call, illustrating the process of upgrading a group call to an emergency group call. MCVideo is a standard group call protocol, while emergency group call is a more advanced version that provides enhanced features such as priority routing and priority signaling. The figure shows the steps involved in upgrading the group call, including the configuration of the new protocol, the addition of priority routing and signaling, and the integration with the existing network infrastructure.\nFigure 7.1.2.5.1.2-1: MCVideo group call upgraded to an MCVideo emergency group call\n1.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of MCVideo client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.\nNOTE 2: While MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo emergency calls.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 requests the MCVideo server to upgrade the MCVideo group to an in-progress emergency state by sending an MCVideo emergency group call request. If configured to send an MCVideo alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit media request.\nNOTE 3:\tWhile the MCVideo group is in the in-progress emergency state, all MCVideo group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by the MCVideo server. MCVideo group members that are not in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group call requests but can set the requested priority of all group call requests to high priority.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all participants in the MCVideo group.\n4.\tMCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert.\n5.\tMCVideo users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCVideo group.\n6.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo group emergency request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the MCVideo user 1 to confirm the upgrade request. If the MCVideo emergency request contained an implicit transmit media request, the OK message contains the result of the implicit transmit media request.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\nMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 continue with the MCVideo group call, which has been transformed into an MCVideo emergency group call. MCVideo client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are also in the MCVideo emergency state.\nNOTE 1:\tIn Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this subclause is \"MCVideo emergency group call cancel\".\nThe procedure describes the case where an MCVideo client cancels an MCVideo group's in-progress emergency state. The emergency state of the group may alternatively be cancelled by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a group.\nNOTE 2:\tFor simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.\nNOTE 3:\tThe end of the MCVideo emergency group call does not cancel the MCVideo group's in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized user using this procedure, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.\n3.\tMCVideo group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.\n4.\tThe MCVideo group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized bearer support.\n5.\tMCVideo client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the group.\nThe figure depicts a video conference call in progress, with the emergency group state set to cancel. The video feed is paused, indicating that the call is currently not in progress.\nFigure 7.1.2.5.1.3-1: MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel\n1.\tThe user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel.\nNOTE 4:\tAn MCVideo user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the MCVideo group can also be authorised to cancel the MCVideo emergency alert in addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the initiator's local MCVideo emergency state.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request to the MCVideo server.\nNOTE 5:\tIf an MCVideo emergency alert relating to MCVideo client 1 is in effect together with an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state on the MCVideo group, the MCVideo emergency alert of MCVideo client 1 can be cancelled at the same time. In that case, the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCVideo client 1 is also being cancelled.\nNOTE 6:\tIf an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request is received by the MCVideo server while a group member that is in the emergency state is transmitting, the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request is rejected by the MCVideo server.\n3.\tMCVideo server resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that MCVideo group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from group management server.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority treatment is no longer required. The MCVideo server cancels/resets the emergency in-progress state of the MCVideo group.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server sends an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request to the MCVideo group members.\n6.\tMCVideo group members are notified of the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel.\n7.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n8.\tThe MCVideo server sends the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel response to the MCVideo user 1 to confirm the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel. If the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCVideo client 1 resets its local emergency status.\nNOTE 7:\tStep 8 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCVideo user is initiating an imminent peril group call for communicating with the affiliated MCVideo members of that MCVideo group. This procedure will gain elevated access privilege for the MCVideo client if it is not already in that state. The access privilege for other applications will not necessarily be affected.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.5.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an imminent peril group call with an MCVideo group i.e., MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 belong to the same MCVideo group which is defined on MCVideo group management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.\n3.\tThe initiating MCVideo client 1 has been provisioned with an MCVideo group that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril communications.\n4.\tMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may have an activated functional alias to be used during the emergency group communication.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nNOTE 1:\tAlternatively, the client could have been provisioned for imminent peril behaviour on the selected group.\nThe figure depicts a group call in a MCVideo application, with the imminent peril group being highlighted.

It shows a network of video encoders and decoders, with each device connected to a specific input and output port. The setup includes a router, which forwards packets between the encoders and decoders, and a switch, which distributes the packets across the network. The figure illustrates the importance of network design and the role of routers and switches in ensuring efficient video transmission.\nFigure 7.1.3.3.2-1: MCVideo group communication setup\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a Group communication announcement message to the MCVideo group.\n2.\tUpon receiving the Group communication announcement message, all MCVideo clients that are not part of an ongoing group communication for the MCVideo group indicated in the Group communication announcement message set parameters for the media plane as described in the Group communication announcement message.\n3.\tThe MCVideo clients send a group communication answer response to the MCVideo group confirming the participation in the MCVideo group communication. On receiving a group communication answer response message from at least one MCVideo client, other MCVideo clients need not send a group communication answer response message. If the Group communication announcement message included a confirm mode indication, then the MCVideo clients should send a group communication answer response message.\nNOTE 1:\tMCVideo client 1 should wait for at least one group communication answer response message before transmitting video to the MCVideo group.\n4.\tMCVideo client 1 checks the participants of the MCVideo group communication through the received group communication answer response messages.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio coverage) during the off-network group communication, the Group communication announcement message, including parameters for media delivery, is periodically sent.\nNOTE 3:\tGroup communication announcement may include user ID, group ID, media type codec, control port for transmission video, video resolution and video frame rate, video mode, last chage time of video mode etc.\n5.\tMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully established the media plane and transmission control for communication.\nThere is ongoing group communication between multiple MCVideo clients. Another MCVideo client, after becoming aware of that group communication and after it has received periodically sent communication parameters, joins the group with or without sending an indication to other group members.\nFigure 7.1.3.4.2-1 describes procedures to join a MCVideo group communication passively.\nThe MCVideo client X passively waits for a Group communication announcement message. Upon receiving a periodic Group communication announcement message, MCVideo client X establishes media plane and joins the MCVideo group communication.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tInformation for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo client 1 to client N and client X.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N and MCVideo client X are members of the same MCVideo group.\n3.\tMCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are part of an ongoing MCVideo group communication.\nThe figure depicts a passive join to MCVideo group communication, illustrating the process of joining two MCVideo groups. The diagram shows the steps involved in the join process, including the selection of the appropriate MCVideo group, the creation of a new MCVideo group, and the addition of the selected group to the existing MCVideo group. The figure is a visual representation of the communication process, providing a clear and concise explanation of the steps involved.\nFigure 7.1.3.4.2-1: Passive join to MCVideo group communication\n1.\tAnother MCVideo client X enters in the communication range after the MCVideo group communication establishment. The MCVideo client X does not do anything and passively waits for a periodic Group communication announcement message.\n2.\tAn MCVideo client which is part of the ongoing MCVideo group communication eventually sends a periodic Group communication announcement message.\n3.\tUpon receiving the periodic Group communication announcement message MCVideo client X sets the parameters for  media plane as described in the Group communication announcement message.\n4.\tIf the Group communication announcement message included a confirm mode indication, MCVideo client X may sends a group communication answer response towards MCVideo group to inform all MCVideo group members of its participation the MCVideo group communication.\n5.\tMCVideo group communication continues with the MCVideo client X.\nThere is ongoing group communication between multiple MCVideo clients. Another MCVideo client, after becoming aware of that group communication, sends a request to get the required communication parameters and after feedback joins the group with or without sending an indication to other group members.\nFigure 7.1.3.5.2-1 describes procedures to join a MCVideo group communication actively.\nThe MCVideo client X sends a Group communication announcement message towards the MCVideo group.\nUpon receiving a Group communication announcement message with new communication parameters, such as communication identifier, a MCVideo client participating in the on-going group communication for the MCVideo group sends a Group communication announcement message.\nThe Group communication announcement message contains parameters for the on-going MCVideo group communication. MCVideo client X upon receiving such a Group communication announcement message establishes the media plane as described in the message and joins the MCVideo group communication.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tInformation for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo client 1 to client N and client X.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N and MCVideo client X are members of the same MCVideo group.\n3.\tMCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are part of an ongoing MCVideo group communication.\nThe figure depicts a network setup where a user is joining a group communication session on a media center video server (MCVideo). The user is connected to the media center server through a media center video server (MCVideo) and is part of a group communication session. The user is connected to the media center server through a media center video server (MCVideo) and is part of a group communication session.\nFigure 7.1.3.5.2-1: Active join to MCVideo group communication\n1.\tAnother MCVideo client X enters in the communication range after the MCVideo group communication establishment. The MCVideo client X sends a Group communication announcement message to start a newMCVideo group communication.\n2.\tUpon receiving a Group communication announcement message with new communication parameters, such as communication identifier, another MCVideo client, which is part of the ongoing MCVideo group communication sends a Group communication announcement message.\n3.\tUpon receiving the Group communication announcement message MCVideo client X sets parameters for the media plane as described in the Group communication announcement message.\n4.\tIf the Group communication announcement message included a confirm mode indication, MCVideo client X may send a group communication answer response towards MCVideo group to inform all MCVideo group members of its participation the MCVideo group communication.\n5.\tMCVideo group communication continues with the MCVideo client X.\nFigure 7.1.3.6-1 describes procedures for broadcast group communication.\nBroadcast group communication over group-broadcast group and over user-broadcast group are handled without distinction in off-network.\nThe figure depicts a broadcast group communication scenario, illustrating the various communication paths and their respective roles in a broadcast group. The figure includes a central transmitter, a group of receivers, and a relay node, all connected by a network of communication paths. The relay node plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth transmission of the broadcast group's message, while the other nodes contribute to the overall communication process.\nFigure 7.1.3.6-1: Broadcast group communication\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 initiates group communication setup as described in subclause 7.1.3.3. The group communication announcement message includes the indication of broadcast group communication.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 initiating broadcast group communication starts to transmit video.\nNOTE:\tOther clients of the group member are not allowed to transmit media in broadcast group communication.\n3.\tThe broadcast group communication is released as described in subclause 7.1.3.7.\n\nIf the on-going MCVideo group communication is inactive for a specific duration, the participating MCVideo clients release the MCVideo group communication. Inactivity is defined as absence of any transmission to or from other communication participants.\nNOTE:\tInactivity time can be set according to the policy of MC service provider.\nThe off-network emergency group communication is a special case of off-network (non-emergency) group communication as defined in subclause 7.1.3.2, subclause 7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause 7.1.3.6 and subclause 7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to support MCVideo emergency group communications:\n-\tAs a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency communication has previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group designated as the MCVideo emergency group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo emergency group communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client could have been provisioned for emergency behaviour on the selected MCVideo group.\n-\tThe group communication announcement contains an indication that the MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo emergency communication regardless of whether or not the MCVideo client is in communication. Group communication participants learn of the MCVideo group's in-progress emergency state from the indication.\n-\tEvery communication initiated by the MCVideo client will be an emergency communication while the MCVideo client is in MCVideo emergency state.\n-\tThe MCVideo client enters the MCVideo emergency state when initiating an MCVideo emergency communication or emergency alert. Only the MCVideo user of the MCVideo client can clear the client's local MCVideo emergency state.\n-\tThe MCVideo group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the communication ends.\n-\tThe MCVideo user who initiated the emergency communication, or upgraded the group communication to emergency group communication, or an authorized user, may cancel the in-progress emergency state with an MCVideo emergency group communication cancel message. The message is sent to the MCVideo group.\n-\tWhen the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state, every client returns the value of ProSe Per Packet Priority to its default value.\n-\tAn in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an emergency group communication when the periodic group communication announcement contains the emergency indicator.\n-\tThe value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency state of MCVideo group communication.\n-\tAn MCVideo group communication upgraded to emergency group communication does not affect the state of other MCVideo communication(s) in the client.\n-\tThe MCVideo group remains in the in-progress emergency state until the emergency group communication ends or the in-progress emergency state is cancelled.\nThe off-network imminent peril group communication is a special case of off-network (non-imminent peril) group communication as defined in subclause 7.1.3.2, subclause 7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause 7.1.3.6 and subclause 7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to support MCVideo imminent peril communications:\n-\tAs a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril communication has previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group to be used as the MCVideo imminent peril group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo imminent peril group communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client could have been provisioned for imminent peril behaviour on the selected MCVideo group.\n-\tThe group communication announcement contains an indication that the MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo imminent peril communication. Group communication participants learn of the MCVideo group's in-progress imminent peril condition from the indication.\n-\tThe MCVideo group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled when the communication ends.\n-\tThe MCVideo user who initiated the in-progress imminent peril communication or upgraded the group communication to imminent peril group communication, or an authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an MCVideo imminent peril group communication cancel message. The message is sent to the communication participants.\n-\tWhen the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress imminent peril state, every MCVideo client returns the value of ProSe Per Packet Priority to its default value.\n-\tAn in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an imminent peril group communication when the periodic group communication announcement contains the imminent peril indicator.\n-\tThe value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to imminent peril state of MCVideo group communication.\n-\tThe MCVideo group remains in the in-progress imminent peril state until the imminent peril group communication ends or the in-progress imminent peril state is cancelled.\n\nThe MCVideo client use emergency alert initiation and emergency alert cancel procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6], with the following clarifications:\n-\tThe MC service ID is the MCVideo ID; and\n-\tThe MC service group ID is the MCVideo group ID.\n\n",

The MCVideo private call request contains the MCVideo ID or the functional alias of invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCVideo client 1 may include a Requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.\nNOTE 1:\tAs part of this step, MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 set up a security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n3.\tMCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initiate the private call, and that MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 is authorized to receive the private call.

If the functional alias of the calling user is included, it is displayed.\n8.\tMCVideo user 2 is notified and has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e., has taken some action to accept via the user interface).\n9.\tThe MCVideo client 2 sends an MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo server. If MCVideo user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCVideo client 2 sends a call failure response to the MCVideo server without adding reason for call failure.\n10.\tThe MCVideo server sends an MCVideo private call response to MCVideo client 1 indicating that MCVideo user 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted media parameters.\n11.\tThe media plane and transmission control for communication is established.\nThe procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo client is requesting to release an ongoing MCVideo private call (with or without transmission control) and the call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic).\nProcedures in figure 7.2.2.3.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client initiating the release of an ongoing MCVideo private call.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and are involved in private call as described in subclause 7.2.2.3.1 and subclause 7.2.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a private call release scenario in a 2.2.3 network, where the client initiates the call release. The release is initiated by the client, and the call is released to the network. The figure shows the network's response to the call release, including the routing of the call to the appropriate network segment.\nFigure 7.2.2.3.3.1-1: Private call release – client initiated\n1.\tUser at MCVideo client 1 would like to release an ongoing MCVideo private call with MCVideo client 2.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo server (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call with the other client.\n3.\tMCVideo server sends the corresponding MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo client specified in the original MCVideo call end request.\n4.\tMCVideo user is notified about the release of the private call.\n5.\tThe receiving MCVideo client 2 acknowledges the MCVideo call end request with a MCVideo call end response.\n6.\tAfter receiving the MCVideo call end response from MCVideo client 2, the MCVideo server generates an MCVideo call end response for the MCVideo client 1's MCVideo call end request.\n7.\tMCVideo clients release all the media plane resources used for the private call. Further, if the private call was established with transmission control, transmission control resources are released.\nThe procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo server is terminating an ongoing MCVideo private call  and the call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic), upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCVideo administrator configured maximum duration for MCVideo private calls has expired or timed out due to MCVideo private call without transmission/reception.\nProcedures in figure 7.2.2.3.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo private call.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and are involved in private call established either in manual or automatic commencement mode.\nThe figure depicts a call termination scenario in a private network, with the server initiating the end of the call. The call is initiated by the user, and the server is responsible for terminating the call. The figure shows the server's interface, which includes a call setup button, a call status bar, and a call termination button. The call termination process involves the server initiating the call, the user initiating the call, and the call being terminated by the server.\nFigure 7.2.2.3.3.2-1: End private call – server initiated\n1.\tUpon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCVideo administrator configured maximum duration for MCVideo private calls has expired or timed out due to MCVideo private call without transmission/reception, the MCVideo server decides to initiate termination of an ongoing MCVideo private call between MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2.\n2.\tMCVideo server sends an MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo clients 1 and 2 (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call between them.\n3.\tMCVideo users at client 1 and client 2 are notified about the termination of the private call.\n4.\tThe MCVideo call end request receiving MCVideo clients 1 and 2 acknowledge the request with MCVideo call end response.\n5.\tMCVideo clients release all the media plane resources used for the private call. Further, if the private call was established with transmission control, transmission control resources are released.\nThis procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is initiating an MCVideo emergency private call with unicast signalling for communicating with another MCVideo user. An MCVideo client in the MCVideo emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCVideo user's mission critical applications.\nProcedures in figure 7.2.2.4.1-1 are the procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo emergency private call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tBoth members of the MCVideo private call belong to the same MCVideo system.\n2.\tThe initiating MCVideo client 1 has been configured to send an MCVideo emergency alert prior to initiating an MCVideo emergency private call.\n3.\tOptionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have a functional alias activated to be used.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a private emergency call made using MCVideo technology, with the call being routed through a private network. The call is encrypted and secured, ensuring confidentiality and privacy.\nFigure 7.2.2.4.1-1 MCVideo emergency private call\n1.\tThe user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency private call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. MCVideo client 1 retains the MCVideo emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo emergency calls.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo emergency private call request towards the MCVideo server. The request contains an indication of the MCVideo emergency. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo emergency private call. The MCVideo server verifies whether the provided functional alias can be used. The MCVideo server records the identity of the MCVideo user that initiated the MCVideo emergency private call until the MCVideo emergency is cancelled. If the MCVideo client is configured to send an MCVideo emergency alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency private call, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo emergency alert is to be initiated.\n3.\tMCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency private call request towards the target MCVideo client. The request contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert. If available the request contains the functional alias of the calling MCVideo user 1.\n4.\tThe MCVideo user on MCVideo client 2 is notified of the incoming MCVideo emergency private call. If the functional alias of the calling user is included it is displayed.\nNOTE 2:\tMCVideo client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of receiving the MCVideo emergency private call.\n5.\tThe receiving MCVideo client acknowledges the MCVideo emergency private call request to the MCVideo server via a MCVideo emergency private call response.\n6.\tThe MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server informs MCVideo client 1 about the successful MCVideo emergency private call establishment via a MCVideo emergency private call response.\n8.\tMCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 establish the media plane and transmission control for video communication.\nNOTE 3:\tThe priority for the MCVideo emergency private call is retained until cancelled according to system policy (e.g. call end) or cancelled by an authorized MCVideo user.\nNOTE 4:\tThe initiating MCVideo user's MCVideo emergency state is retained by the system until cancelled as in subclause 7.1.2.6, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2. The initiating MCVideo user's MCVideo emergency state is also retained locally by the MCVideo client until explicitly cancelled by the MCVideo user.\nThis procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is upgrading a private call to an MCVideo emergency private call while the private call is already in progress.\nProcedures in figure 7.2.2.4.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the MCVideo client upgrading a private call to an MCVideo emergency private call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tBoth members of the private call belong to the same MCVideo system.\n2.\tA private call is already in progress.\nThe figure depicts a private call upgrade in MCVideo, which is a video conferencing application. The upgrade involves the use of a new video codec, which is designed to improve the quality of video calls. The figure shows the new codec's features, such as support for higher frame rates and improved audio quality, as well as the new video format, which is designed to be more efficient and consume less bandwidth. The figure also includes a comparison of the old codec with the new one, highlighting the benefits of the upgrade.\nFigure 7.2.2.4.2-1: MCVideo private call upgrade\n1.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an emergency. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. MCVideo client 1 retains the MCVideo emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo emergency calls.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 requests the MCVideo server to upgrade the private call to in-progress emergency by sending an MCVideo emergency private call request. If configured to send an MCVideo alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit media request.\n3.\tMCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency request towards MCVideo client 2, the MCVideo client of the other participant.\n4.\tThe MCVideo user of MCVideo client 2 is notified of the in-progress emergency of the MCVideo emergency private call.\nNOTE 2:\tMCVideo client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of receiving the MCVideo emergency private call upgrade.\n5.\tThe receiving MCVideo client acknowledges the MCVideo emergency request to the MCVideo server.\n6.\tThe MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call ends.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server confirms the upgrade request to MCVideo client 1. If the MCVideo emergency request contained an implicit transmit media request, the MCVideo emergency private call response message contains the result of the implicit transmit media request.\n8.\tMCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 continue with the private call, which has been transformed into an MCVideo emergency private call. MCVideo client 1 can override MCVideo client 2 unless MCVideo client 2 is also in the MCVideo emergency state.\n",

Only the called party is allowed to transmit video.\nProcedures in figure 7.3.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of MCVideo private call with the chosen MCVideo user for video pull.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tOptionally, MCVideo client 1 may have a functional alias activated to be used.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a one-to-one video pull system, illustrating the process of video transmission between two devices. The system uses a single optical fiber to transmit the video signal, with a single optical line terminal (OLT) at each end. The figure shows the arrangement of the OLTs, with one OLT at each end of the video signal path. The system is designed to ensure reliable and efficient video transmission, with redundancy paths to ensure failover in case of failure. The figure also highlights the importance of SDN principles in the design of this video pull system.\nFigure 7.3.2.3.2-1: One-to-one video pull\n1.\tMCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 initiates video pull from MCVideo client 2, by sending a private call request to the MCVideo server using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] for MCVideo, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCVideo user for video pull. The MCVideo private call request contains MCVideo ID of invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media types and the video pull indication to indicate that invited user is requested to transmit video to the requester. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo private call request.\n2.\tMCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initiate the private call for video pull, and that MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 is authorized to receive the private call for video pull.

If the called MCVideo user has registered to the MCVideo service with multiple MCVideo UEs and has designated the MCVideo UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCVideo private call request is delivered only to the designated MCVideo UE.\n5.\tThe MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private call for video pull. If a functional alias of the calling user is included it is displayed.\n6.\tThe receiving MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call for video pull, and sends an MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo server with an implicit transmit media request.\n7.\tUpon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2 accepting the private call request for video pull, the MCVideo server informs the MCVideo client 1 about successful call establishment via a private call response message.\n8.\tMCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media plane and transmission control for media communication.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the video transmission is completed, the private call is released.\nThe private call release procedure specified in subclause 7.2.2.3.3 is used for one-to-one video pull call release.\nOne-from-server video pull is a private call between the calling party and the MCVideo server that allows the calling party to request streaming of  a video from the server where it is stored in a file. The one-from-server video pull ends typically when the end of the video file has been reached or when the transmission is stopped by the calling user or by the MCVideo server.\nNOTE: This procedure fulfills the requirements for the stage 1 replay of stored video feature.\nProcedure in figure 7.3.2.4.2-1 is the basic signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of MCVideo video pull from the MCVideo server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCVideo user 1 on MCVideo client 1 has been authenticated and authorized to use MCVideo service.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 is registered.\n3.\tMCVideo client 1 has been received the URL of a video file available on the MCVideo server, e.g. within an MCData SDS.\nThe figure depicts a one-to-server video pull scenario in a video streaming network. It illustrates the flow of video data from the source to the destination, with the source being the server and the destination being the client. The figure shows the various components involved in the video pull process, such as the source server, the video encoder, the video decoder, and the video streaming network. The figure also includes a flow chart to illustrate the steps involved in the video pull process, including the encoding, decoding, and transmission of the video data.\nFigure 7.3.2.4.2-1: One-from-server video pull\n1.\tMCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 initiates the pull of a video from the server and sends an MCVideo pull from server request to the MCVideo server.

Transmission control server will also determine the availability of the media at the server to initiate the downlink reception.\n7.\tTransmission control server sends a receive media response message to transmission control participant B.\nNOTE:\tStep 5 to 7 may be omitted when auto-receive (i.e. forced reception mode) transmission mode is used based on configurations (e.g. for emergency group calls, imminent peril calls etc) as described in Annex A.\n8.\tTransmission control server sends video media to transmission control participant B.\n9. Optionally, the transmission control server sends media reception notification message to transmission control participant A which includes the information about the video recipient (transmission control participant B).\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2A-1 describes the procedure for the receiving user initiated media reception end. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCVideo session is established between MCVideo clients (client A and client B) and MCVideo server\n2.\tTransmission control is established between transmission control participants and transmission control server.\n3.\tTransmission control participant A has been granted the permission to transmit media.\nThe figure depicts a user-initiated end media reception scenario, showing the end media receiver (EMS) receiving a user-initiated signal. The figure includes a user interface (UI) and a control panel (CP), allowing the user to configure the settings and monitor the signal quality. The figure also includes a display panel (DP) to show the received signal strength (RSS) and other relevant information.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2A-1: End media reception – receiving user initiated\n1.\tThe MCVideo user determines to end a receiving video stream.\n2.\tThe user sends an media reception end request including the video stream to be ended to the transmission control server.\n3.\tThe transmission control server returns a media reception end response.\n4.\tUpon receiving the media reception end request, the transmission control server stops sending the video stream selected to the transmission control participant B.\n5.\tIf the end media reception at transmission control participant B causes the video transmission continuation condition to fail, then the transmission control server initiates the media transmission end procedure as described in subclause 7.7.1.3.6.2.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2B-1 describes the procedure for the transmission control server initiated media reception end. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCVideo session is established between MCVideo clients (client A and client B) and MCVideo server\n2.\tTransmission control is established between transmission control participants and transmission control server.\n3.\tTransmission control participant A has been granted the permission to transmit media.\n\nThe figure depicts a communication system with a transmission control server (TCS) initiating end media reception (EMR) for a 2B-1 signal. The TCS is responsible for managing the transmission of the signal, ensuring proper signal quality and reliability. The figure also shows the end media reception (EMR) process, which involves the reception of the signal by the end device (e.g., a mobile phone or a router). The figure is important for understanding the communication process and the role of the TCS in managing the signal.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2B-1: End media reception – transmission control server initiated\n1.\tThe transmission control server determines to end a video stream transmitting to transmission control participant B according to events or configurations.\n2.\tThe transmission control server sends an media reception end request including the video stream to be ended to the transmission control participant B.\n3.\tThe MCVideo user is notified about the media reception end.\n4.\tThe transmission control participants B returns a media reception end response.\n5.\tThe transmission control server stops sending the video stream selected to the transmission control participant B.\n6.\tIf the end media reception at transmission control participants B causes the continuation conditions to fail, then the transmission control server initiates media transmission end procedure as described in subclause 7.7.1.3.6.2.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2C-1 describes the procedure for the reception control on overridden with mandatory mode that the transmission control server determines the video stream to be overridden. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCVideo session is established between MCVideo clients (client A and client B) and MCVideo server.\n2.\tTransmission control is established between transmission control participants and transmission control server.\n3.\tTransmission control participant A has been granted the permission to transmit media.\nThe figure depicts a reception control system with two modes: mandatory and optional. The mandatory mode requires the receiver to receive the signal, while the optional mode allows the receiver to receive the signal but not to transmit it. The system is designed to ensure that the receiver receives the signal, even if the transmitter is not active.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2C-1: Reception control on overriding/overridden – mandatory mode\n1.\tA new media stream is to be delivered to the transmission control participant B while the maximum number of simultaneous streams is reached. The transmission control server determines to override another media stream being received by the transmission control participant B accord to the media stream characteristics.\n2.\tTransmission control server sends a media reception override notification message to the transmission control participant B including information about the video stream being overridden and stop the downlink delivery of the overridden video stream to the transmission control participant B. The overriding video stream information maybe also included.\n3.\tThe user of UE B is notified about the details of overriding/overridden.\n4.\tThe transmission control server initiates the media reception end procedure as described in subclause 7.7.1.3.2B. 5.\tThe transmission control server performs the normal reception control procedure as described in subclause 7.7.1.3.2.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2D-1 describes the procedure for the reception control on overridden with negotiated mode that the transmission control participant determines the video stream to be overridden. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCVideo session is established between MCVideo clients (client A and client B) and MCVideo server\n2.\tTransmission control is established between transmission control participants and transmission control server.\n3.\tTransmission control participant A has been granted the permission to transmit media.\n\nThe figure depicts a 2D representation of reception control on overriding/overridden - negotiated mode, showing the various negotiation methods and their corresponding control points.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.2D-1: Reception control on overriding/overridden – negotiated mode\n1.\tA new media stream is to be delivered to the transmission control participant B while the maximum number of simultaneous streams is received. The transmission control server determines to override another media stream being received by the transmission control participant B according to the media stream characteristics.\n2.\tTransmission control server sends a media transmission notification message to the transmission control participant B including information about the new video stream.\n3.\tThe user of transmission control participant B is notified about the maximum number of simultaneous streams received. The MCVideo user determines to reject the video stream or accept the video streaming by overriding a receiving video stream.\n4.\tThe transmission control participant initiates the media reception end procedure as described in subclause 7.7.1.3.2A.\n5.\tThen the transmission control participant B requests to receive the new video stream as the normal reception control procedure described in subclause 7.7.1.3.2.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.3-1 describes the procedure for transmission revoke during an MCVideo session. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCVideo session is established between MCVideo clients (client A and client B) and MCVideo server\n2.\tTransmission control is established between transmission control participants and transmission control server.\n3.\tTransmission control participant B has been granted the permission to transmit media and there may be ongoing media transmission from transmission control participant B.\n4.\tThe maximum media transmission limit for the MCVideo session is reached.\nThe figure depicts a transmission revoke during an MC Video session, illustrating the process of revoking a video stream to prevent unauthorized access or modification. The figure shows the various components involved in the revocation process, such as the video stream, the MC Video session, and the revocation request. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.3-1: Transmission revoke during an MCVideo session\n1.\tTransmission control participant A wants to send video media over the session.\n2.\tTransmission control participant A sends a transmit media request message to transmission control server which includes transmission priority and other information as necessary.\n3.\tTransmission control server determines to accept the transmit media request from transmission control participant A and decides to pre-empt the on-going video transmission from transmission control participant B by queuing or ending the on-going video transmission.\n4.\tTransmission control server responds with a transmission revoked message (4a) to transmission control participant B with the action of pre-emption whether queued or terminated. Transmission control server responds with a transmit media granted message (4b) to transmission control participant A.\n5.\tThe transmission revoked shall cause the transmission control participant B to be notified of the revoke (5a) of the on-going video transmission by queuing or termination. The transmit media granted shall cause the user of UE A where the transmission control participant A is located to be notified.\n6.\tTransmission control participant A starts sending video media over the session established to the transmission control server.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.4-1 describes the procedure where the transmission control is conducted for the MCVideo session already established between MCVideo clients (with transmit media granted to transmission control participant B) and server (with an revoke determination at transmission control server). Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nThe figure depicts a queue status during an MC Video session, showing the number of active users in the queue and the number of users waiting to be served. The status is represented by a bar graph with different colors, indicating the number of users in each queue. The figure provides a visual representation of the system's performance and helps in understanding the system's capacity and efficiency.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.4-1: Queue status during an MCVideo session\n1.\tIt is assumed that transmission control participant B has been granted permission to transmit media and is transmitting video media. There are several other transmission control participants (including transmission control participant A) requesting video transmission which get queued at the transmission control server.\n2.\tTransmission control participant A would like to know its current position in the video transmission queue.\n3.\tTransmission control participant A sends a queue position request message to the transmission control server.\n4.\tTransmission control server determines the current queue position of transmission control participant A from the video transmission queue.\n5.\tTransmission control server responds with the current position in queue position info message.\n6.\tUser at transmission control participant A is informed about the current queue position.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.5.1-1 illustrates the procedure for transmit media request cancellation from the video transmission queue initiated by the MCVideo user. The MCVideo user may be an authorized user who has rights to cancel the transmit media requests of other MCVideo users, whose transmit media requests are in video transmission queue.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that transmission control participant B has been granted the permission for video transmission and is transmitting video. There are several other transmission control participants (including transmission control participant A and transmission control participant C) requesting the permission to transmit media which have been queued at the transmission control server.\nThe figure depicts a media request cancellation process initiated by a user in a video streaming application. The process involves initiating a media request cancellation from the queue, which is initiated by the MC Video user. The figure illustrates the flow of the process, including the initiation of the request, the initiation of the queue, and the initiation of the cancellation.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.5.1-1: Transmit media request cancellation from queue initiated by MCVideo user\n1.\tThe transmission control participant A wants to remove the transmit media request from the video transmission queue. If transmission control participant A is an authorized MCVideo user with the rights to cancel another MCVideo user's transmit media request, the authorized MCVideo user may request for transmit media request cancellation for one or more transmission control participants, whose transmit media request needs to be removed from the video transmission queue.\n2.\tThe transmission control participant A sends a transmit media cancel request (initiating MCVideo ID) message to the transmission control server. If the transmission control participant A wants to remove the transmit media request(s) of other participant(s), the target participant(s)' MCVideo ID should be included in this message.\n3.\tThe transmission control server shall check whether the requesting transmission control participant has authorization to cancel the transmit media request(s). If authorized, the transmit media request(s) will be removed from the video transmission queue. When the on-going transmissions are completed and are within the limit of the maximum simultaneous transmissions, the transmission control server will process the transmit media request from the updated video transmission queue.\n4.\tIf the transmit media cancel request in step 3 is sent by an authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) to cancel the transmit media request(s) of other participant(s) from the video transmission queue, the transmit media cancel request notify message is sent to the transmission control participant whose transmit media request was cancelled from the video transmission queue.\n5.\tThe transmission control server provides a transmit media cancel response to the transmission control participant A when the transmit media request cancellation is completed. Optionally, the new queue position information may be notified to the transmission control participants whose transmit media requests are in the video transmission queue (not shown in the figure).\nFigure 7.7.1.3.5.2-1 illustrates the procedure for transmit media request cancellation from the queue initiated by the transmission control server. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that transmission control participant B has been granted the permission to transmit media and is transmitting video. There are several other transmission control participants (including transmission control participant A and participant C) requesting the permission to transmit media which have been queued at the transmission control server.\nThe figure depicts a communication system where a transmission control server initiates a media request cancellation from the queue. The request is initiated by the transmission control server, which is responsible for managing the transmission of media requests. The figure shows the flow of media requests from the queue to the transmission control server, and the initiation of the request cancellation process.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.5.2-1: Transmit media request cancellation from queue initiated by transmission control server\n1.\tThe transmission control server removes the transmit media request from the video transmission queue based on policy. e.g., expiration of a timer. In the case when transmission control server receives repeated transmit media requests from a transmission control participant while the limit for maximum simultaneous media transmissions has reached, the new transmit media request is accepted and added into the video transmission queue and the existing/former transmit media request is removed from the video transmission queue or the new transmit media request is rejected and the existing/former transmit media request of this transmission control participant is retained in the video transmission queue.\n2.\tThe transmission control server sends a transmit media cancel request notify to the transmission control participant(s) whose transmit media request is removed from the video transmission queue.\n3.\tOptionally, the new queue position information is notified to the other transmission control participants whose transmit media requests are queued.\nFigure 7.7.1.3.6.1-1 describes the procedure for ending a media transmission during an MCVideo session by a MCVideo user.

                            "text_content": "The procedure is for providing transmission control to MCVideo UE in an off-network case. Transmission control is performed by using transmission control information flows between the transmission control participant and the transmission control arbitrator. The transmission control arbitrator is a member MCVideo UE of the MCVideo group where the transmission rules are applied.\nOff-network transmission control is based on ProSe capabilities as described in clause 7.18.\nTransmission control in off-network can be performed in two ways:\n-\tSingle arbitrator: transmission participants rely on a single participant designated as transmission arbitrator for the arbitraton of transmission requests.\n-\tSelf arbitration: each transmsission participant arbitrates its own transmission based on its view of the topology.\nBoth of the approaches, as appropriate for the deployment model, can be adopted for MCVideo group using a configurable parameter (as defined in Annex A.4).\nIn the single arbitrator approach, one MCVideo client assumes the responsibility for arbitration of transmission requests for all group members within range. All requests for transmission are directed to the arbitrator, and the arbitrator checks the configured limits on the simultaneous transmissions, and grants or denies the request. If an MCVideo client is out of range of the current arbitrator, the MCVideo client is allowed to transmit and also become a transmission arbitrator.  If there is insufficient capacity to carry an extra transmission i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may request that an existing transmitting MCVideo client is pre-empted; the pre-emption request is sent to the transmission arbitrator.\nIn the self arbitration approach, each MCVideo client decides for itself whether there is sufficient capacity to carry the transmission. If it determines that there is insufficient capacity i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous transmissions is reached, and from its perspective another transmitting MCVideo client has a lower priority, the requesting MCVideo client may send an override request directly to this other transmitting MCVideo client, which will either accept the override request and give way, or deny the override request.\nIn both the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach, if there is insufficient capacity to carry the communication i.e. the configured limit on the simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may report this to the MCVideo user. The MCVideo user may decide to transmit anyway, and instruct the MCVideo client to proceed with the transmission.\nNOTE:\tThe ProSe function within the MCVideo client could determine that there is insufficient capacity to carry an MCVideo call requested by the MCVideo client, however interactions between the MCVideo client and the ProSe function are outside the scope of the present document.\nFurther subclauses apply to one or both of the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach. Applicability is explicitly indicated in each of the relevant subclauses.\nTable 7.7.2.2.1-1 describes the information flow for the transmission request sent by a transmission participant to request for the transmission permission. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.1-1: Transmission request\n\nTable 7.7.2.2.2-1 describes the information flow for the transmission granted sent by the transmission arbitrator, to indicate that a request for transmission is granted and media may be transmitted. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.2-1: Transmission granted\n\nTable 7.7.2.2.3-1 describes the information flow for transmission release sent by the transmission participant, to indicate that the media transmission is complete and transmission permission is released. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.3-1: Transmission release\n\nTable 7.7.2.2.4-1 describes the information flow for transmission rejected sent by the transmission arbitrator, to indicate that a request for the transmission is rejected. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.4-1: Transmission rejected\n\nTable 7.7.2.2.5-1 describes the information flow for transmission revoked sent by the transmission arbitrator, to indicate that the transmission permission, that was earlier granted, is revoked. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.5-1: Transmission revoked\n\nTable 7.7.2.2.6-1 describes the information flow for transmission taken sent by the transmission participant, to indicate that the transmission participant has taken the responsibility of transmission arbitration. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.6-1: Transmission arbitration taken\n\nTable 7.7.2.2.7-1 describes the information flow for transmission arbitration release sent by the transmission arbitrator, to indicate that the responsibility of transmission arbitration is released. This information flows is sent in unicast or broadcast.\nTable 7.7.2.2.7-1: Transmission arbitration release\n\nThis subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.\nFigure 7.7.2.3-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an MCVideo client initializes transmission control. The MCVideo client sends a transmission request to detect presence of a transmission arbitrator. If the MCVideo client does not receive a response to the transmission request, it sends a transmission arbitration taken message and becomes the transmission arbitrator. The MCVideo client may now transmit a video. This procedure applies when either there have been no recent MCVideo transmissions within the MCVideo group and therefore no arbitrator has been selected, or where there have been recent MCVideo transmissions which may still be ongoing, but the arbitrator cannot be reached, e.g. where MCVideo client that wants to transmit video has gone out of range of the arbitrator.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 wishes to transmit video, and has determined that the pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group has not been reached.\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a transmission control system (TCS) in a 3-1-1 arbitration case, with a single arbitrator. The system is initialized with a transmission control signal (TCS) and a single arbitrator. The figure illustrates the process of arbitration, where the arbitrator selects the next transmission control signal (TCS) based on the current state of the system. The figure is used to understand the basic structure and components of a 3-1-1 arbitration case in a TCS.\nFigure 7.7.2.3-1: Initializing transmission control, single arbitrator case\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo group.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 does not detect any response to the transmission request.\n3a.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a transmission arbitration taken message to the MCVideo group.\n3b.\tMCVideo user may be notified that the video can now be transmitted.\n4.\tMCVideo client 1 transmits video to the MCVideo group.\nThis subclause is applicable only in self arbitration approach.\nFigure 7.7.2.3a-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an MCVideo client initializes transmission control.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 wishes to transmit video.\n\nThe figure depicts a transmission control and self-arbitration case in a 3GPP network, illustrating the process of initializing transmission control and self-arbitration. The figure includes various elements such as the transmission control unit (TCU), self-arbitration unit (SAU), and the signaling system. The figure is crucial for understanding the network's control and self-management mechanisms.\nFigure 7.7.2.3a-1: Initializing transmission control, self arbitration case\n1.\tThe MCVideo client checks whether the pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached and informs the user. If the pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached, the MCVideo user may defer the transmission, or request an override as specified in subclause 7.7.2.8, or decide to continue with the transmission anyway.\nNOTE:\tIf the MCVideo user decides to transmit even if the pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached, the MCVideo user decides to accept any consequences of interference.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a transmission arbitration taken message to the MCVideo group.\n3.\tMCVideo client 1 transmits video to the MCVideo group.\nThis subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.\nFigure 7.7.2.4-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an MCVideo client requests for transmission permission.\nThe MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo client sends a transmission request and waits for a response. The MCVideo client upon receiving a transmission granted message may transmit a video.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tAt least one participant is currently transmitting video.\n\nThe figure depicts a request for transmission permission in a 4G network, illustrating the process of requesting permission from the network to transmit data. The figure shows a user interface with various options for transmitting data, such as \"Requesting transmission permission\" and \"Requesting transmission permission with encryption.\" The figure also includes a \"Requesting transmission permission\" button, which can be clicked to initiate the transmission process.\nFigure 7.7.2.4-1: Requesting transmission permission\n1.\tMCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo group.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks if the configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached.\n3.\tIf the maximum simultaneous transmissions limit is not reached, MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo group. Transmission granted message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended recipient.\n4.\tMCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video can now be transmitted.\n5.\tMCVideo client 2 transmits video to the MCVideo group.\nThis subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.\nFigure 7.7.2.5-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an MCVideo client requests for transmission permission.\nThe MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo client sends a transmission request and waits for a response.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tAt least one participant is currently transmitting video.\n\nThe figure depicts a request for transmission permission in a 5G network, illustrating the process of requesting permission from the network to transmit data. The figure shows a user interface with various options for requesting permission, such as \"Requesting transmission permission\" and \"Requesting transmission permission for a specific user.\" The figure also includes a visual representation of the network architecture, with the requestor's device (e.g., a smartphone) connected to the network, and the network's infrastructure (e.g., a base station) in the background.\nFigure 7.7.2.5-1: Requesting transmission permission\n1.\tMCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo group.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks if the configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached.\n3.\tIf the maximum simultaneous transmissions limit has reached, MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission rejected message to the MCVideo group. Transmission denied message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended recipient. The transmission rejected message may include a rejection cause which indicates that the configured maximum transmissions limit has been reached.\n4.\tMCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video cannot be transmitted right now.\nFollowing step 4, the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may decide to transmit anyway, for example if the user knows the topology of the off-network MCVideo group and locations of the MCVideo group members and needs to transmit video to other local MCVideo group members despite causing a potential conflict with one or more other existing MCVideo transmissions within the MCVideo group. In this case, the MCVideo client follows the procedure in subclause 7.7.2.3.\nThis subclause is applicable in both the single arbitrator and self arbitration approaches.\nFigure 7.7.2.6-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an MCVideo client releases transmission permission.\nThe MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo client stops the video transmission and sends a transmission release request.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tMCVideo client has requested transmission permission and may have received transmission permission.\nThe figure depicts a request for transmission permission in a 6-1 network, illustrating the process of requesting permission from the network to transmit data. The figure shows a user interface with various options for transmitting data, such as \"Requesting transmission permission\" and \"Requesting transmission permission with encryption.\" The figure also includes a \"Requesting transmission permission\" button, which can be clicked to initiate the transmission process.\nFigure 7.7.2.6-1: Requesting transmission permission\n1.\tIf transmitting, the MCVideo client 2 stops the transmission of the video.\n2.\tMCVideo client 2 sends a transmission release message to the MCVideo group.\nNOTE:\tThe transmission arbitrator does not respond to a pending (not granted or denied) transmission request if a transmission release notification is received from the MCVideo client.\n\nThis subclause is applicable in the single arbitrator in the approach.\nFigure 7.7.2.7-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an MCVideo client authorized to override, requests for transmission permission.\nThe MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo client sends a transmission request and waits for a response.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tMaximum simultaneous transmissions limit has been reached.\n\nThe figure depicts a transmission override in a 7-1 system, illustrating the process of manually overriding a transmission in the event of a failure. The figure shows a graphical representation of the system, with arrows indicating the flow of data and the status of the transmission. The figure is labeled with the figure number and the corresponding system number, allowing for easy identification and understanding of the system's components and their interconnections.\nFigure 7.7.2.7-1: Transmission override\n1.\tMCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo group.\n2.\tAs the configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached, MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks the override policy.\n3.\tIf MCVideo client 2 is authorized to override (based on e.g., transmission priority), MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission revoked message to the MCVideo group. Transmission revoked message indicates the MCVideo client from which the permission is revoked, as the intended recipient.\n4.\tMCVideo client 3 stops transmission of video and MCVideo user at MCVideo client 3 may be notified that the transmission permission has been revoked.\n5.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo group.

There is no other MCVideo client to which transmission arbitration can be delegated.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tOnly MCVideo client 1 is transmitting a video.\n\nThe figure depicts a transmission arbitration release without delegation, which is a crucial aspect of network management and control. It illustrates the process of releasing a transmission arbitration request without the need for a delegate, ensuring that the network remains stable and efficient. The figure is a visual representation of the process, with arrows indicating the flow of information and the release of the arbitration request.\nFigure 7.7.2.9.1-1: Transmission arbitration release without delegation\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a transmission release message to the MCVideo group.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 stops transmission of the video.\nThis subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.\nFigure 7.7.2.9.2-1 describes procedures for an MCVideo client to release transmission arbitration. There are other MCVideo clients currently transmitting to which transmission arbitration can be delegated.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group communication has been established.\n2.\tAt least one more MCVideo client is transmitting video other than the current transmission arbitrator.\n\nThe figure depicts a transmission arbitration release with delegation, illustrating the process of releasing a transmission arbitration request to a delegate. The figure shows a release button, a delegate, and a receiver, with the delegate receiving the arbitration request and releasing it to the receiver. This process is crucial in ensuring efficient and reliable communication in a network.\nFigure 7.7.2.9.2-1: Transmission arbitration release with delegation\n1.\tMCVideo client 1 stops video transmission but does not release transmission arbitration.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a transmission arbitration release message. The transmission arbitration release message indicates a MCVideo client which is currently transmitting video, MCVideo client 2, as the subsequent transmission arbitrator. The MCVideo client 1 waits for a confirmation before releasing transmission arbitration.\n3.\tMCVideo client 1 detects no response from MCVideo client 2.\n4.\tMCVideo client 1 sends another transmission arbitration release message. The transmission arbitration release message indicates another MCVideo client which is currently transmitting video, MCVideo client 3, as the subsequent transmission arbitrator.

The group call setup procedure indicates the media stream or media streams within one MBMS bearer that is used for the specific MCVideo group call. When the group call over the MBMS bearer is finished, this temporary association information of an MCVideo group call to specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The procedure in figure 7.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the call start. This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to continuously use a unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBMS bearer is activated and announced to the MCVideo clients.\nIn figure 7.10.4.2.1-1 the MCVideo client 1 is the client that initiate an MCVideo chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCVideo client 1 may, but does not have to be in an MBMS service area. The MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 represents MCVideo clients receiving the MCVideo call over an MBMS bearer.

The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCVideo group ID and information about the media stream identifier or media stream identifiers of the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer broadcasting the call.

This message is sent over a unicast bearer (reference point MCVideo-4).\n5.\tA media transmission notification message is sent from the MCVideo server to all receiving users. This message includes the MCVideo ID of the transmitting MCVideo client as well as the MCVideo group ID. The message is sent over a MBMS bearer to all users that have previously been setup to receive calls over the MBMS bearer.

The expected parameters including codec, resolution, frame rate and etc. are included.\n2.\tMCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has the authorization to update the MCVideo communication parameters.\n3.\tWhen authorized, MCVideo server sends the MCVideo communication parameter update request to the MCVideo client 2.\n4.\tThe MCVideo user of MCVideo client 2 is notified about the request of MCVideo communication parameters update.\n5.\tThe MCVideo client 2 accepts the request, and sends the MCVideo communication parameter update response to the MCVideo server.\n6.\tThe MCVideo server sends the MCVideo communication parameter update response to the MCVideo client 1 with the result.\n7.\tThen, the MCVideo communication applies the new MCVideo communication parameters.\n",

The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the target MCVideo group may be used by the ProSe layer as the target group info and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nPrior to initiating an off-network MCVideo group communication, a group member discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the target MCVideo group are in the proximity of the calling MCVideo user, as described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The off-network MCVideo group communication using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication procedure for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nFor an off-network one-to-one MCVideo communication, the MCVideo client obtains configuration data such as the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of the target MCVideo user from the \"List of user(s) who can be called in MCVideo private call\" in the MCVideo user profile and requests the IP address of the MCVideo UE associated with the target MCVideo user from the ProSe layer.\nThe MCVideo client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the communication with the target MCVideo UE by providing the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) associated to the target MCVideo user. This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure to identify whether the target MCVideo user is in the proximity of the calling MCVideo user. The user info ID of the target MCVideo user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nThe ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCVideo user to the MCVideo client to initiate the off-network one-to-one MCVideo communication based on the one-to-one ProSe direct communication procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\n",

This is left for the implementation.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call, showing the various components and their arrangement. The setup includes a base station (BS), a group of users (UG), and a router (R). The diagram illustrates the setup process, including the placement of the base station, the distribution of the users, and the routing of the data between the users. The figure is useful for understanding the components and their arrangement in an ad hoc group call setup.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call. The MCVideo client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call request containing the list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert to the MCVideo server. Encryption supported information element shall be set to true since end-to-end encryption is supported. An SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters is included. If there is a transmit media request to transmit media, then the ad hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media request. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\nIf the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency ad hoc group call or the MCVideo emergency state is already set for the MCVideo client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCVideo emergency alert):\ni.\tthe MCVideo ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;\nii.\tif the MCVideo emergency state is not set already, MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of MCVideo client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server accepts the ad hoc group call request if the ad hoc group call is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject the ad hoc group call request and do not continue with the rest of the steps. If authorised, it validates whether the number of invited participants is within the configured limit before proceeding with the call setup.\nIf functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether the provided functional alias allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCVideo users on a call when talking\").\nIf an emergency indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and\nIf an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.\nIf the the MC service users' information received in step 1 does not contain an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server forms the ad hoc group by using MCVideo users' information received in step 1, determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group and assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.\nThe MCVideo server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message to MCVideo client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tThe MCVideo ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCVideo server or provided by the MCVideo client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);\nii.\tThe group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and\niii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.\nIf the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, MCVideo client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4a-4c.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCVideo clients of the invited users based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the MCVideo server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCVideo clients (e.g. MCVideo ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge)\n5a-5c.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc group call.\n6a-6c.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients accept the ad hoc group call requests and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCVideo server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCVideo user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCVideo server.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCVideo client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed since the MCVideo server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc group call request to complete before sending the ad hoc group request to another participant.\n8.\tIf the initiating MCVideo user requires the acknowledgement from the invited MCVideo users, and the required MCVideo users do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the MCVideo server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the initiating MCVideo user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to ad hoc group call policy from the user profile configuration. The MCVideo server may notify the initiating MCVideo user of all MCVideo users who did not acknowledge the ad hoc group call request within the configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group call.\n9.\tMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4 establish media plane and transmission control resources.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 9 can occur any time following step 7 if the conditions to proceed with the call are met.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where the MCVideo server releases an ongoing MCVideo ad hoc group call for all the participants of that ad hoc group call, since at least one of the release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure for the MCVideo server initiating termination an ongoing ad hoc group call.\nThe figure depicts a release ad hoc group call, showing a group of participants connected to a central server, with a clear visual representation of the call's structure and participants.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.2-1: Release ad hoc group call\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call.\n2.\tMCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo ad hoc group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.\n3.\tMCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group call and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing session. The MCVideo server cancels the in-progress emergency state or in-progress imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the ad hoc group call is an emergency or imminent peril call respectively.\n4.\tMCVideo server sends ad hoc group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group call.\n5.\tMCVideo users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.\n6.\tMCVideo client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, acknowledge towards the MCVideo server by sending an ad hoc group call release response.\nNOTE:\tIf the initiator of the ad hoc group call does not supply the participants list, the MCVideo client(s) may choose to store the list of participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group call with the same participants.\n7.\tMCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the transmission control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group call that is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e., further call is not possible over the same ad hoc group, otherwise if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the ad hoc group continues to exist (i.e., further calls over the same ad hoc group are possible).\nFigure 7.19.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure initiated by the MCVideo user and MCVideo client 1 wherein the list of participants is determined by the MCVideo server based on the citeria received from the MCVideo client.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 wants to invite MCVideo users who are satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group call.\nThe figure depicts a network setup where MCVideo server is used to determine the participants in an ad hoc group call. The participants are determined by analyzing the video content and the server's response.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group call participants determined by MCVideo server\n1.\tUser at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call in-order to invite the participants satisfying specific criteria. The MCVideo client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call request containing the details of the criteria to be applied by the MCVideo server for determining the participants list. If end-to-end encryption is supported, the Encryption supported information element shall be set to true and pre-configured MCVideo group whose configuration is to be applied is included. An SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters is included. If there is a transmission request to transmit, then the ad hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media request. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\nIf the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency ad hoc group call or the MCVideo emergency state is already set for the MCVideo client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCVideo emergency alert):\ni.\tthe MCVideo ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;\nii.\tif the MCVideo emergency state is not set already, MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of MCVideo client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server accepts the ad hoc group call request if the ad hoc group call is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject the ad hoc group call request and do not continue with the rest of the steps.\nIf functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCVideo users on a call when talking\").\nIf an emergency indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and\nIf an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.\nIf the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server forms the ad hoc group by using received information, and determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group. The MCVideo server assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. Further, the ad hoc group participants are included to ad hoc group once determined as specified in the step 4.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message to MCVideo client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tThe MCVideo ad hoc group ID, either generated by the MCVideo server, if not included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MCVideo ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCVideo server, or provided by the MCVideo client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency alert;\nii.\tThe group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session is authorized); and\niii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not\nIf the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, MCVideo server and client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server determines the list of participants to be invited for the ad hoc group call based on the information present in the information element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying pre-defined criteria or a combination of both.\nNOTE 1:\tThe content of the Criteria information element, the details of the pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCVideo server determines the list of participants are left to implementation.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCVideo clients 2 and 3. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the MCVideo server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCVideo clients. This request carries the pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCVideo server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n6.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc group call.\n7.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients accept the ad hoc group call requests and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCVideo server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCVideo user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCVideo server.\n8.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCVideo client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.\n9.\tThe MCVideo server may notify the initiating MCVideo user of all MCVideo users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group call. If the authorized users (not shown in figure) are configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc group call, the MCVideo server provides ad hoc group call notify about all MCVideo users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call, and when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group call.\nNOTE 2:\tThe authorized user can learn who is currently affiliated to the current adhoc group call.\nEditor's note: How an authroized user determine the currently affiliated status of adhoc group is FFS.\n10.\tMCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 establish media plane and transmission control resources.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.4-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group call participants procedure by an authorized user.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn ad hoc group call is already in progress and the participants list is provided by the originating MCVideo user while initiating the MCVideo ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe participants of the MCVideo ad hoc group call belong to the single MCVideo system.\n3.\tThe MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 3 to MCVideo client n are on an ongoing ad hoc group call.\n4.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 determines to remove the user of MCVideo client 3 from the ad hoc group call and add user of MCVideo client 2 into the on-going ad hoc group call.\n\nThe figure depicts a modification of ad hoc group call participants by an authorized user, showing how the user can modify the call participants list to include authorized users. This modification is crucial for ensuring the security and privacy of the call.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.4-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by an authorized user\n1.\tThe MCVideo user at the MCVideo client 1 is authorized and requests to modify ad hoc group call participants. The MCVideo client 1 sends the modify ad hoc group call participants request to the MCVideo server in order to remove MCVideo client 3 from the ongoing ad hoc group call and add MCVideo client 2 into it.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server verifies whether the MCVideo client 1 is authorized to add or remove (modify) the participants of the on-going ad hoc group call.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server sends modify ad hoc group call participants response to the MCVideo client 1.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call leave request to the MCVideo client 3 in order to remove it from the on-going ad hoc group call.\n5.\tThe MCVideo client 3 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave request.\n6.\tThe MCVideo client 3 sends the ad hoc group call leave response to the MCVideo server.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call request towards MCVideo client 2.\nNOTE:\tSteps 7 to 9 can occur at any time following step 3.\n8.\tThe receiving MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc group call.\n9.\tThe MCVideo client 2 accepts the ad hoc group call request and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCVideo server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCVideo user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCVideo server. The MCVideo server considers the MCVideo user as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n10.\tThe MCVideo server may notify the initiating MCVideo user of all the users who are added to the on-going ad hoc group call. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the ad hoc group call.\n11.\tThe MCVideo server may notify the participants about the change in the participants of on-going ad hoc group call.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.5-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group call participants procedure by the MCVideo server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo client 1 is the initiator of the ad hoc group call.\n2.\tMCVideo server determined the participants for the ad hoc group call based on the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1 while initiating the ad hoc group call.\n3.\tMCVideo server continuously evaluates the criteria to monitor the list of users who meets or not meets the criteria for participating in the on-going ad hoc group call.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server detects that the MCVideo client 5 satisfies the criteria and MCVideo client 4 stops to meet the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1.\n\nThe figure depicts a modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCVideo server, illustrating the process of adding or removing participants from a group call. The figure shows the MCVideo server's interface, which allows users to modify the group call participants. The modification process is depicted in a step-by-step manner, with each step clearly labeled. The figure is a visual representation of the MCVideo server's functionality, providing a clear and concise explanation of how the server can be used to modify group call participants.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.5-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCVideo server\n1.\tThe ad hoc group call is established and on-going with the participants MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4. The participants list is determined by the MCVideo server based on the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1 while initiating the call\n2.\tThe MCVideo server detects that the MCVideo client 5 satisfies the criteria specified by the MCVideo client.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call request to the MCVideo client 5.\n4.\tThe MCVideo client 5 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc group call.\n5.\tThe MCVideo client 5 accepts the ad hoc group call request and sends the ad hoc group call response to the MCVideo server.\n6.\tThe on-going ad hoc group call is updated by adding MCVideo client 5 which satisfies the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server detects that the MCVideo client 4 is no more satisfying the criteria to be the participant of the ad hoc group call.\n8.\tThe MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call leave request to the MCVideo client 4 and removes it from the on-going ad hoc group call.\n9.\tThe MCVideo client 4 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave request.\n10.\tThe MCVideo client 4 sends the ad hoc group call leave response to the MCVideo server.\n11.\tThe on-going ad hoc group call is updated by removing MCVideo client 4, which no more satisfies the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1.\n\nFigure 7.19.3.2.1-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein the list of participants is determined by the MCVideo server based on the criteria received from the MCVideo client and determined MCVideo users are from multiple MCVideo systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system share their users' information to the primary MC system.\n2.\tThe authorized MCVideo user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server 1 of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCVideo user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.\n4.\tSome users of the ad hoc group belong to MCVideo server 2 of the partner MC systems.\n5.\tThe pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCVideo client and other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group communication.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call involving multiple MCVideo systems. MCVideo is a video communication protocol that allows for real-time video communication over a network. The setup includes a base station (BS) and multiple MCVideo systems, each equipped with a video camera and a microphone. The BS sends video and audio signals to the MCVideo systems, which then transmit the video and audio to the users. The setup is designed to ensure reliable communication and is suitable for ad hoc group calls.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup involving multiple MCVideo systems\n1-3.\tSame as described in subclause 7.19.3.1.3.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server 1 determines the list of participants from the primary MC system and determines the partner MC system to be involved in the ad hoc group call based on the information present in the information element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element carries the criteria, indicator identifying pre-defined criteria, or a combination of both.\nNOTE 1:\tThe content of the Criteria information element, the details of the pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCVideo server determines the list of participants are left to implementation.\n5.\tIf the MCVideo server 1 needs to involve the partner system based on the agreement and based on the criteria for determining the participants list, it sends the ad hoc group call get userlist request to the MCVideo server 2. This request carries the criteria specified in the step 1.\n6.\tMCVideo server 2 evaluates the criteria and determines the participants satisfying the criteria (i.e. MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4) and sends the response containing the list of MCVideo users satisfying the criteria. The partner MCVideo server may apply local policies if any while determining the participants satisfying the criteria.\n7.\tThe MCVideo server 1 compiles the list of participants to be invited for the ad hoc group call including the participants from both primary and partner MC system.\n8a-8b.\tThe MCVideo server 1 sends the ad hoc group call request towards the MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4. While sending the ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCVideo clients. This request carries the pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group call if end-to-end encryption is requested.

The MCVideo server 1 more than once during the call may send this notification to the initiating MCVideo user whenever an MCVideo user joins or leaves the MCVideo ad hoc group call. If the authorized users (not shown in figure) are configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc group call, the MCVideo server provides ad hoc group call notify about all MCVideo users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call, and when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group call.\n16.\tThe MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4 establish media plane and transmission control resources.\nNOTE 2:\tThe ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCVideo server 1 of primary MC system and MCVideo client 3/MCVideo client 4 will always traversal through the MCVideo server 2.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.2-1 below illustrates the MCVideo server modifying the ad hoc group call participants procedure involving multiple MCVideo systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server 1 of the primary and MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo systems determined the participants for the ad hoc group call based on the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1 while initiating the ad hoc group call.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server 1 of the primary and MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo systems continuously evaluates the criteria to monitor the list of users who meets or not meets the criteria for participating in the on-going ad hoc group call.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server 1 of the primary MCVideo system detects that the MCVideo client 3 meets the criteria and MCVideo client 2 stops to meet the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo system detects that the MCVideo client 5 meets the criteria and MCVideo client 4 stops to meet the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1.\n\nThe figure depicts a modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCVideo server, illustrating the process of adding or removing participants from a group call.

This procedure, in particular describes about how the partner MC system is notified about ad hoc group call release to cease the determining of the participants by the partner MC system.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server 1 of the primary and MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo systems determined the participants for the ad hoc group call based on the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1 while initiating the ad hoc group call.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server 1 of the primary and MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo systems continuously evaluates the criteria to monitor the list of users who meets or not meets the criteria for participating in the on-going ad hoc group call.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a scenario where MCVideo server releases an ad hoc group call and stops the determination of ad hoc group call participants involving multiple MCVideo systems. The figure illustrates the process of ad hoc group call initiation and termination, highlighting the role of MCVideo server in managing the call and ensuring the smooth functioning of the ad hoc group.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.3-1: MCVideo server releases an ad hoc group call and stops the determination of ad hoc group call participants involving multiple MCVideo systems\n1.\tThe ad hoc group call is established and on-going with the participants MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3, and MCVideo client 4. The participants list is determined by both primary and partner systems MCVideo server based on the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1 while initiating the call.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server 1 detects that the ad hoc group call which is ongoing is to be released e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server 1 sends the notification to MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo system about the ad hoc group call release to stop determining the participants list by MCVideo server 2 of the partner MCVideo system.\n4a-4d.\tThe MCVideo server 1 sends ad hoc group call release request to all the participants of the ad hoc group call.\n5a-5d.\tThe MCVideo clients notifies the user about the release of the ad hoc group call.\n6a-6d.\tAll the participants of the ad hoc group call receives the ad hoc group call release request and sends the ad hoc group call release response to the MCVideo server 1 of the primary MCVideo server.\nNOTE:\tThe ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCVideo server 1 of primary MC system and MCVideo client 3/MCVideo client 4 will always traversal through the MCVideo server 2.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for ad hoc group call setup procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein either a list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is provided by the authorised user and the determined MCVideo users are from multiple MCVideo systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system shares their users' information to the primary MC system.\n2.\tThe authorized MCVideo user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCVideo user/dispatcher controls the ad hoc group.\n4.\tSome users of the ad hoc group belong to partner MC systems.\n5.\tThe preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in the MCVideo client and other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group communication.\n6.\tIf an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is used to invite the ad hoc group members, MCVideo client is aware of the ad hoc group ID.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call, showing the necessary components and their arrangement. The setup includes a base station (BS), a group call group (GCG), and a group call group (GCG), with the BS acting as the central point for the call. The GCG is responsible for routing the call to the appropriate group members. The figure also includes a visual representation of the call setup, with the GCG and GCGs highlighted for clarity.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.4-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tThe MCVideo client of the authorized user initiates an ad hoc group call with multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. An ad hoc group call request message with the information of the MCVideo IDs or an ad hoc group ID if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert is routed to the MCVideo server of the primary MC system.\n2.\tIf the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCVideo server of the primary MC system verifies whether the user at MCVideo client is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group call. If not authorized, the MCVideo server of the primary MC system rejects the ad hoc group call request as specified in the step 3.\nIf the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server of the primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using received information. The MCData server further determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration and assigns an MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.\nIf no MCVideo ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MCVideo ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCVideo server, the MCVideo server assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group\nIf the the MC service users' information received in step 1 does not contain an MCVideo ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server of the primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using MCVideo users' information received in step 1, determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc and assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.\nThe MCVideo server identifies the appropriate MCVideo server responsible for the MCVideo users of the ad hoc group. The MCVideo server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\nNOTE 1:\tThe ad hoc group information including the MCVideo group ID and the list of users is held in dynamic data in the MCVideo server.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message to the MCVideo client containing the below:\ni.\tThe MCVideo ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCVideo server or provided by the MCVideo client if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);\nii.\tThe group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and\niii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.\nIf the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCVideo client shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server of the primary MC system sends the ad hoc group call request to the affiliated group members of the ad hoc group belonging to the primary MC system.\n5.\tThe MCVideo clients receive in the ad hoc group call request the information of the MCVideo group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify their corresponding MCVideo user. The affiliated group members of the ad hoc group of the primary MC system may accept or reject the call and respond with the group call response.\n6.\tThe primary MCVideo server further initiates an ad hoc group call request message to the MCVideo users of the partner MC system. The ad hoc group call request message is routed to the MCVideo users via the MCVideo server of the partner MC system.\n7.\tThe MCVideo clients receive in the ad hoc group call request the information of the MCVideo group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify their corresponding MCVideo user. The MCVideo users upon receipt of the invitation may accept or reject the call, and respond with the ad hoc group call response. The ad hoc group call response message is routed to the MCVideo server of the primary MC system via the MCVideo server of the partner MC system.\n8.\tThe MCVideo server of the primary MC system provides an ad hoc group call response message to the MCVideo client of the authorized MCVideo user upon receiving response to the corresponding ad hoc group call request in step 1. The ad hoc group call response will consist of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe ad hoc group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n9.\tUpon successful ad hoc group call setup, a group call is established amongst the multiple group members from primary and partner MC systems. The media plane and transmission control resources are established.\nThis procedure focuses on the case where an MCVideo server initiates the termination of an ongoing MCVideo ad hoc group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 7.19.3.2.5-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo ad hoc group call.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 belong to primary MC system. The MCVideo client 3 belongs to partner MC system.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a focus on ad hoc group call release. It illustrates the process of releasing a group call in a 5G network, highlighting the use of radio frequency (RF) signals and the role of base stations (gNB) in facilitating the call. The figure also shows the distribution of nodes and the use of radio frequency (RF) signals to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.5-1: Ad hoc group call release\n1.\tThe MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call (e.g. as a result of ad hoc group call setup as specified in clause 7.19.3.2.4).\n2.\tThe MCVideo server would like to release the ad hoc group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group call and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server sends a ad hoc group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call. If the participants belong to partner MC system, then ad hoc group call release request is routed to the MCVideo clients of the partner MC system via the partner MCVideo server.\n5.\tThe MCVideo users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.\n6.\tThe MCVideo client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, send acknowledgement towards the MCVideo server by sending a ad hoc group call release response.\n7.\tThe MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the transmission control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group call that is terminated. The MCVideo servers remove the ad hoc group information from the dynamic data held in the MCVideo servers and the ad hoc group ceases to exist, otherwise if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the MCVideo servers keep the dynamic data and the ad hoc group continues to exist.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.6-1 below illustrates the MCVideo user modifying the ad hoc group call participants procedure involving multiple MCVideo systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn MCVideo ad hoc group call is already in progress and the participants list provided by the originating MCVideo user while initiating the MCVideo ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe participants of the MCVideo ad hoc group call belongs to the multiple MCVideo system.\n3.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 determines that the MCVideo client 3 needs to be invited to on-going ad hoc group call and MCVideo client 2 needs to be removed from the on-going ad hoc group call from the primary MCVideo system.\n4.\tThe MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 determines that the MCVideo client 5 needs to be invited to on-going ad hoc group call and MCVideo client 4 needs to be removed from the on-going ad hoc group call from the partner MCVideo system.\n\n\nThe figure depicts a modification of an ad hoc group call by an authorized user, showing the steps taken to modify the call participants. The figure includes a diagram of the call setup, the user's actions, and the resulting modifications.\nFigure 7.19.3.2.6-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by an authorized user\n1.\tThe MCVideo client 1 sends the modify ad hoc group call participants request to the MCVideo server 1 to remove both MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 4 from the on-going ad hoc group call and to add both MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 5 into on-going ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe MCVideo server 1 verifies whether the MCVideo client 1 is authorized to add or remove (modify) the participants of the on-going ad hoc group call.\n3.\tThe MCVideo server 1 sends modify ad hoc group call participants response to the MCVideo client 1.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server 1 determines that MCVideo client 1 has requested that MCVideo client 3 from the primary MC system be invited to an on-going ad hoc group call and successfully added to the call according to the procedure defined in clause 7.19.3.1.4.\n5.\tThe MCVideo server 1 determines that MCVideo client 1 has requested that MCVideo client 2 from the primary MC system be removed from the on-going ad hoc group call and successfully removed from call according to the procedure defined in clause 7.19.3.1.4.\n6.\tThe MCVideo server 1 determines that MCVideo client 1 has requested that MCVideo client 5 from the partner MC system be invited to an on-going ad hoc group call.

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCVideo UE, MCVideo group, MCVideo user and MCVideo service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MCVideo UE, MCVideo group, MCVideo user and MCVideo service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.281 [3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the present document or the referenced document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MCVideo UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\n",
