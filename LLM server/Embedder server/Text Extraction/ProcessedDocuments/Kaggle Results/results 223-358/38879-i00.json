            "description": "The 3GPP split architecture for NG-RAN is described in TS 38.401 [2]. The NR gNB disaggregated architecture is characterized by the presence of a single gNB-CU-CP, which is in control of one or more gNB-DU(s) and one or more gNB-CU-UP(s) (Figure 4-1). Similarly, a gNB-DU may interact with multiple gNB-CU-UPs simultaneously for the same user context as long as they are controlled by the same gNB-CU-CP.\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture for the separation of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP in TS 38.401, which is a standard for 5G network architecture. The figure shows the separation between the core switches (CS) and the distributed nodes (DNs), with redundancy paths shown in dashed lines. This design aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and failover.\nFigure 4-1: Overall architecture for separation of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP TS 38.401 [2]\nThe gNB-CU-CP may have specific configured data for each supported cell in the gNB, and a common gNB ID per PLMN. This identity is known in the gNB-DU and in neighbor gNBs, and it is also broadcasted in the served NR cells as part of the cell identity.\nThe figure depicts a complex network architecture, illustrating the connections between various components such as the AMF, gNB-CU-CP, gNB-CU-UP, and gNB-DUs. The figure highlights the importance of redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4-2: CP connections involving the AMF, gNB-CU-CP, gNB-CU-UP, and gNB-DUs.\nThere is one (active) CP anchor node per UE in the 5GC (AMF) and one (active) CP anchor per gNB in the NG-RAN (gNB-CU-CP). Figure 4-2 highlights the various CP connections going through the same gNB-CU-CP towards the AMF, to neighbor gNB-CU-CPs, to gNB-CU-UPs, and to gNB-DUs. All CP connections terminate in the gNB-CU-CP; if we only look at the logical architecture, the gNB-CU-CP may indeed be considered as a single point of failure.\nFor Operator, resiliency of public network is under national regulations or other operational constraints.\nWith regard to resiliency TS 38.401[2] includes only the following note:\nNOTE:\tFor resiliency, a gNB-DU may be connected to multiple gNB-CUs by appropriate implementation.\nFurthermore, multiple TNL associations toward the gNB-CU-CP are currently supported by the standard.\nIn the event of a failure at gNB-CU-CP, the likely outcome is that all user contexts could be affected and experience user service interruption.\nThis study handles failure scenarios for gNB-CU-CP, based on the current NG-RAN architecture.\nSolutions for failure scenarios will not be addressed in this study.\nThe nodes shown in Figure 4-1 are logical nodes, i.e., they can be implemented as physical network functions (PNFs) using dedicated hardware (HW) infrastructures or as virtual network functions (VNFs) running as software (SW) functions (e.g., virtual machines (VMs) or cloud-native containers (CNFs)) on general purpose processors (GPPs; with or without HW acceleration support), e.g., in a cloud environment of a data center.\n",

            "description": "Various perspectives were considered by each company (see the informative Annex A for details).\nA failure scenario for a deployment case with gNB-CU-CP at the antenna site (Distributed RAN/D-RAN) should not be of relevance for this study as an outage would impact the network performance only in a limited local area (similar to an outage of the co-located gNB-DU). Local resiliency measures may therefore be realized in the same way for both logical nodes (dependent on PNF/VNF implementation).\nA more important scenario is the case when a gNB-CU-CP is deployed in a central office location of an operator’s network. Those central locations may have transport network (TN) connections (e.g., via tree- or ring-based fibers) to several gNB-DUs located at different antenna sites. In such deployment case the gNB-CU-CP has the responsibility for proper operation of a large number of cells covering a wider regional area, i.e., an outage has a strong impact on overall user experience in a larger part of the mobile network. Each gNB-CU-CP may be connected via multiple TNL associations. As implicitly stated by the note in TS 38.401[2] gNB-DUs at antenna sites may be connected via the same or different TN links to one or several central locations (geo-redundancy) hosting gNB-CU-CP instances.\nThe following failure scenarios have been discussed:\n- Hardware failure\n- Software failure\n- Transport network failure\n- Power failure\n- Entire gNB-CU-CP failure, e.g., due to natural disaster\nIt was confirmed that some failures in the gNB-CU-CP may be addressed by using virtualization technology.\nOn the other hand, there is a scenario with possibly an entire gNB-CU-CP failure (e.g. due to natural disasters). Resiliency mechanisms to recover from such failure may be achieved via gNB-DU’s connection to multiple gNB-CUs by appropriate implementation, as captured in TS 38.401[2].\n",

With the increasing number of connected gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU, gNB-CU-CP will be in the risk of failure caused by the large amount of signalling processing. So this SI will introduce a mechanism to allow the gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU to recovery service. Higher-layer split between gNB-CU and gNB-DU would enable highly-centralized gNB-CU deployment with large coverage area per gNB-CU, especially from C-Plane perspective. Likewise, Higher-layer split between gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP would enable highly-centralized gNB-CU-CP deployment with large coverage area per gNB-CU-CP.\nAs described in the draft SID, such a centralized gNB-CU(-CP) would be a single point of failure. Hence the resiliency of the gNB-CU(-CP) is highly important. Given the limited time allocated for gNB-CU resiliency, only gNB-CU-CP resiliency should be considered in this release, other network nod, e.g. AMF, gNB CU(non-split CU architecture) should not be considered in this release if time not allowed.\nFailure condition:\nFailure condition is the trigger of gNB-CU-CP resiliency. If a network node is considered a failure when it is crashed completely, then it would be too late to recovery. The network should have scheme to switch part or all of the services/connections to another resilient network node to offload before it completely crashes down. The decision of offloading the service/connection can be either of the below:\n1)\tUp to the implantation of gNB-CU-CP\n2)\tThe configured threshold from OAM\nBoth options work and has no impact to RAN3. So the failure condition can be left to network implementation.\nIn addition, if any of the adjacent nodes of gNB-CU-CP, e.g. AMF, gNB-CU-CP and gNB-DU lost the connection to gNB-CU-CP, due to an unexpected gNB-CU-CP failure, adjacent node should be able to activate the resilient gNB-CU-CP automatically.\n",

There are different failure scenarios that may happen in such a deployment scenario:\n(1)\tSW or HW failure in a PNF-based implementation;\n(2)\tVNF (SW) or GPP (HW) failure in a virtualized environment (e.g. cloud-based implementation);\n(3)\tFailures of NW connections, e.g., TN or server NW card failures;\n(4)\tTotal failure of central location, e.g., caused by a power shutdown or a disaster case.\nFor failure scenarios (1) and (2) the gNB-CU(-CP) functionality can be recovered by taking local redundancy in the same central location into account (e.g., based on usage of spare HW (PNF/GPP) for redundancy purposes). A slow recovery can be initiated via OAM orchestrating a new gNB-CU(-CP) instance on the spare HW (e.g., in combination with cloud-based mechanisms in a virtualized environment). A fast recovery approach to bring the outage time down would require active/stand-by operation of a mirror gNB-CU-CP instance in parallel which may be realized in a local environment by appropriate implementation (incl. also cloud-based mechanism in case of virtualization).\nSlow recovery may also work in case of failure scenarios (3) and (4) using a second central location for orchestrating a new gNB-CU-CP instance via OAM, but the critical and more important issue from an operator’s perspective is fast recovery in the geo-redundant case as 3GPP specifications do not provide suitable support for it.\nTherefore, the failure case where a benefit of a resiliency enhancement in 3GPP specifications is seen would be:\n-\tOutage of gNB-CU(-CP) when deployed in a central location without sufficient local redundancy, but availability of geo-redundancy (SW/HW) is given and fast recovery of gNB-CU(-CP) functionality is required by the operator.\nNote:\tFast recovery would also incorporate the gNB-CU-UP functionality in a redundant central location if it was running in the primary central location experiencing the failure.\n",
