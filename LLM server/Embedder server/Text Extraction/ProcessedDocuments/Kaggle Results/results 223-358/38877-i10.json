BS that supports multiple bands by means of separate antenna arrays and active components within the same enclosure are not in the scope of this study as they can already be supported by Rel-15 single band requirements and do not need further study.\nFR2 BS capable of multi-band operation (whether those in the scope of this study, or BS supporting multiple bands by means of separate antenna arrays and active components within the same enclosure) should support evolution from single FR2-1 band to two FR2-1 bands application. Operators can configure for single band operation at one band initially and upgrade it to two bands sharing a common radio without further hardware investment.\nSince common active RF components are used for FR2 multi-band BS, the receiver and transmitter operate simultaneously would require very large isolation, which make it less possible for unsynchronized operation between bands. Hence inter-band synchronized operation is required for multi-band operation.\nPossible FR2 multi-band BS structures and configurations based on combining different receiver/transmitter implementations (multi-band or single band), as well as mapping receive and transmit signals on a shared antenna or separate antennas should be considered in the study.\nScenarios 1), 4), 5) and 6) below should be considered as the target scenarios to be studied in this study while no study needed on the scenario 2) and 3) below:\n1) Multi-band transmitter and/or receiver with common active RF components\n2) Single-band transmitter and receiver\n3) Configurable BS for different bands with the same hardware, i.e. only one band can be configured to operate at any time.\n4) BS covers full-band or sub-band of band A and band B\n5) BS covers consecutive spectrums with different band number, for example, n258+n261\n6) BS covers two bands which have overlapping spectrums, for example, n258+n257, and BS support no overlapping frequency range in the two bands.\nThe upcoming section illustrates high-level architecture options for multi-band support and further identifies which of those options are within the scope of this study.\n\n",

For Option #1 and Option #3, if the PA is capable of being operated in multiple bands at the same time, then it supports multi-band operation. However, if the PA can only be configured and operated in a single-band, then it is considered a single-band RIB.\nOption #1 and Option #3 are feasible with current technology if the ranges covered by each path have a percentage bandwidth up to 19.5%. Per agreements in sub-Clause 5.2.1.4, Option #2 and Option #4 should also be feasible for a percentage bandwidth up to 19.5%. Note that even within the same frequency group, the performance attained would yield a lower Tx power compared to a single-band design. However, given that this requirement is a manufacturer declaration, it would not impact the requirement applicability.\n",

For example one potential advantage of a multiband PA might be that power can be distributed between the supported bands offering more flexibility to optimize the power available for each, this requires only a multi-band PA.\nThe evaluation considers whether the proposed set of FR2-1 requirements is likely to be achievable with present or future implementation possibilities. The study does not aim to conclude on whether a multi-band FR2 solution is more optimal or effective (considering complexity, power, weight etc.) than other possibilities, for example mounting individual radio panels for each band within a BS enclosure.\nWhen discussing the feasibility of wideband components/systems the multi-band bandwidth as a percentage of the carrier frequency should be considered.\nNote that this is generally called fractional BW but in [2] the term fractional BW is already defined to mean something specific so is best avoided to prevent confusion.\nFractional bandwidth (FBW) is defined for a single operating band as shown below:\n-\tFractional bandwidth (FBW) is defined in [2] as ,\n-\twhere FFBWhigh is highest supported frequency within supported operating band, for which fractional bandwidth support was declared, and FFBWlow is lowest supported frequency within supported operating band, for which fractional bandwidth support was declared.\nMultiple operating bands are discussed in this study so the existing definition of fractional bandwidth is not suitable, the term percentage bandwidth is therefore used and defined as follows:\n-\tPercentage bandwidth (PBW) is defined in this study as ,\n-\twhere FPBWhigh is highest supported frequency, for which percentage bandwidth support was declared, and FPBWlow is lowest supported frequency, for which percentage bandwidth support was declared.\nTable 5.1-1 shows the percentage bandwidth for the FR2-1 bands and various potential multi-band groups.\n\nTable 5.1-1:Percentage band width of FR2-1 operating band (s)\n\n",

In [24] a wide band beamformer and PA was presented which covered 24 to 29.5 GHz (bands n257/n258/n261). The performance of which can be seen in table 5.2.1.2-1 and figure 5.2.1.2-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2-1: beamformer IC in 24-29.5GHz\n\nThe figure depicts a PA (Passive Antenna) bias optimized for 2 4 GHz and 2 8 GHz frequencies, with a P1dB gain of 2 dB. The PA is designed to provide high gain and low noise figure, ensuring optimal performance in the specified frequency bands.  The figure depicts a PA (Passive Antenna) bias optimized for 2 4 GHz and 2 8 GHz frequencies, with a P1dB gain of 2 dB. The PA is designed to provide high gain and low noise figure, ensuring optimal performance in the specified frequency bands.\nFigure 5.2.1.2-1: PA bias optimized for P1dB for 24GHz (left), and 28GHz (right)\n\nIt is considered feasible that multi-band beamformer IC covering 24-29.5GHz and associated bands can be achieved.\nLooking further ahead the results of academic studies in [25] a 24-42 GHZ wideband PA was presented which exhibited flat P1dB of 17.8 to 19.6dBm, within 1.6dB from Psat, and flat PAEP1dB of 36.6 to 44.3% over 24 to 40GHz, verifying the truly wideband large-signal matching.\nIn [26] the hybrid N/PMOS allowed the 26-39GHz PA deep Class-AB biasing and device cascade, substantially increasing PA Pout and efficiency.\nThese PAs across different frequency groups are summarized in the following Table 5.2.1.2-2. It can be seen that some recent study shows PA covering 26-39GHz, 24-42GHz with average output power around 10dBm,PAEP1dB larger than 30%.\nTable 5.2.1.2-2: PAs performance from literatures\n\nThese papers indicate that PAs covering frequency ranges from 26 to 40GHz or more are at least technically feasible in the research environment and may become available in the longer term.\nIt should be noted PAs with wide percentage bandwidths may not be capable of operating with signals that broad. For instance, while the PA may cover 50% bandwidth, its instantaneous bandwidth, i.e. maximum signal bandwidth, is usually restricted to a few hundred MHz due to limitations with bias networks and memory effects.\nIn [27] a 27-41GHz RX was designed and a proof-of-concept mm-Wave four-input–four-output MIMO RX array was implemented in a 45-nm CMOS SOI process with a total chip size of 3.6 mm×6.5 mm.\nIn [28] a 24.25-to-71GHz phased-array receiver is was introduced, which covering the whole FR2 frequency band 3GPP have defined by now. A harmonic-selection technique is was proposed to extend the operating bandwidth with low power consumption. The LNA can be configured into either operating Mode 1 covering 24 to 44GHz or operating Mode 2 covering 44 to 71GHz.\nPaper [29] presented a 22–44 GHz 2×2 phased-array receive beamformer. The RX channel includes a LNA, a 5-bit vector modulator (VM) phase shifter, an attenuator, and a variable gain amplifier (VGA). The phased-array channel results in a peak gain of 26.3 dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 20.5–44 GHz. The measured NF is 3–3.6 dB at 22–44 GHz with an IP1dB of −27.5 to −24.5 dBm.\nFor phase-array receive beamformer, these good performance receivers across different frequency groups are summarized in the following Table 5.2.1.3-3. They achieved low NF in a wide bandwidth.\nTable 5.2.1.3-3: Phased-array receiver chips performance\n\nIt has been shown that:\n-\tMulti-band beamformer IC with common active RF components with 19.5% percentage bandwidth in frequency range 24-29 GHz which includes n257/n258/n261 is technically feasible.\n-\tFor RF front-end, TRX chips covering 24-29.5GHz. 27-41GHz RX are shown. A harmonic-selection technique is proposed to extend the receiver’s operating bandwidth up to 24.25-71GHz.\nKey components of a multi-band FR2 RF front end are hence available today for certain frequency ranges and band numbers (n257/n258/n261) and it can be envisioned that wider frequency range products could be feasible in the future.\n",

                            "text_content": "For single-band FR2 radios, the application of DPD may not be critical compared to that of the FR1 counterpart. On one hand, the contribution of PAs to the total DC power consumption in a FR2 BS is much reduced. This is due to the fact that more antenna elements are added to increase the directivity of the antenna array to combat against the high path loss occurred at FR2, which in turn requires smaller power to feed each antenna element, and thus small-power PA per Tx is sufficient. On the other hand, the requirement on ACLR for FR2 BSs is not as large, i.e. 24 - 28dBc (by means of OTA measurement), compared to that applied to FR1 BSs, i.e. 45dBc [2] due to the beamforming and propagation environment. This somewhat alleviates the essential need of high-linearity PAs on meeting required ACLR. Therefore, the DPD in single-band FR2 BSs is expected to provide a little gain in terms of improving power efficiency and meeting the ACLR requirement. Furthermore, the analog and hybrid beamforming, which are predominantly used in FR2 radios, also pose challenges for DPD implementation. With hundreds to thousands of PAs and higher operating bandwidths for FR2 radio, simply utilizing a similar DPD architecture as in FR1 would cost extra for RF hardware design and power consumption, while it may be infeasible to deploy single DPD for every PA in the analog/hybrid beamforming phased array since several or all analog chains essentially share one digital path. The DPD algorithms would also have more demands on the bandwidth of feedback receiver/ADC and BB signal processing resources, which are scaled with the size of bandwidth to be linearized. These limited-gain and implementation-challenge factors make the similar DPD implementations as in FR1 less attractive to the FR2 single-band BS.\nNevertheless, DPD may still bring benefit for FR2 BSs in terms boosting the overall system performance (e.g. throughput due to improved EVM, or very possibly energy efficiency). It is worth highlighting that common FR2 transmitter architecture requires to have tight integration between RF components to reduce hardware costs, sizes, and power loss in which isolator between an antenna element and a PA is preferably avoided [5], e.g. as illustrated in Figure 5.2.2.1-1. In such architecture, PAs directly interact with the antenna array due to low path isolation between them. As a result, mutual coupling and antenna mismatch between antenna paths have strong impact to the PAs’ output matching impedance which changes the PA’s efficiency and nonlinearity behaviours [5]. The array steering angle, which also alters the antenna matching impedance, shows strong dependence on the nonlinearity to the PAs too. In addition, input of PAs in different branches may be driven with different power as a result of the beamforming techniques applied (i.e. tapering, ZF, etc.), or gain error of the phase shifters and gain imbalance of power division network [6]. These mentioned factors have the detrimental effect to efficiency and linearity behaviours of PAs which may degrade the ACLR while increasing the OOB emission and beam distortions [5]. For example, several studies have demonstrated the impact of steering angle to ACLR and OOB emission and how DPD can help to improve the beamforming performance [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nThe figure depicts a typical single-band FR2 antenna array architecture, with a single-antenna array at the center and two additional antennas on each side. The array is designed to provide a wide-band coverage, with the central antenna receiving the strongest signal and the two side antennas receiving the weaker signals. The array is designed to be compact and lightweight, with a focus on maximizing the use of available space. The design is based on the principles of antenna theory, with the central antenna receiving the strongest signal and the side antennas receiving the weaker signals. The array is designed to be efficient and cost-effective, with a focus on maximizing the use of available space.\nFigure 5.2.2.1-1: A typical single-band FR2 antenna array architecture\nObviously, any individual variation in PA would affect the performance of the linearization so the peak linearization performance is likely to be lower than that of a one-DPD-per-PA system. Whilst the design of PA’s is likely to be identical there are a number of factors which could change their performance:\n-\tTemperature – the location of each PA in the array (and the silicon) may mean different transistors are at different temperature (depending on the number of neighbouring devices for example) so the temperature of each junction may be different.\n-\tUnit to unit variation – whilst some transistors may all be on a single piece of silicon and variation on a single bit of silicon may be small if multiple devices are used (8 or 16 per device may be more usual) so there will be unit to unit variation across the potential 128 paths\n-\tOutput match variation – PA performance is very dependent on the load it is working into, again all output match circuits are likely to be designed identically but will vary based on a number of factors:\n-\tUnit to unit of components\n-\tAntenna unit to unit\n-\tAntenna isolation and load pulling from nearby antenna (and signals)\nDespite these issues useful linearization of an FR2 systems can be achieved and may become more common as technology improves.\nAntenna array and TRXs in FR2 radios are desired to be tightly integrated in which RF filter is preferably omitted after the PA. Since a multi-band RIB essentially needs to transmit multiple-band signals concurrently, the nonlinearity of PAs will likely cause intermodulation (IM) distortion. It would be highly challenging to manage the PAs in multiband RIB not to operate in the nonlinearity power region. Particularly, the varying nonlinearity behaviours of the PAs, which causes by the nonlinear interaction between antenna array and the PAs as discussed above, also inherit to the FR2 multi-band RIB. Such issues would be expected to be more complicated in the multiband use cases than in single-band ones due to higher requirements on matching load impedance of PAs covering multiband/wideband. Therefore, unwanted emissions due to IM distortions likely exist and may possibly fall into the operating bands or inter-RF bandwidth. Note that the latter case occurs if there is multicarrier transmission in one band. Figures 5.2.2.2-1 and 5.2.2.2-2 illustrate some examples. Assume that frequency ranges that the BS can operate in Band A and B are 24.25-26.5GHz (n258) and 27-29.5 GHz (n257), and there is transmission taking place at 26GHz in Band A and 27.5GHz in band B. Then IM3 components occur at 24.5GHz and 29GHz, which obviously fall into operating bandwidth of both bands as seen in Figure 5.2.2.2-1. Now assume that band A transmits two carrier frequencies at 24.75 and 25.75GHz. Then one IM3 component occurs at 26.75GHz which falls into the inter-RF bandwidth of the multiband BS as seen in Figure 5.5.2-3.\n\nThe figure depicts a scenario where concurrent multiband transmission is present, leading to unwanted emission. The diagram illustrates the potential issues, such as interference and signal degradation, which can occur when multiple bands are transmitted simultaneously. This can be mitigated by implementing proper signal processing techniques and using appropriate signal processing tools to ensure the quality of the signal.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-1: Example for possible unwanted emission due to concurrent multiband transmissionThe figure depicts a scenario where concurrent multiband transmission in one band results in unwanted emission. The diagram illustrates the potential issues, such as interference and signal degradation, that can occur when multiple bands are transmitted simultaneously in the same frequency band. This can be particularly problematic in scenarios where the frequency band is already occupied by other bands, or when the frequency band is shared with other services. The figure highlights the importance of proper frequency allocation and coexistence management to ensure the smooth operation of communication networks.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-2: Example for possible unwanted emission due to multi-carrier transmission in one band\nNote that Figure 5.2.2.2-1 and Figure 5.2.2.2-2 demonstrate the location of IMD products with CW signals, in reality the transmitted signals are wide band and the IMD products even more so, as such they may not be separable from the noise floor. As such IMD products are a potential issue but possibly not a serious one in some case, for example:\n-\t128 PA’s at 20mW each is only 2.56W (34dBm)\n-\tWith 28dBc ACLR this gives an adjacent channel power of 6dBm\nFor a 100MHz channel this gives a PSD of -14dBm/MHz which is below the spurious emissions requirements for FR2. It is unlikely that any in-band non-linearities will be greater than the ACLR level (as these are 3rd order products) so the out of band emissions requirements are unlikely to be a problem.\nThe IM distortion is also beamformed [10], however if the beams in the different bands are steered in different directions the IM product is in a different direction again [3]. If the beams are close to each other however, e.g. when UEs are nearby each other, the IM distortion beam may still be close enough to point at the intended UE. Thus, it needs to be managed to ensure that RF requirements are still be met for the FR2 multiband RIB.\nApart from other UEs within the network, IM products in the inter RF bandwidth gap need to be suppressed sufficiently to ensure that spurious emissions requirements towards other systems are met. This would in particular need attention if band combinations between frequency groups would be considered.\nRF filter/diplexer after every PAs could be used to handle IM distortions. However, such solution would be very expensive since beamforming phased array in FR2 could have thousands of antenna paths. Filter per path may also generate significantly phase error between antenna paths and increase power loss. Thus, this may not be feasible in terms of cost, size, and performance of FR2 radios. Alternatively, DPD may be a cheaper solution for RF hardware architectures to this issue. For FR2 multi-band DPD, it essentially inherits the abovementioned advantages as well as challenges for single-band FR2 BS with a few additional issues. For instance, the very large percentage BW may cause potential issues when applying DPD for multi-band FR2, these are:\n-\tThe large percentage BW of the PA and the wider the BW the more difficult it will be to maintain a consistent impedance match of PAs over the entire band and hence memory effects may be greater making the DPD algorithm tougher to achieve good linearization.\n-\tLarger BW means variation of the potential sources (as listed for single band) are greater, once gain reducing the potential linearity saving.\nPotentially split or stacked element arrays mean each band signal may be fed to a different antenna, meaning the output load for the PA is more complex and more open to variation.\nInvestigating practically feasible DPD solutions for beamforming phased array in FR2 has been an active research topic [11]. To address the concerns on the DPD implementation in FR2, DPD architectures and efficient DPD training model/algorithms have been intensively studies. Note that since one digital path will be shared between some or all analog chains in the analog/hybrid beamforming phased array, an architecture in which DPD linearization is applied for a set of PAs has been proposed and then demonstrated to be able to improve ACLR and EVM, e.g. [12, 13].\nFor multi-band DPD, as the beam steering for a multi-band FR2 system is likely to be applied to each band separately before the signals are combined and fed to a single PA, one example architecture could be that the signals will be generated separately in different converters. Such architectures have been investigated in FR1 bands [14] where separate signals were used to linearize a dual-band signals in a dual-band PA.\nIn general, one can either deploy a common DPD for all bands or a dedicated DPD for each band [15]. The former may have less demand on DPD architecture but requires much higher bandwidth for DPD hardware as the captured, training and correcting samples are wideband; since the correction is wide-band, band-specific linearization may not be achievable as such. The latter has lower demand on DPD hardware bandwidth and can achieve per-band linearization but may require more complex DPD architectures and algorithms, i.e. to decompose the captured multiband signals to single-band one and vice versa for the corrections, as well as jointly optimize linearized coefficients for all bands. In both architectures, a wider bandwidth feedback path is required to deal with large signal bandwidth of FR2 band; traditionally the feedback channel needs 3 to 5 times the signal bandwidth to collect nonlinear information of PA. This can be a big burden for high-speed and high-precision ADCs. Nevertheless, DPD training algorithms which minimize the demand on DPD hardware bandwidth and BB resources have also been proposed, e.g. in [16, 17]. It should be highlighted that the implementation of phase shifters will not significantly impact the DPD solutions as linearization are applied to signals seen at the output of the PA, as mentioned in [18].\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Analog phase shifters in mmWave BS are used to control the phase of signals in order to steer the beam. In some architectures, attenuators or variable-gain amplifiers are also placed along with the phase shifter to control the gain of beamformed signals to achieve desirable beamforming performance.\nConsidering phase shifter designs which are wideband it would prove difficult to apply different phase shifts to different bands. Hence it is not possible to independently steer beams to different directions in the different bands, and it may even not be feasible to steer the beams in the same directions for to 2 separate bands if the bands are sufficiently far apart in frequency that the beamforming weights would need to be different for each band.\nIf variable true time delay based phase shifters, which add delay to time-domain signals to create phase shift such as tapped delay line phase shifter, are used, then it may be possible to steer the beams toward the same direction for two different bands. This is because the frequency-dependent linear phase response of the true time delay phase shifter can create different phase shifts at different frequencies. However, true time delay phase shifts are challenging to implement due to the required size to delivered acceptable phase shift performance (e.g, phase shift resolution), while incurring high insertion loss.\nPhase shifters with a frequency-flat phase response, such as vector modulated phase shifters may have cheaper implementational cost and be more feasible to integrated into commercial BFICs. However, since only one phase shift value can be controlled at a time instant, it may not be feasible to steer the beams in the same direction for two different bands if the bands are sufficiently far apart in frequency that the beamforming weights need to be different for each band.\nExamples of beam steering results when wide-band frequency-flat phase response phase shifters and wideband phased array are used in a multiband transmitter are shown below. The phase shifters only control the beam weights of the lower frequency band. Two steering angles are considered, i.e. 0 and 20 degrees. Figure 5.2.3-1 illustrates the beam patterns when the element separation for lower band and upper band is 0.5λ and 0.6λ, respectively, which corresponds to the case of, for example, the combination n258+n261. Figure 5.2.3-2 presents the case when the operating bands are further apart, i.e. the element separation for lower band and upper band is 0.35λ and 0.65λ, respectively, which can be the case of combinations across different frequency groups. As can be seen, except when UEs of different bands are at the boresight of the array, otherwise the transmitter cannot steer the beam to multiple UEs independently. Even if different-band UEs are located at same direction (but not boresight), the beam for upper-band UEs is not pointed to its desired direction and a larger frequency separation of the bands results in bigger error of the steering angle.\nThe figure depicts a beam pattern of different band signals when using a wideband phase shifter and an antenna array. The phase shifters apply beam weights for the lower band, with 0-degree steering angle for the lower band and 20-degree steering angle for the upper band. The array separation for the lower band is 0.5λ, and for the upper band is 0.6λ.The figure depicts a beam pattern of different band signals when using a wideband phase shifter and an antenna array.

Within the time frame of this SI it seems commercially available multi-band frequency selective phase shifters that can apply a different phase shift per band are unlikely to be available. However, any specification should not preclude a potential future architecture based on frequency dependent phase shifters. If and when frequency dependent phase shifters become viable, it is possible that RAN4 requirements created in Rel-18 would need re-visiting.\nThe figure depicts a multi-band phase shifter, which is an essential component in a multi-band power amplifier (MBA) system. The figure illustrates the various bands and their respective phase shifters, highlighting the importance of phase alignment in achieving high-quality audio signals. The figure also shows the connection of the phase shifter to the multi-band PA, demonstrating the interconnection of these components to ensure optimal performance.\nFigure 5.2.3-3. Example of multi-band phase shifter prior to a multi-band PA\nIn order to apply independent phase shift and hence independent steering to each band, phase shifters need to be applied differently to each band.  Using technology available today it may be possible to use multiple single band phase shifters to provide the beam steering to each band independently whilst feeding into a multi-band PA shown in Figure 5.2.3-4, although this may have some performance penalty.\nNote that Figures 5.2.3-3 and 5.2.3-4 show example architectures for a multi-band BS. Depending on the implementation, filter may or may not be placed after the multi-band PAs.\nThe figure depicts a single-band phase shifter prior to a multi-band passive antenna (PAM) to steer each band separately. The figure illustrates the concept of phase shifters in wireless communication systems, which are used to adjust the phase of a signal to optimize its transmission. The figure shows the single-band phase shifter in the center, with the multi-band passive antenna on the right, which is used to steer the signal in each of the three bands. This design is crucial for achieving high-quality wireless communication systems, as it allows for the efficient use of the available frequency spectrum.\nFigure 5.2.3-4.

The optimum radiating element size (a dipole is nominally λ/2) and the array element separation are both dependent on frequency. If an antenna is required to operate over a broad range of frequencies it is difficult to maintain optimum element size and element spacing over the whole range. The required percentage bandwidth of the multi-band signal in Table 5.1-1 is therefore important when looking at the feasibility of a broadband antenna.\nFrom antenna design perspective, solutions covering multiple bands can be achieved in three main ways: a single broadband design covering the entire range of the bands (trades certain performance parameters), designing an antenna with multiple resonances in the desired bands, or having separate antenna designs each covering a band (lower percentage bandwidth\n\n",

                            "text_content": "It can be noted for comparison that there are FR1 multi-band fixed antenna arrays covering 1710MHz to 2690MHz, with a percentage bandwidth of 44.5% (VSWR of < 1.5:1). Fixed antenna arrays (with no or limited beam steering) however have more flexibility on element separation with values of up to 0.9λ being acceptable as the grating lobe is also fixed and can be attenuated with the element pattern. Whilst FR1 antennas build practices are different, the limitations on element size and spacing between elements are similar to those for FR2.\nThe radiating element can trade bandwidth against radiation performance. Short dipoles still radiate but the performance degrades the farther from the ideal frequency they are operated at. Defining an exact “acceptable” level of radiation efficiency for a broadband product is not straightforward as other aspects have to be considered (some radiation efficiency may be traded to achieve a broadband system). Also, as the element becomes smaller, its radiation pattern becomes broader these negating its ability to act as a spatial filter for array grating lobes.\nThe size of the radiating element and the element separation are also dependent, e.g. the elements cannot touch each other. The separation of the elements in terms of wavelength occurs at the highest frequency, as the maximum separation is limited by the grating lobe performance there is an upper limit to how large this separation may be. Therefore, this sets the maximum size of the element (which will be electrically shortest at the lowest frequency).\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the physical limitations of element size and separation in a 5G network. It illustrates the impact of these factors on signal propagation, with key elements such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers highlighted. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths to ensure reliability.\nFigure 5.3.2-1: Example of physical limitations of element size and separation\nThe maximum separation is also a parameter which is difficult to agree as it depends on a number of things, a fixed antenna array may have a separation of up to 0.9λ (at its maximum operational frequency). In previous studies [xx] it has been assumed for BS antenna simulations that a fully steerable antenna array has a separation of 0.5-0.7λ to avoid grating lobes.\nFor example, taking 0.5λ as a lower limit (this could be smaller if short dipoles were used), it then needs to be decided what an acceptable level of side lobe / grating lobe suppression is and also what range of steering is required.\nThree examples with similar grating lobe levels and different element spacing and steering can be seen:\n-\t0.7λ element separation with 30° steering\n-\t0.8λ element separation with 20° steering\n-\t0.9λ element separation with 10° steering\n\n\nThe figure depicts a 3D array pattern with 0.7λ elements separated by 30°, 0.8λ elements separated by 20°, and 0.9λ elements separated by 10°, illustrating the array's design for efficient signal transmission.\nFigure 5.3.2-1\t Array pattern: 0.7λ element separation with 30° steering, 0.8λ element separation with 20° steering, 0.9λ element separation with 10° steering\nEach of these maximum separations equates to a percentage BW of 33%, 46% and 57%, respectively, and it is clear that grating lobe level and steering range can be traded against percentage bandwidth. Once again, selecting an exact set of conditions to estimate a maximum percentage bandwidth is difficult as it depends on the product definition.\nUsing another approach and taking antenna element separation 0.5λ at a higher limit, the scanning angle reaches ±60º at 26 GHz and ±45º at 38 GHz with acceptable side lobe/grating lobe levels, as shown in Figure 5.3.2-2. The corresponding spacing will be 0.34λ at a lower limit. The isolation among the antenna elements at a lower limit can be ensured with the use of decoupling structures.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with a multi-path signal propagation, illustrating the signal path from the base station (gNB) to the user equipment (UE) and the presence of scatterers.

Beam scanning performance in azimuth plane when antenna element separation is 0.5λ at higher limit (a) 26 GHz, and (b) 38 GHz.\n\nIn addition to the physical limitations and grating lobe performance discussed, it should also be noted that the array is electrically shorter at lower frequencies than higher frequencies and this also affects the antenna directivity and gain. For example, there is approximately 3dB gain difference between low band (26GHz) and high band (38GHz) that can be seen in Figure 5.3.2-2. This factor may also be a consideration when planning an antenna design.\nTaking another example, Figure 5.3.2-3 shows the directivity of an 8x8 uniform rectangular phased array with respect to different element separations. The antenna elements described in [31] are used in the simulation. It is seen that lower element separation will result in low array directivity. This means if the separations seen by lower frequency band is low, it likely consumes more energy to deliver acceptable array performance and cause power imbalance with higher bands, while the EIS receiver sensitive is low. The directivity difference between operating frequency bands may also be a consideration when planning an antenna design.\n\nThe figure depicts the directivity of a uniform rectangular array (URA) with respect to array element separations. The URA is a type of array that can be used for various applications, such as wireless communication, radar, and satellite communication. The figure shows the relationship between the array element separations and the directivity of the URA. The directivity is a measure of the ability of the array to focus its energy in a specific direction, which is important for applications that require precise communication. The figure provides a visual representation of the relationship between the array element separations and the directivity, which can be used to optimize the performance of the URA for specific applications.\nFigure 5.3.2-3. Directivity of uniform rectangular array (URA) with respect to array element separations.\n\nThe coupling effect may also pose challenges in wideband antenna array designs. It should be further noticed that the lower and higher band will see different impact of the mutual coupling effect among radiators due to different element spacing, i.e. the narrower element spacing suffers stronger mutual coupling. This effect could change the array pattern and input impedance matching of the antenna elements while being difficult to analytically predict.\nHowever, based on existing technology it has been agreed that multi-band AA with common radiated element with 19.5% percentage bandwidth in frequency range 24-29 GHz which includes n257/n258/n261, or with 26.3% percentage bandwidth in frequency range 37-48 GHz which includes n260/n259/n262 is feasible, at least from antenna array perspective.\n\n",

Using stacked patches allows the different bands to feed different elements which are tuned for the specific band. This resolves some of the physical restrictions on the element size. However, if the arrays are stacked then restrictions still exist on the element separation in the array.\nStacked patches can be designed with either a single dual band input or with separate input ports. As the bands are separated (for example 26GHz and 40GHz), it is possible to implement a diplexer to separate the bands for each of the antenna arrays, if necessary.\nThe figure depicts a multi-band PA (Passive Antenna) with stacked single-band arrays (single and dual input ports) in a 5G network. The design is based on the principles of SDN (Software-Defined Networking), allowing for efficient network management and optimization.\nFigure 5.3.3-1: Multi-band PA with stacked single band arrays (single and dual input ports)\nA number of papers have been identified [19], [20], [21], and [22] which have demonstrated the feasibility of operational stacked patch antennas in the range 26 to 40 GHz\nDual band performance can be achieved by using multiple patches stacked on top of each other. For example, in [20] a simple stack with a high band patch and a low band patch with a single input port was shown. Using these patches, a 2x2 array was demonstrated with acceptable levels of input match, boresight gain isolation and scanning angle. Although of course such small arrays are more suitable for a handset than a BS.\nIn [22] a larger 8x4 array was demonstrated along with separate single band beamformers. While this is still small for BS purposes, it demonstrates the scalability of such structures and that larger BS-size arrays may be technically feasible to implement.\nIn the above configuration, there are two types of feed line such as single input and dual input. The following analysis shows the difference between their performance. The 28+39 GHz (n257/n261, n260) combination was analysed, and figure 5.3.3-2 shows their structures. Both type support dual polarization. Upper patch is for Hi-band (n260) and lower patch is for Lo-band (n257/n261).\nFigure 5.3.3-2: Dual polarized stacked patch antenna element for 28+39GHz combination.\n\nThe following simulation result shows antenna gain of both stacked patch antenna elements.\nFigure 5.3.3-3: Performance of multi-band stacked patch antenna element for 28+39GHz combination.\n\nTable 5.3.3-1: Performance of multi-band stacked patch antenna element for 28+39GHz combination.\n\nFrom antenna performance perspective, the difference between single input and dual input of stacked patch multi-band antenna is small, and both types could achieve 4 to 5dBi element gain including frequency roll-off. Considering that 4 to 5dBi is generally set as the antenna element gain in a link budget for mmWave communication equipment, performance impact of both stacked patch multi-band antennas is small. In addition, it is possible to expand the support frequency range by increasing thickness of the antenna as needed.\nFrom the above discussions for different antenna array structures, either a multi-band antenna array (broadband or with multi-resonances) or separate antenna arrays with lower percentage bandwidth can be used in FR2 multiband RIB/BS. In comparison to separate antenna arrays, a consolidated multi-band design is more compact and reduces costs, but trades performance aspects that can be optimized for in separate designs. On the other hand, having separate designs enables dedicated optimizations, yielding better performance. However, this comes at the cost of a significantly larger circuit area being used for two designs and additional integration losses from lines and transitions.\n",

The isolation between panels’ adjacent antenna elements and correlation between the radiated beams needs to be ensured. The performance metrics are isolation (between antenna elements) and diversity performance parameters e.g. envelope correlation coefficient (ECC). The ECC is commonly used to measure amount of radiated beams correlation. The ECC values are calculated using radiated far-field equation in [23].

                    "text_content": "In this section, a number of other considerations for FR2-1 wideband BS from the feasibility point of view that are not considered in the preceding sections are mentioned.\nDigital considerations\nTo support a large bandwidth, it is necessary to provide a high sampling rate for ADC and DAC. For individual Frequency Band Groups (e.g. 24.5-29.5GHz, n257+n258), the bandwidth to be supported may be more than 5GHz, and to cover the full FR2-1 the bandwidth might be up to 24GHz. If linearization would be seen later to be feasible for multiband BS, then DAC/ADC would need to support for the feedback and correction, which poses another challenge to DAC/ADC.\nPotentially only the in band spectrum could be generated by separate converters which would reduce the requirements on individual converters.\nIn an implementation, the architecture, RF performance and power consumption of the analogue/digital interface would be key considerations. The ADC and DAC complexity and power consumption could be reduced by reducing the sampling resolution, but this would impact TX factors such as EVM and emissions and RX factors such as dynamic range and RX EVM. For this reason, care would need to be taken that requirements on e.g. EVM, receiver dynamic range and demodulation performance would be achievable.\nIn addition to the DAC and ADC, the large bandwidth and sampling rates would lead to very high volumes of data to be moved within the radio architecture. Data transport and interface architectures would need to support the very high data volume. Reducing the data volume (e.g. by reducing the sampling resolution) would lead to similar considerations as for ADC and DAC on meeting requirements such as EVM, emissions, RX dynamic range and demodulation.\nIn addition to the interface bandwidth, the digital transport latency may also impact radio near algorithms (such as DPD, CFR) and could impact the performance of the transmitter and receiver. It is not clear whether the need to support a much larger interface bandwidth could impact the interface latency.\nDigital filtering may be needed for meeting selectivity and blocking requirements depending on the sensitivity and architecture. The large sampling rates and bandwidth would increase the amount of computational power needed for digital filtering, and potentially the achievable steepness of the filters. This could impact the feasibility of meeting TX EVM and RX selectivity, blocking and demodulation requirements.\nAnalogue considerations\nThe possibilities for analogue filtering within an FR2-1 AAS array are extremely limited. The filter in a typical single-band FR2 BS may not be placed before the antenna. However, it could be the case of multi-band, due to the multi-frequency signal going through the PA if the PA is highly nonlinearity, or due to the architecture splitting multi-band signals. And thus filter before the antenna may be needed.\nChoosing where to place filter components is an important part of a multi-band solution as it impacts the overall performance. For instance, if a filter would need to be placed before the antenna, then there are other issues in practice with insertion loss and power unbalancing due to non-identical filter for each branch.\nThe regulatory requirements in the inter RF gap and the linearity of the transmitter will set the boundary for the analogue filtering. The feasibility of analogue filtering may impact the ability to meet some regulatory emissions requirements and out of band blocking, and if the filter has ripple also the EVM may be impacted.\nDepending on the array architecture, it may be necessary to split different frequency components of the multi-band signal and route them to different antenna elements, e.g. in architectures using diplexer. The splitting and additional routing can have implications for TX power loss and RX sensitivity, and the placement of components needs to be carefully considered. For instance, placing the diplexer before the PA is preferred from a design loss and power dissipation perspective. This is because the insertion loss of the diplexer occurs at a lower power level and can be accommodated by a simple increase in driver gain. Conversely, if the diplexer is placed after the PA, the insertion loss of the diplexer directly reduces the power available to the antenna array and leads to more thermal dissipation.\nOn the other hand, it is worth noting that if the power loss is significantly different/uneven between antenna branches, then beamforming may be degraded, and calibration may be required which may bring complexity to the architecture. This may impact the feasibility of the multi-band solution, although since TX power and RX sensitivity are subject to declarations it may not impact the requirements definition. As shown in Clause 4.2.1 Option #4, splitting and additional routing can be avoided by using a multi-band antenna, such as a single input stacked patch design.\nDedicated PAs for the desired frequency ranges may be adopted from a design loss and power dissipation perspective, as the narrower band designs will have better efficiency and the thermal dissipation will be spread out over a larger area.\n",

With this agreement, together with the agreements on re-using FR1 multi-band methods and exceptions, there is currently no need for new FR2-1 specific multi-band requirements as the current FR1 multi-band methods and exceptions can be applied to FR2-1 and are sufficient for FR2-1 multi-band RIB for all band combinations within the same frequency group. For multi-band RIB for band combinations across different frequency groups, the current FR1 multi-band methods and exceptions can also be applied, while FR2-1 specific multi-band requirements may be considered in the future taking into account the implementation challenges.\n",

There are currently no proposed solutions to enable a wide band beam former to steer beams for different bands in different directions.\nAntennas and antenna arrays are limited to certain maximum percentage BW’s however MB solutions using multiple antenna arrays have been investigated and solutions within the agreed percentage BW’s above have been identified.\nOther considerations, i.e. on a need of DPD and complications of digital and analogue designs for a wideband / multiband BS are also analysed.\nConsidering the wide range of FR2-1 operating bands and potential combinations FR2-1 operating bands have been considered within frequency groups with limited percentage BW’s as shown in table 5.1-1 and feasibility analysed within these groups. However, whilst practical limits exist which may limit multi-band solutions to be within these groups no restrictions need to be used in the technical specification and as such frequency groups do not need to be defined with the updates of the technical specifications. On the other hand, as highlighted in clause 6.2 study of solutions across frequency groups may be further studied and the use of additional multi-band requirements may be considered in the future for percentage BW’s greater than 19.5%.\nFor updating the technical specifications, FR2-1 multi-band requirements are to be added to the existing NR 3GPP TS 38.104 [2]and 3GPP TS 38.141-2 [30] technical specifications, using the same approach as FR1 multi-band as described in clause 6. The existing MB RIB definition as well as the explanations on BS capable of supporting operation in multiple operating bands with different implementations at the RIB in 38.104 [2] for FR1 can also apply to FR2-1.\n\n\n",
