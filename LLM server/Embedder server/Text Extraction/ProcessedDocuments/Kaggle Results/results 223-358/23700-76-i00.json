            "description": "The ad hoc group call allows authorised users to combine a set of MCX users based on implementation-specific criteria into a group call. The main characteristics of this ad hoc group call are:\na)\tThe ad hoc group does not exist until it is spontaneously created during the call.\nb)\tThe ad hoc group ceases to exist when the call terminates.\nc)\tThe ad hoc group does not support 'persistent state' communication, e.g. emergency state.\nMCX users that are combined in an ad hoc group call can be served by the same or different MCX systems. The ad hoc group call uses a common security level, priority level, floor control method, and set of operational characteristics for the participants during the call. As with any group call, the priority level can change dynamically.\nThe ad hoc group is used for a single call and it does not persist when the call is terminated. Authorized users can recreate the ad hoc group for subsequent calls, or request creation of a permanent MCX group from the participants in the ad hoc group call.\nThis technical report identifies the key issues and corresponding solutions with recommendations for the normative work.\n",

This kind of deployment topology cannot be exposed and learned by the third party and only be controlled by the network operator.

This is left for the implementation.\n\n\nThe figure depicts an ad hoc group communication setup, showing a group of nodes connected by a wireless network. The setup includes a base station (BS), a group of nodes (G), and a wireless network (W). The nodes are connected by a wireless link, and the BS provides radio access to the group. The setup is designed to allow for flexible and efficient communication within the group.\nFigure 7.1.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group communication setup\n1.\tUser at MC service client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group communication. MC service client 1 initiates the ad hoc group communication by sending the ad hoc group communication request containing the list of participants to the MC service server. Encryption supported information element shall be set to true since end-to -end encryption is supported. The ad hoc group communication request may also contain block sharing participants list indicator information element set to true if the originating user want to suppress sharing of the participants list to other users. The ad hoc group communication request may include the MC service group ID that is created by the MC service client 1 or not include the MC service group ID that allow the MC service server to assign one for use.  An SDP offer containing the MC service client media parameters is included. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the ad hoc group communication request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MC service client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group communication request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group communication request contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\nIf the MC service user at MC service client 1 initiates an MC service emergency ad hoc group communication or the MC service emergency state is already set for the MC service client 1 (due to a previously triggered MC service emergency alert):\ni.\tthe MC service ad hoc group communication request shall contain an emergency indicator;\nii.\tif the MC service emergency state is not set already, MC service client 1 sets its MC service emergency state. The MC service emergency state of MC service client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MC service client 1.\n2.\tThe MC service server accepts the ad hoc group communication request if the ad hoc group communication is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject the ad hoc group communication request and do not continue with the rest of the steps. If authorised, it validates whether the number of invited participants is within the configured limit before proceeding with the communication setup.\nIf functional alias is present, the MC service server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the ad hoc group communication request, the MC service server checks the privacy policy of the MC service user to decide if the location information of MC service client 1 can be provided to other users on the communication (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MC service users on a communication when talking\").\nIf an emergency indicator is present in the received MC service ad hoc group communication request, the MC service ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group communication is terminated; and\nIf an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MC service ad hoc group communication request, the MC service ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group communication is terminated.\nThe MC service server considers the ad hoc group communication participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n3.\tThe MC service server shall send the ad hoc group communication request return message to MC service client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tThe MC service ad hoc group ID (e.g. either provided by MC service client 1 which is acceptable to the MC service server or generated by the MC service server in the case where the MC service ad hoc group ID created by the MC service client 1 is not acceptable or the case where the MC service ad hoc group ID was not provided by MC service client 1); and\nii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group communication is authorized or not\nIf the ad hoc group communication request is not authorized, MC service client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4a-4c.\tMC service client 1 sends AHGC share security material command targeting each of the participants containing the security material to be shared with the participants for use in this ad hoc group communication.\nNOTE 1:\tIf end-to-end encryption is not supported, then the ad hoc group communication security material requests are not sent.\n5a-5c.\tThe MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication requests towards the MC service clients of the invited users based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc group communication requests, the MC service server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MC service clients (e.g. Block sharing participants list indicator, MC service ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge)\n6a-6c.\tThe receiving MC service clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc group communication.\n7a-7c.\tThe receiving MC service clients accept the ad hoc group communication requests and send ad hoc group communication responses to the MC service server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MC service server.\n8.\tThe MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication response to MC service client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful communication establishment.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed since the MC service server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc group communication request to complete before sending the ad hoc group request to another participant.\n9.\tIf the initiating MC service user requires the acknowledgement from the invited MC service users, and the required MC service users do not acknowledge the communication setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged communication setup timeout\"), then the MC service server may proceed with or abandon the communication and then notify the initiating MC service user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to ad hoc group communication policy from the user profile configuration. The MC service server may notify the initiating MC service user of all MC service users who did not acknowledge the ad hoc group communication request within the configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MC service user by the MC service server more than once during the communication when MC service users join or leave the MC service ad hoc group communication.\n10.\tMC service client 1, MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC service client 4 establish media plane and floor control resources.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 10 can occur any time following step 8 if the conditions to proceed with the communication are met.\n\nThe procedure focuses on the case where the MC service server releases an ongoing MC service ad hoc group communication for all the participants of that ad hoc group communication, since at least one of the release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.\nFigure 7.1.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure for the MC service server initiating termination an ongoing ad hoc group communication.\nThe figure depicts a release 2 ad hoc group communication system, showing a group of nodes connected by a wireless network. The system includes a base station (BS), a group of nodes (G), and a wireless network (W). The BS provides radio access to the G, and the W connects the G to the internet. The figure illustrates the communication process, including the transmission of data packets, the reception of data packets, and the establishment of a connection between the G and the internet.\nFigure 7.1.3.1.2-1: Release ad hoc group communication\n1.\tIt is assumed that MC service users on MC service client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group communication.\n2.\tMC service server would like to release the MC service ad hoc group communication which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.\n3.\tMC service server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group communication and generates ad hoc group communication release request to release ongoing session. The MC service server cancels the in-progress emergency state or in-progress imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the ad hoc group communication is an emergency or imminent peril communication respectively.\n4.\tMC service server sends ad hoc group communication release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group communication.\n5.\tMC service users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group communication.\n6.\tMC service client(s) receiving ad hoc group communication release request, acknowledge towards the MC service server by sending an ad hoc group communication release response.\nNOTE:\tIf the participants list is not suppressed by the initiator of the ad hoc group communication, the MC service client(s) may choose to store the list of participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group communication with the same participants.\n7.\tMC service client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group communication that is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e., further communication is not possible over the same ad hoc group.\nFigure 7.1.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group communication setup procedure initiated by the MC service user and MC service client 1 wherein the list of participants is determined by the MC service server based on the citeria received from the MC service client.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC service user at MC service client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group communication.\n2.\tThe MC service user at MC service client 1 wants to invite MC service users who are satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group communication.\nThe figure depicts a network setup where MC service servers determine the ad hoc group communication participants.\nFigure 7.1.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group communication participants determined by MC service server\n\n1.\tUser at MC service client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group communication in-order to invite the participants satisfying specific criteria.

In this case, we consider the partner MC system does not share their users' information to the primary MC system.\n2.\tThe authorized MC service user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.\n3.\tThe MC service server of the primary MC system is where the authorized MC service user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.\n4.\tSome users of the ad hoc group may belong to partner MC systems.\n5.\tThe ad hoc group identity and ad hoc group configuration for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MC service client and other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group communication.\n6.\tThe call initiating MC service client is aware of a suitable preconfigured ad hoc group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs who are the participants of the ad hoc group.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call, showing the various components and their arrangement. The setup includes a base station (BS), a group of users (UG), and a router (R). The diagram illustrates the setup process, including the placement of the base station, the distribution of the users, and the routing of the data. The figure is used to demonstrate the concept of ad hoc group calls, which are a type of wireless communication where users are connected to a central point without the need for a dedicated network infrastructure.\nFigure 7.2.2.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tThe MC service client of authorized user initiates a group call with multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. A group call request message with the information of the MC service IDs and the pre-configured ad hoc group is routed to the MC service server of the primary MC system.\n2.\tThe MC service server of the primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using MC service users' information and the configuration of the preconfigured ad hoc group received in step 1 and assigns a MC service group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. It identifies the appropriate MC service server responsible for the MC service users of the ad hoc group. The MC service users are automatically affiliated to the ad hoc group.\nNOTE 1:\tThe newly formed ad hoc group information including the MC service group ID and the list of users is held in dynamic data in the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server of the primary MC system sends the group call request to the affiliated group members of the ad hoc group belonging to the primary MC system.\n4.\tThe MC service clients receive in the group call request the information of the MC service group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify their corresponding MC service user. The affiliated group members of the ad hoc group of the primary MC system may accept or reject the call and respond with the group call response.\n5.\tThe primary MC service server further initiates a group call request message to the MC service server of the partner MC system for the ad hoc group's MC service users' belonging to partner MC system.\n6.\tUpon receiving the group call request message from the MC service server of the primary MC system, the MC service server of the partner MC system initiates a call invitation to its MC service users and sends the group call request to the MC service users of the partner MC system.\n7.\tThe MC service clients receive in the group call request the information of the MC service group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify their corresponding MC service user. The MC service users upon receipt of the invitation may accept or reject the call, and respond with the group call response.\n8.\tThe MC service server of the partner MC system provides a group call response message to the MC service server of the primary MC system with success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.\n9.\tThe MC service server of the primary MC system provides a group call response message to the MC service client of the authorized MC service user upon receiving response to the corresponding group call request with the MC service server of the partner MC system. The group call response will consist of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure. The MC service client 1 receives the MC service group ID assigned for the ad hoc group via this step.\nNOTE 2:\tThe group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n10.\tUpon successful group call setup, a group call is established amongst the multiple group members from primary and partner MC systems. The media plane and floor control resources are established.\nThis procedure focuses on the case where an MC service server initiates the termination of an ongoing MC service ad hoc group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MC service group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 7.2.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MC service server initiating termination of an ongoing MC service ad hoc group call.\nThe figure depicts a 2.2.2.2 Ad Hoc group call release, showing the release process for a specific group call. The release is depicted in a graphical format, with the release status, release time, and release duration clearly labeled. The figure is a visual representation of the release process, allowing users to understand the steps involved in releasing a group call.\nFigure 7.2.2.2-1: Ad hoc group call release\n1.\tIt is assumed that MC service users on MC service client 1, client 2 belonging to primary MC system and client 3 belonging to partner MC system are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call (e.g. as a result of ad hoc group call setup as specified in clause 7.2.2.1.1).\n2.\tThe MC service server would like to release the MC service group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MC service group members are not present.\n3.\tThe MC service server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group call and generates group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call. If the participants belong to partner MC system, then group call release request is sent to the partner MC service server, which further sends the group call release request to the MC service clients.\n5.\tThe MC service users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.\n6.\tThe MC service client(s) receiving group call release request, send acknowledgement towards the MC service server by sending a group call release response.\n7.\tThe MC service client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is terminated. The MC service servers remove the ad hoc group information from the dynamic data held in the MC service servers and thus the ad hoc group ceases to exist.\nTable 7.3.2.1.1-1 describes the information flow group call request from the MC service client to the MC service server.

This solution provides a procedure for the MC service server to create the ad hoc group ID and share it to the MC service clients that needs to be used for the ad hoc group communication. MC service client is not allowed to create AHGC group ID in solution #1.This way the MC service client is totally transparent of the network topology of the MC system domain and no need to create the ad hoc group ID by itself. As the network is the one selecting which MC service server to host the AHGC, network resources (the MC service server that hosts this group communication) can be dynamically allocated based on real-time information of network resources such as availability and traffic load balance that can be further specified in the normative work.
