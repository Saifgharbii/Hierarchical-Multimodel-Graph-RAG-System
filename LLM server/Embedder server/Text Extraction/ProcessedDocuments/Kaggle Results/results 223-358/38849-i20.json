Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced document.\nshould\t\tindicates a recommendation to do something\nshould not\tindicates a recommendation not to do something\nmay\t\tindicates permission to do something\nneed not\tindicates permission not to do something\nThe construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.\ncan\t\tindicates that something is possible\ncannot\t\tindicates that something is impossible\nThe constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and \"need not\".\nwill\t\tindicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nwill not\t\tindicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nmight\tindicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nmight not\tindicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nIn addition:\nis\t(or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\nis not\t(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\nThe constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.\n",

The result of this consultation is that at the November 2020 meeting the ECC with ECC Decision (20)01 “on the harmonised use of the frequency bands 5945 to 6425 MHz for the implementation of Wireless Access Systems including Radio Local Area Networks (WAS/RLANs)” approved unlicensed operation in the range 5945 to 6425 MHz. This initiated this TR which has later been expanded to also include NR unlicensed operation in the 6 GHz band for other regions.\nNR-Unlicensed is standardized in Rel-16 with the definition of band n96 covering the spectrum range 5925-7125 MHz which is currently applicable in the USA only subject to FCC Report and Order FCC 20-51. For Rel-17 3GPP WG4 is tasked to also enable unlicensed operation in the range 5945 to 6425 MHz for European deployments and in the 5925-7125 MHz range for other regions.\nRegulatory information is maintained in [2].\n",

Each additional emission requirement is associated with a unique network signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC signalling by an NR frequency band number of the applicable operating band as detailed in TS 38.101-1.\nTo meet the additional requirements applicable in EU as given in EN 303 687, additional maximum power reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table 6.1.1.1.1-1 for low power indoor (LPI) with PC5 and in Table 6.1.1.1.1-1b for PC3.\n\nTable 6.1.1.1-1:  A-MPR for PC5 LPI\n\nTable 6.1.1.1.1-1a:  Signal setup\n\nThe figure depicts a simulation of a 5G network scenario, specifically focusing on the performance of a PC3 LPI (Long Term Evolution-Advanced) in the EU/CEPT (European Commission for the Promotion of Research and Technological Development) network. The simulation results show the impact of various factors on the network's performance, such as the number of users, the number of base stations (BTS), and the distance between the BTS and the user equipment (UE). The figure also includes a visual representation of the network's topology, showing the distribution of BTS and UE locations.\nFigure 6.1.1.1.1-1a: A-MPR simulation results for PC3 LPI in EU/CEPT.\n\nTable 6.1.1.1.1-1b: A-MPR for PC3 LPI (1TX)\n\nFor very low power (VLP) operation the out-of-band emissions and in-band power spectral density requirements are much more restrictive than for LPI.  For PC5 VLP, a comprehensive set of A-MPR simulation results is provided below for 20, 40, 60, and 80 MHz channels.  In Figure 6.1.1.1-1 all channels in the band are represented while in Figure 6.1.1.1-2 lower edge channels are not illustrated since those are most impacted by the additional spurious emission requirement of -45 dBm/MHz.  The lower edge channels found to be impacted were the ones centered at 5955 MHz for 20 MHz channels, 5965 MHz for 40 MHz channels, 5975 MHz and 5995 MHz for 60 MHz channels, and 5985 MHz for 80 MHz channels.\nTable 6.1.1.1-2.  Simulation scenarios for all CBW/SCS\n\nThe figure depicts a power backoff scheme for 20, 40, 60, and 80 MHz channels, illustrating the different power levels at which the signal is transmitted. The scheme is designed to ensure reliable communication in various frequency bands.\nFigure 6.1.1.1.1-1. Power backoff for 20, 40, 60, and 80 MHz channels\n\nThe figure depicts a power backoff scenario with lower edge channels excluded, illustrating the impact of these channels on the system's performance. The figure shows the power backoff configuration, with the lower edge channels excluded, which can lead to a reduction in the system's capacity and impact on the overall system performance.\nFigure 6.1.1.1.1-2.

The simulation results indicate that PC5 VLP has a high PDR of 99.99% and a low PLR of 0.0001%, which demonstrates its effectiveness in providing reliable and high-speed communication in the 5G network.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.3-2: A-MPR simulation results for PC5 VLP in Japan.\n\nTable 6.1.1.2.3-3: A-MPR for PC5 VLP in Japan\n\nTable 6.1.1.2.1-1: Signal setup (LPI).\n\nThe figure depicts a simulation of a 5G network in Canada, showing the performance of PC5 LPI (Long Term Evolution Plus) in terms of packet loss, jitter, and delay.

The simulation results show the system's ability to detect and track vehicles, with a sensitivity of 100 meters and a range of 1000 meters. The system is designed to operate in a wide range of environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low temperatures, and is capable of detecting vehicles at night and in poor visibility conditions. The simulation results indicate that the system is effective in detecting and tracking vehicles, with a high level of accuracy and reliability.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.1-2: A-MPR simulation results for PC5 VLP in Canada.\nTable 6.1.1.2.1-4: A-MPR for PC5 VLP in Canada\n\nTable 6.1.1.2.2-1: Signal setup (LPI and VLP).\n\nThe figure depicts a simulation of a 5G network in South Korea, showing the performance of PC5 LPI (Long Term Evolution Plus) in terms of packet loss, jitter, and delay.

The results show that the network achieves a 2.5 Gbps throughput in Peru and 1.5 Gbps in Chile, demonstrating the potential of 5G technology in providing high-speed connectivity in these regions.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.3-1: A-MPR simulation results for PC5 LPI in Peru and Chile.\nTable 6.1.1.2.3-2: A-MPR for PC5 LPI in Peru and Chile\n\nThe A-MPR results for PC5 LPI in Peru and Chile are mostly identical to the A-MPR results defined by NS_53 (LPI in US). In some cases, A-MPR results are 0.5-1dB relaxed comparing to NS_53. Thus, accounting for the marginal difference between these A-MPR values and NS_53, the latter can be re-used to support Peru and Chile.\n\n\nTable 6.1.1.2.4-1: Signal setup (VLP).\n\nThe figure depicts a simulation of a 5G network in Brazil, showing the performance of PC5 LPI (Long Term Evolution Plus) in terms of packet loss, jitter, and delay.
