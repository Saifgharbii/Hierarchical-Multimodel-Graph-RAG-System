For instance, NTN satellite UE is assumed to connect and transmit to the satellite when it is outside a Terrestrial Network operating in an adjacent channel/band. The satellite beam might still overlap the terrestrial network.\n",

Commission’s technical rules for its MSS authorization can be found in FCC 47 C.F.R Part 25.\nTechnical rules for NTN SAN and UEs operating in 1 to 3 GHz from FCC’s 47 C.F.R. § 25.202 [23] are summarized below:\n47 C.F.R. § 25.202:\n(d) Frequency tolerance, Earth stations. The carrier frequency of each earth station transmitter authorized in these services shall be maintained within 0.001 percent of the reference frequency.\n(e) Frequency tolerance, space stations. The carrier frequency of each space station transmitter authorized in these services shall be maintained within 0.002 percent of the reference frequency.\n47 C.F.R. § 25.202 (f):\nEmission limitations. Except for SDARS terrestrial repeaters and as provided for in paragraph (i), the mean power of emissions shall be attenuated below the mean output power of the transmitter in accordance with the schedule set forth in  through  of this section. The out-of-band emissions of SDARS terrestrial repeaters shall be attenuated in accordance with the schedule set forth in  of this section.\n(1)\tIn any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: 25 dB;\n(2)\tIn any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: 35 dB;\n(3)\tIn any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: An amount equal to 43 dB plus 10 times the logarithm (to the base 10) of the transmitter power in watts;\n(4)\tIn any event, when an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in ,  and  of this section.\n47 C.F.R. § 25.216:\n(a) The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from mobile earth stations placed in service on or before July 21, 2002 with assigned uplink frequencies between 1610 MHz and 1660.5 MHz shall not exceed −70 dBW/MHz, averaged over any 2 millisecond active transmission interval, in the band 1559-1587.42 MHz.

Inmarsat-B terminals manufactured more than six months after Federal Register publication of the rule changes adopted in FCC 03-283 must meet these limits. Inmarsat B terminals manufactured before then are temporarily grandfathered under the condition that no interference is caused by these terminals to aeronautical satellite radio-navigation systems. The full-compliance deadline for grandfathered Inmarsat-B terminals is December 31, 2012.\n(e) The e.i.r.p density of emissions from mobile earth stations with assigned uplink frequencies between 1990 MHz and 2025 MHz shall not exceed −70 dBW/MHz, averaged over any 2 millisecond active transmission interval, in frequencies between 1559 MHz and 1610 MHz.

The e.i.r.p of discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth from such stations shall not exceed a level determined by linear interpolation from −80 dBW at 1605 MHz to −20 dBW at 1610 MHz, averaged over any 2 millisecond active transmission interval.\n(h) Mobile earth stations manufactured more than six months after Federal Register publication of the rule changes adopted in FCC 03-283 with assigned uplink frequencies in the 1626.5-1660.5 MHz band shall suppress the power density of emissions in the 1605-1610 MHz band-segment to an extent determined by linear interpolation from −70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to −46 dBW/MHz at 1610 MHz, averaged over any 2 millisecond active transmission interval.

This can be captured as part of additional spurious emission requirements which allows inclusion of frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) from the edge of the channel bandwidth.\n\n",

For Case 1 (Urban scenario), an Isolation distance of 1500m as 2*ISD is considered to reflect the NTN-TN selection algorithm at the border, assuming TN connection will always be prioritized over NTN.\nAs defined in Figure 6.2.1.1-1, isolation distance is the distance between the blue-dotted line which represents TN cell boarder and the red line. No UEs deployed in the isolation region is assumed to reduce the calculation complexity.\nThe figure depicts the isolation distance for Case 1, which is a crucial aspect of network design and performance. The isolation distance is the minimum distance between two points in a network, and it is an essential factor in ensuring the reliability and security of the network. The figure shows the isolation distance for Case 1, which is 1 meter, and the corresponding probability of a collision. This information is crucial for network designers and operators to understand the network's performance and to make informed decisions about network design and implementation.\nFigure 6.2.1.1-1: Isolation distance for Case 1\nTable 6.2.1.1-1:\tNetwork and UE deployment\n\nFor simulations of HAPS and TN co-existence, a cluster of TN cells is randomly dropped in the HAPS coverage area as shown in Figure 6.2.1.2-1. The TN cell cluster consists of 19 sites, 57 sectors, with the same assumption described in clause 6.2.2.4. HAPS coverage and cell layout are described in clause 6.2.2.3.\nThe figure depicts a simulation layout between HAPS (High-Speed Packet Access) and TN (Tunnel Nodes) in a 5G network. It illustrates the interconnection of HAPS with TN nodes, highlighting the importance of proper network design to ensure efficient communication and data transmission.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-1: Simulation layout between HAPS and TN\nHAPS and HAPS co-existence can be characterized by “center-to-center” inter-system distance (i.e., the distance between two coverage centers) as depicted in Figure 6.2.1.3-1. Since HAPS location is at the center of its coverage area, the inter-system distance is the separation of the two HAPS. Different inter-system distances may be simulated to evaluate the interference caused by antenna gain variation in the elevation domain.\nThe figure depicts a simulation layout between HAPS (High-Speed Packet Access) and HAPS, illustrating the interconnection of these two types of high-speed communication networks. The layout includes various components such as HAPs, HAPs, and HAPs, with the HAPs connected to the HAPS through the simulation layout. The layout is designed to ensure efficient communication between the two networks, with the HAPs acting as the primary communication links.\nFigure 6.2.1.3-1: Simulation layout between HAPS and HAPS\n",

Two implementations of the layout are shown in Figure 6.2.2.3-1. The UEs in the HAPS system are assumed to be outdoor and uniformly distributed in the coverage area in the rural environment. The serving cell is selected by the strongest RSRP or least coupling loss. (Note: Calibration data show these two implementations yield similar results). HAPS system parameters for the co-existence study are listed in Table 6.2.2.3-1.\nFor DL transmission, one UE is scheduled for the full bandwidth. For UL transmission, 9 UEs are scheduled, each using a bandwidth of 6 RBs. The scheduled UEs are evenly distributed in the frequency domain as shown in Figure 6.2.2.3-2. Note that the scheduled resources are aligned among different cells to model co-channel effect. Since the UE uses only part of the channel bandwidth in UL, the ACI impact may differ in the frequency domain of the adjacent channel.

It was further discussed and agreed that simply using 20% active rate and assuming fully deployed NR stations with urban deployment assumptions in the whole NR-NTN beam coverage area would overestimate the density and aggregated interference from NR stations to NR-NTN in this scenario. In the end, the case of NR DL interfering the NR-NTN LEO-600 UL that deployed in a Rural environment has been selected as a representative one that could be used as basis to derive ACIR values. Further study could be considered base on a mixed Urban and Rural environment.\nTable 6.4.6-1: Simulation results for average throughput loss - TN BS with non-AAS antenna\n\n\nFigure 6.4.6-1: Simulation results for average throughput loss - TN BS with non-AAS antenna\nTable 6.4.6-2: Simulation results for 5%-tile throughput loss - TN BS with non-AAS antenna\n\n\nFigure 6.4.6-2: Simulation results for 5%-tile throughput loss - TN BS with non-AAS antenna\nTable 6.4.6-3: Interpolated ACIR values for Scenario 5 to meet the 5% throughput loss criteria - TN BS with non-AAS antenna\n\nTable 6.4.6-4: Average ACIR of 5%-tile values in the above worse case for Scenario 6 - TN BS with non-AAS antenna\n\n",

The technical justifications which support the requirements definition are also presented in the following sub-clauses.\nNTN products are assumed to use AAS BS architecture, with both 1-H and 1-O being included in Release 17 WI. Therefore, both conducted, as well as radiated requirements are required to be considered.\nThe requirements in TS 38.108 [26] apply to Satellite Access Node otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios are exactly the same for SAN with and without connectors.\nFor SAN type 1-O and SAN type 1-H, two SAN classes (LEO and GEO) are currently defined in Table 7.3.1.1-1.\nTable 7.3.1.1-1: SAN classes\n\nThe classification is based on the requirements associated with SAN classes in case-by-case manner including [IoT level/ICS, NF, ACLR/ACS, Emission] requirements. The satellite altitude or orbit type were not identified as part of the class differentiation, and for this reason LEO at 600 km and LEO at 1200 km were grouped together in the same class. At least NF, ACLR and ACS values are the same for LEO 600 km and LEO 1200 km and therefore are not requiring class differentiation. On the other hand, as resulted from the coexistence studies, ACLR requirement values are different between GEO and LEO constellations, requiring a class differentiation. Differences exist as well in terms of emission requirements (e.g. Out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions) between GEO and LEO. At the same time, ACS requirement values from the coexistence studies are the same between GEO and LEO constellations.\n",

The OoB domain emission as attached Annex 5 should be attenuated below the maximum psd by the following and the attenuation can’t be greater than the spurious emission limit.\nThe OoB domain emissions of a station operating in the bands allocated to the FSS and MSS should be attenuated below the maximum psd, in a reference bandwidth of 4 kHz (for systems operating above 15 GHz a reference bandwidth of 1 MHz may be used in place of 4 kHz) within the necessary bandwidth, by the following:\nThe figure depicts the frequency offset from the edge of the total assigned band, expressed as a percentage of necessary bandwidth. The OoB emission domain starts at the edges of the total assigned band.\nwhere F is the frequency offset from the edge of the total assigned band, expressed as a percentage of necessary bandwidth. It is noted that the OoB emission domain starts at the edges of the total assigned band.\nThe figure depicts an example of an OoB mask, which is a key component in the design of a 5G network. The mask is used to represent the attenuation of signals in the presence of noise and interference. The figure shows the attenuation of signals at different levels, with the spurious limit (25 dBsd) being the most significant. This is important for ensuring the reliability of the network and for meeting the required performance standards.\nFigure 7.3.2.2.4.2-1: Example of OoB mask assuming the spurious limit is equivalent to 25 dBsd\nThe “F” = Frequency offset / channel bandwidth × 100 can be get as above. Thus, the OoB mask requirements can be specified as below based on the ITU regulation when we use f_offset and BWchannel to replace “F”.\nTransmitter basic limits for spurious emissions are presented in Table 7.3.2.2.5-1.\nTable 7.3.2.2.5-1: SAN transmitter spurious emission limits\n\nRecommendation ITU-R SM.329 [30] defines Unwanted emissions in the spurious domain.

These points are crucial for determining the optimal placement of base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UE) to maximize network performance. The figure illustrates the importance of considering factors such as signal strength, distance, and the presence of obstacles when selecting reference points.\nFigure 7.3.3.1-1: Reference points for mmeasurement of Rx requirements\nThe FRCs specified in TS 38.104[16] shall be re-used to specify the satellite access node Rx requirements. Further revisit is not precluded if the spectrum utilization (SU) would be different.\nFor derivation of the Rx requirements, the following assumptions were made:\n-\tThe FRCs specified in TS 38.104 [16] for NR BS were re-used to specify the NTN SAN Rx requirements.\n-\tThe Implementation Margin (IM) value was assumed to be 2 dB for NTN SAN.\n-\tThe following Noise Figure (NF) values were used for the derivation of Rx requirements for NTN SAN:\nTable 7.3.3.1-1: NF values for NTN SAN requirements derivation\n\nThe following equation was used to derive the reference sensitivity for NTN SAN requirement development, reusing the same methodology for the reference sensitivity derivation as done for the NR BS, as captured in TR 38.817-02 [31]:\nPREFSENS = -174 dBm/Hz + 10 * log10 BW + NF + IM + SNR [dBm]\nWhere:\n-\tBW is the maximum transmission bandwidth,\n-\tNF is noise figure of NTN SAN receiver in dB,\n-\tIM is implementation margin reserved for NTN SAN manufacturer in dB;\n-\tSNR is the value to satisfy the 95% throughput of the FRC channel.\nThe Rx dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal at the TAB connector for SAN type 1-H inside the received SAN channel bandwidth. In this condition, a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel. As the Rx dynamic range requirement measures the effects of NTN SAN receiver’s impairments, the uncertainty due to the receiver’s own thermal noise floor should be minimized. Therefore, the interference level should be increased by a certain amount of margin to mask the receiver’s own noise floor, represented by Interference over Thermal (IoT).\nIn order to define the dynamic range requirement, both wanted and interfering signal power levels need to be defined. The mean power levels of interfering and the wanted signals were defined in the following method:\nPIntf = -174 dBm/Hz + 10 * log10(NRB * SCS * 12) + NF + IoT\nPwanted = -174 dBm/Hz + 10 * log10(NRB * SCS * 12) + NF + IoT + SNR + IM\nWhere:\n-\tNRB is the transmission bandwidth configuration of the lowest SCS defined for SAN for each BS channel bandwidth;\n-\tSCS is the lowest sub-carrier spacing defined for SAN for each BS channel bandwidth;\n-\tNF is noise figure of SAN receiver in dB as defined in table 6.2.2.1-5,\n- \tIoT: during the discussion various values of the IoT were considered for the definition of the dynamic range requirement. In case of LEO600, IoT values in range of 15-18 dB were collected based on the simulation results.  In case of LEO1200, IoT values in range of 10-15 dB were collected based on the simulation results, as captured in annex D.\n-\tSNR is the value to satisfy the 95% throughput of measurement channel. As the derivation methodology and the FRC’s from the NR BS was reused, more details on the SNR simulation results can be found in TR 38.817-02 [31];\n-\tIM is implementation margin reserved for SAN manufacturer in dB. The IM values was reused from the NR BS as 2 dB;\nFor SAN it was agreed to define a single dynamic range requirement for LEO SAN (both 600 and 1200) based on the IoT value of 15 dB. Based on the collected simulation results for NTN scenarios, it was decided not to define dynamic rage requirement for SAN GEO class.\nThe interfering signal for the dynamic range requirement was defined as AWGN signal, same as for NR BS requirements.\n7.3.3.2.3.1\tAdjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)\n7.3.3.2.3.1.1\tGeneral\nAdjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver’s ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at the antenna connector for NTN Satellite Access Node (SAN) in the presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.\nThe ACS value is coming from coexistence analysis. A worst case value of 38 dB ACS is found in GEO case and the interfering signal mean power (dBm) is computed given a NF 7.4 dB for a 5 MHz band.\nIt is worth noting that OFDM is considered as interfering waveform (rather than DFT-s-OFDM) corresponding to a coexistence scenario 6 for the MSS S-band where TN BS DL is interfering with SAN UL.\n7.3.3.2.3.1.2\tMinimum requirements for Satellite Access Node\nThe throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel.\nFor SAN, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the antenna connector are specified in table 7.3.3.2.3.1.2-1 and table 7.3.3.2.3.1.2-2 and the frequency offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.3.3.2.3.1.2-3 for ACS.\nThe ACS requirement is applicable outside the SAN RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the SAN RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.\nMinimum conducted requirement is defined at the antenna connector.\nTable 7.3.3.2.3.1.2-1: SAN GEO class ACS requirement\n\nTable 7.3.3.2.3.1.2-2: SAN LEO class ACS requirement\n\nThe wanted signal and interfering signal power level are calculated in the following way in FR1:\nWanted signal power level = REFSENS + 6 dB\nInterfering signal power level = SAN noise floor + ACS + 4.7dB = -174 dBm/Hz+10*log10(BW) + NF + ACS + 4.7 dB\nWhere:\n-\tBW is wanted signal bandwidth in Hz, e.g. 25 PRB for 5 MHz SCS 15 kHz;\n-\tNF is noise figure which is agreed as 7.4 dB for GEO, 4.3 dB for LEO@600, 4.3 dB for LEO@1200;\n-\tSAN ACS is agreed as 38 dBc (more precisely according to coexistence Scenario 6, it has been noticed from the coexistence simulations that the required SAN ACS is in the order of 38 dBc ACS);\n-\t4.7 dB is calculated from 10log10(10^(6/10)-1).\nIf the equation considers the worst case of 38 dB ACS, with NF of 7.4 dB for GEO class and NF of 4.3 dB for LEO class, for 5 MHz signal bandwidth (as for TS 38.104[16]), the interfering signal mean power level is:\n-174+10*log10(5*10^6)+7.4+38+4.7=-57dBm for GEO class, according to the interfering signal mean power value from Table 7.4.1.2-1.\n-174+10*log10(5*10^6)+4.3+38+4.7=-60dBm for LEO class, according to the interfering signal mean power value from Table 7.4.1.2-2.\nTable 7.3.3.2.3.1.2-3: SAN ACS interferer frequency offset values\n\n7.3.3.2.3.2 \tIn-band blocking\nNo In-band blocker is considered for SAN.\n7.3.3.2.4.1\tGeneral\nThe out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the TAB connector for SAN type 1-H in the presence of an unwanted interferer out of the operating band, which is a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.\n\nFigure 7.3.3.2.4.1-1: Band of concern to determine OOB blocking\nThe identified worst case is for the band n256 with the SpaceOps TC (TeleCommand) band between 2025 and 2110 MHz. This band is used to send commands to the satellite platform, taking into account the fact that a very robust radio link is established. To do so, the maximum EIRP of SpaceOps (Space Operations) TC (TeleCommand) stations is 80 dBW.\nFor a LEO satellite at 600 km (LEO@600km), in a worst case scenario (i.e. SpaceOps TC station at satellite Nadir), the free space losses are 154 dB.\nTherefore, the signal level at satellite level is -44 dBm.\n7.3.3.2.4.2\tMinimum requirements for Satellite Access Node\nThe throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to SAN type 1-H TAB connector using the parameters in table 7.3.3.2.4.2-1.\nThe out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to FUL,low – ΔfOOB and from FUL,high + ΔfOOB up to 12750 MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD operating band.\nMinimum conducted requirement is defined at the antenna connector at the TAB connector for SAN type 1-H.\nTable 7.3.3.2.4.2-1: Out-of-band blocking performance requirement for NR\n\nThe requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.\nThe requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.\nThe requirement framework from terrestrial network (TN) NR specification is agreed to be reused.\nOn the same principle as for the NR TN BS Specification TS 38.104[16], the SAN OTA sensitivity testing procedure should be based on SAN manufacturer declarations of sensitivity direction and EIS level.\nOTA reference sensitivity level is a directional requirement specified as an EIS level. On the same principle as for the NR TN BS specification TS38.104[16], the SAN OTA reference sensitivity EISREFSENS requirements should be derived from:\n-\tthe conducted reference sensitivity PREFSENS which can be calculated based on the formula presented in Section 7.3.3.2.1;\n-\ta hypothetical antenna gain of a passive satellite antenna;\n-\tsome implementation margin reserved for the NTN SAN manufacturer.\nThe last two contributions are both taken into account under ΔOTAREFSENS parameter.\nAs OTA reference sensitivity is used as a reference for many of the interference requirements where it is important that the interferer is polarization matched to the receiver antenna it is also important that the wanted signal is polarization matched. Hence OTA reference sensitivity is specifically declared per polarization and the EIS values are under the assumption of polarization match.\nFor SAN type 1-O, OTA reference sensitivity is intended to provide equivalent protection and performance as the conducted reference sensitivity level. The OTA reference sensitivity level is calculated based on the conducted reference sensitivity level for SAN type 1-H and antenna gain of a passive antenna which would be used with a non-AAS SAN in the same deployment scenario.\nThe requirement assumes that the wanted signal and interfering signal come from the same direction. And since both wanted signal and AWGN will be transmitted from the test equipment in the same direction, the same combining gain will be achieved for both wanted signal and the AWGN. Hence, the OTA dynamic range for FR1 can be defined based on conductive requirements plus an offset, i.e., ΔOTAREFSENS.\n7.3.3.3.4.1\tOTA adjacent channel selectivity\nOTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver’s ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system. For SAN type 1-O, interfering signal mean power should be offset by the value ΔminSENS, other parameters could be reused from SAN type 1-H and respective ACS clause.\n7.3.3.3.5.1\tGeneral\nThe OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the RIB at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.\n7.3.3.3.5.2\tMinimum requirement for SAN type 1-O\n7.3.3.3.5.2.1\tGeneral minimum requirement\nThe requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction and are within the minSENS RoAoA.\nThe wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the assumption of polarization match. The interferer shall be polarization matched in-band and the polarization maintained for out-of-band frequencies.\nThe values for the minimum requirements have been obtained with the hypothesis from section 7.3.3.2.4 Out-of-band blocking, considering the maximum EIRP of SpaceOps (Space Operations) TC (TeleCommand) stations of 80 dBW, and the interfering signal mean power of -44 dBm, for a LEO satellite at 600 km of altitude (LEO@600km).\nFor OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the parameters in table 7.3.5.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:\n-\tThe throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel.\nFor SAN type 1-O the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 30 MHz to FUL,low – ΔfOOB and from FUL,high + ΔfOOB up to 12750 MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD operating band.\nTable 7.3.3.3.5.2.1-1: OTA out-of-band blocking performance requirement\n\n7.3.3.3.5.2.2\tCo-location minimum requirement\nThis requirement is not applicable in Release 17.\nThe requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.\nThis requirement is not applicable in Release 17.\nFor SAN type 1-O, power level of wanted signal and interfering signal should be offset by the value ΔminSENS. Other parameters could be reused from SAN type 1-H and respective in-channel selectivity (ICS) clause.\n",

For UE with integral antenna only, a reference antenna with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. Handheld PC3 UE is assumed in Release 17 for satellite access.\nThe following UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth of NR carrier unless otherwise stated. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame (1ms).\nTable 7.4.2.2.1-1: UE Power Class\n\n7.4.2.2.2.1\tMPR\nUE is allowed to reduce the maximum output power (MPR) due to higher order modulations and transmit bandwidth configurations to meet the general transmission requirements which includes in-band emission, ACLR, out-of-band emission and general spurious emission. As it was agreed those general transmission requirements can be reused from TN, the same requirements specified in Table 6.2.2-1 in TS 38.101-1 [17] can be reused for NTN satellite access UEs.\n7.4.2.2.2.2\tA-MPR\nA-MPR is band specific requirement which is used to meet the additional requirements indicated by network signalling (NS) value.\nFor n256, based on the regulation conclusion in section 5.2, the A-MPR requirements for n65 could be as starting point. From TS 38.101-1, since the maximum carrier centre frequency of NS_05 and NS_05U is lower than 1960 MHz and the maximum carrier centre frequency of NS_51 is lower than 1980 MHz, it is proposed NS_05, NS_05U and NS_51 don’t need to be considered for n256. The requirements of NS_01, NS_24 and NS_100 specified in Table 6.2.3.1-1 in TS 38.101-1 [17] for band n65 can be reused for n256\nFor n255, based on regulatory requirements, a new NS is required. The following observations were made from the measurement results using an LTE modem and transceiver supporting 1626.5 – 1656.5 MHz:\n-\tFor 5 MHz channel, PA emissions for DFT-s-OFDM are below the spurious emission limits between 1559 and 1606 MHz.\n-\tFor 10 MHz channel, PA emissions for DFT-s-OFDM are exceeding the spurious emission limits for 1 MHz MBW by 5 dB between 1604 and 1606 MHz.\n-\tFor 15 MHz channel, PA emissions for DFT-s-OFDM are exceeding the spurious emission limits for 1 MHz MBW by 9 dB between 1599 and 1606 MHz.\n-\tFor 20 MHz channel, PA emissions for DFT-s-OFDM are exceeding the spurious emission limits by 9 dB between 1584 and 1606 MHz.\n-\tFor 700 Hz MBW, PA emissions for all channel bandwidths are below the spurious emission limits between 1559 and 1606 MHz.\nA n255 duplexer with rejection of more than 10 dB will be a sufficient to satisfy the spurious emission limits specified in Table 7.4.2.2.8-1.\nBased on this measurement observations, the expected filter attenuation of more than 10 dB below 1610 MHz is going to be adequate to meet the additional emissions requirements between 1559 – 1610 MHz, and therefore, no A-MPR needs to be specified for n255.\nIn view of the above, the additional requirements with their associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and applicable operating band(s) for each NS value shall be specified in Table 7.4.2.2.2.2-1 and the mapping of NR satellite band numbers and values of the additionalSpectrumEmission to network signalling labels is specified in Table 7.4.2.2.2.2-1A.\nTable 7.4.2.2.2.2-1: Additional maximum power reduction (A-MPR)\n\nTable 7.4.2.2.2.2-1A: Mapping of network signalling label\n\nFor n256, FFS for how to protect n2, n25, n70 and whether A-MPR required.\nFor Transmit OFF power and Power control, the framework and requirements for existing TN UE can be reused for satellite UE. The transmit OFF power is -50 dBm for 20MHz.\nSince handheld UE always transmits the maximum output power for satellite access scenario based on the NR NTN calibration summary in R4-2115628, FFS whether relaxed value needed or not based on existing TN UE requirements\nThe UE basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL slot. The mean value of basic measurements of UE modulated carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period of 1 ms of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the carrier frequency received from the Satellite Access Node.\nNOTE:\tThe requirements is applicable only when PVT ephemeris updated at least once [10] seconds.\nFor the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude), the same requirements specified in TS 38.101-1 [17] sub-clause 6.4.2.1 for QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM can be reused for NTN satellite access UEs. NTN satellite access UEs support UL/DL 64QAM for NTN operation as optional with per band.\nFor the carrier leakage, the same requirements specified in TS 3.101-1 [17] sub-clause 6.4.2.2 can be reused for NTN satellite access UEs.\nFor the in-band emission, the same requirements specified in TS 3.101-1 [17] sub-clause 6.4.2.3 can be reused for NTN satellite access UEs.\nFor SEM of NTN satellite access UEs, the same requirements of TN UE specified in TS 38.101-1 [17] sub-clause 6.5.2.2 can be reused.\nFor ACLR, the same ACLR for TN NR UE which is specified in TS 3.101-1 [17] sub-clause 6.5.2.4.1 can be applied for NTN satellite access UEs.\nThe requirement of ALCR is specified in Table 7.4.2.2.7-1.\nTable 7.4.2.2.7-1: NTN satellite access UE ACLR requirement\n\nThe spurious emissions limits specified in TS 38.101-1[17] sub-clause 6.5.3 would also be applicable to NTN satellite access UEs referring to the ERC Recommendation 74-01[28] Annex 3 item 3.1.4 for Mobile Earth Stations (MES) (see Note 1bis) transmitting in the Mobile Satellite Service between 1 GHz and 3 GHz.\nConsidering FCC rule 47 C.F.R § 25.216 (h) [23], TN UE’s general spurious emission requirements will be inadequate for L-band NTN satellite UE operation in the US. A new NS value and a subclause with Table 7.4.2.2.8-1 needs to be specified for n255 for NTN satellite operations in the US.\nTable 7.4.2.2.8-1: Additional requirements for NS_57N\n\nThe transmit intermodulation limits specified in TS 38.101-1[17] sub-clause 6.5.4 (Table 7.4.2.2.9-1) would also be applicable to NTN satellite access UEs.\nThe requirement of transmit intermodulation is specified in Table 7.4.2.2.9-1.\nTable 7.4.2.2.9-1: Transmit Intermodulation\n\nIn recent RAN4#102 and RAN4#103 meetings, the spurious emissions requirements (-50dBm/MHz) for protected bands UE co-existence (especially for band n256 UL: 1980~2010MHz DL: 2170~2200MHz) were widely discussed. The adjacent/overlapping TN bands to NTN band n256 are shown in Figure 5.2.1-1.\n1)\tCoexistence protection for band n34 DL\nThe NS_24 including associated A-MPR value as specified in TS 38.101-1[17] is reused to solve this issue in Release 17. However, other companies pointed out the n256 UL frequency range can’t be leveraged due to 5MHz guard band at the upper of n256 UL frequency range to protect band n34.If NS_24 is used, n256 will be reduced due to the 5 MHz guard band that has been considered with NS_24, frequency range 2005-2010 MHz can not be used anymore. Besides, when NS_24 is indicated to protect the DL frequency range of band n34, satellite UE has to reduce the out power in band n256. It will lead to UL throughput loss and even UL radio link failure for some UL RB configurations.\n2)\tCoexistence protection for band n39 DL\n-50dBm/MHz co-existence requirement can be met considering 20MHz channel bandwidth for band n256 without A-MPR requirement, even if a band n65 duplexer is reused for band n256.\nBased on extrapolating the SEM mask to the ACLR4 region which overlaps n39 for the lowest n256 20MHz channel it is feasible to specify -50dBm/MHz protection level for n39 by n256 even when using n65 duplexer (no filter help assumed). This assumes the maximum n256 bandwidth is 20MHz.\n\nThe figure depicts a coexistence analysis based on the SEM mask extension for band n256, illustrating the coexistence of different signal paths in a 5G network. The analysis considers the impact of different signal paths, such as NLOS, LOS, and mixed LOS/NLOS scenarios, and highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 7.4.2.2.10-1: Coexistence analysis based on SEM mask extension for band n256\n3)\tCoexistence protection for band n2, n25, n70 DL\nFrom RAN4 perspective, UE co-existence requirements can’t be fulfilled (-50dBm/MHz) for the TN bands (i.e., n2, n25 and n70) which are overlapping n256. In Release 17, it is RAN4 understanding that the co-existence issue between n256 and those TN bands shall rely on regional or national regulation.\nOther proposals:\nOther proposals were submitted to solve the UE to UE coexistence issues between NTN and TN especially for the protected DL frequency range which is overlapping with UL frequency range of band n256 or next to the edge of band n256 UL filter.\nFor example:\n-\tIsolation regions could be defined between NTN and TN coverage. And a corresponding signaling could be designed by RAN2.\n-\tBefore transmitting UL band n256 signals, satellite UE should determine (or be informed) whether the IMT services exist for the protected DL frequency range in the vicinity.\n-\tOther potential mechanisms/solutions are not precluded.\nConsidering these proposals will have impacts on RAN1/RAN2 specifications, these proposals were not further discussed in Release 17.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the antenna connector(s) of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each antenna port(s). UE with an integral antenna(s) may be taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one receiver antenna connector, identical interfering signals shall be applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of these is used (diversity).\nUnless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the antenna connector(s) of the UE for satellite access.\nThe handheld UE for satellite access is required to be equipped with a minimum of two Rx antenna ports in all NTN satellite operating bands in FR1.\nThe reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel. For below 6GHz, the REFSENS level can be calculated by the equation below in TR 38.817-01[32]:\nSensitivity = -174dBm(kT) + 10*log(RX BW) + NF + SNR +IM – diversity gain\nIt is noted that the Rx BW is identical to the transmission bandwidth configuration, which is determined by the spectrum utilization. The RB values in the analysis of this contribution are based on the agreed SU for NR.\nSNR in Nagoya meeting was agreed as -1dB for NR.\nThe REFSENS for E-UTRA assumes that the receiver is equipped with two Rx port as a baseline. If 2Rx is considered, the diversity gain is 3dB and the Implementation Margin (IM) uses 2.5dB. In the following calculation, same assumptions are used for NR NTN satellite bands.\nFor band n255, 9dB noise figure is assumed which is aligned with band n24.\nBoth dedicate 30MHz duplexer and n65 duplexer are allowed to be used for band n256. Finally, 9dB noise figure is assumed for band n256 as well.\nThe throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2 and A.3.2 from TS 38.101-1 [17] (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1 from TS 38.101-1 [17])  with parameters specified in Table 7.4.3.2.2-1 and Table 7.4.3.2.2-2.\nTable 7.4.3.2.2-1: Two antenna port reference sensitivity QPSK REFSENS\n\nTable 7.4.3.2.2-2: Uplink configuration for reference sensitivity\n\nMaximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the UE antenna port, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement channel. In defining requirements for maximum input level, there are two effects should be considered. One is the dynamic range for Rx link since the maximum input level would determine the high limit of dynamic range. The other is the maximum received input power at UE in real deployment. If the maximum received input signal level is increased, then pre-LNA attenuation is required, which adds complexity to UE RX chain. Similar as the method in TN system, in order to evaluate the level of maximum received power, the Min distance for consideration is given in Table 7.4.3.2.3-1.\nTable 7.4.3.2.3-1: Min distance for conderation\n\nFrom above table, the maximum received power is -77.2 dBm for 20 MHz which is very lower than -25dBm in TN. It is therefore the maximum input level can be relaxed by 15 dB compared with TN requirement.\nFor ACS, the coexistence studies outcome shows that the same ACS values as for NR TN UE are appropriate, and therefore reused.\nACS test parameters in case 1 is applied. ACS requirements in case 2 can be specified based on the maximum input level of -40dBm.\nFor blocking characteristics, it is agreed, the same requirements as for NR TN UEs are applicable, and therefore reused. For NR satellite band n255, OOBB requirements of n24 are reused. For n256, to keep UE implementation freedom with both options (i.e., reusing n65 duplexer or dedicated 30MHz duplexer) is agreed. FFS for n256 OOBB requirements if the same hardware of n65 is expected to be reused.\nSpurious response is a measure of the ability of the receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other frequency for which a response is obtained, i.e. for which the out-of-band blocking limit is not met. To assume the same interfering signals for guaranteeing TN and NTN UE performance, TN spurious response requirements in section 7.7 of TS 38.101-1[17] could be applicable to NTN satellite access UEs.\nIntermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal. To assume the same interfering signals for guaranteeing TN and NTN UE performance, TN wide-band intermodulation parameters in Table 7.8.2-1 of TS 38.101-1[17] could be applicable to NTN satellite access UEs.\nThe spurious emissions limits specified in TS 38.101-1[17] sub-clause 7.9 would also be applicable to NTN satellite access UEs referring to the ERC Recommendation 74-01[28] Annex 3 item 3.1.5 for Mobile Earth Stations (MES) (see Note 1bis) operating below 3 GHz: receivers, receive only MES and transmitters in the carrier-off state.\n[To be updated]\n",
