Measurement Name (clause header)\nThis is a descriptive name of the measurement type that is specified as clause C.x.y of the present document.\nThe measurement name shall be written in lower-case characters except abbreviations (e.g. RNC).\nA measurement name can apply to one or more measurements. If the measurement name applies to several measurements then all fields of the template will take this into account.\nMeasurement names shall not exceed 64 characters in length and should be constrained to 32 characters maximum. Exceptions greater than 32 characters are allowed but should be kept to a minimum and only made where necessary.\na)\tDescription\nThis subclause contains an explanation of the measurement operation.\nb)\tCollection Method\nThis n contains the form in which this measurement data is obtained:\n-\tCC (Cumulative Counter);\n-\tGAUGE (dynamic variable), used when data being measured can vary up or down during the period of measurement;\n-\tDER (Discrete Event Registration), when data related to a particular event are captured every nth event is registered, where n can be 1 or larger;\n-\tSI (Status Inspection);\n-\tTF (Transparent Forwarding) ;\n-\tOM (Object Mapping).\nc)\tCondition\nThis subclause contains the condition which causes the measurement result data to be updated;\nThis will be defined by identifying protocol related trigger events for starting and stopping measurement processes, or updating the current measurement result value. Where it is not possible to give a precise condition, then the conditional circumstances leading to the update are stated.\nIf a measurement is not available for FDD or TDD, then the measurement description shall contain a statement.\nIf a measurement is related to \"external\" technologies, this subclause shall give a brief reference to other standard bodies.\nd)\tMeasurement Result (measured value(s), Units)\nThis subclause contains a description of expected result value(s) (e.g. a single integer value). If a measurement is related to \"external\" technologies, this subclause shall also give a brief reference to other standard bodies.\nThe definition applies for each measurement result.\ne)\tMeasurement Type\nThis subclause contains a short form of the measurement name specified in the header, which is used to identify the measurement type in the result files.\nThe measurement names are dotted sequences of items. The sequence of elements identifying a measurement is organised from the general to the particular.\n-\tThe first item identifies the measurement family (e.g. HHO, RAB, SMS). Note that this family may also be used for measurement administration purpose.\n-\tThe second item identifies the name of the measurement itself, for which the following rules shall apply:\n-\tThe second item of the measurement name can be divided into  <Operation>, <Reason/Result> and <Direction> (and in that order)\n-\tExamples of Operation can be Establishment, Release, and Modification\n-\tExamples of Reason/Result can be Attempt, Failure, Success, Throughput and Volume\n-\tExamples of Direction can be Incoming, Outgoing, Uplink and Downlink\n-\tDepending on the measurement type, additional items may be present to specify subcounters (failure causes, traffic classes, min, max, avg, G, U ...). In case of multiple additional items, they are also represented as a dotted sequence of items. When available, the template will describe to which standard it is referring to for these additional items (e.g. cause, traffic class). Otherwise, the additional item semantics must be described in details in the present document.\nStandardised causes will be a number.  This number shall be derived according to which of the following rules applies:\nFor the standardised causes with numeric values explicitly specified in the reference spefication, the subcounter name will be the number assigned to this cause in this reference specification.\nFor the standardised causes without numeric values explicitly specified in the reference spefication, but where the causes are identified, the subcounter name shall be a number from 1 to n mapped in an incremental sequence to each of the specified causes following top down sequence in the order they are identified in the reference specification (e.g. RRC.ConnEstab.1, 1 idenfies the establishment cause \" Originating Conversational Call\", see TS 25.331 [30]);\nFor the standardised causes without numeric values explicitly specified in the reference spefication and the causes identified and the causes have been divided into different cause groups, the subcounter should be defined as the form of ‘Cause group’.Cause, where:\n-\tthe subcounter name of ‘Cause group’ shall be an incremental number from 1 to n to identify each cause group specified in a top down sequence following the order they are identified in the reference specification,\n-\tthe subcounter name of cause within this cause group shall be an incremental number from 1 to n to identify each cause within the group specified in a top down sequence following the order they are identified within the cause group in the reference specification (e.g. RLM.FailRLSetupIub.2.1, 2.1 indenfies the cause \" Transport resource unavailable\" in the cause group \" Transport Layer Cause\", see TS 25.433 [29]). Subcounter ‘Cause group’.sum is permitted to indentify the aggregate of measurement values of all the causes within the cause group (e.g. RLM.FailRLSetupIub.1.sum, 1.sum identifies the aggregate of all the causes within the cause group \"Radio Network Layer Cause\", see TS 25.433 [29]).\nThe non standardised causes should be a string (e.g. RRC.ConnEstab.NoReply).\nThe set of values issued for a measurement does not depend on the associated collection method (CC, SI, Gauge, DER, TF). For instance, a gauge collected counter does not necessarily provide min, max, average values.\nThe vendor-specific UMTS and combined GSM/UMTS measurement names will all begin with the VS prefix.\nIn addition, it is recommended that a prefix is added for non-UMTS measurements:\n-\tQ3 for Q3 measurements;\n-\tMIB for IETF measurements (ATM, IP);\n-\tOS for other standards measurements.\nThe 3GPP standardised measurements name must not commence with the above prefixes.\nExamples of valid measurement names are:\n-\tHO.PrepAtt\n-\tSAEB.EstabSucc\n-\tRRC.ConnEstabAtt.Cause\nwhere Cause identifies the failure cause.\nExamples of valid measurement names for measurements defined before version 8.3.0 of the present document are:\n-\tVS.HO.InterSGSNReject.NoResource;\n-\tATM. ATML.IngressCells;\n-\tHHO.SuccOutIntraCell;\n-\tMM.AttachedSubs.Max;\n-\tRAB.EstabAttCS.Conversational;\n-\tRRC.ConnEstab.Cause\nwhere Cause identifies the failure cause.\nAbbreviations to be used within measurement types can be found in subclause 3.2 of the present document.\nf)\tMeasurement Object Class\nThis subclause describes the measured object class (e.g. UtranCell, RncFunction, SgsnFunction). The object class used for this purpose shall be in accordance with NRMs, such as those defined in TS 28.622 [24], TS 28.702 [26] ,TS 28.652 [25] and TS 28.541 [24].\nFor object classes currently not defined according to the above, the present document defines its own nomenclature (e.g. RA, LAC).\nIt is possible to use the same measurement name for a standardized measurement type implemented at a different object class level than the one defined in the Standard. The same measurement type can apply to one or more measurements for which all fields of the measurement template are the same except the clause f) \"Measurement Object Class\". For instance, a measurement which uses the same template as a given measurement type but relates to another or different object classes (e.g. UtranCell instead of UtranRelation, or RncFunction and UtranCell) shall have the same name.\ng)\tSwitching Technology\nThis subclause contains the Switching domain(s) this measurement is applicable to i.e. Circuit Switched and/or Packet Switched.\nh)\tGeneration\nThe generation determines if it concerns a GSM, UMTS, EPS, 5GS, combined (GSM+UMTS+EPS+5GS) or IMS measurement.\n-\tGSM: pure GSM measurement; it only counts GSM events.

In a combined (GSM+UMTS+EPS) NE the count would be exactly the same as in a pure  In a pure GSM, pure UTMS or combined GSM and  this counter does not exist;\n- \t5GS: pure 5GS measurement; it only counts 5GS events. In a combined (GSM+UMTS+EPS+5GS) NE the count would be exactly the same as in a pure 5GS NF. In a pure GSM, pure UTMS, pure EPS or combined GSM, UTMS and EPS NE this counter does not exist;\n-\tGSM/UMTS: measurement applicable to both GSM and UMTS systems; in a combined (GSM+UMTS) NE separate subcounts for GSM and/or UMTS events can be obtained;\n-\tGSM/UMTS/EPS: measurement applicable to GSM, UMTS and EPS systems; in a combined (GSM+UMTS+EPS) NE separate subcounts for GSM, and/or UMTS, and/or EPS events can be obtained;\n- \tEPS/5GS: measurement applicable to EPS and 5GS systems; in a combined (EPS+5GS) NE separate subcounts for EPS, and/or 5GS events can be obtained;\n-\tCombined: measurement applicable to combined GSM, UMTS, EPS and 5GS systems, but regardless of whether the measured event occurred on the GSM, UMTS, EPS or 5GS part of the system. This means that in a combined NE only one total (i.e. GSM+UMTS+EPS+5GS) count is obtained for the measured event.\nThe above aspects are also reflected in the measurement type name in template item E by adding a \"G\" to the GSM measurements, \"U\" to the UMTS measurements, \"E\" to the EPS measurements, \"5G\" for 5GS measurements.\n-\tIMS: measurement applicable to IMS.\nNOTE:\tThe GSM  component of combined GSM/UMTS  equipment may actually choose to implement GSM measurements according to the present document or TS 52.402 [2], based on GSM specifications.\ni)\tPurpose\nThis optional clause aims at describing who will be using the measurement. It is proposed to indicate in this clause the targeted categories of users based on the measurement user communities described in Annex B.\nWhen available, this clause provides additional information on the interest of the measurement but is however purely indicative.\n",

In that case, the sum of all supported per cause measurements is equal to the total sum across all subcounters;\n-\tsupport only a subset of the subcounters (allowed only if the cause codes are specified in 3GPP standards). In that case, the first value of the result sequence must be the total sum across all the cause codes as defined in 3GPP standards.

New features develop, networks evolve and operating conditions change without sufficient consideration given to the measurements needed to keep the network running efficiently. While Equipment Vendors define measurements to satisfy their particular needs, other perspectives, especially the voice of the Network Operator, are sometimes lost during Equipment Vendor development processes. Similarly, Network Operators sometimes request measurements without fully understanding who will be using the data or what actions those people will take based on the collected data. A coherent, simple, top-down methodology for defining performance measurements is lacking in the telecommunications industry.\nThis annex proposes a methodology to handle the above problems. In particular, multiple user communities have been defined representing the end-users of system measurements. Performance goals and measurements are defined considering these same user communities. The definition includes identification of specific problem scenarios and corrective actions to be taken by the appropriate user community.\nMeasurements defined using this methodology can be contributed to 3GPP SA5 for potential adoption and inclusion in the present document. It is believed that this methodology will help reduce development costs for the Equipment Vendors and reduce operational costs for the Network Operators.\n",

They have numerous uses related to resource utilization, expansion planning, network optimisation, operating problem diagnosis and network availability monitoring. For the wireless telecommunications world, product performance measurements are necessary to support multiple communities of users.\nIn addition, once performance measurements are defined for a wireless telecommunication network they must be maintained. The evolution of a wireless telecommunication network for capacity increases and feature extensions leads to the evolution of the collected measurements. Performance measurements need to be added, modified and made obsolete from the overall measurement repository. These changes must be defined completely and accurately to meet the requirements of each community of users.\nThe development of a performance measurement life cycle process to oversee this need is proposed in this annex. The life cycle process addresses the multiple user communities whose perspectives are needed to supply the requirements for the performance measurements.\nThe proposed performance measurement life cycle process is a usage-based process. The basic Goal, Question, Metric (GQM) method is enhanced to define problem scenarios and corrective actions. These descriptions are not only used to filter out proposals for performance measurements that provide no defined benefit, but also support user community training in the use of the performance measurements.\nThe remainder of this annex is organised as follows.\n-\tClause B.3 defines Measurement User Communities for wireless telecommunications.\n-\tClause B.4 discusses the GQM and the Enhanced GQM methods.\n-\tClause B.5 discusses the measurement life cycle process.\n-\tClause B.6 provides conclusions.\n",

The Enhanced GQM methodology extends the measurement definition criteria to better satisfy multiple groups with diverse needs for these measurements.\nA qualitative judgement as to the efficacy of a Performance Management subsystem is how well served these different groups are by the measurements provided.

The original GQM methodology was enhanced to better fit within the wireless telecommunications industry for the following reasons:\na)\tAllow wireless measurement user communities to specify their needs at the beginning of the performance measurement life cycle rather than waiting for product to be delivered.\nb)\tAllow wireless measurement user communities to understand what performance measurements are being designed for them in time to modify the associated collection, analysis and reporting processes.\nc)\tAllow wireless measurement user communities to understand how they should analyse collected measurement data and what actions they should take when analysis has been completed.\nd)\tProvide criteria for rejecting unnecessary goals, useless measurements, or measurements that can not be properly collected, analysed or understood.\ne)\tProvide criteria for architecting metrics into the appropriate wireless network device (based on network traffic capacity, device CPU and memory capacity, data collection capabilities, etc.).\nf)\tAllow for consistent measurement definition by providing Enhanced GQM model definition and measurement definition templates.\ng)\tHelp reduce development costs for Equipment Providers and reduce operational costs for the Network Operator.\nThe Enhanced GQM, or EGQM, methodology is comprised of the following four steps.\n1.\tIdentify and define measurement goals for a particular measurement user community;\n2.\tRefine measurement goals into quantifiable problem scenarios;\n3.\tDefine measurements that will determine if the goal is being accomplished;\n4.\tDefine corrective actions.\nEGQM's first and third steps are similar to GQM's first and third steps. EGQM's second step is different than GQM's second step in that it focuses on problem scenarios associated with the goal rather than on questions associated with the goal. Problem scenarios are descriptions of real world problems the measurement user community has or will experience. Each problem scenario represents a particular aspect of the associated goal. Problem scenarios include definitions of any formulas that will allow the measurement user community to analyse the problem scenario after metric data has been collected from the field. EGQM's fourth step is new. Corrective actions are descriptions of what the measurement user community should do based on analysis of metric data collected from the resulting wireless network.\nExecution of the EGQM methodology results in the formation of an EGQM model. An EGQM model contains the set of defined goal, problem scenarios, metrics and corrective actions. An EGQM model also provides trace-ability from the goals to the associated corrective actions. Figure B.4.2.1 shows an example of an EGQM model.\nThe EGQM Model is a comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance of energy-efficient and quality-aware communication systems. It incorporates various factors such as energy consumption, signal quality, and network reliability to optimize the system's performance. The model is based on the principles of energy efficiency and quality, and it provides a systematic approach to evaluate the system's performance.\nFigure B.4.2.1: EGQM Model\nEGQM has definition templates for producing an EGQM model and for defining metrics. The EGQM model definition template is shown in Table B1. The EGQM metric definition template that is useful for 3GPP SA5 activities is defined in subclause 3.3 of the present document.\nTable B.4.2.1: EGQM Model Definition Template\n\nAs described in clause B.3, six measurement user communities have been defined for the wireless telecommunications industries. EGQM supports all six communities. Representatives from each community participate in all four steps of the EGQM methodology. This allows user communities to specify exactly what they need and/or want and to know exactly how they will use the metrics before any software is developed. Participation in the EGQM process increases Network Operator satisfaction through early definition of operational practices (including corrective actions) and increases product knowledge within the Network Operator organization.\nThe EGQM model definition and metric definition templates provide the mechanism to reject unnecessary goals, useless metrics, or metrics that can't be properly collected or computed. Reasons for the rejection of a goal include the following:\na)\tNon-ambiguous goal definition could not be determined;\nb)\tProblem scenarios could not be determined;\nc)\tDefinition of how performance measurement will be used within a problem scenario could not be determined;\nd)\tCorrective actions could not be determined;\ne)\tMetrics could not be defined to support problem scenario definitions;\nf)\tRequired metrics could not be architected into network devices for any of the following reasons:\n1)\tNetwork device could not collect metric due to CPU utilization issues;\n2)\tNetwork device could not collect and/or store metric due to memory issues;\n3)\tNetwork could not support the uploading of measurement data from network devices to network manager;\n4)\tNetwork manager could not collect and/or store measurement data due to memory issues.\n",

            "description": "If the uses of performance measurements were confined to feature releases and occasional changes to those features, then EGQM would suffice. However, user community needs evolve, operating conditions change, performance models are validated, new services are introduced, etc. As these conditions change, performance measurements may need to change. Such considerations point to the need for a complete measurements life cycle model.\nA simple life cycle model to handle performance measurement changes is depicted in Figure B.5.1. New performance measurement goal and metric definitions are provided through new features. These are made available with major releases.\nThe figure B.5.1 illustrates the measurement life cycle of a 5G network, showing the various stages of testing and verification that are conducted to ensure the network's performance and reliability. The figure includes a flowchart that outlines the steps involved in each stage, from initial testing to final verification, with visual elements such as arrows and checkboxes to represent the different stages. The figure also includes a legend to explain the symbols used in the flowchart, such as \"Start\" and \"Stop,\" which indicate the beginning and end of each stage. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the measurement life cycle, highlighting the importance of continuous testing and verification in ensuring the quality and reliability of 5G networks.\nFigure B.5.1: Measurement Life Cycle\nPerformance measurements may need to be periodically reviewed. Goal and metric definition updates made during this process are generally instantiated at major releases. When metrics are no longer useful they can be made obsolete and eventually deleted. A waiting period between obsolescence and deletion allows user communities time to implement and test out new metrics and analyses that are meant to replace existing metrics and analyses.\n",

            "description": "In the past, definition of performance measurements of wireless telecommunications networks was focused mainly on satisfying the needs of the Equipment Vendor Performance Modelling and Development Engineering measurement user communities. The needs of the wireless telecommunications Network Operator were not always addressed. The Performance Measurement Definition process described in this annex addresses the needs of all measurements user communities. The process also provides additional benefits, including the following:\n-\tAllow measurement communities to specify their needs up front.\n-\tAllow measurement communities to prepare for and modify their measurement monitoring and reporting processes before product is released to them.\n-\tAllow measurement communities to know what actions they need to perform when assessing collected measurements.\n-\tProvides method for rejecting unrealistic goals and measurements.\n-\tProvides method for best architecting measurements into network devices.\n-\tProvides method for producing consistent measurement definitions.\n-\tProvides method for managing measurements life cycle including measurement creation, modification and obsoletion.\nThe EGQM methodology may be used for:\n-\tanalyse and assess performance areas that are not well understood or are highly complex;\n-\tnon-straightforward cases where it is difficult to create useful measurement proposals;\n-\tan understanding of real value is required before useful measurement proposals can be created;\n-\tmine for missing measurements;\n-\tmine for conflicting, overlapping, or existing measurements that are no longer useful.\nIn summary, the EGQM methodology may be used by any company to generate measurement definitions that can then be contributed to 3GPP SA5 for potential inclusion in the present document.\n\n\n\n\n",
