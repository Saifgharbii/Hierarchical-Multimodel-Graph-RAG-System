The F1 setup is initiated by the gNB-DU. The F1 setup function also allows to send the information of a mobile IAB-MT from the co-located mobile IAB-DU to the gNB-CU.\nThe gNB-CU Configuration Update and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions allow to update application level configuration data needed between gNB-CU and gNB-DU to interoperate correctly over the F1 interface, and may activate or deactivate cells. The gNB-CU Configuration Update function may activate SSB beams of cells. For cross-link interference mitigation, the gNB-CU may coordinate the exchange of intended TDD DL-UL configuration by merging, forwarding and selective forwarding of intended TDD DL-UL configuration(s) between its gNB-DUs, or between its gNB-DUs and other gNBs, gNB-CUs. With the gNB-CU Configuration Update function, energy saving with cell activation/deactivation can be supported as defined in TS 38.300 [8]. The gNB-DU Configuration Update function also allows to send the information of a mobile IAB-MT from the co-located mobile IAB-DU to the gNB-CU.\nThe F1 setup and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions allow to inform the S-NSSAI(s), NSAG(s), CAG ID(s) and NID(s) supported by the gNB-DU.\nThe F1 setup and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions allow to provide information on either RedCap access configuration, or eRedCap access configuration, or both at the gNB-DU.\nThe F1 setup and gNB-CU Configuration Update functions allow to inform the NID(s) available at the gNB-CU.\nThe F1 resource coordination function is used to transfer information about frequency resource sharing between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. In case of split gNB architecture, the gNB-CU may consolidate the outgoing messages from multiple gNB-DUs and distribute the incoming messages to the involved gNB-DUs, to perform resource coordination.\nThe gNB-DU status indication function allows the gNB-DU to indicate overload status to gNB-CU. In case of IAB, the IAB-donor-DU or IAB-DU can indicate the downlink congestion status to the IAB-donor-CU.\nThe network access rate reduction function is used to indicate to the gNB-DU that the rate at which UEs are accessing the network need to be reduced.\nThe F1 removal function is used to remove the interface instance and all related resources between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU in a controlled manner.\n",

The receiving node can accept or reject the modification. The F1 UE context management function also supports the release of the context previously established in the gNB-DU. The release of the context is triggered by the gNB-CU either directly or following a request received from the gNB-DU. The gNB-CU request the gNB-DU to release the UE Context when the UE enters RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE. In case of configured grant small data transmission, this function allows the gNB-CU to request the gNB-DU to keep part of the UE context, including at least the lower layer configuration for SDT DRB(s)/SRB(s), C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, F1AP association, and F1 tunnel information, when the gNB-CU sends the UE into RRC_INACTIVE state. In case of positioning when the gNB-CU sends the UE into RRC_INACTIVE state, this function allows the gNB-CU to request the gNB-DU to keep part of the positioning context, including the SRS configuration for the UE.\nThis function can be also used to manage DRBs, SRBs and SL DRBs, i.e., establishing, modifying and releasing DRB, SRB and SL DRB resources. The establishment and modification of DRB, or SL DRB resources are triggered by the gNB-CU and accepted/rejected by the gNB-DU based on resource reservation information and QoS information to be provided to the gNB-DU. For each DRB to be setup or modified, the S-NSSAI may be provided by gNB-CU to the gNB-DU in the UE Context Setup procedure and the UE Context Modification procedure. In case of NG-RAN sharing, the gNB-CU includes the serving PLMN ID (for SNPNs the serving SNPN ID) in the UE Context Setup procedure.\nThis function is also used to manage a UE's configuration with multicast resources and to provide information about the multicast MRBs which are established for the multicast MBS Sessions the UE has joined.\nFor Uu, the mapping between QoS flows and radio bearers is performed by gNB-CU and the granularity of bearer related management over F1 is radio bearer level. For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU decides an aggregated DRB QoS profile for each radio bearer based on received QoS flow profile, and provides both aggregated DRB QoS profile and QoS flow profile to the gNB-DU, and the gNB-DU either accepts the request or rejects it with appropriate cause value. With this function, gNB-DU could also notify gNB-CU whether the QoS for already established DRBs is not fulfilled any longer or it is fulfilled again. The function can be also used to inform the gNB-DU the alternative QoS Parameters Sets when available for a QoS flow. To support packet duplication for intra-gNB-DU CA and packet split/duplication for intra-DU multi-path relay as described in TS 38.300 [8], one data radio bearer should be configured with at least two GTP-U tunnels between gNB-CU and a gNB-DU.\nFor SL, the mapping between QoS flows and radio bearers is performed by gNB-CU and the granularity of bearer related management over F1 is radio bearer level. For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU decides an aggregated SL DRB QoS profile for each radio bearer based on received QoS flow profile, and provides both aggregated SL DRB QoS profile and QoS flow profile to the gNB-DU, and the gNB-DU either accepts the request or rejects it with appropriate cause value.\nWith this function, gNB-CU requests the gNB-DU to setup or change of the SpCell (as defined in TS 38.321 [10]) for the UE, and the gNB-DU either accepts or rejects the request with appropriate cause value. This function also enables the gNB-DU to inform the gNB-CU of which cell the UE has successfully accessed during conditional mobility.\nWith this function, the gNB-CU requests the setup of the SCell(s) at the gNB-DU side, and the gNB-DU accepts all, some or none of the SCell(s) and replies to the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU requests the removal of the SCell(s) for the UE.\nWith this function, the gNB-CU indicates the UL UE AMBR limit to the gNB-DU, and the gNB-DU enforces the indicated limit.\nWith this function, the gNB-DU indicates that a bearer, or a UE is inactive or active. The gNB-CU consolidates all the serving gNB-DUs for the UE and takes further action.\nWith this function, the gNB-CU indicates the gNB-DU that the UE context concerns mobility enhancement operation, and the gNB-DU takes corresponding actions.\nIn addition, for IAB-nodes and IAB-donors:\n-\tThe F1 UE context management function is used for managing BH RLC channels, i.e. establishing, modifying and releasing BH RLC channel resources. The establishment of BH RLC channels is triggered by the IAB-donor-CU. The establishment and modification is accepted/rejected by the IAB-node’s parent, based on e.g. resource reservation information and QoS information provided to the IAB-node’s parent.\n-\tThe DRB QoS profile framework is reused for BH RLC channels carrying DRBs. Prioritization of traffic on the F1-C interface is based on traffic type (e.g. UE-associated F1AP signalling, non-UE-associated F1AP signalling) and is enforced in the IAB-donor-DU and in IAB-nodes, considering that the traffic on the F1-C interface has higher priority than other traffic; in-sequence delivery over the signaling connection is always ensured.\n-\tThe IAB-donor-CU associates each BH RLC channel carrying control plane traffic with one of the signaled control plane traffic type values.\nFor L2 U2N Relay:\n-\tThe F1 UE context management function is used for managing Uu Relay RLC channels and PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N relay, i.e. establishing, modifying and releasing Uu Relay RLC channel and PC5 Relay RLC channel resources. The establishment of Uu Relay RLC channels and PC5 Relay RLC channels are triggered by the gNB-CU. The establishment and modification is accepted/rejected by the gNB-DU based on resource reservation information and QoS information provided to the gNB-DU.
