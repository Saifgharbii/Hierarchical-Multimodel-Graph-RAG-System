For single-band connector(s), the following applies:\n-\tSingle-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions requirements apply to this connector that is mapped to single-band.\n-\tIf the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements shall apply to this connector configured for single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable IAB-DU or IAB-MT are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested separately at the connector configured for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.\nA IAB-DU or IAB-MT type 1-H  may be capable of supporting operation in multiple operating bands with one of the following implementations of TAB connectors in the transceiver array boundary:\n-\tAll TAB connectors are single-band connectors.\n-\tDifferent sets of single-band connectors support different operating bands, but each TAB connector supports only operation in one single operating band.\n-\tSets of single-band connectors support operation in multiple operating bands with some single-band connectors supporting more than one operating band.\n-\tAll TAB connectors are multi-band connectors.\n-\tA combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of TAB connectors provides support of the type IAB-DU type 1-H capability of operation in multiple operating bands.\nUnless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an operating band apply only to the set of TAB connectors supporting that operating band.\nIn the case of an operating band being supported only by single-band connectors in a TAB connector TX min cell group or a TAB connector RX min cell group, single-band requirements apply to that set of TAB connectors.\nIn the case of an operating band being supported only by multi-band connectors supporting the same operating band combination in a TAB connector TX min cell group or a TAB connector RX min cell group, multi-band requirements apply to that set of TAB connectors.\nThe case of an operating band being supported by both multi-band connectors and single-band connectors in a TAB connector TX min cell group or a TAB connector RX min cell group  is not covered by the present release of this specification.\nThe case of an operating band being supported by multi-band connectors which are not all supporting the same operating band combination in a TAB connector TX min cell group or a TAB connector RX min cell group is not covered by the present release of this specification.\nIAB-DU or IAB-MT type 1-O may be capable of supporting operation in multiple operating bands with one of the following implementations at the radiated interface boundary:\n-\tAll RIBs are single-band RIBs.\n-\tAll RIBs are multi-band RIBs.\n-\tA combination of single-band RIBs and multi-band RIBs provides support of the IAB-DU or IAB-MT type 1-O capability of operation in multiple operating bands.\nFor multi-band connectors and multi-band RIBs supporting the bands for TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.\n",

Details about how the EVM is determined are specified in Annex D.\nFor IAB-MT type 1-H this requirement shall be applied at each TAB connector supporting transmission in the operating band.\nFor IAB-MT type 1-H, the EVM levels of each NR carrier for different modulation schemes outlined in table 6.5.2.2.2-1 shall be met using the frame structure described in clause 6.5.2.2.3.\nTable 6.5.2.2.2-1: Requirements for Error Vector Magnitude\n\nNOTE: \tWhen the indicated IAB-MT transmission timing mode is set to ‘Case6’ as specified in 3GPP TS 38.213 [10], the power imbalance for simultaneous transmission between IAB-DU and IAB-MT under which the system can be operated is declared by manufacturer.\n\nEVM shall be evaluated for each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and uplink subframes for IAB-MT. Different modulation schemes listed in Table 6.5.2.2.2-1 shall be considered for rank 1.\nFor NR, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and uplink subframes within 10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.\n\n",

In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe out-of-band emissions requirement for the IAB-DU and IAB-MT transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).\nThe maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the operating band edge is ΔfOBUE. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink operating band of IAB-DU and uplink operating band of IAB-MT, plus the frequency ranges ΔfOBUE above and ΔfOBUE below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.\nThe values of ΔfOBUE are defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2 for the NR operating bands.\nTable 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink operating band of IAB-DU\n\nTable 6.6.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink operating band of IAB-MT\n\nFor IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the TAB connector TX min cell groups for all the supported configurations.

It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nThe spurious emission basic limits are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1 where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply for IAB-MT and IAB-DU.

When the transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH allocation a precoder is randomly generated with equal propability of each applicable i1 and i2 combination and applied to the PDSCH.

If the target cell is a known cell, then Tsearch = 0 ms. If the target cell is an unknown intra-frequency cell and the target cell Es/Iot≥-2 dB, then Tsearch = N* Trs  ms. N=8 when the target cell is in FR2-1. Regardless of whether DRX is in use by the mIAB-MT, Tsearch shall still be based on non-DRX target cell search times.\nTprocessing is time for mIAB-MT processing. Tprocessing can be up to 20ms.\nTmargin is time for SSB post-processing. Tmargin can be up to 2ms.\nT∆ is time for fine time tracking and acquiring full timing information of the target cell. T∆ = Trs for both known and unknown target cell.\nTIU is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH occasion in the new cell.

In this clause, the antenna connection method for applying 2RX tests to IAB-MTs supporting 4RX antenna ports is specified. No tests are currently specified for FR1 which are applicable only to 4RX antenna ports, so 4RX capable IAB-MTs are always tested by reusing tests which were originally specified for 2RX IAB-MTs.\nG.1.3.1.1.2\tPrinciple of testing\nG.1.3.1.1.2.1\tSingle carrier tests\nFor 4RX capable IAB-MTs supporting at least one 2RX band, the, all single carrier tests specified for FR1 except those in G.2.3 shall be tested on any band where 2RX is supported with the antenna connection specified in clause G.1.3.1.1.2.2.\nFor 4RX capable IAB-MT which do not support any 2RX band, all tests specified for FR1 shall be tested using the antenna connection specified in clause G.1.3.1.1.2.3. For radio link monitoring tests, the SNR levels are modified according to table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-1 and table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-2. For beam failure detection and link recovery tests, the SNR levels are modified according to table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-3.\nTable G.1.3.1.1.2.1-1: Modified parameters for RLM out of sync testing with 4 RX antenna connection\n\nTable G.1.3.1.1.2.1-2: Modified parameters for RLM in sync single carrier testing with 4 RX antenna connection\n\nTable G.1.3.1.1.2.1-3: Modified parameters for Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery testing with 4 RX antenna connection\n\nG.1.3.1.1.2.2\tAntenna connection for bands where 2RX is supported\nFor bands where 2RX is supported, it is left to declaration and AP configuration to decide which 2 of the 4 Rx ports are connected with data source from tester. The remaining 2 Rx ports shall be connected with zero input. No test parameters or requirements are modified.\nG.1.3.1.1.2.3\tAntenna connection for bands where 4RX is supported\nFor bands where 4RX is supported, all 4 RX antennas are connected with data source from tester. The Tester provide independent noise and fading (low correlation) for each antenna port. Except for the modifications to radio link monitoring thresholds described in clauses G.1.3.1.1.2.1 and G.1.3.1.1.2.2, no test parameters or requirements are modified.\nUnless otherwise specified, the default Downlink Antenna Configuration for NR FR2-1 cells is 1x2.\nIn case of Downlink Antenna Configuration 2x2 for NR FR2-1 cells, unless otherwise specified, the downlink signal is transmitted over the two polarizations (V and H) of the dual polarized antenna of the test equipment.\n\n",

These tests will verify the requirements in clause 12.1.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT and for IAB type 1-H.\nThe test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-1, table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-3 below. The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the active cell, becomes inactive. The time period T3 starts after the occurrence of the radio link failure. During T1, the IAB-MT shall be configured with the carrier frequency of cell 2 (with RF Channel Number #2) to ensure that the IAB-MT has the context of the carrier frequency of cell 2 by the end of T1.\nTable G.2.1.1.1.1.1-1: Supported test configurations\n\nTable G.2.1.1.1.1.1-2: General test parameters for NR inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment test case in FR1\n\nTable G.2.1.1.1.1.1-3: Cell specific test parameters for NR inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment test case in FR1\n\nG.2.1.1.1.1.2\tTest Requirements\nThe RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time period T3, to the moment when the IAB-MT starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2 for sending the RRCReestablishmentRequest message to cell 2.\nThe RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR inter frequency cell shall be less than 14.5 s.\nThe rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.\nNOTE:\tThe RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following expression:\n\nWhere:\nTUL_grant = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger for the completion of the test; hence TUL_grant is not used.\n\nNfreq = 2\nTidentify_intra_NR = 6400 ms\nTidentify_inter_NR = 6400 ms\nTSI = 1280 ms; it is the time required for receiving all the relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 for the target inter-frequency NR cell.\nTPRACH = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access procedure.\nThis gives a total of 14495 ms, allow 14.5 s in the test case.\nG.2.1.1.1.2\tIntra-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR1 without serving cell timing for LA IAB-MT\nG.2.1.1.1.2.1\tTest Purpose and Environment\nThe purpose is to verify that the NR intra-frequency RRC re-establishment delay in FR1 without serving cell timing is within the specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in clause 12.1.1.1.

These steps are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay profiles specified in I.2.2.1 can be used as such.\n-\tStep 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 [27].\n-\tStep 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.\n-\tStep 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 [27].\n-\tStep 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay resolution.\n-\tStep 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them by calculating their linear power sum.\n-\tStep 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the taps as follows:\n-\tFind the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are considered):\n-\tIf there are two or more taps having the same value and are the weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.\n-\tWhen the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:\n-\tUpdate the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of the weakest tap and the second delay tap.\n-\tRemove the second delay tap.\n-\tWhen the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:\n-\tUpdate the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the second-to-last tap and the last tap.\n-\tRemove the second-to-last tap.\n-\tOtherwise:\n-\tFor each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.\n-\tWhen the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.\n-\tSelect the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.\n-\tOtherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference for merging.\n-\tTo merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power of the weakest tap and the selected tap.\n-\tWhen the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.\n-\tWhen the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.\n-\tOtherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay. Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns  15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns  20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher power).

This precoder takes as an input a block of signals for antenna port(s) ,  and generates a block of signals  the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical antenna elements:\n\nThe precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration.  is defined in Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 [11].\nThe transimison on PT-RS antenna port is associated (using same precoder) with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS antenna ports assigned for the PDSCH.\nThe physical antenna elements are identified by indices, where  is the number of physical antenna elements configured per test.\nModulation symbols  with  (i.e. PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH) are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.\nModulation symbols  for CSI-RS resources which configured for tracking with one port are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.\nModulation symbols  for CSI-RS resources which configured for beam refinement with one port are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.\nModulation symbols  for NZP CSI-RS which configured for CSI acquisition with    are mapped to the physical antenna index  where is the number of NZP CSI-RS ports configured per test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
