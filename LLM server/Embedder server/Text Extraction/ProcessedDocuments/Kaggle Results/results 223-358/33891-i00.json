The figure includes a secure communication channel, a secure key exchange protocol, and a secure key distribution mechanism. The figure also highlights the importance of network security and the use of encryption techniques to protect the communication.\nFigure 6.2.2-1 Secure U2X service direct communication establishment\nThe steps shown in Figure 6.2.2-1 is described as follows:\n1a-b.\tIf the UAV is capable of Uu communication, the UAV performs UUAA procedure and C2 authorization (if required) as described in TS 23.256 [4] and TS 33.256 [5]. The UAV obtains UAV-C pairing information (if not configured already) and U2X security policy for each U2X services (i.e., C2 and DAA) along with the result of successful C2 authorization. The U2X security policy includes signalling and user plane security policy per U2X service type (i.e., for C2 and DAA, the signalling and user plane confidentiality and integrity are set as required based on local policy), pairing restrictions list, and access restriction information (i.e., UAV information which are restricted to perform DAA).\nSimilarly, the UAV-C can also perform UUAA procedures and C2 authorization as described in TS 23.256 [4] and TS 33.256 [5]. The UAV-C obtains UAV pairing information (if not configured already), U2X security policy for each U2X services (i.e., C2 and DAA) along with the result of successful C2 authorization. Alternatively, these data may be configured by the USS in UAV-C which is up to USS.\nNOTE 1: \tUUAA and C2 authorization for UAV-C is not covered in Rel-17.\n2.\tThe UAV if determines to set up C2 communication over PC5, it sends Direct Communication Request with U2X service type which indicates C2 service, UAV identifier (i.e., CAA-Level UAV ID), UAV-C identifier, U2X service security policy specific to the C2 service (i.e., confidentiality and integrity protection requirements for signalling and user plane protection), security capability and key establishment information (as described in TS 33.536 [6]) which can be related to security information for C2 security.\n3.\tThe UAV-C on receiving the direct communication request, if the U2X service type indicates C2 service, the UAV-C verifies the received U2X service security policy and UAV ID against the locally configured U2X security policy which includes the Pairing restrictions list and U2X service security policy. If the received UAV ID is same as any of the UAV ID(s) in the (authorized) pairing restrictions list and if the U2X service security policy matches with the locally stored one, then the UAV-C determines to respond with step 4.\nIf the UAV ID in the direct communication request do not match with any of the UAV ID(s) in the pairing restrictions list or if the received U2X service security policy violates the locally configured U2X service security policy for the C2 service, then the UAV-C determines to reject the direct communication, where the UAV-C skip steps 4-6a and performs step 6b.\n4. UAV-C performs direct authentication and key establishment (as described in TS 33.536 [6]) with the UAV.\n5a. The UAV-C sends to the UAV, the Direct security mode command which includes (information as in TS 33.536 [6]) Key_Est_Info, MSB of Key ID (e.g., KNRP ID to indicate the C2 security key), security capability, and additional information such as those received in step 1 (i.e., U2X service type, U2X service security policy). The session key (i.e., for C2), PC5 signalling and user plane keys (for confidentiality and the integrity) as required can be derived to protect the C2 service based on the U2X service security policy.\n5b.\tThe UAV checks that the returned security capabilities, U2X service type and U2X service security policy are the same as those it sent in step 1. The UAV on receiving the Direct security mode command, if the above check is successful, based on received Key_Est_Info (as in TS 33.536 [6]) derives the key and choose LSB of Key ID (e.g., KNRP ID) to uniquely identify the Key and locally store the key with the identifier. Then the UAV sends to the UAV-C, the Direct security mode complete message which includes LSB of Key ID, security capabilities, U2X service type, and U2X service security policy sent in step 1. The confidentiality key and the integrity key as required can be derived to protect the C2 service based on the U2X service security policy.\n6a.\tThe UAV-C sends Direct Communication Accept over the established link. The UAV and UAV-C can start C2 communication over PC5.\n6b. The UAV-C based sends a direct communication reject message (i.e., if the U2X security policy is not met, or if authentication and key establishment fails or if the direct security mode command procedure fails) with respective cause information.\nSecurity of DAA unicast connection:\nDirect UAV to UAV communication for the purpose of DAA can use PC5 (e.g., C-V2X) as described in TR 23.700-58 [2] Clause 5.3. To enable confidentiality, integrity and relay protection for DAA related unicast connection, the procedure described using Figure 6.2.2-1 can be used with the following DAA specific adaptations.\n1. For the DAA case, step 1a of Figure 6.2.2-1 is applicable here.\nNOTE 2: Step 1b of Figure 6.2.2-1 is not applicable for the DAA case.\n2. If the UAV (e.g., UAV 1) determines to set up DAA connection over PC5, it sends Direct Communication Request with U2X service type which indicates DAA service, UAV identifier (i.e., CAA-Level UAV ID), U2X service security policy specific to the DAA service (i.e., confidentiality and integrity protection requirements for signalling and user plane protection), security capability and key establishment information (as described in TS 33.536) which can be related to security information for DAA security.\n3.\tThe UAV (e.g., UAV 2) on receiving the direct communication request, if the U2X service type indicates DAA service, the UAV-C verifies the received U2X service security policy and UAV ID against the locally configured U2X security policy which includes the access restriction information (i.e., UAV information which are restricted to perform DAA) and U2X service security policy. If the received UAV ID not part of access restriction information, and if the U2X service security policy matches with the locally stored one, then the UAV determines to respond with step 4.\nIf the UAV ID in the direct communication request match with any of the UAV ID(s) in the access restriction information or if the received U2X service security policy violates the locally configured U2X service security policy for the DAA service, then the UAV-C determines to reject the direct communication, where the UAV skip steps 4-6a and performs step 6b.\n4. UAV (e.g., UAV 2) performs direct authentication and key establishment (as described in TS 33.536 [6]) with the UAV (e.g., UAV 1).\n5a. The UAV (e.g., UAV 2) sends to the UAV (e.g., UAV 1), the Direct security mode command which includes (information as in TS 33.536 [6]) Key_Est_Info, MSB of Key ID (e.g., KNRP ID to indicate the DAA security key), security capability, and additional information such as those received in step 1 (i.e., U2X service type, U2X service security policy). The session key (i.e., for DAA), PC5 signalling and user plane keys (for confidentiality and the integrity) as required can be derived to protect the DAA service based on the U2X service security policy.\n5b.\tThe UAV (e.g., UAV 1) checks that the returned security capabilities, U2X service type and U2X service security policy are the same as those it sent in step 1. The UAV on receiving the Direct security mode command, if the above check is successful, based on received Key_Est_Info (as in TS 33.536 [6]) derives the key and choose LSB of Key ID (e.g., KNRP ID) to uniquely identify the Key and locally store the key with the identifier.

The UAVs can start DAA communication over PC5.\n6b.

Hence the Key_Est_Info IE described in clause 5.3.3.1.3.2 of TS 33.536 [6] is used to transport the needed authentication signalling to establish PC5 keys. This IE enables authentication over PC5 using credentials and methods specified outside 3GPP.\nNOTE 3: \tThis solution is independent of the pairing method used and of the method used to establish security material at the UEs (i.e. UAV and UAV-C) to set up the security.\nThe figure depicts the message flow for the establishment of unicast security in a network. It shows the steps involved in establishing a secure connection, including the sender sending a message, the receiver receiving it, and the sender verifying the message's authenticity. The figure illustrates the use of encryption and authentication protocols to ensure the security of the communication.\nFigure 6.3.2-1: Message flow for the establishment of unicast security\nFigure 6.3.2-1 gives an overview of the flow for (re-)establishing security for unicast connections (see TS 33.536 [6] for the details). The security policy relevant to the service (i.e. DAA or C2) will be used when establishing a connection for that service. C2 and DAA traffic will only be accepted from a peer authorised to send such traffic and be sent on different connections.\nIn addition to address the privacy issue of re-using identities, Link identifier update and Layer-2 release procedures are performed as described in clauses 5.3.3.2.2.1 and 5.3.3.2.2.2 of TS 33.356 [6].\n",
