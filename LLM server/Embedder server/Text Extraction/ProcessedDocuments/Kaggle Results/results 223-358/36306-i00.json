A fallback band combination supports the same channel bandwidths for each carrier as its parent band combination. An intra-band non-contiguous band combination is not considered to be a fallback band combination of an intra-band contiguous band combination.\nNB-IoT: NB-IoT allows access to network services via E-UTRA with a channel bandwidth limited to 200 kHz (corresponding to one PRB).\nPrimary Cell: The cell, operating on the primary frequency, in which the UE either performs the initial connection establishment procedure or initiates the connection re-establishment procedure, or the cell indicated as the primary cell in the handover procedure. In this specification, Primary Cell also refers to PSCell defined in TS 36.331 [5] unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nSidelink: UE to UE interface for sidelink communication, V2X sidelink communication and sidelink discovery.

            "description": "The following clauses define the UE radio access capability parameters and minimum capabilities for MBMS capable UE. Only parameters for which there is the possibility for UEs to signal different values are considered as UE radio access capability parameters. Therefore, mandatory features without capability parameters that are the same for all UEs are not listed here. Also capabilities which are optional or conditionally mandatory for UEs to implement but do not have UE radio access capability parameter are listed in this specification.\nE-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.\nAll parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field defined in TS 36.331 [5].\nFor optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter indicates whether the feature has been implemented and successfully tested. For mandatory features with the UE radio access capability parameter, the parameter indicates whether the feature has been successfully tested.\nThe mandatory features required to be supported by a UE are the same for all UE categories unless explicitly specified elsewhere in the specifications.\nUnless otherwise stated, the requirements on the maximum number of transport block bits are applicable for a TTI length of 1 ms. For other TTI lengths, the requirements shall be scaled according to clause 7.1.7 or 11.1 in TS 36.213 [22] in order to get the corresponding requirement.\nThe following UE radio access capability
