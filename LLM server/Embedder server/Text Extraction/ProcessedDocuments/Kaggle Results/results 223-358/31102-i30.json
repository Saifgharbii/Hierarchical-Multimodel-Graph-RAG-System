Although the terminal is able to read the entire structure it should only use those elements in the data item which is recognised by the terminal.\nFor any EF, when the SFI is not indicated in the description of the file it is not allowed to assign an SFI. If in the description of the file an SFI value is indicated the file shall support SFI. The SFI value shall be assigned by the card issuer. It is mandatory for Efs stating an SFI value ('YY') in the description of their structure to provide an SFI. For files where in the file description the SFI is indicated as 'Optional' the file may support an SFI.\nFor an overview containing all files see figures 4.1 and 4.2.\n",

The ME shall not ask for the secret code to be entered at this point.\nOptionally the ME may store the link to phone book entry in the file, so that it does not need to look again for a match in the phone book when it reuses the entry.

The network parameters stored in the USIM shall be in accordance with the procedures specified in this clause.\nThe RF carrier frequency information is stored on 2 bytes and coded on 16 bits starting from 0,0 MHz. Each increment of the 16 bit value is an increment of 200 kHz in frequency. This allows the exact channel frequency to be stored in this data field making it independent of any band information. It is up to the terminal to associate the indicated frequency with a particular band, e.g. GSM 900, GSM 1800 etc. This means that a range from 0 to 13,1 GHz can be covered, with the resolution of 200 kHz. The frequency indicated is always the terminal receiver carrier frequency.\nThe EF provides a minimum storage capacity of 46 bytes in order to provide the capability of storing at least two cell information TLV objects, e.g. GSM/FDD or FDD/TDD in its minimum configuration, i.e. the terminal can rely on the required memory space for storing at least two cell information lists offering 8 GSM neighbour carrier frequencies and 8 Intra/Inter frequencies, respectively. In what configuration the available memory actually is being used is up to the terminal.\nA terminal shall ignore a TLV object or the value of a carrier frequency which is beyond its capabilities, i.e. an FDD only terminal shall ignore the GSM related frequency information. When updating this file, the terminal shall update it with the current values available in the terminal. Updating of this file shall start from the beginning of the file. The terminal need not respect the structure of any information previously stored, i.e. an FDD only terminal may overwrite the GSM parameters stored in this file by another terminal.\nThe GSM cell information constructed TLV object contains the information of the BCCH channel frequency that the terminal is currently camped on, indicated by tag '80'. The constructed TLV object also contains an indication of up to 32 neighbour BCCH carrier frequencies indicated by tag '81'. In order to store a complete set of GSM network parameters, a total of 72 bytes is required. The terminal shall convert the BCCH channel information, as specified in TS 44.018 [28], received from the network into the corresponding frequency before storing it in the USIM.\nThe FDD cell information constructed TLV object contains the scrambling code information for the intra frequency carrier, tag '80', and the inter frequency scrambling codes, tag '81'. The intra frequency carrier information may contain up to 32 scrambling codes (m) while there is a limitation of the number of inter frequency scrambling codes (n1, n2, n3). The number of inter frequencies that can be indicated is limited to three and the total amount of scrambling codes for the inter frequencies is limited to 32 (n1+n2+n3 <= 32), i.e. if only one inter frequency carrier is indicated, it can contain up to 32 scrambling codes. If two or more inter frequency carriers are indicated, a total of 32 scrambling codes can be provided. How the information is split between the inter frequency carriers is determined by the terminal. In order to store a complete set of FDD cell information a total of 146 bytes is required. The terminal shall convert the UARFCN information, as specified in TS 25.101 [33], received from the network into the corresponding frequency before storing it in the USIM.\nThe TDD cell information constructed TLV object has the same structure as the FDD cell information TLV object.\nNOTE:\tCurrently there is no inter frequency cell information required for the TDD case.\n\n\n-\tEFNETPAR Cell Information tags\n\n\n-\tGSM Cell Information, if tag 'A0' is present in this EF the content of this TLV is as follows:\n\n\n-\tFDD Cell Information.

When both phonebook types co-exist, they are independent and no data is shared. In this case, when the terminal supports application specific phonebooks, it shall be possible for the user to select which phonebook the user would like to access.\nSupport of the global phonebook is mandatory, except for Terminals of type ND, NK or NS, as specified in 3GPP TS 31.111 [12] Annex P, for which support is optional. Terminals that support the global phonebook shall conditionally support, the application specific phonebooks, also known as local phonebook. The support of local phone book is:\na)\toptional for terminals that support alternative phonebook applications; and\nNOTE 1:\tSuch terminals could be of type \"Smartphone\" as described in GSMA: \"IMEI Allocation and Approval Process\" [84].\nb)\tmandatory for terminals that do not support alternative phonebook applications.\nNOTE 2:\tSuch terminals could be of type \"Feature Phone\" as described in GSMA: \"IMEI Allocation and Approval Process\" [84].\nIt is recommended that the terminal searches for the global phonebook located under DFTELECOM as its presence is not indicated anywhere in the USIM application.\nThe global phonebook is located in DFPHONEBOOK under DFTELECOM.. Each specific USIM application phonebook is located in DFPHONEBOOK of its respective Application ADFUSIM. The organisation of files in DFPHONEBOOK under ADFUSIM and under DF TELECOM follows the same rules. Yet DFPHONEBOOK under ADFUSIM may contain a different set of files than DFPHONEBOOK under DFTELECOM. All phonebook related Efs are located under their respective DFPHONEBOOK. USIM specific phonebooks are dedicated to application specific entries. Each application specific phonebook is protected by the application PIN.\nEFADN and EFPBR shall always be present if the DFPhonebook is present. If any phonebook file other than EFADN or EFEXT1, is used, then EFPBC shall be present.\nIf a GSM application resides on the UICC, the Efs ADN and EXT1 from one DFPHONEBOOK (defined at GSM application installation) are mapped to DFTELECOM. Their file Ids are specified in 3GPP TS 51.011 [18], i.e. EFADN = '6F3A' and EFEXT1 = '6F4A', respectively.\nIf the UICC is inserted into a terminal accessing the ADN and EXT1 files under DFTELECOM; and a record in these files has been updated, a flag in the corresponding entry control information in the EFPBC is set from 0 to 1 by the UICC. If the UICC is later inserted into a terminal that supports the global and/or application specific phonebook, the terminal shall check the flag in EFPBC and if this flag is set, shall update the EFCC, and then reset the flag. A flag set in EFPBC results in a full synchronisation of the phonebook between an external entity and the UICC (if synchronisation is requested).\nThe EF structure related to the public phonebook is located under DFPHONEBOOK in DFTELECOM. A USIM specific phonebook may exist for application specific entries. The application specific phonebook is protected by the application PIN. The organisation of files in the application specific phonebook follows the same rules as the one specified for the public phone book under DFTELECOM. The application specific phonebook may contain a different set of files than the one in the public area under DFTELECOM.\nThis file describes the structure of the phonebook. All Efs representing the phonebook are specified here (with the exception of EFPSC, EFPUID and EFCC), together with their file identifiers (FID) and their short file identifiers (SFI), if applicable.\nCertain kinds of Efs can occur more than once in the phonebook, e.g. there may be two entities of Abbreviated Dialling Numbers, EFADN and EFADN1. For these kinds of Efs, no fixed FID values are specified. Instead, the value '4FXX' indicates that the value is to be assigned by the card issuer. These assigned values are then indicated in the associated TLV object in EFPBR.\nThe SFI value assigned to an EF which is indicated in EFPBR shall correspond to the SFI indicated in the TLV object in EFPBR.\nThe reference file is a file that contains information how the information in the different files is to be combined together to form a phone book entry. The reference file contains records. Each record specifies the structure of up to 254 entries in the phone book. Each phone book entry consists of data stored in files indicated in the reference file record. The entry structure shall be the same over all the records in the EF PBR. If more than 254 entries are to be stored, a second record is needed in the reference file. The structure of a phone book entry is defined by different TLV objects that are stored in a reference file record. The reference file record structure describes the way a record in a file that is part of the phonebook is used to create a complete entry. Three different types of file linking exist.\nType 1 files:\tFiles that contain as many records as the reference/master file (EFADN, EFADN1) and are linked on record number bases (Rec1 -> Rec1). The master file record number is the reference.\nType 2 files:\tFiles that contain less entries than the master file and are linked via pointers in the index administration file (EFIAP).\nType 3 files:\tFiles that are linked by a record identifier within a record.\nTable 4.1: Phone Book Reference file Constructed Tags\n\nThe first file ID in the first record of EFPBR indicated using constructed Tag 'A8' is called the master EF. Access conditions for all other files in the Phonebook structure using Tags 'A8', 'A9' or 'AA' is set to the same as for the master EF unless otherwise specified in the present document.\nFile Ids indicated using constructed Tag 'A8' is a type 1 file and contains the same number of records as the first file that is indicated in the data part of this TLV object. All files following this Tag are mapped one to one using the record numbers/Ids of the first file indicated in this TLV object.\nFile Ids indicated using constructed Tag 'A9' are mapped to the master EF (the file ID indicated as the first data object in the TLV object using Tag 'A8') using the pointers in the index administration file. The order of the pointers in the index administration file is the same as the order of the file Ids presented after Tag 'A9'. If this Tag is not present in the reference file record the index administration file is not present in the structure. In case the index administration file is not present in the structure it is not indicated in the data following tag 'A8'.\nFile Ids indicated using constructed Tag 'AA' indicate files that are part of the reference structure but they are addressed using record identifiers within a record in one or more of the files that are part of the reference structure. The length of the tag indicates whether the file to be addressed resides in the same directory or if a path to the file is provided in the TLV object.\nType 2 and type 3 files contain records that may be shared between several phonebook entries (except when otherwise indicated). The terminal shall ensure that a shared record is emptied when the last phonebook entry referencing it is modified in such a way that it doesn't reference the record anymore.\nNOTE:\tin the current version of the specification, only type 3 files contain records that may be shared.\nEach constructed Tag contains a list of primitive Tags indicating the order and the kind of data (e.g. ADN, IAP,…) of the reference structure.\nThe primitive tag identifies clearly the type of data, its value field indicates the file identifier and, if applicable, the SFI value of the specified EF. That is, the length value of a primitive tag indicates if an SFI value is available for the EF or not:\n-\tLength = '02'\tValue: 'FID (2 bytes)'\n-\tLength = '03'\tValue: 'FID (2 bytes)', 'SFI (1 byte)'\nTable 4.2: Tag definitions for the phone book kind of file\n\nTable 4.3 (below) lists the allowed types for each kind of file:\nTable 4.3: Presence of files as type\n\nPhone Book Reference file EFPBR structure\n\nAt the end of each record, unused bytes, if any, shall be filled with 'FF'.\nThis file is present if Tag 'A9' is indicated in the reference file.\nThe EF contains pointers to the different records in the files that are part of the phone book. The index administration file record number/ID is mapped one to one with the corresponding EFADN (shall be record to record). The index administration file contains the same amount of records as EFADN. The order of the pointers in an EFIAP shall be the same as the order of file Ids that appear in the TLV object indicated by Tag 'A9' in the reference file record. The amount of bytes in a record is equal to the number of files indicated the EFPBR following tag 'A9'.\nThe value 'FF' is an invalid record number/ID and is used in any location in to indicate that no corresponding record in the indicated file is available.\nThe content of EFIAP is set to 'FF' at the personalisation stage.\nIndex administration file EFIAP structure\n\nThis EF contains Abbreviated Dialling Numbers (ADN) and/or Supplementary Service Control strings (SSC). In addition it contains identifiers of associated network/bearer capabilities and identifiers of extension records. It may also contain an associated alpha-tagging.\n\n\n-\tAlpha Identifier.\nContents:\n-\tAlpha-tagging of the associated dialling number.\nCoding:\n-\tthis alpha-tagging shall use either:\n-\tthe SMS default 7-bit coded alphabet as defined in TS 23.038 [5] with bit 8 set to 0. The alpha identifier shall be left justified. Unused bytes shall be set to 'FF'.\nOr:\n-\tone of the UCS2 coded options as defined in the annex of TS 31.101 [11].\nNOTE 1:\tThe value of X may be from zero to 241. Using the command GET RESPONSE the ME can determine the value of X.\n-\tLength of BCD number/SSC contents.\nContents:\n-\tthis byte gives the number of bytes of the following two data items containing actual BCD number/SSC information. This means that the maximum value is 11, even when the actual ADN/SSC information length is greater than 11. When an ADN/SSC has extension, it is indicated by the extension1 identifier being unequal to 'FF'. The remainder is stored in the EFEXT1 with the remaining length of the additional data being coded in the appropriate additional record itself (see clause 4.4.2.4).\nCoding:\n-\taccording to TS 24.008 [9].\n-\tTON and NPI.\nContents:\n-\tType of number (TON) and numbering plan identification (NPI).\nCoding:\n-\taccording to TS 24.008 [9]. If the Dialling Number/SSC String does not contain a dialling number, e.g. a control string deactivating a service, the TON/NPI byte shall be set to 'FF' by the ME (see note 2).\nNOTE 2:\tIf a dialling number is absent, no TON/NPI byte is transmitted over the radio interface (see TS 24.008 [9]). Accordingly, the ME should not interpret the value 'FF' and not send it over the radio interface.\n\n\n-\tDialling Number/SSC String\nContents:\n-\tup to 20 digits of the telephone number and/or SSC information.\nCoding:\n-\taccording to TS 24.008 [9], TS 22.030 [4] and the extended BCD-coding (see table 4.4). If the telephone number or SSC is longer than 20 digits, the first 20 digits are stored in this data item and the remainder is stored in an associated record in the EFEXT1. The record is identified by the Extension1 Record Identifier. If ADN/SSC require less than 20 digits, excess nibbles at the end of the data item shall be set to 'F'. Where individual dialled numbers, in one or more records, of less than 20 digits share a common appended digit string the first digits are stored in this data item and the common digits stored in an associated record in the EFEXT1. The record is identified by the Extension 1 Record Identifier. Excess nibbles at the end of the data item shall be set to 'F'.\nByte X+3\n\n\nByte X+4:\n\n\netc.\n-\tCapability/Configuration1 Record Identifier.\nContents:\n-\tcapability/configuration identification byte. This byte identifies the number of a record in the EFCCP1 containing associated capability/configuration parameters required for the call. The use of this byte is optional. If it is not used it shall be set to 'FF'.\nCoding:\n-\tbinary.\n-\tExtension1 Record Identifier.\nContents:\n-\textension1 record identification byte. This byte identifies the number of a record in the EFEXT1 containing an associated called party subaddress or additional data. The use of this byte is optional. If it is not used it shall be set to 'FF'.\n-\tif the ADN/SSC requires both additional data and called party subaddress, this byte identifies the additional record. A chaining mechanism inside EFEXT1 identifies the record of the appropriate called party subaddress (see clause 4.4.2.4).\nCoding:\n-\tbinary.\nNOTE 3:\tEFADN in the public phone book under DFTELECOM may be used by USIM, GSM and also other applications in a multi-application card. If the non-GSM application does not recognise the use of Type of Number (TON) and Number Plan Identification (NPI), then the information relating to the national dialling plan shall be held within the data item dialling number/SSC and the TON and NPI fields set to UNKNOWN. This format would be acceptable for 3GPP network operation and also for the non-GSM application where the TON and NPI fields shall be ignored.\nEXAMPLE:\tSIM storage of an International Number using E.164 [22] numbering plan.\nTON\t\tNPI\tDigit field.\nUSIM application\t\t001\t0001\tabc...\nOther application compatible with 3GPP specification\t000\t0000\txxx...abc...\nwhere \"abc...\" denotes the subscriber number digits (including its country code), and \"xxx...\" denotes escape digits or a national prefix replacing TON and NPI.\n\nNOTE 4:\tWhen the ME acts upon the EFADN with a SEARCH RECORD command in order to identify a character string in the alpha-identifier, it is the responsibility of the ME to ensure that the number of characters used as SEARCH RECORD parameters are less than or equal to the value of X if the MMI allows the user to offer a greater number.\nTable 4.4: Extended BCD coding\n\nBCD values 'C', 'D' and 'E' are never sent across the radio interface.\nNOTE 5:\tThe interpretation of values 'D', 'E' and 'F' as DTMF digits is for further study.\nNOTE 6:\tA second or subsequent 'C' BCD value will be interpreted as a 3 second PAUSE (see TS 22.101 [24]).\nThis EF contains extension data of an ADN/SSC.\nExtension data is caused by:\n-\tan ADN/SSC which is greater than the 20 digit capacity of the ADN/SSC Elementary File or where common digits are required to follow an ADN/SSC string of less than 20 digits. The remainder is stored in this EF as a record, which is identified by a specified identification byte inside the ADN/SSC Elementary File. The EXT1 record in this case is specified as additional data;\n-\tan associated called party subaddress. The EXT1 record in this case is specified as subaddress data.\n\n\n-\tRecord type.\nContents:\n-\ttype of the record.\nCoding:\n\n\n-\tb3 to b8 are reserved and set to 0;\n-\ta bit set to 1 identifies the type of record;\n-\tonly one type can be set;\n-\t'00' indicates the type \"unknown\" or \"free\".\nThe following example of coding means that the type of extension data is \"additional data\":\n\n\n-\tExtension data.\nContents:\nadditional data or Called Party Subaddress depending on record type.\nCoding:\nCase 1, Extension1 record is additional data:\n-\tThe first byte of the extension data gives the number of bytes of the remainder of ADN/SSC. The coding of remaining bytes is BCD, according to the coding of ADN/SSC. Unused nibbles at the end shall be set to 'F'. It is possible if the number of additional digits exceeds the capacity of the additional record to chain another record inside the EXT1 Elementary File by the identifier in byte 13. In this case byte 2 (first byte of the extension data) of all records for additional data within the same chain indicates the number of bytes ('01' to '0A') for ADN/SSC (respectively MSISDN, LND) within the same record unequal to 'FF'.\nCase 2, Extension1 record is Called Party Subaddress:\n-\tThe subaddress data contains information as defined for this purpose in TS 24.008 [9]. All information defined in TS 24.008 [9], except the information element identifier, shall be stored in the USIM. The length of this subaddress data can be up to 22 bytes. In those cases where two extension records are needed, these records are chained by the identifier field. The extension record containing the first part of the called party subaddress points to the record which contains the second part of the subaddress.\n-\tIdentifier.\nContents:\nidentifier of the next extension record to enable storage of information longer than 11 bytes.\nCoding:\nrecord number of next record. 'FF' identifies the end of the chain.\n-\tExample of a chain of extension records being associated to an ADN/SSC. The extension1 record identifier (Byte 14+X) of EFADN is set to 3.\n\n\nIn this example, ADN/SSC is associated to additional data (records 3 and 4) which represent the last 27 or 28 digits of the whole ADN/SSC (the first 20 digits are stored in EFADN) and a called party subaddress whose length is more than 11 bytes (records 6 and 1).\nThis EF contains control information related to each entry in the phone book. This EF contains as many records as the EFADN associated with it (shall be record to record). Each record in EFPBC points to a record in its EFADN. This file indicates the control information and the hidden information of each phone book entry.\nThe content of EFPBC is linked to the associated EFADN record by means of the ADN record number/ID (there is a one to one mapping of record number/identifiers between EFPBC and EFADN).\nStructure of control file EFPBC\n\n-\tEntry Control Information.\nContents:\n-\tprovides some characteristics about the phone book entry e.g. modification by a terminal accessing the ADN and EXT1 files under DFTELECOM (see clause 4.4.2).\nCoding:\n\n\n-\tHidden Information.\nContents:\nindicates to which USIM application of the UICC this phone book entry belongs, so that the corresponding secret code can be verified to display the phone book entry.

The amount of additional number entries may be less than or equal to the amount of records in EFADN. The EF structure is linear fixed. Each record contains an additional phone number or Supplementary Service Control strings (SSC). This record cannot be shared between several phonebook entries. The first byte indicates whether the record is free or the type of additional number referring to the record number in EFAAS, containing the text to be displayed.

The terminal assigns the (UID) when a new entry is created. The value of the UID does not change as long as the value of the PBID remains the same. The UID shall remain on the UICC, in EFUID, until the PBID is regenerated. This means that when a phone book entry is deleted, the content of the linked information (e.g. ADN, E-MAIL,..) shall be set to the personalization value 'FF…FF'. But the UID-value of the deleted record shall not be used when a new entry is added to the phonebook until the PBID is regenerated, but it shall be set to a new value.\nIf/when the PBID is regenerated, all UIDs for the entry in the phone book shall be assigned new values starting from 1. If more than one EFUID exists (i.e. multiple phone book file sets) then all values of UIDs used in that phone book shall be unique over all phone book file sets within that phone book. The new value of the UID for each entry shall then be kept until the PBID is regenerated again.\nStructure of EFUID\n\n-\tUnique Identifier of Phone Book Entry.\nContent:\n-\tnumber to unambiguously identify the phone book entry for synchronisation purposes.\nCoding:\n-\thexadecimal value. At initialisation all UIDs are personalised to ''00 00'' (i.e. empty).\nThe phone book synchronisation counter (PSC) is used by the ME to construct the phone book identifier (PBID) and to determine whether the accessed phone book is the same as the previously accessed phone book or if it is a new unknown phone book (might be the case that there is one phonebook under DF-telecom and one phone book residing in a USIM-application). If the PSC is unknown, a full synchronisation of the phone book will follow.\nThe PSC is also used to regenerate the UIDs and reset the CC to prevent them from running out of range. When the UIDs or the CC has reached its maximum value, a new PSC is generated. This leads to a scenario where neither the CC nor the UIDs will run out of range.\nThe PSC shall be regenerated by the terminal if one of the following situation applies:\n-\tthe values of the UIDs have run out of range;\n-\tthe whole phone book has been reset/deleted;\n-\tthe value of the CC has run out of range.\nStructure of EFPSC\n\n-\tPSC: Unique synchronisation counter of Phone Book.\nContent:\nnumber to unambiguously identify the status of the phone book for synchronisation purposes.\nCoding:\nhexadecimal value.\nThe phone book identifier (PBID) coding based on the EFPSC is described hereafter:\n-\tFor a phone book residing in DF-telecom:\n-\tPBID\t= ICCid (10bytes) \"fixed part\" + 4 bytes (in EFPSC) \"variable part\".\n-\tFor a phone book residing in an USIM application:\n-\tPBID\t= 10 last bytes of (ICCid XOR AID) \"fixed part\" + 4 bytes (in EFPSC) \"variable part\".\nTo be able to detect if the PSC needs to be regenerated (i.e. the variable part) the following test shall be made by the terminal before for each update of either the CC or the assignment of a new UID:\n-\tEach time the terminal has to increment the value of the UID the following test is needed:\n-\tIf UID = 'FF FF' then.\n{Increment PSC mod 'FF FF FF FF'; all the UIDs shall be regenerated}.\n-\tEach time the terminal has to increment the value of CC the following test is needed:\nIf CC = 'FF FF' then.\n{Increment PSC mod 'FF FF FF FF';\tCC=0001}.\nNOTE:\tIf the phonebook is deleted then the terminal will change the PSC according to:\nIncrementing PSC modulus 'FFFFFFFF'.\nThe change counter (CC) shall be used to detect changes made to the phone book.\nEvery update/deletion of an existing phone book entry or the addition of a new phone book entry causes the terminal to increment the EFCC. The concept of having a CC makes it possible to update the phone book in different terminals, which still are able to detect the changes (e.g. changes between different handset and/or 2nd and 3rd generation of terminals).\nStructure of EFCC\n\n-\tChange Counter of Phone Book.\nContent:\n-\tindicates recent change(s) to phone book entries for synchronisation purposes.\nCoding:\n-\thexadecimal value.

The remaining digits are stored in the selected Extension1 record where the type of the record is set to \"additional data\". The first byte of the Extension1 record is set with the number of bytes of the remaining additional data. The number of bytes containing digit information is the sum of the length of BCD number/SSC contents of EFADN and byte 2 of all associated chained Extension1 records containing additional data.\niii)\tIf a called party subaddress is associated to the ADN/SSC the procedure shall proceed as follows:\n-\tIf the length of the called party subaddress is less than or equal to 11 bytes (see TS 24.008 [9] for coding):\n-\tThe ME seeks for a free record in EFEXT1. If an Extension1 record is not marked as \"free\", the ME runs the Purge procedure. If an Extension1 record is still unavailable, the procedure is aborted.\n-\tThe ME stores the called party subaddress in the Extension1 record, and sets the Extension1 record type to \"called party subaddress\".\n-\tIf the length of the called party subaddress is greater than 11 bytes (see TS 24.008 [9] for coding):\n-\tThe ME seeks for two free records in EFEXT1. If no such two records are found, the ME runs the Purge procedure. If two Extension1 records are still unavailable, the procedure is aborted.\n-\tThe ME stores the called party subaddress in the two Extension1 records. The identifier field in the Extension1 record containing the first part of the subaddress data is coded with the associated EFEXT1 record number containing the second part of the subaddress data.

If the USIM has no available empty space to store the received ADN/SSC, or if the procedure has been aborted, the ME advises the user.\nFor reasons of memory efficiency, the ME may analyse all Extension1 records to recognise if the additional or subaddress data to be stored is already existing in EFEXT1. In this case, the ME may use the existing chain or the last part of the existing chain from more than one ADN. The ME is only allowed to store extension data in unused records.

For the specification of the corresponding procedures across the USIM/ME interface see clause 5.\nThe mechanism achieves mutual authentication by the user and the network showing knowledge of a secret key K which is shared between and available only to the USIM and the AuC in the user's HE. In addition, the USIM and the HE keep track of counters SQNMS and SQNHE respectively to support network authentication. SQNHE is a counter in the HLR/AuC, individual for each user and SQNMS denotes the highest sequence number the USIM has ever accepted.\nWhen the SN/VLR initiates an authentication and key agreement, it selects the next authentication vector and sends the parameters RAND and AUTN (authentication token) to the user. Each authentication token consists of the following components: a sequence number SQN, an Authentication Management Field (AMF) and a message authentication code MAC over the RAND, SQN and AMF.\nThe USIM checks whether AUTN can be accepted and, if so, produces a response RES which is sent back to the SN/VLR. The SN/VLR compares the received RES with XRES. If they match the SN/VLR considers the authentication and key agreement exchange to be successfully completed. The USIM also computes CK and IK. The established keys CK and IK will be used by the ME to perform ciphering and integrity functions.\nA permanent secret key K is used in this procedure. This key K has a length of 128 bits or 256 bits and is stored within the USIM for use in the algorithms described below. Also more than one secret key K can be stored in the USIM. The active key to be used by the algorithms is signalled within the AMF field in the AUTN.\n",

In addition, a cipher key and an integrity key are calculated. For the execution of the command the USIM uses the subscriber authentication key K, which is stored in the USIM.\nThe function is used in VGCS/VBS security context during the procedure for retrieving the VGCS/VBS Short Term Key (VSTK) used by the terminal in establishing VGCS/VBS calls.\nThe function is used in GBA security context in two different modes:\na)\tBootstrapping Mode: during the procedure for mutual authenticating of the USIM and the Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) and for deriving bootstrapped key material from the AKA run.\nb)\tNAF Derivation Mode: during the procedure for deriving Network Application Function (NAF) specific keys from previous bootstrapped key material.\nThe function is used in MBMS security context in two different modes:\na)\tMSK Update Mode: during the procedure for updating an MBMS Service Key (MSK).\nb)\tMTK Generation Mode: during the procedure for retrieving the MBMS Traffic Key (MTK) used by the terminal to decrypt MBMS data.\nThe function is related to a particular USIM and shall not be executable unless the USIM application has been selected and activated, and the current directory is the USIM ADF or any subdirectory under this ADF and a successful PIN verification procedure has been performed (see clause 5).\nThe USIM first computes the anonymity key AK = f5K (RAND) and retrieves the sequence number SQN = ()  AK.\nThen the USIM computes XMAC = f1K (SQN ||  || AMF) and compares this with the MAC which is included in AUTN. If they are different, the USIM abandons the function.\nNext the USIM verifies that the received sequence number SQN is previously unused. If it is unused and its value is lower than SQNMS, it shall still be accepted if it is among the last 32 sequence numbers generated. A possible verification method is described in TS 33.102 [13].\nNOTE:\tThis implies that the USIM has to keep a list of the last used sequence numbers and the length of the list is at least 32 entries.\nIf the USIM detects the sequence numbers to be invalid, this is considered as a synchronisation failure and the USIM abandons the function. In this case the command response is AUTS, where:\nAUTS = Conc(SQNMS) || MACS;\nConc(SQNMS) = SQNMS  f5*K(RAND) is the concealed value of the counter SQNMS in the USIM; and.\nMACS = f1*K(SQNMS || RAND || AMF) where:\nRAND is the random value received in the current user authentication request;\nthe AMF assumes a dummy value of all zeroes so that it does not need to be transmitted in clear in the resynchronisation message.\nIf the sequence number is considered in the correct range, the USIM computes RES = f2K (RAND), the cipher key CK = f3K (RAND) and the integrity key IK = f4K () and includes these in the command response. Note that if this is more efficient, RES, CK and IK could also be computed earlier at any time after receiving .\nThe use of AMF is HE specific and while processing the command, the content of the AMF has to be interpreted in the appropriate manner. The AMF may e.g. be used for support of multiple algorithms or keys or for changing the size of lists, see TS 33.102 [13].\nIf Service n°27 is \"available\", the USIM calculates the GSM response parameter KC, using the conversion function defined in TS 33.102 [13].\nInput:\n-\tRAND, AUTN (AUTN:= SQN  AK || AMF || MAC).\nOutput:\n-\tRES, CK, IK if Service n°27 is \"not available\".\nOr\n-\tRES, CK, IK, KC if Service n°27 is \"available\".\nOr\n-\tAUTS.\nUSIM operation in an GSM security context is supported if Service n°38 is \"available\".\nThe USIM computes RES = f2K (RAND), the cipher key CK = f3K (RAND) and the integrity key IK = f4K (). Next the USIM calculates the GSM response parameters SRES and KC, using the conversion functions defined in TS 33.102 [13].\nInput:\n-\t.\nOutput:\n-\tSRES; KC.\nUSIM operation in a VGCS/VBS security context is supported if both Service n°57 and Service n°64 are \"available\" (VGCS security context) or if both Service n°58 and Service n°65 are \"available\" (VBS security context).\nThe USIM computes the Short Term Key (VSTK) associated with a particular VGCS/VBS Group Identifier (Group_Id). For this computation, the USIM uses the Voice Group (for VGCS) or Broadcast Group (for VBS) Key (V_Ki) identified by their respective Group_Id and Master Group Key Identifier (VK_Id). The USIM retrieves the Group_Id and the service flag (VGCS or VBS) from the received Voice Service Identifier (Vservice_Id).\nNOTE:\tThe Group_Id has a variable length according to TS 43.068 [46].\nThe USIM shall first search if the Group_Id corresponds to a stored VGCS Group Identifier in EFVGCS or a stored VBS Group Identifier in EFVBS.\nThen, the USIM shall retrieve the V_Ki corresponding to the given Group_Id and VK_Id.\nThen the USIM uses V_Ki and VSTK_RAND as input parameters for the A8_V key derivation function (as defined in TS 43.020 [44]) in order to compute and returns VSTK.\nInput:\n-\tVservice_Id, VK_Id, VSTK_RAND\nOutput:\n-\tVSTK.\nUSIM operations in GBA security context are supported if service n°68 is \"available\".\nThe USIM receives the RAND and AUTN*. The USIM first computes the anonymity key AK = f5K (RAND) and retrieves the sequence number SQN = ()  AK.\nThe USIM calculates IK = f4K (RAND) and MAC (by performing the MAC modification function described in TS 33.220 [42]). Then the USIM computes XMAC = f1K (SQN ||  || AMF) and compares this with the MAC previously produced. If they are different, the USIM abandons the function.\nThen the USIM performs the checking of AUTN* as in UMTS security context. If the USIM detects the sequence numbers to be invalid, this is considered as a synchronisation failure and the USIM abandons the function. In this case the command response is AUTS, which is computed as in UMTS security context.\nIf the sequence number is considered in the correct range, the USIM computes RES = f2K (RAND) and the cipher key CK = f3K ().\nThe USIM then derives and stores GBA_U bootstrapped key material from CK, IK values. The USIM shall also stores RAND in the  field of EFGBABP\nThe USIM stores GBA_U bootstrapped key material from only one bootstrapping procedure. The previous bootstrapped key material, if present, shall be replaced by the new one. This key material is linked with the data contained in EFGBABP : , which is updated by the USIM and B-TID, which shall be further updated by the ME.\nNOTE:\tAccording to TS 33.220 [42], NAF-specific keys that may be stored on the USIM are not affected by this bootstrapping operation.\nRES is included in the command response after flipping the least significant bit.\nInput:\n-\tRAND, AUTN*\nOutput:\n-\tRES\nor\n-\tAUTS\n\nUSIM operations in GBA security context are supported if service n°68 is \"available\".\nThe USIM receives the NAF_ID and IMPI.\nThe USIM performs Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF derivation as defined in TS 33.220 [42] using the key material from the previous GBA_U bootstrapping procedure.\nIf no key material is available this is considered as a GBA Bootstrapping failure and the USIM abandons the function. The status word '6985' (Conditions of use not satisfied) is returned.\nOtherwise, the USIM stores Ks_int_NAF and associated B-TID together with NAF_ID. The Ks_int_NAF keys related to other NAF_Ids, which are already stored in the USIM, shall not be affected. The USIM updates EFGBANL as follows:\n-\tIf a record with the given NAF_ID already exists, the USIM updates the B-TID field of this record with the B-TID value associated to the GBA_U bootstrapped key involved in this GBA_U NAF derivation procedure.\n-\tIf a record with the given NAF_ID does not exist, the USIM uses an empty record to store the NAF_ID and the B-TID value associated to the GBA_U bootstrapped key involved in this GBA_U NAF Derivation procedure.\nNOTE:\tAccording to TS 33.220 [42], the USIM can contain several Ks_int_NAF together with the associated B-TID and NAF_ID, but there is at most one pair of Ks_int_NAF and associated B-TID stored per NAF_ID.\n-\tIn case no empty record is available the USIM shall overwrite an existing record to store the NAF_ID and the B-TID value associated to the GBA_U bootstrapped key involved in this GBA_U NAF Derivation procedure. To determine the record to overwrite, the USIM shall construct a list of record numbers by storing in the list first position the record number of the last used (i.e. involved in an Authentication command) or derived Ks_int_NAF and by shifting down the remaining list elements. The last record number in this list corresponds to the record to overwrite when the USIM runs out of free records. If an existing record corresponding to a Ks_int_NAF key in use is overwritten, the application Ks_int_NAF shall not be affected (e.g. in case a Ks_int_NAF was put into use as an MBMS MUK key, the MUK key shall continue to be available for the MBMS application).\nThen, the USIM returns Ks_ext_NAF.\nInput:\n-\tNAF_ID, IMPI\nOutput:\n-\tKs_ext_NAF\nUSIM operations in MBMS security context are supported if service n°69 is \"available\".\nThe USIM receives the MIKEY packet containing an MSK update message.  First, the USIM uses the MUK ID to identify the Ks_int_NAF corresponding with a previous bootstrapping procedure.\nThe USIM shall check if a new NAF derivation procedure involving the received Idi in the MIKEY message has been performed or if it is the first time that this Idi is used. If this check cannot be performed because the corresponding Ks_int_NAF key was overwritten, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '6985' (Conditions of use not satisfied). In case of a new NAF derivation procedure or a new Idi, the USIM shall store the last bootstrapped Ks_int_NAF as the last generated MUK and update EFMUK as follows:\n-\tIf a record with the received Idi (included in the MUK ID: see TS 33.246 [43]) value is already present, then the MUK ID is stored in the corresponding field of this record, and the associated Time Stamp Counter (TS) field is reset. Additionally, the USIM internally stores the last successfully used MUK (i.e. MUK that was used during the last successful MSK update procedure), along with its MUK ID for further use (e.g. to detect Key freshness failure).\n-\tIf a record with the received Idi does not exist, the USIM uses an empty record to include the MUK ID, and reset the associated TS field.\n-\tIn case there is no empty record available in EFMUK the USIM abandons the function and the status word '9867' (Authentication error, no available memory space in EFMUK) is returned.\nNOTE:\tIn case no empty record in EFMUK is available the ME should run a MUK Deletion Mode procedure to free entries in EFMUK before running an MSK Update Mode procedure that involves a new MUK key.\nNOTE:\tIn case the ME receives the status word '6985', the ME should derive the required Ks_int_NAF key. In case the corresponding bootstrapping key Ks is still available, the ME should invoke the Authenticate command in \"GBA - NAF derivation Mode\" before invoking again the AUTHENTICATE command in \"MBMS - MSK Update Mode\". In case the corresponding bootstrapping key has been updated, the ME should put the new B-TID into use.\nIf the received MUK ID does not correspond to the last generated MUK (i.e. last bootstrapped MUK) then the USIM proceeds as follows:\n-\tIf the received MUK ID corresponds to the last successfully used MUK then the USIM uses this MUK to verify the integrity of the message. If the verification is unsuccessful, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '9862' (Authentication error, incorrect MAC). If the verification is successful, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '9865' (Key Freshness Failure), indicating to the ME that the received MIKEY message is protected using the last successfully used MUK that does not correspond to the last generated MUK (the new B-TID shall be put into use: see TS 33.246 [43]). In this case, the USIM shall not return a MIKEY verification message.\n-\tOtherwise, this is considered as a bootstrapping failure (incorrect MUK) and the USIM abandons the function. The status word '6A88' (Referenced data not found) is returned.\nOtherwise, if the received MUK ID corresponds to the last generated MUK, the USIM uses the MUK value for MSK validation and derivation functions as described in TS 33.246 [43]. If the validation is unsuccessful, the status word '9862' (Authentication error, incorrect MAC) is returned and the USIM abandons the function.\nAfter a successful MSK Update procedure the USIM stores the received credentials (e.g. MSK and/or Key Validity data) and updates EFMSK as follows:\n-\tIf a record with the received Key Domain ID and Key Group part (i.e. Key Group part of the MSK ID) already exists, USIM stores the older MSK ID (if any) and its associated TS as the 2nd MSK ID and TS. The newer MSK ID is stored as the 1st MSK ID. In case the received MSK message has the same MSK ID as a stored MSK, the TS associated to this stored MSK is stored as the 1st TS. Otherwise, the 1st TS value is reset. The number of stored MSK IDs and corresponding TS shall be set to '02' if the USIM stores two different MSK IDs. The USIM shall not store two MSK IDs with the same Key Number part in the same record.\n-\tIf a record with the received Key Domain ID and Key Group part does not exist, the USIM uses an empty record to include those values. The received MSK ID is stored as the 1st MSK ID and the associated TS is reset. The 2nd MSK ID and the associated TS are set to 'FF FF'. The number of stored MSK IDs and corresponding TS shall be set to '01'. In case there is no empty record available in EFMSK the USIM abandons the function and the status word '9866' (Authentication error, no available memory space) is returned.\n-\tIn the case of a BM-SC solicited pull procedure (i.e. when the Key Number part of the MSK ID is set to 0x0), EFMSK is not updated.\nNOTE:\tIn case no empty record is available the ME should run an MSK Deletion Mode procedure to free entries in EFMSK before running an MSK Update Mode procedure that contains a new MSK key.\nThen, the USIM stores the Time Stamp field (retrieved from the MIKEY message) in its corresponding field under EFMUK.\nThe USIM stores internally the last successfully used MUK along with its MUK ID for further use. This MUK may be used beyond its GBA validity (i.e. after the derivation of a new Ks_int_NAF resulting from a new bootstrap procedure) to verify the integrity of a MIKEY message in order to detect a synchronization failure. This may occur if the last derived Ks_int_NAF did not reach the BM-SC.\nThe MSK is not necessarily updated in the MIKEY message, since a MSK transport message can be sent e.g. to update the Key Validity data or as part of a BM-SC solicited pull procedure. In such a case the USIM shall use the status word '9000' to inform the ME that the MIKEY message validation using the last generated MUK has succeeded.\nFinally, if the V-bit in the HDR field of the received MIKEY message is set then the USIM shall produce a MSK Verification Message as described in TS 33.246 [43]. In this case the command response is the MIKEY verification message.\nInput:\n-\tMIKEY message\nOutput:\n-\tMIKEY message\nor\n-\tNone\nUSIM operations in MBMS security context are supported if service n°69 is \"available\".\nThe USIM receives the MIKEY message containing an MBMS MTK and a Salt key (if Salt key is available). First, the USIM retrieves the MSK with the Key Domain ID and the MSK ID given by the Extension payload of the MIKEY message (as described in TS 33.246 [43]).\nIf the needed MSK does not exist, this is considered as a MSK failure and the USIM abandons the function. The status word '6A88' (Referenced data not found) is returned.\nIf the key validity data of the MSK indicates an invalidated MSK (i.e. SEQl is greater than SEQu) then the USIM returns the status word '6985' (Conditions of use not satisfied) and abandons the function. SEQl and SEQu are defined in TS 33.246 [43].\nOtherwise, the USIM performs the MBMS Generation and Validation Function (MGV-F) as described in TS 33.246 [43] using MSK.\nIf the USIM detects that the given MTK ID is invalid, this is considered as a SEQp freshness failure and the USIM abandons the function. The status word '9865' (Key freshness failure) is returned.\nIf the integrity validation of the MIKEY message is unsuccessful, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '9862' (Authentication error, incorrect MAC).\nAfter successful MGV_F procedure the USIM stores the Time Stamp field (retrieved from the MIKEY message) as the Time Stamp Counter (TS) associated with the involved MSK under EFMSK\nThe USIM also stores MTK ID (retrieved from the MIKEY message) as the SEQl associated with MSK.\nThen, the USIM returns MTK and Salt key (if Salt key is available).\nInput:\n-\tMIKEY message\nOutput:\n-\tMTK and Salt (if available).\nUSIM operations in MBMS security context are supported if service n°69 is \"available\".\nThe USIM receives the Key Domain ID and the Key Group part of the MSK ID. The USIM shall identify in the EFMSK the record containing MSK IDs having this Key Domain ID and Key Group part.\nIf no record is identified, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '6A88' (Referenced data not found).\nIf a record is found, the USIM shall delete all corresponding MSKs and set to 'FF' the bytes of this record.\nInput:\n-\tKey Domain ID, MSK ID Key Group part\nOutput:\n-\tNone.\nUSIM operations in MBMS security context are supported if service n°69 is \"available\".\nThe USIM shall identify in EFMUK the record containing the received MUK ID.\nIf no record is identified, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '6A88' (Referenced data not found).\nIf a record is found, the USIM shall delete the corresponding MUK and set to 'FF' the bytes of this record. If a corresponding Ks_int_NAF key is present (i.e. with the same NAF_ID), it shall be deleted and its corresponding record in EFGBANL shall be set to 'FF'. In case the corresponding Ks key is present (i.e. with the same B-TID), it shall be deleted and the content of EFGBABP shall be set to 'FF'.\nInput:\nMUK ID TLV\nOutput:\n-\tNone\nUSIM operations in this security context are supported if service n°68 and service n°76 are \"available\".\nThe USIM receives the NAF_ID corresponding to the NAF Key Centre, the Terminal_ID, the Terminal_appli_ID, the UICC_appli_ID, RANDx, the Counter Limit value and the MAC as described in TS 33.110 [47].\nThe USIM uses the NAF_ID to identify the Ks_int_NAF associated to the NAF Key Centre. If no valid Ks_int_NAF is available, this is considered as a Key Establishment failure and the USIM abandons the function. The status word '6A88' (Referenced data not found) is returned.\nIf the Ks_local key derivation is not authorized by the local UICC policy (e.g. Terminal_appli_ID/UICC_appli_ID association not authorized or Terminal_ID value not authorized), the USIM abandons the function. The status word '6985' (Conditions of use not satisfied) is returned.\nOtherwise, the USIM retrieves the appropriate Ks_int_NAF, derives Ks_local as described in TS 33.110 [47]. The USIM verifies the MAC value received from the Terminal as described in TS 33.110 [47]:\n-\tIf the verification is unsuccessful, the USIM abandons the function and returns the status word '9862' (Authentication error, incorrect MAC).\n-\tIf the verification is successful, the USIM stores Ks_local and associated parameters Terminal_ID, Terminal_appli_ID, UICC_appli_ID, RANDx and the Ks_local Counter Limit. The USIM returns the Local Key Establishment Operation Response TLV (indicating a successful Key Derivation operation) and a response MAC, which is derived as described in TS 33.110 [47].\nThe minimum number of Local keys that can be stored by the USIM shall be defined by the service provider at the pre-issuance of the card.\nIn case the maximum number of Local Key was already reached or there is not enough available memory in the USIM, the USIM shall overwrite a Local Key and its associated data in order to store the new one. To determine the Ks_local to overwrite, the USIM shall construct a list of Ks_local identifiers by storing in the list first position the Ks_local identifier of the last used or derived Ks_local and by shifting down the remaining list elements. The last Ks_local identifier in this list corresponds to the Ks_local to overwrite when the USIM runs out of free memory or when the maximum number of Ks_local keys is reached. If an existing Ks_local in use is overwritten, the application using Ks_local shall not be affected.\nInput:\n-\tLocal Key Establishment Mode (Key Derivation mode), Counter Limit, request MAC, Key Identifier (i.e. NAF_ID, Terminal_ID, Terminal_appli_ID, UICC_appli_ID, RANDx)\nOutput:\n-\tKey Derivation operation status, response MAC.\nUSIM operations in this security context are supported if service n°68 and service n°76 are \"available\".\nThe USIM receives a Ks_local identifier. The USIM checks if a corresponding valid Ks_local is available. If a valid Ks_local key is available the Local Key Establishment Operation Response TLV (indicating a successful Key Availability Check operation) is returned. In case no valid Ks_local key is available the command fails and the status word '6A88' (Referenced data not found) is returned.\nInput:\nLocal Key Establishment Mode (Key Availability Check mode), Key identifier (i.e. NAF_ID, Terminal_ID, Terminal_appli_ID, UICC_appli_ID, RANDx).\nOutput:\n-\tKey Availability Check Operation Status.\n",

Raster image points which point to this entry are transparent, so that the underlying colour in the display is shown.\nThe three colour-coding bytes of  entry number C-1 in the CLUT are of no importance when referenced from images using the  '22' coding scheme.\nNOTE:\tTwo different descriptors in the EFIMG file with Image Coding Scheme '21' and '22' may point to the same actual image instance. In that case, the descriptor with Image Coding Scheme '21' would describe an image where a raster image point pointing to entry number C-1 in the CLUT would have the colour described in that CLUT entry, while the descriptor with Image Coding Scheme '22' would describe an image where a raster image point pointing to entry number C-1 in the CLUT is transparent.\nStructure of the GSM network parameter TLV object, 0<= m <=32\n\n\nStructure of the FDD network parameter TLV object, 0 <= m <= 32\n\n\nStructure of the TDD network parameter TLV object, 0 <= m <= 32\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\tthe value 'FF' is an invalid tag value. For ASN.1 tag assignment rules see ISO/IEC 8825-1 [35].\nIf EFs have an unassigned value, it may not be clear from the main text what this value should be. This annex suggests values in these cases.\n\nNOTE 1:\tThe value '000000' means that ACMmax is not valid, i.e. there is no restriction on the ACM. When assigning a value to ACMmax, care should be taken not to use values too close to the maximum possible value 'FFFFFF', because the INCREASE command does not update EFACM if the units to be added would exceed 'FFFFFF'. This could affect the call termination procedure of the Advice of Charge function.\nNOTE 2:\txxxxxx stands for any valid MCC and MNC, coded according to TS 24.008 [9].\nThe length of all the records is determined by the LSA descriptor containing the largest number of bytes. Combinations containing different numbers of LSA IDs, LAC+ CI and CI or LAC can therefore be done. Various examples are show. Due to the OTA management of the records it is recommended that the record length is maximum 100 bytes in order to leave room for command descriptor and signature information in the SMS.\nThis first example contains two LSAs, one described by two LSA IDs and another described by three Cell IDs, giving a record length of 8 bytes.\n\n\n\nThe second example contains two LSAs, one described by one LSA ID and one described by two Cell Ids, giving a record length of 6 bytes.\n\n\n\nThis example phonebook has more than 254 entries. Additional number (3 additional numbers) information, second name and e-mail information can be added to each ADN entry. In addition each entry has a 2 byte Unique ID (UID) attached to it. The phonebook also contains three files that are shared EFEXT1, EFAAS and EFGAS. These files are addressed from inside a file. EFEXT1 is addressed via EFADN, EFADN1, EFAAS is addressed via EFANRA, EFANRA1, EFANRB, EFANRB1, EFANRC, EFANRC1 and EFGAS is addressed via EFGRP, EFGRP1. The phonebook supports two levels of grouping and hidden entries in EFPBC.\nTwo records are needed in the phonebook reference file PBR '4F30' for supporting more than 254 entries. The content of the phonebook reference file PBR '4F30' records is as shown in table G.2. The structure of the DFPHONEBOOK is shown in table G.1.\nThe content of phonebook entries in the range from 1-508 is described in the tables G.3 and G.4.\nTable G.1: Structure of EFs inside DFPHONEBOOK\n\nTable G.2: Contents of EFPBR\n\n\nTable G.3: Structure of the 254 first entries in the phonebook\n\nTable G.4: Structure of phone book entries 255 to 508 (Rec 1-254)\n\nThe figure depicts a phone book with various entries, including names, numbers, and addresses.

The following provisions apply:\nWhen using pre-shared keys, only a USIM-RN is required, and the Relay Node will establish directly a secure channel with USIM-RN. It is assumed that the Relay Node knows the \"3G application code\" within the PIX value reserved for 3GPP USIM-RN.\nWhen using certificate based procedure, the UICC inserted in the Relay Node shall contains two USIMs, the USIM-RN and USIM-INI. In case initial provisioning is required, the Relay Node will first select USIM-INI, either by direct application selection or by use of the EF_DIR file.\n1.\tDirect application selection: with full or with partial AID. It is assumed that the Relay Node knows the \"3G application code\" within the PIX value reserved for 3GPP USIM-INI.\n2.\tBy use of the EF_DIR file: The Relay Node identifies the USIM-INI, which is characterised by an AID with a \"3G application code\" within the PIX value reserved for 3GPP USIM-INI, see TS 31.101 [11], and selects the USIM-INI by AID. The AID of the USIM-RN is characterised by an AID with a \"3G application code\" within the PIX value reserved for 3GPP USIM-RN, see TS 31.101 [11]. If the only applications present in EF_DIR are a USIM-RN and a USIM-INI, the terminal omits user presentation and proceeds to application selection.\nThe USIM applications USIM-INI and USIM-RN are not simultaneously active. USIM-INI is used to establish an initial network connection and USIM-INI is deactivated once the network related operations are finished. USIM-INI is deactivated prior to activating USIM-RN.\nUSIM-INI may be selected on any logical channel, see TS 31.101 [11]. Prior to selecting USIM-RN a new logical channel shall be opened using the MANAGE CHANNEL command as specified in TS 31.101 [11], an application to application secure channel can only be established on a logical channel different from channel 0. USIM-RN is then selected on the new logical channel.\nUSIM-RN shall be configured to support implicit and explicit application selection. The Relay Node will first select USIM-INI, according to the application selection mechanisms specified in TS 31.101 [11]. When the USIM-RN is selected explicitly, the Relay Node shall send a SELECT by AID APDU command in clear text prior to secure channel establishment. The implicit selection mechanism is performed by specifying USIM-RN AID in the MANAGE SECURE CHANNEL – Establish Master SA command.\n",

            "description": "IOPS allows to provide network service to Public Safety users even in the case the network has no or only limited backhaul connectivity. One of the main issues in such cases is the missing backhaul to perform authentication. A solution has been defined by using local HSSs which take over the responsibility for authentication in IOPS mode.\nA problem identified for IOPS security when making use of local HSS is the higher probability of a compromise of a local HSS. Therefore the security solution described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [52] uses a local HSS with different authentication credentials than the standard HSS in normal operation. Additionally there might be several local HSSs and to further reduce the impact of possible compromised local HSSs, each local HSS should use different authentication credentials.\nThe security solution described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [52] is based on a USIM application dedicated for IOPS and using derived individual keys per local HSS.\n3GPP TS 23.401 [69] Annex K specifies a PLMN identity dedicated for IOPS mode of operation. Additionally a USIM dedicated for IOPS uses an Access Control Class of '11' or '15'.\n",

The specific values for the Access Control Class prevent UEs with different Access Control Classes from trying to attach to the IOPS network.\n-\tThe entry for the USIM dedicated for IOPS in EFDIR has a label starting with 'USIM-IOPS'.\nIn case multiple local HSSs are to be supported, The USIM should also support:\n-\tThe AMF (Authentication Management Field) mechanism as described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [52] Annex F.4.1 is supported.\n-\tAn Operator specific mechanism to derive local HSS individual keys is supported (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [52] Annex F.4).\nNOTE:\tThe mechanism to derive local HSS specific keys in the USIM dedicated for IOPS is specific to an Operator and needs to be agreed for the local HSS and the USIM.
