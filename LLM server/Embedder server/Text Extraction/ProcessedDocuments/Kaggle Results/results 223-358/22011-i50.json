When this condition applies service interruptions and failures will be mitigated.\nPLMN\nA Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is a network established and operated by an Administration or RPOA for the specific purpose of providing land mobile communication services to the public. It provides communication possibilities for mobile users. For communications between mobile and fixed users, interworking with a fixed network is necessary.\nA PLMN may provide service in one, or a combination, of frequency bands.\nAs a rule, a PLMN is limited by the borders of a country. Depending on national regulations there may be more than one PLMN per country.\nA relationship exists between each subscriber and his home PLMN (HPLMN). If communications are handled over another PLMN, this PLMN is referred to as the visited PLMN (VPLMN).\nPLMN Area\nThe PLMN area is the geographical area in which a PLMN provides communication services according to the specifications to mobile users. In the PLMN area, the mobile user can set up calls to a user of a terminating network. The terminating network may be a fixed network, the same PLMN, another PLMN or other types of PLMN.\nTerminating network users can also set up calls to the PLMN.\nThe PLMN area is allocated to a PLMN. It is determined by the service and network provider in accordance with any provisions laid down under national law. In general, the PLMN area is restricted to one country. It can also be determined differently, depending on the different telecommunication services, or type of UE.\nIf there are several PLMNs in one country, their PLMN areas may overlap. In border areas, the PLMN areas of different countries may overlap. Administrations will have to take precautions to ensure that cross border coverage is minimized in adjacent countries unless otherwise agreed.\nNote 1:\tITU-T Recommendation Q.1001 [4] does not contain a definition of the PLMN area.\nSystem Area\nThe System Area is defined as the group of PLMN areas accessible by UEs.\nInterworking of several PLMNs and interworking between PLMNs and fixed network(s) permit public land mobile communication services at international level.\nNote 2:\tThe System Area according to [4] Recommendation Q.1001 corresponds to the System Area.\nService Area\nThe Service Area is defined in the same way as the Service Area according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.1001 [4]. In contrast to the PLMN area it is not based on the coverage of a PLMN. Instead it is based on the area in which a fixed network user can call a mobile user without knowing his location. The Service Area can therefore change when the signalling system is being extended, for example.\nShared MCC\nMCC assigned by ITU-T as shared MCC according to ITU-T E.212 [19], except within this specification for PLMN selection purposes the MCC of value 999 is not considered a shared MCC.\nRegionally Provided Service\nRegionally Provided Service is defined as a service entitlement to only certain geographical part(s) of a PLMN, as controlled by the network operator.\nLocalised Service Area (LSA)\nThe localised service area concept shall give the operator a basis to offer subscribers different services (e.g. tariffs or access rights) depending on the location of the subscriber. An LSA consists of a cell or a number of cells within a PLMN. (3GPP TS 22.043 [5]).\nTracking Area:\nE-UTRAN utilises Tracking Areas (TA) for UE access control, location registration, paging and mobility management. The TA is independent of Location Areas (LA) and Routing Areas (RA). A TA comprises one or more E-UTRA cells Service requirements for E-UTRAN are specified in 3GPP TS 22.278 [8].\n",

It shall be possible for the user to update the User Controlled PLMN Selector data field, but it shall not be possible to update this data field over the radio interface, e.g. using SIM Application Toolkit.\nIt shall be possible to have an Operator Controlled PLMN Selector list and a User Controlled PLMN Selector list stored on the SIM/USIM card. Both PLMN Selector lists may contain a list of preferred PLMNs in priority order. It shall be possible to have an associated Access Technology identifier e.g., NG-RAN, satellite NG-RAN, E-UTRAN (WB-S1 mode), E-UTRAN (NB-S1 mode), UTRAN, GERAN or GERAN EC-GSM-IoT associated with each entry in the PLMN Selector lists.\nFor UEs supporting any, or a combination, of NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT [18] and Category M1 or M2 of E-UTRA [17], the 5G system shall support a mechanism to have an Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology on the USIM to be used for network selection. The signal threshold is specific for a certain Access Technology and shall apply to all PLMNs with the corresponding access technology combinations.\nNOTE 1: \tThe use of the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is intended for IoT stationary devices, without user interaction.\nNOTE 2:\tThe allowed range of the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is between the cell selection criterion and the high quality signal as defined in TS 23.122 [3].\nThe UE shall utilise all the information stored in the USIM related to network selection, e.g. HPLMN, Operator controlled PLMN Selector list, User Controlled PLMN Selector list, Forbidden PLMN list, Operator controlled signal threshold.\nNOTE:\tA PLMN in a Selector list, including HPLMN, may have multiple occurrences, with different access technology identifiers.\nThe UE shall ignore those PLMN + access technology entries in the User Controlled PLMN selector and Operator Controlled PLMN selector lists where the associated Access Technology is not supported by the UE. In the case that there are multiple associated Access Technology identifiers in an entry the UE shall not ignore the entry if it includes any associated Access Technology that is supported by the UE.\nIt shall be possible to handle cases where one network operator accepts access from access networks with different network IDs. It shall also be possible to indicate to the UE that a group of PLMNs are equivalent to the registered PLMN regarding PLMN selection, cell selection/re-selection and handover.\nIt shall be possible for the home network operator to identify alternative Network IDs as the HPLMN. It shall be possible for the home network operator to store in the USIM an indication to the UE that a group of PLMNs are treated as the HPLMN regarding PLMN selection. Any PLMN to be declared as an equivalent to the HPLMN shall be present within the EHPLMN list and is called an EHPLMN. The EHPLMN list replaces the HPLMN derived from the IMSI. When the EHPLMN list is present, any PLMN in this list shall be treated as the HPLMN in all the network and cell selection procedures.\nIf registration on a PLMN is successful, the UE shall indicate this PLMN (the \"registered PLMN\") and be capable of making and receiving calls on it. The identity of the registered PLMN shall be stored on the SIM/USIM. However, if registration is unsuccessful, the UE shall ensure that there is no registered PLMN stored in the SIM/USIM.\nIf a registration is unsuccessful because the IMSI is unknown in the home network, or the UE is illegal, then the UE shall not allow any further registration attempts on any network, until the UE is next powered-up or a SIM/USIM is inserted.\nIf the registration is unsuccessful due to the lack to service entitlement, specific behaviour by the UE may be required, see clause 3.2.2.4.\nTo avoid unnecessary registration attempts, lists of forbidden PLMNs, TAs and LAs are maintained in the UE, see clause 3.2.2.4 and 3GPP TS 23.122 [3].\nRegistration attempts shall not be made by UEs without a SIM/USIM inserted.\nAn UE/ME which has not successfully registered shall nevertheless be able to make emergency call attempts on an available PLMN (which supports the emergency call teleservice), without the need for the user to select a PLMN. An available PLMN is determined by radio characteristics (3GPP TS 23.122 [3]).\nIf the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is set on the USIM, it shall be used for the selection of the last registered PLMN (and/or EHPLMN/HPLMN) and for the automatic mode network selection steps described in this clause. In particular, if the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is set on the USIM, the UE shall only select a network if\n- \tthe network selection conditions as described below are met and\n-\tthe received signal quality of the candidate PLMN/access technology combination is equal to or higher than the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology.\nAt switch on, when in coverage of the last registered PLMN as stored in the SIM/USIM, the UE will attach to that network.\nAs an option, in automatic selection mode, when no EHPLMN list is present, the UE may select the HPLMN. When the EHPLMN list is present, the UE may select the highest priority EHPLMN among the available EHPLMNs. The operator shall be able to control the UE behaviour by USIM configuration.\nAs an option, if the UE is in manual network selection mode at switch-on\n-\tif the last registered PLMN is unavailable and no equivalent PLMN is available,\n-\tand the UE finds it is in coverage of either the HPLMN or an EHPLMN\nthen the UE should register on the corresponding HPLMN or EHPLMN. The UE remains in manual mode.\nIf the UE returns to coverage of the PLMN on which it is already registered (as indicated by the registered PLMN stored in the SIM/USIM), the UE shall perform a location update to a new location area if necessary. As an alternative option to this, if the UE is in automatic network selection mode and it finds coverage of the HPLMN or any EHPLMN, the UE may register on the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present) or the highest priority EHPLMN of the available EHPLMNs (if the EHPLMN list is present) and not return to the last registered PLMN. If the EHPLMN list is present and not empty, it shall be used. The operator shall be able to control by USIM configuration whether an UE that supports this option shall follow this alternative behaviour.\nNOTE:\tAt switch-on and at recovery from lack of coverage, a UE in automatic network selection mode can attempt registration once the RPLMN or, if the above option is applicable, the HPLMN or EHPLMN is found on an access technology.\nThe default behaviour for a UE is to select the last registered PLMN.\nIf there is no registered PLMN stored in the SIM/USIM, or if this PLMN is unavailable and no equivalent PLMN is available, or the attempted registration fails, the UE shall follow one of the following procedures for network selection:\nA)\tAutomatic network selection mode\nThe UE shall select and attempt registration on other PLMNs, if available and allowable, if the location area is not in the list of \"forbidden LAs for roaming\" and the tracking area is not in the list of \"forbidden TAs for roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [3]), in the following order:\ni)\tAn EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or the HPLMN (derived from the IMSI) if the EHPLMN list is not present for preferred access technologies in the order specified. In the case that there are multiple EHPLMNs present then the highest priority EHPLMN shall be selected.

It shall be possible to configure a voice capable UE so that it shall not attempt registration on a PLMN if all cells identified as belonging to the PLMN do not support the corresponding voice service.\nIn the case of a UE operating in UE operation mode A or B, an allowable PLMN is one which is not in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field in the SIM/USIM. This data field may be extended in the ME memory (see clause 3.2.2.4). In the case of a UE operating in UE operation mode C, an allowable PLMN is one which is not in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field in the SIM/USIM or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" in the ME.\nIf the UE uses the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology and no candidate PLMN/access technology combination fulfils the Operator controlled signal threshold criteria, the UE shall repeat the network selection without using the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology.\nIf there is no available PLMN except for PLMNs in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field in the SIM/USIM, and the available PLMNs indicate that Disaster Condition applies, this PLMN shall be considered allowable for registration to the UE while the Disaster Condition is applicable.\nIf successful registration is achieved, the UE shall indicate the selected PLMN.\nIf registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and at least one PLMN offering restricted local operator services has been found, the UE shall obtain user consent for restricted local operator services and the UE may use a list of preferred PLMNs for restricted local operator services stored in the ME. If none of the preferred PLMNs for restricted local operator services is available, the UE shall select any available PLMN offering restricted local operator services. If one of these PLMNs for restricted local operator service is chosen, the UE shall indicate the choice. If none are selected, the UE shall wait until a new PLMN is detected, or new location areas or tracking areas of an allowed PLMN are found which are not in the forbidden LA or TA list(s), and then repeat the procedure.\nIf registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and no PLMN offering restricted local operator services has been found, the UE shall indicate \"no service\" to the user, wait until a new PLMN is detected, or new location areas or tracking areas of an allowed PLMN are found which are not in the forbidden LA or TA list(s), and then repeat the procedure. When registration cannot be achieved, different (discontinuous) PLMN search schemes may be used in order to minimize the access time while maintaining battery life, e.g. by prioritising the search in favour of BCCH carriers which have a high probability of belonging to an available and allowable PLMN.\nB)\tManual network selection mode\nThe UE shall indicate PLMNs, including \"Forbidden PLMNs\", which are available. If there are none, this shall also be indicated. The HPLMN of the user may provide on the USIM additional information about the available PLMNs, if this is provided then the UE shall indicate that information to the user. This information, provided as free text may include:\n-\tPreferred partner,\n-\troaming agreement status,\n-\tsupported services\nFurthermore, the UE may indicate whether the available PLMNs are present on one of the PLMN selector lists (e.g. EHPLMN, User Controlled, Operator Controlled or Forbidden) as well as not being present on any of the lists.\nFor the purpose of presenting the names of the available PLMNs to the user, the ME shall use the USIM defined names if available or other PLMN naming rules in priority order as defined in 3GPP TS 22.101 [7] (Country/PLMN indication).\nAny available PLMNs shall be presented in the following order:\ni)\tHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present); or if one or more of the EHPLMNs are available then based on an optional data field on the USIM either the highest priority available EHPLMN is to be presented to the user or all available EHPLMNs are presented to the user in priority order; if the data field is not present, then only the highest priority available EHPLMN is presented;\nii)\tPLMNs contained in the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector\" data field in the SIM/USIM (in priority order);\niii)\tPLMNs contained in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector\" data field in the SIM/USIM (in priority order);\niv)\tother PLMN/access technology combinations with sufficient received signal level (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [3]) in random order;\nv)\tall other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing signal strength.\nIf a PLMN does not support voice services, then this shall be indicated to the user.\nThe user may select the desired PLMN and the UE shall attempt registration on this PLMN. (This may take place at any time during the presentation of PLMNs.)\nIf registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and at least one PLMN offering restricted local operator services has been found, the UE shall obtain user consent for restricted local operator services and offer the user to select one of these networks. If one of these networks is selected, the UE shall indicate the selected PLMN, wait until a new PLMN is detected, or new location areas or tracking areas of an allowed PLMN are found which are not in the forbidden LA or TA list(s), and then repeat the procedure.\nIf the registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and no PLMN offering restricted local operator services is selected, the UE shall indicate \"No Service\". The user may then select and attempt to register on another or the same PLMN following the above procedure. The UE shall not attempt to register on a PLMN which has not been selected by the user.\nOnce the UE has registered on a PLMN selected by the user, the UE shall not automatically register on a different PLMN unless:\ni)\tThe new PLMN is declared as an equivalent PLMN by the registered PLMN;\nor,\nii)\tThe user selects automatic mode.\nIf a PLMN is selected but the UE cannot register on it because registration is rejected with the cause \"PLMN not allowed\", the UE shall add the PLMN to the “Forbidden PLMN” list (clause 3.2.2.4.1). The UE shall not re-attempt to register on that network unless the same PLMN is selected again by the user.\nIf a PLMN is selected but the UE cannot register for PS services on it because registration is rejected with the cause \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\", the UE shall not re-attempt to register for E-UTRAN or UTRAN PS or GERAN PS on that network. The PLMN is added to the list \"Forbidden PLMN's for GPRS services\". The UE shall not re-attempt to register for E-UTRAN or UTRAN PS or GERAN PS on that network unless the same PLMN is selected again by the user. The reception of the cause \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\", does not affect the CS service.\nFor requirements to restrict the access of a UE to one or several specific RATs see section 7.1.\nIf a PLMN is selected but the UE cannot register on it for other reasons, the UE shall, upon detection of a new LA (not in a forbidden LA list) of the selected PLMN, attempt to register on the PLMN.\nIf the UE is registered on a PLMN but loses coverage, different (discontinuous) carrier search schemes may be used to minimize the time to find a new valid BCCH carrier and maintain battery life, e.g. by prioritizing the search in favour of BCCH carriers of the registered PLMN.\nAt any time, the user may request the UE to initiate reselection and registration onto an alternative available PLMN, according to the following procedures, dependent upon the operating mode.\nA)\tAutomatic Network Selection Mode\nThe UE shall follow the procedure defined in clause 3.2.2.2.A) above, including the use of Operator signal threshold per access technology, if set on the USIM, as described in 3.2.2.2.\nB)\tManual Network Selection Mode\nThe procedure of 3.2.2.2 B) is followed.\nDifferent types of UE behaviour are required to support, for example, national roaming, regionally provided service and temporary international roaming restrictions. The behaviour to be followed by the UE is indicated by the network.\nWhen a registration attempt by the UE is rejected by a network with an indication of \"permanent\" PLMN restriction, the PLMN identity shall be written to a list of \"Forbidden PLMNs\" stored in a data field in the SIM/USIM.\nIf a successful registration is achieved on a PLMN in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" list, the PLMN shall be deleted from the list. However, if successful registration is achieved on a PLMN in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" list while Disaster Condition applies, the PLMN shall not be deleted from \"Forbidden PLMN\" list.\nWhen in automatic mode, the UE may indicate any PLMNs which will not be selected due to their presence in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" list.\nIf a UE receives an equivalent PLMN list containing a PLMN which is included in the “Forbidden PLMN” list, this PLMN shall be removed from the equivalent PLMN list before this is stored by the UE.\nWhen a registration attempt by the UE is rejected by a network due to a \"partial\" or a \"temporary\" PLMN restriction, the UE shall perform one of the following procedures determined by the indication in the location update reject cause sent by the network (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [3]):\ni)\tThe UE shall store the tracking area identity or location area identity in the list of \"5GS forbidden TA, forbidden TAs or forbidden LAs for regional provision of service\" respectively and shall enter the limited service state. The UE shall remain in that state until it moves to a cell in a location area where service is allowed.\nii)\tThe UE shall store the tracking area identity or the location area identity in the list of \"5GS forbidden TA, forbidden TAs or forbidden LAs for roaming\" respectively and shall use one of the following procedures according to the PLMN selection Mode:\nA)\tAutomatic network selection mode:\nThe procedure of 3.2.2.2. A).\nB)\tManual network selection mode:\nThe procedure of 3.2.2.2.B).\niii)\tThe UE shall store the tracking area identity or location area identity in the list of \"5GS forbidden TA, forbidden TAs or forbidden LAs for roaming\" respectively and shall search for a suitable cell in the same PLMN.\nNOTE:\tA suitable cell will belong to a different TA or LA which is not in the \"forbidden TAs or LAs for roaming\". When a TA supports multiple systems (e.g. 5GS and EPS), a cell of the TA may be a suitable cell for one system while the cell is not a suitable cell for other systems..\nWhen a registration attempt for PS services by the UE is rejected by the network with the cause \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\", the PLMN identity shall be written to a list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" in the ME. This list is deleted when the UE is switched off or when the SIM/USIM is removed; the maximum number of possible entries in this list is implementation dependent, but must be at least one entry (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [3]).\nIf a successful registration is achieved on a PLMN in the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" list, the PLMN shall be deleted from the list.\nIf the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is not set on the USIM, a UE in Automatic Mode shall make periodic attempts to look for a higher priority PLMN including associated Access Technology of the same country as the currently received PLMN including associated Access Technology or for a higher priority PLMN including associated Access Technology that uses a Shared MCC (e.g. MCC=901). If the currently received PLMN including associated Access Technology uses a Shared MCC, also a higher priority PLMN including associated Access Technology using any non-Shared MCC shall be considered. For the ranking of PLMNs the UE shall use the order used in clause 3.2.2.2. In the case that there is no associated Access Technology identifier, the mobile shall assume that all Access Technologies provided by a PLMN are of equal priority. Moreover, periodic network selection shall not lead to change of access technology within the registered PLMN.\nWhen a Disaster Condition is applicable, a UE in Automatic Mode that is registered to a PLMN in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field in the SIM/USIM may make periodic attempts to look for an allowable PLMN of the same country as the currently received PLMN.\nIn the case that the UE has stored a list of equivalent PLMNs, the UE shall only select a PLMN if it has a higher priority than all the PLMNs, in the list of equivalent PLMNs, which are of the same country as the currently registered PLMN.\nNOTE 1: \tIn the context of this 3GPP TS, the term country is to be interpreted not as a political entity but as a single Mobile Country Code (MCC). For example the USA and India have multiple MCC. Such cases are in fact treated as exceptions in the 3GPP specifications. For all other countries, multiple MCCs may be used, however the specifications have not taken this into account and there could be adverse effects such as the UE being unable to detect that multiple MCCs are within the same country.\nNOTE 2:\tThere are some situations where one MCC represents multiple political entities or where an MCC is independent of political entities. Examples include Shared MCCs, where international satellite operations typically use the Shared MCC with value 901.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the purposes of PLMN selection, the associated Access Technology using a Shared MCC is restricted to the satellite NG-RAN.\nIn the case that there are multiple EHPLMNs available, the UE shall not attempt to select a higher priority EHPLMN when an EHPLMN has already been selected. The priorities of EHPLMNs are only applicable when the UE is on a VPLMN and multiple EHPLMNs are available.\nThe UE shall only make reselection attempts while in idle mode. In case of GPRS terminals, the UE shall only make reselection attempts while in Idle or Stand-by mode. In case of terminals operating E-UTRA and/or NR, the UE shall only make reselection attempts while in Idle or RRC-Inactive mode.\nIn the case of a UE receiving an eMBMS transport service when in idle mode, the UE may postpone the higher priority PLMN search and any reselection attempt until the eMBMS transport service has finished or been stopped.\nThe interval between attempts shall be stored in the SIM/USIM.\nOnly the service provider shall be able to select for which of the previous situations, periodic network selection shall be attempted and to set the interval value.\nFor UEs supporting only Access Technologies other than the following: NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT and Category M1 [17] of E-UTRAN enhanced-MTC the UE shall interpret the interval value to be between 6 minutes and 8 hours, with a step size of 6 minutes.\nFor UEs only supporting any of the following, or a combination of, NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT [18], and Category M1[13] of E-UTRAN enhanced-MTC, the UE shall interpret the interval value to be between 2 and 240 hours, with a step size of 2 hours between 2 and 80 hours and a step size of 4 hours between 80 and 240 hours.\nFor UEs supporting a combination of IoT and non-IoT Access Technologies the UE shall interpret the interval value to determine the timer value as above based on the Access Technology currently in use by the UE.\nOne interval value shall be designated to indicate that no periodic attempts shall be made.\nIn the absence of a permitted value in the SIM/USIM, or the SIM/USIM is phase 1 and therefore does not contain the datafield, then a default value of 60 minutes, shall be used by the UE except for those UEs only supporting any of the following, or a combination of: NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT [18], and Category M1 [17] of E-UTRAN enhanced-MTC. For those UEs a default value of 72 hours shall be used.\nNOTE 4:\tUse of values less than 60 minutes may result in excessive UE battery drain.\nPeriodic network selection based on Operator controlled signal threshold criteria\nIf the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is set on the USIM, the UE shall perform the periodic network selection procedure considering all PLMNs, of higher or lower priority than the current PLMN, in the same order as in clause 3.2.2.2, with the following conditions:\n-\tthe UE shall select a higher priority PLMN/access technology combination if the target PLMN’s access technology signal quality is equal to or higher than the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology.\n-\tthe UE shall select a lower priority PLMN/access technology combination only if the RPLMN’s access technology signal quality is lower than the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology, and the target PLMN’s access technology signal quality is equal or higher than the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology.\nNOTE 5:\tThe UE does not perform the periodic attempts if the RPLMN is a HPLMN or EHPLMN, and the RPLMN’s access technology signal quality is equal or higher than the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology.\nIf no PLMN, including the RPLMN, fulfils the Operator controlled signal threshold criteria, the UE shall perform the normal periodic network selection for higher priority PLMNs (as described above), without applying the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology.\nThe operator shall be able to control by SIM/USIM configuration whether a UE that is capable shall perform an investigation scan. This investigation scan shall be performed after each successful PLMN selection as well as during limited service state. The investigation scan shall search for a higher prioritised PLMN that does not offer CS voice service. If such a PLMN is available, the user shall be informed. This enables the user to switch to such a PLMN using manual selection if the user so prefers. The investigation scan shall not be performed when no SIM/USIM is inserted.\nSteering to a specific VPLMN\nIt shall be possible for the HPLMN at any time to direct a UE, that is in automatic mode, to search for a specific VPLMN and, if it is available, move to that VPLMN as soon as possible. This VPLMN shall then be regarded as the highest priority VPLMN as defined by the operator, though any EHPLMN or PLMN on the User Controlled PLMN list shall have higher priority. This process shall be done transparently and without inconvenience to the user.\nIf the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology is set on the USIM, the UE shall only select the VPLMN if the signal quality is equal to or higher than the Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology, otherwise the steering request shall be ignored.\nIf the UE is in manual mode, the steering request shall be ignored.\nIf the UE is registered on a VPLMN that is present on the User Controlled PLMN List, the steering request shall be ignored. PLMNs contained on the User Controlled PLMN List shall have priority over the steered-to-PLMN.\nThe UE shall attempt to register on the specified VPLMN even if the specified VPLMN is present on a Forbidden List.\nThis mechanism shall be available to the HPLMN even if the VPLMN the UE is registered on is compliant to an earlier release of the 3GPP specifications.\nVPLMN Redirection\nIt shall be possible for the HPLMN to request a UE, that is in automatic mode, to find and register on a different VPLMN from the one it is currently using or trying to register on, if another VPLMN, that is not in a Forbidden List, is available. The original VPLMN shall then be treated as the lowest priority VPLMN and would not be selected by the UE unless it is the only one available to the UE or has been selected in manual mode. This process shall be done transparently and without inconvenience to the user.\nIf the UE is in manual mode, the redirection request shall be ignored.\nIf the UE is registered on a VPLMN that is present on the User Controlled PLMN List, the redirection request shall be ignored.\nThis mechanism shall be available to the HPLMN even if the VPLMN the UE is registered on is compliant to an earlier release of the 3GPP specifications.\n",

It is not possible to foresee all possible configurations and provide a detailed technical specification for network and system selection for all possible multi-mode terminal configurations. The following provides the generic requirements for network and system selection for Multi-mode terminals with 3GPP Capability. These requirements are mandatory for a 3GPP capable multi-mode terminal, unless otherwise is explicitly specified elsewhere in the 3GPP Technical Specifications.\n-\ta multi-mode terminal, when in 3GPP mode of operation shall be compliant to the 3GPP specifications, including PLMN selection, cell selection and re-selection, paging reception etc.,\n-\tAs consequence, the multi-mode terminal when entering 3GPP mode of operation shall act as if it were a 3GPP only UE which had just been switched-on. Similarly, when leaving the 3GPP mode of operation the multimode terminal shall act as if it were a 3GPP only UE which had just been switched-off\nWhen the multimode terminal is in 3GPP mode, the switching between modes in the multi-mode terminal is considered an overlay functionality selecting mode of operation. For the design of the overlay functionality the following requirements shall be fulfilled:\n-\tThe overlay functionality shall include a mechanism to avoid ping-pong between systems, e.g., a timer or hysteresis function\n-\tThe overlay functionality shall not include network priority mechanisms, which conflict with the network priority mechanisms specified in 3GPP specifications, e.g., the Periodic network selection attempts scanning within 3GPP based systems for PLMNs of higher priority than the current serving PLMN.\n-\tAny functionality in the overlay system, such as background scan of other systems, shall not impact the fulfilment of 3GPP protocol requirements (in particular in regard to paging, cell selection, cell re-selection and PLMN selection)\n-\tAs specified in this technical specification, the 3GPP technical specification provides the capability for the user to set their own 3GPP PLMN selection preferences; as well as the user can manually select any 3GPP PLMN. This has been done to ensure a fair competition environment. These principles shall be maintained in the design of the overlay functionality.\n",

Additionally, in the case of the access network being UTRAN the serving network can indicate that UEs are allowed to respond to paging and perform location registration (see, sec 3.1), even if their access class is not permitted. Otherwise access attempts are not allowed. Also, the serving network can indicate that UEs are restricted to perform location registration, although common access is permitted. If the UE responded to paging it shall follow the normal defined procedures and react as specified to any network command.\nNOTE: The network operator can take the network load into account when allowing UEs access to the network.\nAccess Classes are applicable as follows:\nClasses 0 - 9\t\t\t-\tHome and Visited PLMNs;\nClasses 11 and 15\t-\tHome PLMN only if the EHPLMN list is not present or any EHPLMN;\nClasses 12, 13, 14\t-\tHome PLMN and visited PLMNs of home country only.

The ‘mean duration of access control’ and the barring rate are broadcasted for each type of access attempt (i.e. mobile originating data or mobile originating signalling).\n- \tThe UE determines the barring status with the information provided from the serving network, and perform the access attempt accordingly. The UE draws a uniform random number between 0 and 1 when initiating connection establishment and compares with the current barring rate to determine whether it is barred or not. When the uniform random number is less than the current barring rate and the type of access attempt is indicated allowed, then the access attempt is allowed; otherwise, the access attempt is not allowed.

This feature is optional.\nThe following requirements apply:\n-\tThis feature shall be applicable to UTRAN PS Domain and E-UTRAN.\n-\tThis feature shall be applicable to UEs in idle mode only that are not a member of one or more of Access Classes 11 to 15.\n-\tACDC shall not apply to MMTEL voice, MMTEL video, SMS over IMS (SMS over IP) emergency call and paging response.\nNOTE:\tEven if any of the above services are initiated by application, ACDC does not apply, but they are\tsubject to other applicable access control methods.\n-\tThe home network shall be able to configure a UE with at least four and a maximum of sixteen ACDC categories to each of which particular, operator-identified applications are associated. The categories shall be ordered as specified in sub-clause 4.3.5.2.2.\nNOTE:\tProvisioning of the ACDC categories in the UE is the responsibility of the home network, and the categorization is outside the scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE:\tA mechanism needs to be provided that enables the UE to verify that the provisioning of the configuration originates from a trusted source.\n-\tThe serving network shall be able to broadcast, in one or more areas of the RAN, control information, indicating barring information per each ACDC category, and whether a roaming UE shall be subject to ACDC control.\nNOTE: \tThe barring information may be similar to ACB information, and include mean durations of access control (i.e., barring timer) and barring rates (i.e., percentage value). If the barring timer is running due to a previous access attempt from an application in a certain given matched ACDC category, the UE may only allow access attempts from applications in higher ACDC categories (according to the corresponding barring information for those higher categories). If the barring timer is running due to a previous access attempt from an application in a certain given unmatched ACDC category or a uncategorised application, the UE may only allow access attempts from applications in higher ACDC categories than the lowest ACDC category broadcast (according to the corresponding barring information for those higher categories).\n-\tThe UE shall be able to control whether or not an access attempt for a certain application is allowed, based on this broadcast barring information and the configuration of ACDC categories in the UE.\n-\tThe serving network shall be able to simultaneously indicate ACDC with other forms of access control.\n-\tWhen both ACDC and ACB controls are indicated, ACDC shall override ACB.\n- \tIf a UE is configured for both EAB and ACDC, and the serving network simultaneously broadcasts EAB information and ACDC barring information:\n-\tIf the UE determines as specified in sub-clause 4.3.4.1 that access to the network is not barred or as specified in sub-clause 4.3.4.2 that it is permitted to override an EAB restriction, then access to the network is subject to ACDC.\n-\tIf the UE determines as specified in sub-clause 4.3.4.1 that access to the network is barred and as specified in sub-clause 4.3.4.2 that it is not permitted to override the EAB restriction, then access to the network is barred.\n-\tIn the case of multiple core networks sharing the same access network, the access network shall be able to apply ACDC for the different core networks individually. For the mitigation of congestion in a shared RAN, barring rates should be set equal for all Participating Operators.\nWhen configuring the UE with categories of applications, the home network shall proceed as follows:\n-\tApplications whose use is expected to be restricted the least shall be assigned the highest ACDC category; and\n-\tApplications whose use is expected to be restricted more than applications in the highest category shall be assigned the second-to-highest ACDC category, and so on; and\n-\tApplications whose use is expected to be restricted the most shall either be assigned the lowest ACDC category, or not be categorised at all.\nFor a UE with ACDC categories configured, the applications on the UE that are not assigned to any ACDC category shall be treated by the UE as part of the lowest ACDC category broadcast by the serving network. If the operator requires differentiation with respect to these uncategorized applications, the operator should avoid assigning applications to the lowest ACDC category. When applying ACDC, the serving network broadcasts barring information starting from the highest to the lowest ACDC category. The home network and the serving network may use different categorisation. The serving network decides if ACDC applies to roaming UEs.\nThe number of ACDC categories in the UE may not be the same as the number of ACDC categories broadcast by the serving network. This may happen, e.g. when the UE is roaming and the number of categories broadcast by the serving network is different from the home network. Therefore, the following rules shall apply:\n-\tIf the serving network broadcasts more ACDC categories than the UE's configuration, the UE shall use barring information for the matching ACDC category and shall bar uncategorised applications using the barring information for the lowest category broadcast by the serving network, and shall ignore barring information for unmatched categories.\n-\tIf the serving network broadcasts barring information for fewer ACDC categories than the UE's configuration, the UE shall use barring information for the matching ACDC category and shall bar other applications using the barring information for the lowest category broadcast by the serving network.\nNOTE:\tA matching ACDC category is an ACDC category for which barring information is broadcast by the serving network and that has the same rank as the rank of a configured ACDC category in the UE. An unmatched ACDC category is either an ACDC category for which barring information is broadcast by the serving network but with no corresponding ACDC category configured in the UE, or an ACDC category configured in the UE but with no corresponding barring information broadcast by the serving network.\n",
