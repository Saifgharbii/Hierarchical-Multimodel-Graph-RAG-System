To promote 5G service, the subscription data of UE may be set to 5G access first, i.e. the subscribed RFSP Index is of the value of \"5G has higher priority than 4G\". In some scenarios, the PCF may adjust the RFSP index to direct the UE from 5G to 4G according to dynamic network situations, for example:\n-\tWhen network congestion prediction received from NWDAF, the PCF may move some of the \"5G prioritized\" UEs which consuming low value applications to 4G access.\n-\tAccording to the request from AF, the PCF may move the requested UE(s) from 5G to 4G.\nWhen UE registers to EPC, the MME chooses the RFSP Index in use based on the subscribed RFSP Index, the locally configured operator's policies and the UE related context information available at the MME. If the EPC decides the UE needs to go back to 5G, the MME provides \"5G prioritized\" RFSP Index to eNB.\nTo avoid network issue, e.g. the ping-pong issue, where the 5GC keeps sending the UE to EPC based on authorized RFSP Index from PCF, while the MME only has the subscribed RFSP Index and kick the UE in the above scenarios back to 5G immediately, this key issue will study AM policy control on RFSP Index consistency when UE moves from 5GC to EPC:\n-\tWhether the current interworking procedure supports MME received the RFSP Index in use from 5GC?

                            "text_content": "This solution is to allow MME to receive RFSP Index update from PCF when UE moves from 5G to 4G in N26-based interworking architecture. When MME is able to receive updated RFSP index from PCF as AMF, the RFSP index in use will be consistent when UE moves between 5G and 4G. This is a solution for N26-based interworking.\nWhen N26-based interworking architecture applies, AMF and MME use N26 interface to transfer mobility management message. The parameters, subscribed RFSP index and RFSP index in use, are transferred in:\n-\tForward Relocation Request as in 5GS to EPS handover procedures using N26 interface, or\n-\tContext Response as in 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface.\nTherefore, this solution proposes that, when UE moves from 5G to 4G, the old AMF should keep or defer to terminate the AM association of the UE within a reasonable period, i.e. AM Policy Association maintenance timer. When the PCF is triggered to update the RFSP Index, the updated RFSP index is delivered to the old AMF in the existing AM Policy association, and the AMF will transfer it to new MME use the N26 interface in a GTPv2 message.\nFor example, a UE may have subscribed RFSP Index of 5G prioritization in subscription data stored in HSS/UDM.\nIf a UE initially attaches to 5GC with AM Policy association established:\n1.\tIf something triggers the PCF to change the RFSP Index as of 4G prioritization, the UE will moves from 5GC to EPC. In handover or idle mode mobility procedure, the old AMF sends the PCF-updated RFSP Index, i.e. the RFSP Index in use, to the new MME using N26 interface.\n2.\tWith the received RFSP Index in use, the new MME may, as local logic, ignore the subscribed RFSP Index and keep the RFSP index in use as 4G prioritization. The UE will stay in 4G and will not be send right back to 5G as the subscribed RFSP Index as 5G prioritization. The old AMF may keep the established AM association or defer the AM policy association termination for the UE to receive further update on RFSP Index update from PCF, just as the old AMF will keep UE context for some time after the UE deregister. The duration value of this timer should be pre-configured at the AMF. And the AMF should subscribe to HSS/UDM for UE's serving MME update notification in case the UE moves further to another MME.\n3.\tLater but before the AM Policy Association maintenance timer runs out, based on some trigger, the PCF may update UE's RFSP index in order to direct the UE back from EPC to 5GC. The update RFSP index is deliver to the old AMF. Then the old AMF transfers it to the serving MME the UE register to through N26 interface. Then the serving MME updates the RFSP index in use and triggers the UE move back to 5G using current mechanism.\n4.\tWhen the AM Policy Association maintenance timer runs out, the old AMF initiates the AM Policy Association termination and unsubscribe to the HSS/UDM for further change on serving MME. This should be no later than the old AMF to release the UE context.\n5.\tAs AM Policy Association maintenance timer running in the old AMF, an equal timer should runs in the serving MME. The initial value of the timer may be pre-configured at the MME and no less than the value of the AM policy Association maintenance timer at the AMF. When the MME aware that the timer runs out, the MME will be free to select the RFSP Index in use, e.g. the subscription value, as in current specification. Also, when handover happens between MMEs, the remaining value of the timer should also be transfer as UE context.\nIf a UE initially attaches to EPC, or the AM policy association is invalid, that is, no exist AM policy association in PCF for that UE, the MME may update UE's RFSP Index according to current mechanism. The MME may decide to direct UE to 5GC by changing the RFSP Index. In some cases, when the EPS to 5GS procedure is complete and soon after a new AM association is established, the PCF may decides the UE should be in 4G. Then the EPS to 5GS procedure as described above may take place. With the proposed mechanism, the PCF selected RFSP Index will take over and the UE will not ping-pong between 4G and 5G.\n",

The change is: the AMF, where the UE originally register to, will not initiate the AM Policy Association termination procedure with the PCF when it received the Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification from HSS/UDM as in clause 4.11.1.5.3 of TS 23.502 [3] (TAU of handover) nor clause 4.11.1.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3] (Idle mode mobility). But the AM Policy Association maintenance timer starts to run in AMF when the Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification receives. A timer also start to runs in target MME1 to indicate it should wait for further input from AMF on RFSP Index update.\nStep 3, the old AMF subscribes to HSS/UDM for the notification in case of UE S1-handover happens to insure the old AMF always know the serving MME of the UE.\nStep 4 and Step 5, the PCF is trigger to update the RFSP Index and notify to the old AMF according to current description in TS 23.503 [4].\nStep 6 and Step 7 are the proposed new mobility management messages using N26 interface, in which the AMF transfer the updated RFSP index to MME1 and MME1 reply with an acknowledgement.\nIf before the AM policy association maintenance timer runs out, S1-handover or TAU happens in EPC:\nStep 8, the UE deregisters from MME1 and register to MME2 in EPC and the remaining of the timer is transfer from MM1 to MM2 as part of UE context.\nStep 9, HSS/UDM notifies the old AMF with MME2. The RFSP index in use will be sent from MME1 to MME2 as in current specification.\nFor further RFSP Index update from PCF as in step 4, the old AMF transfer the updated RFSP index to MM2 as in step 5, 6 and 7.\nWhen the AM Policy Association maintenance timer runs out, the AMF initiates the AM Policy Association termination as in TS 23.502 [3] and unsubscribe to HSS/UDM for further serving MME change notification. When the timer at the MME runs out, the MME could reselect an RFSP Index value as defined in current specification.\nOr, if the AMF receives from HSS/UDM that the UE is not registered to any MME, i.e. deregistered from EPC, the AMF should initiates the AM Policy Association termination before the timer runs out.\n",

The parameters, subscribed RFSP index and RFSP index in use, are transferred in:\n-\tForward Relocation Request as in 5GS to EPS handover procedures using N26 interface, or\n-\tContext Response as in 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface.\n\n\nDuring UE registration in 5GC, the AMF may report to the PCF the subscribed RFSP Index received from the UDM for further evaluation as described in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 23.503 [4]. When receiving the \"authorized RFSP Index\" from the PCF, the AMF replaces the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" with the \"authorized RFSP Index\" as specified in clause 5.3.4.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. So the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" stored in the UE context in AMF may be different than the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" received from the UDM as the AMF may replace the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" with the \"authorized RFSP Index\" received from the PCF.\nTherefore, this solution proposes that, when UE moves from 5G to 4G, the MME shall compare the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" received from the AMF (which could be the \"Authorized RFSP Index\" provided by the PCF) with the \"RFSP Index\" received from the HSS. If they are different, the MME shall store the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" received from AMF in a new IE \"5GC Authorized RFSP Index\" and store the RFSP Index received from the HSS in \"subscribed RFSP Index\".\nThe difference in \"5GC Authorized RFSP Index\" and \"subscribed RFSP Index\" is an indication to the MME that 5GC has dynamically assigned an RFSP Index to the UE and the MME shall, based on operator's policies, ignore the RFSP Index received from the HSS e.g. for a configured duration. This policy/duration could be operator determined e.g.:\n-\t\"5GC Authorized RFSP Index\" is used only for the current registration in the MME and is not used when the UE moves to another MME due to mobility.\n-\t\"5GC Authorized RFSP Index\" is used only for a configured duration (e.g. T). When the UE moves to another MME due to mobility (e.g. after a period \"t\"), the source MME then provides the remaining duration (i.e. T-t) for which \"5GC Authorized RFSP Index\" shall be used by the destination MME.\n-\tOr it could be a combination of both of the above.\nWhen the configured duration is reached, the MME may remove the \"5GC Authorized RFSP Index\" from its context for the UE and start using the \"subscribed RFSP Index\" that was received from the HSS.\n",

Besides, when the PCF provides modified/authorized RFSP Index (e.g. based on network congestion analytics), PCF has the knowledge how long the congestion may last, therefore it should be the PCF (but not the EPC/MME) that determines the validity time, as the EPC/MME does not have the necessary information.\nThere are following solutions addressing the deployment scenario without N26 interface:\nSol#2, Sol#4, Sol#5, Sol#7, Sol#8, Sol#9.\nAmong the above solutions, except Sol#8, the other solutions propose to involve UDM+HSS either by modifying the existing Subscribed RFSP Index in HSS or add new parameter (either \"Authorized RFSP Index\" or \"RFSP Index in use\" for MME to use.\nTable 7.1.1-1 below list the comparison in the following aspects:\n#1\tPCF or AMF notifies or provisions UDM of the RFSP Index chosen by the AMF?\n#2\tWhich NF determines the validity time?\n#3\tIs a new parameter introduced in the subscription data provided by HSS?

If no, what enhancements is needed.\nFor N26-based interworking: (Solution #1, #3, #6 and #10) the current specification already supports the RFSP Index in use transferred to MME in UE context during handover/TAU.\nIf there is any enhanced information, it should also be transferred via N26.\nQ2:\tIf the MME get the RFSP Index in used in handover procedure or idle mode mobility procedure, how and when it resumes to the subscription RFSP Index.\n-\t(Solution #1 and #6) The PCF for a UE maintains the AM Policy Association when UE move from 5G to 4G and updates the authorized RFSP Index according to triggers and conditions defined in current specification. The MME re-selects the RFSP Index in use considering the dynamic input from PCF at the cost of network overhead and extra procedures.\n-\tWhen MME realizes a UE is moving from 5GC, it starts a timer within which value of the RFSP Index in use will not be changed. When the timer expires, the MME will be free to re-select the RFSP Index in use according to current method. The value of this timer may be set to:\n-\t(Solution #10) A local value preconfigured in MME, which is same to all UE and not adjustable.\n-\t(Solution #3) A value selected by PCF when it generates an authorized RFSP Index value indicating the UE to move from 5G to 4G. So the timer is per UE from 5G and not adjustable after the UE in 4G. PCF can decide that timer based on information, e.g. from UDR or NWDAF. If the AMF modifies the authorized RFSP Index from PCF, i.e. the AMF selects a different value of RFSP Index in use, whether the timer value from PCF should still be sent to MME is clarified in S2-2205525 (ongoing discussion).\nConsidering the trade-off of system impact and flexibility, the PCF-selected timer seems to solve the problem in a more agreeable way. Preconfigured timer in MME can implementation specific without standardization as such timer will apply to EPS to 5GS mobility scenario not targeted in the KI.\nQ3:\tWhen UE is under EPC, should MME receive any update of RFSP Index from 5GC and how.\n-\t(Solution #1 and #6) Yes. The PCF is able to update the RFSP Index In Use or the timer according to, e.g. AF's influence request. And MME is able to change the RFSP Index in use in a timely manner.\n-\t(Solution #3 and #10) No. The MME is able to re-select the RFSP Index only after the validity time provided by the AMF (decided by PCF) expires.\nThe evaluation of Q2 also applies to Q3.\n",

When the PCF for a UE provides the Authorized RFSP Index indicating the UE to move to 4G, it may also provide the value of \"RFSPinUseExpiryTime\". If the AMF selects the RFSP Index in use identical to the authorized RFSP Index, it should store the received \"RFSPinUseExpiryTime\" in UE context in AMF and further also send the received \"RFSPinUseExpiryTime\" to MME in UE context along with the \"RFSP Index in use\" when N26 interface applied.\n-\tWhen mobility happens between MMEs before the \"RFSPinUseExpiryTime\" expires, the remaining value of the \"RFSPinUseExpiryTime\" should also be sent to the new MME. The new MME handles RFSP Index in the same way as for mobility from the AMF to the MME as described above.\n-\tWhen a UE is served by the EPC, there is no use case or requirement to provide updated RFSP Index from 5GC to the EPC.\n\n\n",
