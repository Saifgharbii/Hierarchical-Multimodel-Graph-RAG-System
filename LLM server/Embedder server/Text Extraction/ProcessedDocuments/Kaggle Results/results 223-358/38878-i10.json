The process of selecting paired UEs is called ‘pairing’. As illustrated in Figure 4.1.1-1, UE1 and UE2 are paired and gNB transmits data to both UEs with suitable precoders through the same time-frequency resources. However, the gNB cannot guarantee the perfect pairing of multiple users in the real network. The paired UEs may not perfectly spatially orthogonal to each other and this will induce the intra-cell interference between paired UEs.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with a multi-path signal propagation, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. The figure includes key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 4.1.1-1. gNB transmit data to paired UE1 and UE2 with the same time-frequency resources\nTo evaluate the performance of UE with intra-cell interference induced by spatial multiplexing, the following scenarios illustrated from Figure 4.1.1-2 to Figure 4.1.1-3 are considered for the case of number of paired UEs is 2. Moreover, scenario illustrated in Figure 4.1.1-4 is considered for the case of number of paired UEs is 3.\n-\tTarget UE with single DMRS antenna port:\n-\tScenario 1: Number of CDM group without data is 1\n-\tAP1000 for target UE, AP1001 for interference UE\n-\tTarget UE with two DMRS antenna ports:\n-\tScenario 2: Number of CDM group without data is 2\n-\tAP1000 and 1001 for target UE, AP1002 and 1003 for interference UE\n-\tTarget UE with single DMRS antenna port:\n-\tScenario 3: Number of CDM group without data is 1\n-\tAP1000 for target UE, AP1001 for 2 interference UEs with different frequency domain allocation.\nIn this scenario, there are two CDM groups without data, and an AP1000 for the target UE, while an AP1001 is used for interference.\nFigure 4.1.1-2: Scenario 1, number of CDM group without data is 1 and AP1000 for target UE, AP1001 for interference UE\nIn this scenario, there are two CDM groups without data, with AP1000 and 1001 for the target UE, and AP1002 and 1003 for the interference UE. The APs are configured to forward traffic to the target UE, while the APs in the interference group are configured to forward traffic to the interference UE. This configuration ensures that the target UE receives the necessary data and the interference UE receives the necessary information.\nFigure 4.1.1-3: Scenario 2, number of CDM group without data is 2 and AP1000 and 1001 for target UE, AP1002 and 1003 for interference UE\nIn this scenario, there are three CDM groups without data, with AP1000 for the target UE, AP1001 for two interference UEs with different frequency domain allocation.\nFigure 4.1.1-4: Scenario 3, number of CDM group without data is 1 and AP1000 for target UE, AP1001 for 2 interference UEs with different frequency domain allocation\n",

The DMRS sequences of paired UEs are assumed to be known for channel estimation purposes for all paired UEs. Note that the DMRS scrambling sequences of paired UEs are assumed to be the same to guarantee orthogonality.\nThe PDSCH and DMRS of the paired UEs are precoded prior to transmission. The precoder for each user is denoted by  and  respectively.\nIn the scope of this technical report is the precoder matrix of ith UE, of size NTX x NLi from Type I single panel codebook as described in [3GPP TS 38.214]. Where, NTX is the number of TX antenna, NLi is the number of layers from ith UE. The combined precoder , of size NTX x NL where, NL is the total number layers across all users. In general, other codebooks are also valid for MU-MIMO scenarios with advanced receiver.\nThe precoder of the target UE  is randomly selected. For the co-scheduled UE, the precoder  is selected in one of the two ways below.\n-\tOrthogonal precoder:  is randomly selected from the codebook with a constraint that the combined precoder W has orthogonal columns, i.e., the off-diagonal entries of WHW are zero.\n-\tRandom precoder:  is randomly selected from the codebook ensuring any column of  is not identical to any column of\nTo maintain the average per UE signal power as NLi /NL, an additional scaling is applied to the each precoder as:\n\n\n",

            "description": "This technical report has documented the RAN4 evaluation on techniques to cancel downlink intra cell inter-user interference. The major work includes the determination of network scenario, interference modelling, interference suppressing receiver structure, required information analysis for each candidate receiver, link-level simulation parameters and performance evaluations.\nMU-MIMO scenario with gNB transmits PDSCH to the paired UEs through the same time-frequency resources is evaluated.\ngNBs equipped with 2Tx and 4Tx antennas are considered in the RAN4 performance evaluation. However, for the UEs capable of inter-user interference suppression ability discussed in this TR, they can also be used in the deployments with larger number of Tx ports configuration. For the interference suppressing receiver, both E-MMSE-IRC and R-ML are evaluated as candidate advanced receivers.\nRAN4 reaches consensus on the required information for both E-IRC and R-ML receiver. In addition, RAN4 has agreed the network default configuration assumptions. Therefore, the advanced receiving algorithm can be performed under these default assumptions. For some of the default assumptions, it is required for the network to indicate the UE whether the default assumption is valid or not by RRC signalling. For UE with R-ML receiver, DCI based network assistant signalling is required.\nPDSCH link-level simulations are performed to evaluate the performance gain of the candidate E-IRC and R-ML receiver over the baseline MMSE-IRC receiver under intra-cell inter-user interference scenario. 16 simulation cases that covers the advanced receiver with genie-aided required information, with co-scheduled UE DMRS port and FDRA information blind detection, and with co-scheduled UE modulation order blind detection (for R-ML receiver only), are selected for the evaluation. Different antenna and rank configurations for target and interference UEs, different propagation condition, and CBW configurations are included.\nBased on the simulation results, the performance gain of R-ML receiver over the baseline MMSE-IRC receiver is verified.\nBased on the above evaluations, it is recommended to select R-ML as the new advanced receiver for inter-user interference suppression receiver for MU-MIMO scenario in Rel-18, and to introduce necessary new UE capability and network assistant signalling for the selected receiver.\nIt is also recommended to define NR PDSCH demodulation requirements for the selected inter-user interference suppression receiver for MU-MIMO scenario in Rel-18.\n\n\n",
