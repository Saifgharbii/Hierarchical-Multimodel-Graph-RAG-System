This may affect services, e.g. regulatory services, tariff notifications, and etc. that rely on cell ID/TAC as location reference. Therefore, this key issue needs to address:\n-\tHow to provide appropriate cell ID/TACs information (and possible its corresponding geographic area) of mobile base station relay that moves when such cell ID/TACs are needed, e.g. to assist route an emergency call to the correct PSAP, to assist to handle Lawful Interception, to assist the Public Warning System, etc.\nNOTE 1:\tFor mobile base station relay that moves, whether its cell information in the System Information Broadcast (e.g. Cell ID, TAC) changes or not due to its movement has RAN dependency.\nNOTE 2:\tFor mobile base station relay that moves, even the cell information in the System Information Broadcast (e.g. Cell ID, TAC) does not change, it may represents different geographic area due to the movement.\n",

The pre-configuration of TACs for a MBSR is able to be obtained by the AMF serving the UE if the UE camps on the MBSR, and the Registration Area (RA) configured for the UE includes those TACs so that the UE will not perform mobility registration.\nFollowing figure shows an example of the moving scenario:\nThe figure depicts an example of a UE (User Equipment) stopping mobility registration when moving with MBSR (Mobile Base Station Registration). This is a crucial step in ensuring the security and privacy of the network. The figure shows the UE's status, such as the status of the registration, and the MBSR's response, which is the registration status. This process is essential for maintaining the integrity of the network and preventing unauthorized access.\nFigure 6.4.1-1: Example of UE stopping mobility registration when moving with MBSR\n1.\tThe UE is served by AMF1, and the RA configured in UE does not include any TAC that is allowed to be broadcasted by any MBSR.\n2.\tThe UE onboards a vehicle equipped with a MBSR, and the MBSR is serving by AMF2. The MBSR is pre-configured with allowed TAC list that includes TAC1, TAC2, and TAC3, which is not included in the current RA of the UE, and the NG-RAN selects TAC1 for the MBSR to broadcast. The UE performs mobility registration via the MBSR due to RA change, and the AMF1 provides new RA to the UE, which includes TAC1, TAC2, and TAC3, so that the UE will not perform mobility registration again until the UE leaves the MBSR.\n3.\tThe MBSR moves together with the UE, and the MBSR performs mobility registration and is instructed to broadcast TAC2. The serving NG-RAN decides to change the serving AMF for the UEs served by AMF1, e.g. NG-RAN does not have connection with the AMF1, and the serving NG-RAN sends context transfer request to AMF3 in order to transfer context for bulk UEs under the MBSR from AMF1.  The AMF3 requests UE Context transfer from AMF1 without temporary UE ID (5G-GUTI) change, i.e. no NAS signalling. After the UE Context transfer, the NG-RAN is able to send message to the AMF3 for the UEs. The AMF3 invokes Nudm_UECM_Registration with \"move together\" indication to UDM, the UDM will suspend the deregistration notification to the AMF1.\n4.\tThe MBSR continues to move and performs mobility registration, and the serving AMF for the MBSR is changed to AMF4. The NG-RAN selects TAC3 for the MBSR to broadcast (the NG-RAN may also select TAC1 or TAC2).\n5.\tThe UE gets off the vehicle, camps on a macro cell, and the TAC broadcasted by the cell is not in the current RA of the UE, so the UE performs mobility registration, which changes the serving AMF to AMF5. The AMF5 requests UE context from AMF1 according to the 5G-GUTI and invokes Nudm_UECM_Registration without \"move together\" indication, and UDM will deregister the AMF3 and resume the deregistration notification to the AMF1.\n",

The MBSR may be managed by a different AMF, so the AMF serving the UE allocates a Link ID to link to the MBSR and associates the UE with the Link ID. If multiple UEs under a MBSR are served by the same AMF, those UEs are associated with the same Link ID. The Link ID consists of AMF ID of the AMF that allocates it and a unique ID within the AMF.\nConsidering that the NG-RAN does not have the UE context when the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the NG-RAN is provided with the Link IDs from AMFs serving UEs and the NG-RAN manages the association between the MBSR and the Link IDs. When a MBSR moves, the NG-RAN may trigger the UE context transfer for the UEs under the MBSR according to the AMF ID in the Link ID (e.g. the NG-RAN does not have a connection with the AMF), i.e. the NG-RAN sends the Link ID to the new AMF serving the UEs, and the new AMF serving the UEs requests bulk UE context transfer from the AMF indicated by the AMF ID in the Link ID.\nThe following figure shows the data model for the mobility management:\nThe figure depicts a data model for mobility management, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It includes a user interface (UI) for managing user profiles, a mobility management system (MMS), and a data model for tracking user movements. The figure also shows the flow of data between the UI and MMS, highlighting the importance of data integrity and security in this system.\nFigure 6.4.2-1: Data model for mobility management\nEach UE is served by an AMF (AMF serving UE, A.K.A.

The Link ID includes AMF ID indicating the AMF assigning the Link ID, and includes a unique number assigned by the AMF indicated by the AMF ID. The UEs served by the same AMF and camps on the same MBSR will be assigned with the same Link ID. The 5G-GUTI included in the UE Context may be assigned by another AMF-UE if the UE does not perform mobility registration when moving with the MBSR (see clauses 6.4.3.1, 6.4.3.2 and 6.4.3.3).\nThe NG-RAN serving a MBSR holds the MBSR Context that includes zero or more Link IDs so that even a UE under the MBSR is in CM-IDLE state, the NG-RAN is able to trigger UE context transfer during MBSR mobility (see clauses 6.4.3.1 and 6.4.3.2). If a UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and is relayed by a MBSR, the UE context in the NG-RAN also includes a Link ID associated with the MBSR, so that when the UE performs handover (move together with MBSR or not), even the serving AMF for the UE is changed while 5G-GUTI of the UE is unchanged, the NG-RAN is able to know the serving AMF for the UE (see clause 6.4.3.3), and if multiple UEs relayed by the MBSR are served by the same AMF, they will associate the same Link ID even if the AMF IDs in the UE 5G-GUTIs are different, so that when the handovers of those UEs are triggered by the moving of the MBSR (move together), the NG-RAN is able to send bunch of handover requests for those UEs to the AMF (see clauses 6.4.3.3.2 and 6.4.3.3.3).\n",

In the case of registration procedure, the NG-RAN may select a new AMF-UE.\n4.\tIn case new AMF-UE is selected, the AMF-UE requests UE Context transfer from the old AMF-UE.

In case of registration procedure, if the TAI list configured for the MBSR does not change, for the sake of saving mobility registration for UEs behind the MBSR, the AMF-UE may send Registration Accept to the UE with TAI List that only includes the TAI list received in step 3. The NG-RAN associates the Link ID with the MBSR and stores the Link ID into the UE context.\n6.\tThe NG-RAN associates the Link ID with the MBSR ID and the UE ID. The NG-RAN sends an RRC message to the UE, the RRC message may include the N1 message. The usage of Link ID is referred to clauses 6.4.3.2, and 6.4.3.3.\n7.\tIf the UE camps on a MBSR, the UE may suspend the mobile registration if the UE keeps camping on the MBSR (e.g. the TAI/TAC broadcasted by the MBSR does not change and the NG-RAN sends the TAI to the AMF-UE).\n8.\tThe UE camps on another MBSR or NG-RAN.\n9.\tWhen the mobile registration is suspended, the UE resumes the mobile registration (e.g. the TAI/TAC broadcasted by a MBSR is not provisioned to the UE before the UE camps on the MBSR and when UE camps on a MBSR, only the TAI/TAC of the MBSR is provisioned to the UE). If the UE camps on another MBSR, the steps 2-9 are performed with a different Link ID, different MBSR ID, and a possibly different AMF-MBSR, if the UE camps on NG-RAN directly, the registration procedure described in clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 [5] is performed, and when Nudm_UECM_Registration without \"move together\" indication is invoked by a new AMF-UE, the UDM resumes the deregistration notification that was suspended in step 6 of clause 6.4.3.2.\nAs described in clause 6.4.1, the UE will keep silent as possible as it can when moving with MBSR, i.e. no mobility registration. As described in step 3 of clause 6.4.1, the AMF serving the UE may need to be changed later without NAS signalling exchange.\nAccording to procedure in clause 6.4.3.1, during the mobility of MBSR, even when the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the NG-RAN is able to determine whether the AMF serving the UE needs to be changed according to the Link ID associated with the MBSR. The NG-RAN sends the Link ID to the new AMF serving the UE and the new AMF sends the Link ID to the old AMF serving the UE for requesting bulk UE context transfer. The old AMF serving the UE stores the UE context with the Link ID, so bulk UE context transfer can be done.\nThe figure depicts a mobile base station relay mobility registration procedure with UEs, illustrating the steps involved in registering mobile base stations (BSs) for relay mobility. The figure includes a mobile base station (MSB), a relay, and multiple UEs, with each UE having a unique identifier. The figure also shows the registration process, which involves the MSB sending a registration request to the relay, which then sends the request to the network control center (NCC). The NCC verifies the registration request and sends a response back to the MSB. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the mobile base station relay mobility registration procedure, making it easy to understand the process and its components.\nFigure 6.4.3.2-1: Mobile Base Station Relay mobility registration procedure with UEs\n1.\tThe MBSR sends Registration Request towards the 5GC via the NG-RAN, or the MBSR performs handover procedure.\n2.\tIn case Registration procedure is performed, the NG-RAN may select an AMF-MBSR different from the old AMF-MBSR, the AMF-MBSR queries UE Context for the MBSR from the old AMF-MBSR and the old AMF-MBSR returns MBSR Context with the Link IDs (see clause 6.5.3.1 for how AMF-MBSR knows the Link IDs).\n3.\tIn case Registration procedure is performed, the AMF-MBSR sends Registration Accept to the MBSR, whose underlayer N2 message includes the Link IDs, the NG-RAN updates the Link IDs for the MBSR.\n4.\tThe (target) NG-RAN decides whether to change the AMF serving the UEs associated with a Link ID according to the Link ID.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE decides to change slice requirement, the UE will initiate mobility registration update procedure without changing to a new TA outside the UE's RA according to clause 4.2.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [5].\n5.\tIf new AMF-UE is selected, the NG-RAN sends AMF Relocation Request (Link ID) to the new AMF-UE.\n6.\tThe new AMF-UE invokes Bulk UE Context Transfer Request (Link ID) towards the old AMF-UE according to the Link ID. The old AMF-UE responds the context of UEs associated with the Link ID. The UE context includes the Link ID and the associated AMF ID indicating the AMF-MBSR that the old AMF-UE has subscribed event to.\nThe new AMF-UE invokes Nudm_UECM_Registration with \"move together\" indication to the UDM, and the UDM suspends deregistration notification to the old AMF-UE who did not indicate \"move together\".\nNOTE 2:\tThe UDM still notifies deregistration to any other old AMF-UE, i.e., notifies deregistration to those old AMF-UE who indicated \"move together\".\n7.\tThe new AMF-UE allocate a new Link ID, associates the new Link ID with the UEs, and responds to the NG-RAN with the new Link ID. The NG-RAN replace the Link ID with the new Link ID, i.e., replaces the Link ID in the context of MBSR with the new Link ID, and replaces the Link ID in context of UEs with the new Link ID.\nAs described in clause 6.4.1, the UE will keep silent as possible as it can when moving with MBSR, i.e. no mobility registration. As described in step 3 of clause 6.4.1, the AMF serving the UE may need to be changed during the MBSR handover without UE NAS signalling exchange.\nThe NG-RAN has the context of the UE that is in CM-CONNECTED state, which includes the Link ID as described in step 5 of clause 6.4.3.1 and step 7 of clause 6.4.3.2. As described in step 3 of clause 6.4.1, the 5G-GUTI of the UE is unchanged, hence the AMF ID in the 5G-GUTI may not indicate to the AMF that stores the UE context, in this procedure, the NG-RAN sends handover required message to the AMF according to the Link ID in the UE context instead of the 5G-GUTI of the UE. For N2 handover, if the AMF serving UE is changed, the AMF ID in the Link ID indicates the old AMF serving the UE, the new AMF serving the UE needs to sends a new Link ID to the target NG-RAN.\nThe figure depicts a handover scenario between a mobile base station (MBS) and a user equipment (UE) in a 4G network. The MBS is equipped with a relay N2, which is responsible for relaying the signal to the UE. The figure shows the handover process, including the handover signal, the UE's signal, and the MBS's signal. The relay N2 is highlighted, indicating its role in the handover process.\nFigure 6.4.3.3.2-1: Mobile Base Station Relay N2 handover with UEs\n1.\tThe source NG-RAN determines to perform handover for the MBSR and sends the Handover Required (MBSR info) message to the AMF-MBSR. The AMF-MBSR may select a new AMF-MBSR for the handover procedure.\n2.\tThe handover procedure for the MBSR continues. If the AMF-MBSR is not changed, the AMF-MBSR sends the Link IDs associated with the MBSR to the target NG-RAN; if the AMF-MBSR is changed, the new AMF-MBSR sends the Link IDs associated with the MBSR to the target NG-RAN (see clause 6.5.3.1 for how AMF-MBSR knows the Link IDs). The target NG-RAN updates the Link IDs for the MBSR.\n3.\tThe AMF-MBSR sends the Handover Command (MBSR info) to the source NG-RAN.\n4.\tThe source NG-RAN sends Handover Command to the MBSR with MBSR info.\nThe following steps 5-9 are performed per UE.\nNOTE:\tFollowing steps 5-9 can be executed simultaneously with steps 1-3. Whether the MBSR handover is together with UEs' handover or before UEs' handover is determined by RAN WGs, but there's no impact to the following procedures.\n5.\tThe source NG-RAN also sends Handover Required (UE info (MBSR info), \"move together\") per the UE associated with the MBSR towards the AMF-UE according to the Link ID in the UE context. The UE info (MBSR info) is included in the transparent container. The source NG-RAN can combine multiple Handover Required messages in a bulk way sending to the same destination. In order to differentiate the case that UE handover due to moving together with the MBSR from the case that UE handover to leave the MBSR, the \"move together\" is included to indicate that the UE is moving together with the MBSR.\n6.\tThe AMF-UE may determine to select a new AMF-UE for the specific UE, and invoke Create UE Context Request (UE Context (Link ID), UE info, \"move together\") towards the new AMF-UE. The UE Context includes the Link ID when \"move together\" is received.\n7.\tThe handover procedure for the UE continues. In case new AMF-UE is not selected and the UE moves together with the MBSR, the AMF-UE sends the UE info to the target NG-RAN. In case new AMF-UE is selected and the UE moves together with the MBSR, if the new Link ID related to the MBSR associated with the Link ID has not been allocated, the new AMF-UE allocates a new Link ID. The new AMF-UE sends the new Link ID and the UE info to the target NG-RAN. The target NG-RAN associates the MBSR with the Link ID, or the new Link ID if received.\n8.\tIn case step 3 is performed, the new AMF-UE responds to the AMF-UE.\n9.\tThe AMF-UE sends Handover Command (UE info) to the source NG-RAN. The UE info includes the associated MBSR info.\n10.\tThe resources used between the UE and the MBSR may not change, and the source NG-RAN may or may not send Handover Command to the UE depends on RAN procedures.\nThe figure depicts a mobile base station (BS) relay handover scenario with multiple UEs, illustrating the handover process from the BS to the UE. The figure shows the handover process from the BS to the UE, with the UE being the destination. The handover is depicted in a simplified manner, with the BS and UE being represented as a single entity. The figure also includes a visual representation of the handover process, with the BS and UE being connected by a cable.\nFigure 6.4.3.3.3-1: Mobile Base Station Relay Xn handover with UEs\n1.\tThe UE moves together with the MBSR and both the UE and the MBSR performs Xn handover procedure.\nThe following steps 2-3 are performed per UE.\n2.\tThe target NG-RAN sends Path Switch (UE info, \"move together\") per the UE associated with the MBSR towards the AMF-UE according to the Link ID in the UE context. The target NG-RAN can combine multiple Path Switch messages in a bulk way sending to the same destination. In order to differentiate the case that UE handover due to moving together with the MBSR from the case that UE handover to leave the MBSR, the \"move together\" is included to indicate that the UE is moving together with the MBSR.\n3.\tThe Xn handover procedure for the UE continues.\n4.\tThe target NG-RAN also sends Path Switch (MBSR info) to the AMF-MBSR.\n5.\tThe Xn handover procedure for the MBSR continues. The AMF-MBSR sends the Link IDs associated with the MBSR to the target NG-RAN (See clause 6.5.3.1 for how AMF-MBSR knows the Link IDs). The target NG-RAN updates the Link IDs for the MBSR.\n",

The AMF-UE also associates the Link ID with the AMF ID indicated by the MBSR ID.\nWhen subscribe request with a Link ID is received, the AMF-MBSR increase the count for the Link ID, and when unsubscribe request with a Link ID, the AMF-MBSR decrease the count of the Link ID.\n3.\tThe new AMF-UE sends a N2 message, and the N2 message may include a N1 message. In case of registration procedure, if the TAI of the MBSR does not change, for the sake of saving mobility registration for UEs behind the MBSR, the AMF-UE may send Registration Accept to the UE with TAI List that only includes the TAI received in step 1.\n4.\tThe NG-RAN sends an RRC message to the UE, the RRC message may include the N1 message.\n5.\tIf the UE camps on a MBSR, the UE may suspend the mobile registration if the UE keeps camping on the MBSR (e.g. the TAI/TAC broadcasted by the MBSR does not change and the NG-RAN sends the TAI to the AMF-UE in step 1).\n6.\tWhen the event met, the AMF-MBSR notifies the AMF-UE with the Link ID and associated information, see clauses 6.5.3.3 and 6.5.3.4.\n7.\tThe UE camps on another MBSR or NG-RAN. When the mobile registration is suspended, the UE resumes the mobile registration (e.g. the TAI/TAC received is not included in the current RA of the UE). The steps 1-5 are performed. If the UE camps on another MBSR, the NG-RAN indicates a different MBSR ID to the AMF-UE. If the UE camps on NG-RAN directly, the NG-RAN does not indicate MBSR ID to the AMF-UE.\n8.\tIf no MBSR ID is received and a Link ID and associated AMF ID exist in the UE Context, the AMF-UE unsubscribes towards the AMF-MBSR indicated by the associated AMF ID with the Link ID.\nSame as described in clause 6.5.3.1, the Link ID is introduced to map to the MBSR in the AMF of UE in the handover procedure During the handover, whenever the serving AMF of UE is changed, the serving AMF of MBSR also needs to be informed, so that the notification can be sent to the correct AMF of UE.\nFor the UE handover from one MBSR to another MBSR, the serving AMF of UE may change, the AMF of MBSR needs to know one UE is leaving the old MBSR and one UE (the same one) is joining the new MBSR by the means of received Link ID.\nThe figure depicts a handover scenario in a 5G network, where an UE (User Equipment) N2 transitions from a mobile base station (BS) relay to connect/disconnect to/from the Mobile Base Station (MBS). The figure illustrates the process of handover, including the handover request, the handover procedure, and the handover completion. The figure also shows the handover path, which is a crucial component of the handover process, ensuring that the UE is connected to the MBS in a reliable and efficient manner.\nFigure 6.5.3.2.1-1: UE N2 handover to connect/disconnect to/from Mobile Base Station Relay\n1.\tThe UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and may be relayed by a MBSR.\n2.\tThe source NG-RAN determines to perform handover for the UE and sends the Handover Required (UE info) message to the AMF-UE. The AMF-UE may select a new AMF-UE for the handover procedure. The UE info is included in the transparent container. The difference from step 2 in 6.4.3.3.2 of solution #4 is that the \"move together\" is not included to indicate that the UE handover from a macro cell or to leave a MBSR.\n3.\tIn case new AMF-UE is selected, the AMF-UE invokes Create UE Context Request (UE Context, UE info) towards the new AMF-UE. The UE Context in the request does not include the Link ID and the associated AMF ID if the UE was relayed by a MBSR and \"move together\" is not received in the step 2.\n4.\tThe handover procedure for the UE continues. If the UE is handed over to the target NG-RAN via another MBSR, the target NG-RAN indicates the new MBSR ID to the (new) AMF-UE.\n5.\tIn case step 3 is performed, the new AMF-UE responds to the AMF-UE.\n6.\tIn case step 3 is performed and Link ID is included in the stored UE Context (i.e. the UE handover to leave a MBSR), the AMF-UE unsubscribes to the AMF-MBSR indicated by the associated AMF ID with the Link ID. The AMF-MBSR decreases the count for the Link ID.\n7.\tThe AMF-UE sends Handover Command (UE info) to the source NG-RAN.\n8.\tThe source NG-RAN sends the Handover Command to the UE.\n9.\tThe UE tunes to the target NG-RAN, which may be via another MBSR.\n10.\tThe target NG-RAN sends Handover Confirm to the (new) AMF-UE.\n11.\tThe handover procedure for the UE continues.\n12.\tIf MBSR ID is received and the UE will not perform mobility registration, the AMF-UE allocates a Link ID for the received MBSR ID, and subscribe to the AMF-MBSR according to the MBSR ID with the allocated Link ID and the received MBSR ID. The AMF-MBSR maps the allocated Link ID to the MBSR and increases the count for the Link ID,\nWhen the event met, the AMF-MBSR notifies the AMF-UE with the Link ID and associated information, see clauses 6.5.3.3 and 6.5.3.4.\nThe figure depicts a handover process for an UE (User Equipment) from a Mobile Base Station (MBS) to a Relay, illustrating the steps involved in connecting or disconnecting from the MBS. The figure shows the UE's handover from the MBS to the Relay, with the UE's antenna pointing towards the MBS and the relay's antenna pointing towards the UE. The figure also includes a diagram of the MBS and the relay, with the MBS's antenna pointing towards the UE and the relay's antenna pointing towards the MBS. The figure is a visual representation of the handover process, providing a clear and concise explanation of how the UE connects or disconnects from the MBS.\nFigure 6.5.3.2.2-1: UE Xn handover to connect/disconnect to/from Mobile Base Station Relay\n1.\tThe UE performs Xn handover to connect to a MBSR from direct NG-RAN connection or from another MBSR, or to connect to macro cell from a MBSR.\n2.\tThe target NG-RAN sends the Path Switch ([MBSR ID], UE info) message to the AMF-UE. If the UE handover to directly connect to NG-RAN, the MBSR ID is not included. If the UE handover to a MBSR, the MBSR ID is included.\n3.\tConsidering that UE will not handover to the same MBSR, the new AMF-UE may perform conditional subscription update as described in step 2 of clause 6.5.3.1, or unsubscribe and then subscribe to the AMF-MBSR as described in step 2 of clause 6.5.3.1.\nWhen the event met, the AMF-MBSR notifies the AMF-UE with the Link ID and associated information, see clauses 6.5.3.3 and 6.5.3.4.\n4.\tThe handover procedure for the UE continues.\nSame as described in clause 6.5.3.1, the Link ID is introduced to map to the MBSR in the AMF of UE in the mobility registration procedure.\nFor the mobility registration of the MBSR, the AMF of the MBSR may change, the new AMF of MBSR needs to notify the AMF of UE with Link ID, which indicates the MBSR in the AMF of UE. If bulk UE context transfer as described in clause 6.4.3.3 of solution #4 is performed, the AMF of UE may change after the mobility registration of the MBSR, the new AMF of UE also needs to inform the AMF of MBSR the change of the AMF with the Link ID.\nThe figure depicts a mobile base station relay's mobility registration procedure, illustrating the steps involved in determining the relay's location and ensuring its reliability. The figure includes a mobile base station (MBS), a relay, and a mobile user (MU), with the relay's location marked by a red dot. The figure also shows the relay's location on a map, with the red dot indicating its position. The figure is labeled with the figure number \"6\" and the figure name \"5.3.3-1,\" indicating its specific section within the larger figure.\nFigure 6.5.3.3-1: Mobile Base Station Relay mobility registration procedure\n1.\tThe MBSR sends Registration Request towards the 5GC via the NG-RAN.\n2.\tThe NG-RAN may select an AMF-MBSR different from the old AMF-MBSR, the AMF-MBSR queries UE Context for the MBSR from the old AMF-MBSR and the old AMF-MBSR returns MBSR Context with the Link IDs.\n3.\tIf AMF-MBSR is changed, the AMF-MBSR notifies the AMF change event with the Link ID to the AMF-UE. The AMF-UE replaces the AMF ID associated with the Link ID with the AMF ID of the AMF-MBSR.\n4.\tThe AMF-MBSR sends Registration Accept to the MBSR.\n5.\tSteps 4-7 in clause 6.4.3.2 of solution#4 may be performed.\n6.\tIf step 5 is performed, the AMF-UE is changed, the new AMF-UE updates the subscription with the Link ID and the new Link ID (unconditional update) towards the AMF-MBSR associated with the Link ID. The AMF-MBSR replace the Link ID with the new Link ID.\nSame as described in clause 6.5.3.1, the Link ID is introduced to map to the MBSR in the AMF of UE in the handover procedure.\nFor the N2 handover of MBSR together with UEs, both the AMF of the MBSR and the AMF of UE may change together during the N2 handover procedure, the new AMF of MBSR needs to notify the AMF of UE with Link ID, which indicates the MBSR in the AMF of UE. The new AMF of UE also needs to inform the AMF of MBSR the change of the AMF with the Link ID.\nThe following procedure is for N2 handover, no extension needed for Xn handover because AMF will not change during Xn handover.\nThe figure depicts a handover scenario between a mobile base station (MBS) and a user equipment (UE) in a 5G network. The MBS is equipped with a relay N2, which is responsible for relaying the signal to the UE. The figure illustrates the handover process, including the handover signal, the UE's signal, and the MBS's signal. The relay N2 is shown in a handover position, indicating that it is in the process of relaying the signal. The figure also shows the handover signal, which is a combination of the MBS's signal and the UE's signal. The handover signal is shown in a handover position, indicating that it is in the process of relaying the signal. The figure also shows the UE's signal, which is a combination of the MBS's signal and the relay N2's signal.

The figure also shows the UE's signal, which is a combination of the MBS's signal and the relay N2's signal. The figure also shows the MBS'\nFigure 6.5.3.4-1: Mobile Base Station Relay N2 handover with UEs\n1.\tThe source NG-RAN determines to perform handover for the MBSR and sends the Handover Required (MBSR info) message to the AMF-MBSR. The AMF-MBSR may select a new AMF-MBSR for the handover procedure.\n2.\tThe handover procedure for the MBSR continues.\n3.\tThe AMF-MBSR sends Handover Command (MBSR info) to the source NG-RAN.\n4.\tThe source NG-RAN sends Handover Command to the MBSR.\n5.\tIf the new AMF-MBSR is selected, the new AMF-MBSR gets the MBSR context during the handover procedure, which includes the Link ID. The Link ID may be updated to a new Link ID by the new AMF-UE, e.g. as described in steps 10-11. The new AMF-MBSR notifies the AMF change event with the Link ID to the AMF according to the AMF ID in the Link ID.\nThe following steps 6-7 are performed per UE.\nNOTE:\tFollowing steps 6-10 can be executed simultaneously with steps 1-3. Whether the MBSR handover is together with UEs' handover or before UEs' handover is determined by RAN WGs, but there's no impact to the following procedures.\n6.\tThe source NG-RAN also sends Handover Required (UE info (MBSR info), \"move together\") per the UE associated with the MBSR towards the AMF-UE. The UE info (MBSR info) is included in the transparent container. The source NG-RAN can combine multiple Handover Required messages in a bulk way sending to the same destination. In order to differentiate the case that UE handover due to moving together with the MBSR from the case that UE handover to leave the MBSR (e.g., described in clause 6.5.3.2.1), the \"move together\" is included to indicate that the UE is moving together with the MBSR.\n7.\tThe AMF-UE may determine to select a new AMF-UE for the specific UE, and invokes Create UE Context Request (UE Context (Link ID, AMF ID), UE info, \"move together\") towards the new AMF-UE. The UE Context includes the Link ID and the associated AMF ID indicating the AMF-MBSR when \"move together\" is received.\n8.\tThe handover procedure for the UE continues.\n9.\tIf step 7 is performed, the new AMF-UE responds to the AMF-UE.\n10.\tThe AMF-UE sends Handover Command (UE info) to the source NG-RAN. The UE info includes the associated MBSR info.\n11.\tThe resources used between the UE and the MBSR may not change, and the source NG-RAN may or may not send Handover Command to the UE depends on RAN procedures.\n12.\tIf step 7 is performed and \"move together\" is received, the new AMF-UE updates the subscription towards the AMF-MBSR with the Link ID and the new Link ID (unconditional update).\n13.\tIf the AMF-MBSR is in handover procedure, when the AMF-MBSR does not select a new AMF-MBSR, the AMF-MBSR decreases the count for the Link ID, increases the count for the new Link ID, and associates the MBSR indicated by the Link ID with the new Link ID. When the AMF-MBSR selects a new AMF-MBSR in step 2, the AMF-MBSR forwards the subscription update towards the new AMF-MBSR, and the new AMF-MBSR decreases the count for the Link ID, increases the count for the new Link ID, and associates the MBSR indicated by the Link ID with the new Link ID.\n14.\tThe AMF-MBSR responds to the subscription update.\nAs described in clause 6.4.1, the UE will keep silent as possible as it can when moving with MBSR, i.e. no mobility registration, so the AMF serving the UE may not know where the UE is, but the AMF knows the UE is with MBSR without knowing where MBSR is.\nAccording to the procedure from clause 6.5.3.1 to 6.5.3.4, the AMF of UE knows the AMF of MBSR, and Link ID is used to indicate the MBSR, the AMF of UE can relay paging message with the Link ID to the AMF of MBSR, and AMF of MBSR will page the UE via the MBSR indicated by the Link ID.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a mobile user moves with the Mobile Base Station Relay (MBSR), leading to a change in the mobile termination point. This change is highlighted by the change in the signal strength and the corresponding change in the mobile termination point. The figure illustrates the importance of proper mobile termination in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 6.5.3.5-1: Mobile termination when UE moves with Mobile Base Station Relay\n1.\tUE moves with the MBSR, the AMF-UE is triggered to send N1 message or N2 message to UE.\n2a.\tIf the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF-UE sends the N1/N2 message towards the NG-RAN. If N1 message is received, the NG-RAN sends the N1 message to the UE via the MBSR.\n2b.\tIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the UE context includes a Link ID, as well as the AMF-UE knows the serving RAN node for the MBSR related to the Link ID (e.g. the procedure described in clause 6.4.3.2 of solution#4 is just performed), the AMF-UE may send Paging request (UE ID, Link ID) to the NG-RAN. The NG-RAN maps the Link ID to the MBSR.\n2c.\tThe AMF-UE may invoke Page Relay (Link ID, UE ID) towards the AMF-MBSR.\n3.\tIf step 2c is performed, the AMF-MBSR maps the Link ID to the MBSR. The AMF-MBSR sends the Paging request (UE ID) to the NG-RAN.\n4.\tIf step 2b or step 3 is performed, the NG-RAN sends the Paging request (UE ID) to the MBSR, and the MBSR pages the UE.\n",

In case the network node is a mobile base station relay it may change its location, and therefore it is important that the position/location of the mobile base station relay node is known for the time period when the UE performs measurements on the node.\nThus, there are different cases that needs to be taken into account:\n-\tWhen a UE performs positioning measurements based on signals from the mobile base station relay and possibly other base stations gNBs the current position of the mobile base station relay needs to be known by the LMF and therefore the LMF may need to request positioning measurements of the mobile base station relay.\n-\tWhen a UE only can perform measurements on the mobile base station relay i.e. no or too few neighbouring gNBs to measure on, it may use the sidelink positioning procedures as investigated in FS_Ranging_SL TR 23.700-86 [15].

The MO-LR positioning procedure is a straightforward extension, where the trigger is MO-LR.\nThis procedure on MT-LR positioning consists of two parts, first the procedure for UE positioning from TS 23.273 [4] utilizing the mobile base station relay as a RAN node and then the IAB-UE positioning using the UE positioning procedures in TS 23.273 [4].\nThe figure depicts a procedure for MT_LR (Multi-Tiered Load Reduction) for an UE (User Equipment) served by a MBSR (Multi-Building Small-Scale Radio) using TRP (Traffic Request Protocol) information request procedure. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the MT_LR process, including the selection of the appropriate TRP, the transmission of the request, and the response from the MBSR. The figure also includes a visual representation of the MBSR's network topology, highlighting the importance of network redundancy and failover mechanisms.\nFigure 6.7.3.1-1: Procedure for MT_LR for UE served by a MBSR using TRP information request procedure\n0.\tTRP Information Exchange procedure is triggered by OAM, when the MBSR is integrated or fully migrated in the RAN at a gNB. The LMF requests gNBs to provide detailed information (e.g. the geographical coordinates for the TRP) for TRPs hosted by the gNBs. During this procedure, the MBSR IAB-DU informs the Donor gNB-CU that its TRP(s) is mobile, which is further forwarded to the LMF. The MBSR cell ID and a permanent MBSR IAB-UE identity (MBSR ID, which may be a GPSI) which is also used to identify the MBSR UE in the UDM, is also passed to the LMF.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure is typically performed before LMF initiating a position procedure for a UE as this is UE independent.\n1.\tThe AMF serving UE is triggered to initiate location reporting procedure for UE as specified in TS 23.273 [4].\nNOTE 2:\tThis step may be same as the procedure for a UE served by normal gNB and does not require the MBSR to be register at the same AMF as the UE.\n2.\tThe LMF, selected by the AMF serving UE, is triggered to initiate location reporting procedure for the UE. The AMF provides the LCS correlation ID and the cell-ID of the serving cell, i.e. the serving cell of the MBSR.\n3. \tThe LMF performs the positioning procedures, e.g. step 8 in clause 6.1.1 of TS 23.273 [4] 5GC-MT-LR procedure for the regulatory location service, or step 12 in clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [4] 5GC-MT-LR Procedure for the commercial location service. The LMF configures the gNBs within the area of interest based on the provided serving cell-ID to start broadcast PRS, in the response the gNB provides the list of TRPs that are activated with an indication if the TRP is a MBSR. The UE send the UL positioning message including the positioning data captured by the UE. The data set may include one or more cell-ID(s) with positioning data associated with one or more mobile base station relay (which are known from step 0 or by the updated list received in this step). If no MBSR cell is included, the steps 4-6 are skipped.\n4.\tSince the LMF knows the TRP hosted by MBSR(s) is mobile (in step 0), the LMF initiate a TRP Information Exchange procedure to request the updated location information of the TRP(s) associated with MBSRs by directing the TRP information exchange messages to the gNB(s) associated with the Cell ID(s), for example, by setting the NRPPa TRP Information Type Item IE to \"geo-coordinates\". Donor-CU further send a F1 TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to any MBSR IAB-DU.\n5. \tThe MBSR IAB-UE initiate a 5GC-MO-LR procedure (as defined in clause 6.2 of TS 23.273 [4]) to get its location information. The MBSR IAB-UE's location info is used by the co-located MBSR IAB-DU to determine the updated location for its TRP.\n6.  The MBSR IAB-DU report its updated TRP location, e.g. TRP's geo-coordinate, to the Donor-CU, which is further forwarded to LMF which uses the updated location of MBSR's TRP for calculation the UE's position.\n7.\tThe LMF provides the UE location to the AMF serving the UE.\nThere is another variation on how LMF know the updated location of TRP. In current F1/NRPPa, the DU can report its TRP location as a relative location to a reference point. Current reference point is fixed and its location info is configured by OAM.  This can be enhanced for MBSR by using the MBSR IAB-UE as the reference point. By knowing the reference point is a MBSR IAB-UE (as from step 0 TRP Information exchange), the LMF can first initiate MT-LR to determine the location of the Reference Point (i.e. MBSR IAB-UE), then determine the TRP's location. An example call flow is shown below.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for MT_LR (Multi-Tiered Load Reduction) for an UE (User Equipment) served by a MBSR (Multi-Building Small-Scale Radio) using an other MT-LR procedure. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the MT_LR process, including the selection of the appropriate MT-LR procedure, the selection of the MBSR, and the selection of the UE. The figure also shows the steps for the MT_LR procedure, including the selection of the MBSR, the selection of the UE, and the selection of the load. The figure is important for understanding the MT_LR process and for implementing it in a real-world scenario.\nFigure 6.7.3.1-2: Procedure for MT_LR for UE served by a MBSR using another MT-LR procedure\n0.\tTRP Information Exchange procedure is triggered by OAM. when the MBSR is integrated or fully migrated in the RAN at a new gNB.

While for the IAB- UE, existing roaming procedures can be re-used to a large extent (i.e. the donor IAB node is authorized to serve the MBSR as such if there is some subscription to authorize it, as detected by the serving AMF), the roaming IAB-DU will appear as a base station in the visited network and will thus interfere with the visited operators' network unless it is properly configured to be compatible with the existing deployments and regulations in the visited country.\nPre-condition: IAB Roaming Agreement\nAs a pre-condition, we assume an IAB-specific Roaming Agreement needs to be in place before IAB-Node moves into a VPLMN and obtain service in the VPLMN. Roaming agreements for a standard UE are of course quite well understood, but roaming agreements for an IAB-Node are not yet known and require extensions to a standard roaming agreement as the operation of the IAB-DU part needs to be considered (i.e. access node-related configurations including parameters like max transmission power, maximum bandwidth, antenna configurations).\nThis is particularly important as we will need really to ensure compatibility between the MBSRs visiting a PLMN and the VPLMN OAM. The MBSR may also be preconfigured with the settings that are necessary to operate in VPLMN(s) (with some additional tuning done using the F1 interface once the MBSR is in the VPLMN(s)).  Several options are possible and most likely a discussion will need to take place on which way to go as this will impact the MBSR implementation and deployment requirements.\nHigh level description\nThe MBSR can be configured by the HPLMN per roaming partner PLMN ID and can be further reconfigured or updated by the VPLMN in such a way that the IAB-DU can be operated in the roaming partner operator's network. This includes reconfiguration of radio resources, e.g. used frequencies, power levels. This configuration by the VPLMN is subject to the MBSR to be an \"mobile IAB Node allowed\" in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE (in other words the UE context in the RAN includes the authorization of the MBSR to Mobile IAB node).\nThe MBSR IAB UE can obtain the IP address of an OAM configuration server and e.g. one time authentication credentials to access the local OAM in the Registration Accept message received from the AMF.  The address of the OAM server may be based on the MBSR PEI (e.g., for OAM compatibility reasons).\nEditor's note:\tThe security aspects of any solution, including this one, need SA WG3 evaluation.\n",

                            "text_content": "The mobility of a Mobile Base Station Relay (MBSR) over a wide area faces the challenge that when it changes IAB Donor, the PDCP and RRC connection of the UEs that it serves is impacted, so the UEs even if stationary inside the vehicle experience potentially nontrivial amount of signalling due to mobility in idle mode (due to need to adapt the TA values to the new gNB assigned values, change PDCP termination and security for user plane) and connected mode. See figure 6.13.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a network with multiple donor IAB nodes, each with a unique CU (Control Unit) change. The CU changes represent the different states of the nodes, with each state indicating the node's mobility. The figure illustrates the impact of these changes on the network's overall mobility, showing how the nodes' states change over time.\nFigure 6.13.2-1: Mobility among donor IAB nodes: CU changes\nThe root cause of this mobility related signalling could be mitigated if MBSR, or more precisely DU of the MBSR, is served by a CU that is covering a much wider area. In short, it could be advantageous to offer the homing of MBSR to a dedicated mobile control unit (which can be e.g. called \"m-CU\") that would control the UEs connected to the MBSR. This would enable the MBSR to move across a much wider RAN coverage area without changing the m-CU. Hence, mobility of the MBSR between IAB Donors could be hidden from the UEs connected to the MBSR as long as the controller remains in the same m-CU like in figure 6.13.2-2.\nThe figure depicts a 13.2-2-2 mobility scenario with a stable CU (Central Unit). The CU is depicted as a solid line, indicating its stable position. The figure illustrates the movement of the CU, with the 13.2-2-2 symbol indicating the distance between the CU and the 13.2-2-2 symbol. The figure is a visual representation of the CU's position and movement, providing a clear understanding of its stability in the context of the 13.2-2-2 mobility scenario.\nFigure 6.13.2-2: mobility with m-CU: CU is stable\nThe analogy of the partial migration supported in Rel-17 whereby an IAB-DU can be homed to a previous IAB Donor CU and the proposed m-CU based solution is shown in Figure 6.13.2-3. The m-CU corresponds to the CU of the IAB Donor gNB on the left having Xn connection to the Donor gNB. According the Rel-18 VMR assumption, the intermediate IAB-node is not existing as the MBSR operation is limited to single-hop topology. Hence, the lower IAB-node corresponds to MBSR, and an intermediate IAB node could exist as long as it is not a MBSR.\nThe figure depicts a relationship between the architecture for partial migration and the use of multi-core units (m-CU). It illustrates the relationship between the number of cores and the number of units, highlighting the importance of having a sufficient number of cores to support the required number of units. The figure also shows the relationship between the number of cores and the number of units, highlighting the importance of having a sufficient number of cores to support the required number of units.\nFigure 6.13.2-3: Relationship between architecture for partial migration and m-CU\nRel-17 IAB specifications provide suitable basis for such solution without the need for major enhancements to existing procedures and signalling. This is possible due to the distributed nature of the RAN architecture. Referring to the architecture in figure 6.13.2-3, the m-CU corresponds to the source IAB-Donor CU maintaining F1 to the migrating IAB-node DU while the IAB-UE is handed over to the target topology.\nDuring MBSR mobility between Donor nodes, IAB-UE part of the MBSR applies normal handover procedure the same way as in Rel-17 IAB migration. F1 between MBSR and m-CU is maintained during the mobility by moving the transport of the F1 from the source to the target Donor.\nRAN WGs may elaborate the degree of required IAB capabilities in RAN (Donor) nodes and functional split between donor and m-CU considering the single-hop assumption.\n",

RAN groups have eventually to take the lead on specifying the details when they start working on this.\nPossible options can imply that when the MBSR is integrated, the AMF validates and authorizes the MBSR to be served by the m-CU based on the MBSR's IAB-UE subscription information. The F1 between the MSBR and the m-CU can be routed via the IAB Donor to m-CU e.g. in a similar manner as in NR-DC or TNL routing in inter-donor partial migration specified for Rel.17 IAB. UE control and bearer termination will be at the m-CU eliminating UE handovers when the BH link/Donor is changed due to the MBSR mobility.\nEditor's note:\tThe detailed procedures need to be discussed with RAN WG3.\nFig. 6.13.3-1 shows an example for the MBSR integration procedure. Alternative procedures may exist. The sub-procedures use either standard signalling or enhanced procedures for the interaction between RAN and m-CU (subject for RAN WGs to specify).\nThe figure depicts a 13.3-1 MBSR (Multi-Band Signal Reconstruction) integration and mobility procedure, illustrating the steps taken to ensure seamless communication in a 5G network. The figure includes key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The layered design of the optical backbone aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of redundancy and failover in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 6.13.3-1: MBSR integration and mobility procedure\nMBSR integration:\n1.\tIAB-UE of the MBSR establishes the connection via the selected RAN node (Donor). At this stage IAB-UE in MBSR behaves like a normal UE, the same way as in Rel-16/17 IAB, and registers with a serving network AMF (identified as AMF-mbsr). The IAB-UE may indicate to be a mobile IAB-node (MBSR) in the connection setup (msg5) and/or NAS Registration message to trigger this behaviour in this message flow, and the AMF confirms the IAB-UE is authorized to act as MBSR by checking the subscription information and local policy.\n2.\tF1 is setup between the m-CU and MBSR IAB-DU in coordination with the Donor. The BH connection, established between IAB-UE and the Donor, carries F1 between IAB-DU and m-CU. For the F1 the Donor and m-CU configure the transport (TNL) connection between Donor-DU and m-CU. TNL configuration can be similar to NR-DC or TNL configuration for inter-donor partial migration specified in Rel.17 IAB inter-donor topology adaptation.\n3.\tDU operation and cell(s) are configured with F1AP over established F1 using standard procedures. IAB-DU cells are activated for UEs to camp or connect to.\n4.\tUE can establish connection via the cells served by MBSR. IAB-DU and m-CU pair form the serving gNB for the UEs. Standard procedures are used without UE impacts. the UE can register with an AMF that in general needs not be the same as the AMF-mbsr, and we identify it as AMF-UE.\nMBSR mobility:\n5.\tthe MBSR moves towards the IAB Donor 2 coverage.\n6.\tthe IAB UE of the MBSR sends measurements report to IAB Donor-1 based on the measurement and reporting configuration.\n7.\tTriggered by the measurement report, source IAB Donor (Donor-1) initiates HO preparation with the target IAB Donor (Donor-2) which indicates the IP address the MBSR will need to use in the target IAB Donor 2 to continue the F1 connectivity. Figure 6.13.3-1 refers (for illustration only) to Xn mobility, but NG mobility support is not excluded.\n8.\tNormal HO execution procedure is performed. IAB Donor-2 creates HO command and sends it to IAB Donor-1. RRC reconfiguration is sent to IAB UE by IAB Donor-1 to UE (including the IP address to be used for F1) followed by IAB-UE access and sending HO Complete message to the target cell to complete the procedure.\n9.\tF1 with the m-CU can be continued via the new IAB Donor 2, thus allowing to maintain the original cells served by MBSR.\nNOTE:\tThis example is for the case where the m-CU remains the same (which we assume to be the relevant case in most cases covered by this solution). IAB full migration/mobility (including DU migration/mobility) is required when m-CU is changed (new F1 to be set up); this is an objective of the RAN Rel-18 WI.\n10.\tUEs served by the MBSR continue being served without the need to know about the MBSR mobility. No UE HOs are needed.\n",

A subset of the solution can be used with RAT independent position methods (e.g. A-GNSS or WLAN), though this is not described here.\nSince the MBSR may be moving, a current (rather than previous) location of the MBSR may be critical to obtaining an accurate UE location. Preferably, the MBSR location is obtained at the same time as any location measurements obtained by the UE of the MBSR or any location measurements obtained by the MBSR of the UE. If the MBSR location is instead obtained some time before or after these location measurements are obtained, there may be an additional error in locating the UE. For example, if the UE is stationary but the MBSR (e.g. a VMR attached to a vehicle) is moving at 60kph and the MBSR location is obtained 3 seconds before or 3 seconds after the UE location measurements are obtained, then the MBSR location at the time the UE location is measured will differ from the obtained MBSR location by 50 meters. If instead the MBSR is travelling at 120kph (e.g. on a highway) and the time error is 5 seconds, the MBSR location error would be 167 meters. These errors may produce similar errors to the determined UE location - e.g. if the UE location is obtained based only on measurements for or by the MBSR.\n",

The figure includes a diagram of the UE's antenna array, the MBSR access point, and the surrounding environment, highlighting the importance of accurate positioning for reliable communication.\nFigure 6.15.3-1: Positioning Procedure for a UE with MBSR access\n1.\tA trigger for either locating the UE or reporting a UE location event occurs at the AMF. The trigger can be a request for an 5GC-MT-LR received from a GMLC as at step 5 in clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [4], a request for a 5GC-MO-LR received from the UE as at step 2 in clause 6.2 of TS 23.273 [4], a trigger for a 5GC-NI-LR as at step 1 in clause 6.10.1 of TS 23.273 [4], or an event report sent by the UE for a deferred 5GC-MT-LR for periodic or triggered location as at step 25 in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [4].\n2.\tThe AMF selects an LMF. Except for a deferred 5GC-MT-LR for periodic or triggered location where the LMF may be preassigned, the AMF selects an LMF and may select an LMF able to support location for MBSR access if the AMF is aware (e.g. from the donor gNB) that the UE has access via an MBSR.\n3.\tFor a 5GC-MT-LR, 5GC-MO-LR or 5GC-NI-LR, the AMF sends a location request to the LMF using a. Nlmf_Location_DetermineLocation Request service operation and may include parameters such as serving cell ID, LCS Correlation identifier and required QoS as defined in TS 23.273 [4]. For a deferred 5GC-MT-LR for periodic or triggered location, the AMF forwards the event report received form the UE to the LMF. For both cases, the AMF indicates MBSR access if the AMF is aware of this.\n4.\tThe LMF obtains the UE positioning capabilities using LPP according to the procedure in clause 6.11.1 of TS 23.273 [4]. The UE, if aware, may indicate MBSR access to the LMF.\n5.\tIf MBSR access is indicated at either step 3 or step 4, the LMF requests the positioning capabilities of the MBSR when functioning as a TRP using an NRPPa procedure (TRP Information exchange) defined in TS 38.455 [14] to the donor gNB, and a corresponding F1AP procedure defined in TS 38.473 [18] from donor gNB to MBSR. The procedure is modified as described in clause 6.15.2 bullet (c) to allow the LMF to indicate to the donor gNB that it applies to the MBSR. The MBSR returns its positioning capabilities which indicate, for example, a capability to act as a TRP that can configure and transmit DL PRS to the UE and/or configure and measure UL SRS transmitted by the UE. A TRP ID for the MBSR is also assigned by the donor gNB and returned to the LMF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe TRP ID allows the LMF to indicate the MBSR to the donor gNB at steps 7, 8 and 15 and allows the MBSR to identify itself at step 14.\nNOTE 2:\tThe details of LMF requesting the positioning capabilities of the MBSR should be decided by RAN.\n6.\tThe LMF selects one or more position methods supported by the UE and the MBSR as indicated by the positioning capabilities received at steps 4 and 5. If position methods are selected that are not supported by the MBSR, the procedure here is no longer applicable and is not used.\n7.\tDepending on the position methods selected at step 6, the LMF may use existing procedures in TS 38.455 [14] and TS 38.473 [18] to configure transmission of DL PRS by the MBSR (and possibly from other nearby gNBs) and/or to configure the donor gNB, which in turn configures via RRC the transmission of UL SRS by the UE. These procedures make use of sending and received NRPPa messages to and from the donor gNB using the procedure in clause 6.11.2 of TS 23.273 [4].\n8.\tIf the LMF configured transmission of UL SRS by the UE at step 7, the LMF uses existing procedures in TS 38.455 [14] and TS 38.473 [18] to request measurements of the UL SRS by the MBSR and optionally by other nearby gNBs. The LMF makes use of the procedure in clause 6.11.3 of TS 23.273 [4] to exchange NRPPa messages with the donor gNB (and other gNBs) for this purpose.\n9.\tIf the LMF configured transmission of DL PRS by the MBSR at step 7, the LMF uses existing procedures in TS 37.355 [13] to request measurements of the DL PRS by the UE and optionally of DL PRS from other nearby gNBs. The LMF makes use of the procedure in clause 6.11.1 of TS 23.273 [4] to exchange LPP messages with the UE for this purpose.\n10.\tThe UE transmits UL SRS if requested at step 7 and/or measures DL PRS from the MBSR (and other gNBs) if requested at step 9.\n11.\tThe MBSR transmits DL PRS if requested at step 7 and/or measures UL SRS from the UE if requested at step 8.\n12.\tOther gNBs may transmit DL PRS if requested at step 7 and/or measure UL SRS from the UE if requested at step 8.\n13.\tIf the UE measured DL PRS from the MBSR (and other gNBs) at step 10 as requested at step 9, the UE returns the measurements to the LMF according to the procedure in clause 6.11.1 of TS 23.273 [4] and includes the time (or times) of the measurements.\n14.\tIf the MBSR (and other TRPs or gNBs) measured UL SRS from the UE at step 11 (and step 12) as requested at step 8, the MBSR (and other TRPs) return the measurements to the donor gNB, which (and other gNBs) in turn returns them to LMF according to the procedure in clause 6.11.3 of TS 23.273 [4]. The MBSR(s) participated in the measurement also includes the MBSR location at the time of measurement and the MBSR velocity.\nNOTE 3:\tThe support of reporting location and velocity of the MBSR over F1AP will be defined by RAN WGs.\n15.\tIf the LMF receives UE measurements of DL PRS transmitted by the MBSR at step 13 along with a time of measurement, the LMF may request the location of the MBSR from the MBSR for the time of measurement using a modified NRPPa procedure for obtaining the location of a TRP. This may not be needed, however, if the MBSR provides a location and velocity for the MBSR at step 14, because the LMF can then estimate the location of the MBSR at the time of measurement using this location and velocity.\nNOTE 4:\tThe feasibility to allow LMF to obtain the location and velocity of MBSR for the time of measurement will be evaluated by RAN.\n16.\tThe LMF determines the UE location using the measurements received at steps 13 and/or 14. The LMF also uses the location and velocity of the MBSR received at step 14 and/or the MBSR location received at step 15 to determine MBSR location(s) as input for the determination of the UE location.\n17.\tFor a 5GC-MT-LR, 5GC-MO-LR or 5GC-NI-LR, the LMF returns the UE location to the AMF. For a deferred 5GC-MT-LR for periodic or triggered location, the LMF may forward the event report and the UE location to a GMLC to send on to an LCS Client or AF.\n",

                            "text_content": "The option is based on the support of existing IAB architecture as specified in TS 23.501 [2] with the following high-level description:\n-\tIt is assumed that the OAM configures a dedicated TAC for the MBSR. The dedicated TAC is unique per MBSR and different from the TACs supported by the normal cells.\n-\tDuring F1 setup procedure, the gNB-DU includes a mobile IAB indication in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message to the IAB-donor gNB and also provides the dedicated TAC as the cell configuration information. The IAB-donor gNB shall perform gNB Configuration Update towards 5GC to add the dedicated TAI into the Supported TA List of donor gNB. In addition, IAB-donor gNB indicates the 5GC that the dedicated TAI is MBSR specific. Similarly, when the MBSR releases the F1 connection with IAB-donor gNB, the IAB-donor gNB shall perform gNB Configuration Update towards 5GC to delete the dedicated TAI from the Supported TA List of donor gNB. In other words, the dedicated TAC of MBSR enables the 5GC to detect whether UE is accessing via MBSR. Meanwhile, the IAB-donor gNB connecting with the MBSR can be tracked using the Supported TA List of donor gNB.\nThe figure depicts a 17.2.1-1 IAB-node mobility scenario with dedicated TACs, illustrating the importance of network slicing and the use of TACs for efficient network management.\nFigure 6.17.2.1-1: IAB-node mobility with dedicated TAC\n-\tWhen UE registers to the 5GC via the MBSR, the IAB-donor gNB selects a suitable AMF for UE. The UE-AMF knows that the UE is camping on the cell of MBSR based on the UE's TAI in the N2 message. The UE-AMF allocates Registration Area for UE connected to the MBSR which only includes UE's TAI (i.e the Registration Area includes a single TA). When UE disconnects from the MBSR and camps on a different cell, the UE initiates Mobility Registration Update upon changing to a new TA. The UEs in the vehicle connected to the MBSR will not initiate Mobility Registration Update, even when MBSR are served by cells of a new TA outside the UE's Registration Area during the mobility of MBSR. However, the UE still perform non-mobility related registration, e.g. periodic registration update, as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tWhen the MBSR moves from the source IAB-donor gNB to the target IAB-donor gNB, the dedicated TAI of MBSR is supported at the target IAB-donor gNB. There are two cases as the following:\n-\tCase#1: The target IAB-donor gNB has the N2 connection with the UE-AMF. In this option, the UE-AMF (i.e. AMF#1 in the Figure 6.17.2.1-2) can track the UE/MBSR location based on the Supported TA List of donor gNB via gNB Configuration Update procedure. The UE mobility management can be fulfilled within the same UE-AMF, such as the UE-AMF can decide whether to update UE configuration information such as Access and Mobility Management related parameters due to UE mobility. When the conditions to trigger paging are met, the UE-AMF sends the paging request message to the target IAB-donor gNB.\nThe figure depicts a 17-2-1-2 mobility scenario within an 802.11ac network, illustrating the movement of an UE (User Equipment) within the network. The mobility is represented by the movement of the UE from one location to another, with the mobility path being represented by the dashed line. The figure also includes the location of the base station (BS) and the access point (AP) to ensure that the UE can connect to the network.\nFigure 6.17.2.1-2: Intra UE-AMF mobility\n-\tCase#2: The target donor gNB has no N2 connection with the UE-AMF. In this option, the UE-AMF cannot track the dedicated TAI via gNB Configuration Update procedure due to the lack of N2 connection. In order to manage UE mobility and UE reachability, the 5GC needs some enhancements to trigger UE-AMF relocation (i.e. the UE-AMF changes from AMF#1 to the AMF#3 in the Figure 6.17.2.1-3). The details of UE-AMF relocation are described in the clause 6.17.3.1.2.\nThe figure depicts a 17 GHz 2.1-3 GHz frequency band with 17 GHz being the primary frequency band, and 2.1-3 GHz being a secondary frequency band. The figure shows the mobility of an UE (User Equipment) in the 17 GHz band, with the mobility of the UE being represented by the color gradient. The figure also includes an AMF (Access Multiplexer) to facilitate the transmission of signals between the primary and secondary frequency bands.\nFigure 6.17.2.1-3: Inter UE-AMF mobility\nFigure 6.17.2.2-1 shows an example operation of the option based on time sequence of 1 to 4. The UE1, MBSR, and AMF-UE 1 and AMF-UE 2 are the same entities at different time instances (1 to 4) in the figure.\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where UEs are moving with the Mobile Base Station Radio (MBSR) and are not registered for mobility updates. This is important for ensuring that the network remains secure and efficient, as it prevents unauthorized access to the network.The figure depicts a network scenario where UEs are moving with the Mobile Base Station Radio (MBSR) and are not registered for mobility updates. This is important for ensuring that the network remains secure and efficient, as it prevents unauthorized access to the network.The figure depicts a network scenario where UEs are moving with the Mobile Base Station Radio (MBSR) and are not registered for mobility updates. This is important for ensuring that the network remains secure and efficient, as it prevents unauthorized access to the network.\nFigure 6.17.2.2-1: Avoid mobility registration updates for UEs moving with the MBSR\nThis option follows the below general principles:\n-\tThe MBSR is configured to use a specific TAC reserved for MBSR use in the serving PLMN. The TAC is different from that used by the fixed cells and does not change even when the MBSR migrates to different a NG-RAN.\n-\tWhen the MBSR registers to the serving PLMN, it may be provisioned with the TAC to use. The MBSR can inform the donor gNB-CU of the TAC via F1-AP signalling. Within the context for the MBSR, the donor gNB-CU allocates an MBSR-ID for the MBSR and stores the TAC.\nEditor's note:\tThe necessity of MBSR-ID allocation by the donor gNB-CU and the details of the MBSR-ID are FFS.\n-\tRelated to KI#2, the donor gNB-CU includes the TAC in the Supported TA List of NG SETUP REQUEST message, or the NG CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, as defined in TS 38.413 [19]. The donor gNB-CU adds the UE-AMF ID (e.g. AMF Set ID and AMF Pointer) to the context of the MBSR. When other UEs perform registration and donor gNB-CU selects the same AMF for other UE, this procedure can be skipped.\nEditor's note:\tWhen UE enters the idle state, whether the donor gNB-CU deletes the UE-AMF ID from the context of the MBSR is FFS.\n-\tIn the INITIAL UE MESSAGE, the donor gNB-CU provides the MBSR indication (this may be different from the IAB node Indication) and the MBSR-ID to the UE-AMF. The UE-AMF stores the information and ensures that the TAC for MBSR is included in the TAI list sent to the UE. When selecting the UE-AMF, the gNB-CU takes the MBSR indication into account, so that the AMF-UE can serve a larger area.\n-\tRelated to KI#3, when the MBSR changes donor gNB-CU, it keeps announcing the same TAC. Therefore, the UEs will not perform mobility registrations.\n-\tDuring the MBSR mobility, the MBSR context will be forwarded to the new donor gNB-CU, if full migration is performed. The old donor gNB-CU may perform NG CONFIGURATION UPDATE to remove the TAC from the AMFs, if no other MBSRs context using the same TAC exist on this donor gNB-CU.\n-\tWhen the new donor gNB-CU receives the MBSR context in the HO preparation phase, it checks if the TAC for MBSR has already been reported to the UE-AMFs in the MBSR context. The donor gNB-CU may perform NG SETUP REQUEST or the NG CONFIGURATION UPDATE to inform the UE-AMFs of the TAC for MBSR, if needed.\n-\tIf the new donor gNB-CU determines that it cannot establish the N2 reference point with the UE-AMFs, it indicates that to the MBSR. The MBSR will then change the TAC to broadcast during the full migration phase. This triggers the UEs camped on the MBSR to perform mobility registration and a new UE-AMF to be selected. A new 5G-GUTI will be allocated to the UEs as the result of this procedure.\nEditor's note:\tThe details of TAC change during the full migration phase are FFS and should be coordinated with RAN WGs.\nEditor's note:\tThe UEs connecting the MBSR may experience frequent mobility registration when MBSR moves, e.g., the MBSR broadcasts a different TAC upon every donor gNB-CU changes, which results all UEs have to perform Mobility Registration Update procedures. How to address this issue is FFS.\n-\tWhen a MT service for a UE is required, the AMF-UE is triggered to send a paging message for the UE. The Paging message will be sent to the latest donor gNB-CU that has registered the TAC of the MBSR with the AMF-UE. Optionally, the Paging message can carry also the MBSR-ID, so that the donor gNB-CU receives this Paging messages only triggers over-the-air paging in the corresponding MBSR cell.\nNOTE 1:\tIf no MBSR-ID is provided, the gNB-CU will trigger paging in all cells using this MBSR TAC.\nNOTE 2:\tIf there are multiple MBSRs using the MBSR TAC in the same PLMN, the AMF may trigger paging towards all the MBSRs registered to it with the MBSR TAC, to support UE mobility between the MBSRs using the same TAC without registration.\nEditor's note:\tWhen UE leaves the MBSR and camps on a normal cell whose TAI is also included in the TAI list, the idle UE will not initiate Mobility Registration Update.\n-\tRelated to KI#2, when a UE leaves the MBSR and connects/camps on a fixed cell, it is triggered to perform mobility registration, due to the different TAC used by the fixed cell. Existing procedures as defined in TS 23.502 [5] can be used.\n",

Based on the subscription data obtained in step 2, GMLC performs privacy check for the target UE, only if the result of the privacy check indicates that the UE must either be notified or notified with privacy verification, the GMLC sends the indication to AMF. Based on the indication and if the UE supports LCS notification (according to the UE capability information), the AMF interact with the UE/User for UE/User LCS notification, which requires LCS related UE 5GMM signalling.\nAs described, the result of UE LCS privacy check may require the interaction with UE/User, for the commercial location services which triggers this 5GC-MT-LR Procedure mainly target the end users. Supposing that the existing location service framework and procedures are basically applied to the MBSR because the MBSR is also considered as a UE for the positioning, the UE privacy check procedure for the MBSR needs to be performed.\nThus, in case the positioning of the MBSR is additionally performed for the UE served by an MBSR as described in the solutions #7, #8, #14 and #15, the UE LCS privacy check procedures for MBSR obviously should not be invoked for every UEs' positioning procedure, as it causes delay.\nThis solution addresses the issue and avoids the unnecessary privacy check for the MBSR if MT-LR procedure is triggered by the UE-LMF to obtain the MBSR location.\nIf UE-LMF triggers MT-LR procedure via the MBSR-AMF, because the GMLC is not involved in the procedure, based on the current mechanism above, the privacy check is skipped and thus it is impossible for AMF to receive the indication that UE must either be notified or notified with privacy verification. So the AMF will not check whether the UE supports LCS notification and will not interact with the UE/User for UE/User LCS notification. Thus, in this case, no enhancement is needed to avoid the interaction above.\n",

While this is for sure in general something the study should strive to maximize, the existing IAB configuration has some built in assumptions on the fact the IAB node is a rather trusted entity that also may be preconfigured with OAM sever address and any security credentials. However, the MBSRs are in many cases third party devices that need to be integrated in a PLMN. Solution#10 provides method for the serving PLMN to provide the MBSR with the address of the OAM server and the security credentials to access it. What security credentials are used is up to SA3 and SA5 to decide. The configuration of the MBSR itself can be based on procedures defined by SA5 and RAN WGs and may reuse the existing methods with any enhancements not in scope of SA WG2.\nSolution#2 could be seen as complementary to solutions above and deal more directly with the configuration of the IAB-UE part of the MBSR to e.g. restrict the operation of the MBSR to specific areas , time, or PLMNs.

                    "text_content": "There are six solutions addressing Key Issue#3, Efficient mobility and service continuity when served by mobile base station relay, i.e. solution#4, solution#5, solution#12, solution#13, solution #16, and solution #17:\n-\tSolution #4 and #5 addresses both KI#2 and KI#3. Solution #4 assumes that the TACs potentially will be broadcasted by the MBSR are provided to the UE by the AMF of the UE served by the MBSR, so that the UEs do not need to perform mobility registration when the MBSR changes TACs. In order to support UE mobility management without the mobility registration, some special contexts are created on NG-RAN associated with the MBSR, and in the AMF serving the UEs. These contexts are connected using a new identifier \"Link ID\". With solution#4, the donor gNB is able to support AMF-UE relocation for all the UEs served by this AMF with one N2 signalling. i.e., when UE moves with MBSR, the NG-RAN proxies the UE idle mobility and NG-RAN triggers the UE handover due to MBSR mobility. Solution#4 works with legacy UEs when the UE is served by the MBSR, no mobility registration is performed and therefore 5G-GUTI is not updated even if the UE context transfer is triggered among AMFs. CT WGs and SA3 evaluation is required to confirm that the UE context management at AMF is not broken. Support of the new context at donor gNB and AMF and their maintenance during MBSR mobility requires verification by CT WGs and RAN WG3.\n-\tSolution #5 is based on solution #4 to enhance idle mobility and handover to support mobile terminated services. Solution#5 further creates a special context in AMF serving the MBSR, and associate it with the context in AMF-UE using the Link ID. Interactions between AMF-UE and AMF-MBSR are introduced to maintain the binding of the Link ID. and AMFs are enhanced to redirect the UE paging message from AMF-UE to AMF-MBSR. The AMF-MBSR forwards the paging message to NG-RAN serving the MBSR so that it can be broadcasted by MBSR. The paging forwarding by AMFs needs verification by CT WGs and RAN WG3.\n-\tSolution #12 address KI#3. It proposes to use a full migration approach with a 2-step handover procedure for reducing the service interruption, firstly MBSR handover is performed without F1 anchor change, then UE handover is triggered.  With this solution, the UEs served by MBSR would still experience mobility event even if they remain connected to the same MBSR. Other the other hand, Solution#12 does enhance the existing Xn and N2 handover procedures to support group UE handover and therefore reduces corresponding signalling over Xn and N2. Overall, the principle of this solution is to aggregate the information of group UEs in a single message to support bulk handling in 5GC. When group UEs are accessing the same IAB-node, the commonality is that group UEs share the same user location and AMF. The support of group mobility procedure requires verification of RAN WG3. The solution#12 does not address the IDLE mode mobility aspect when the UEs move together with the MBSR. Additionally, delivery of the RRC messages to the connected UEs requires F1-C connectivity between the source IAB-donor-CU and the migrating MBSR. This F1-C connectivity may have to be carried via the CN if the source IAB-donor-CU and the target IAB-donor do not have Xn and/or IP connectivity. This should be coordinated with RAN WGs.\n-\tSolution #13 address KI#3. It proposes to adopt a partial migration approach that besides the CU of gNB handles the MBSR mobility, a central CU that acts as F1 anchor for as long as practically possible to shield the MBSR mobility from the UEs it serves, which saves the AN signalling for mobility. This requires some discussion and adoption in RAN WGs. An interaction with RAN3 is required to consolidate this approach. The feasibility to support IAB mobility based on the Rel-17 IAB partial migration should be discussed in the RAN WGs. In addition, R18 NR_mobile_IAB in RAN WGs only focuses on full migration (RP-213601). Given that the m-CU cannot cover all possible MBSR operation locations, additional handling from other solutions may needed to complement this solution.\n-\tSolution #16 addressed KI#3. It proposes that the MBSR is configured by the donor gNB to broadcast the TAC of its serving cell. For a UE served by the MBSR, it would observe the TAC change when it moves together with the MBSR across different serving cells, even if it camps on the same MBSR cell. On the other hand, a UE would not be triggered to perform mobility registration when it camps on or leaves the MBSR cell temporarily.\n-\tSolution #17 addressed KI#3. It proposes two options. Option#1 is that the MBSR uses a dedicated TAC, and the TAC remains the same when MBSR moves across different donor gNBs. The donor gNB will add or remove the TAC of the MBSR to UE's AMF(s) when the MBSR connects to leaves it. With this solution, the UE served by MBSR would not perform mobility registration, even when the MBSR changes donor gNBs. Option#2 is that MBSR broadcasts a TAC which maintains unchanged within a certain service area. Once there is no N2 reference point between new IAB-donor gNB and AMF-UEs, the MBSR will change the TAC to broadcast during the full migration phase. This triggers the UEs camped on the MBSR to perform mobility registration.\nThe solutions have RAN impact as following and need RAN coordination:\n1)\tSolution #4 and #5 require NG-RAN to manage MBSR context with Link IDs sent by AMFs via NGAP messages, one Link ID identifies one AMF that serves a group of UEs camp on the MBSR, as well as require NG-RAN to initiate an NGAP message to new AMF with Link ID(s) for AMF relocation when needed.\n2)\tSolution #12 requires NG-RAN to support full migration approach with group handover for UEs. The potential F1-C connectivity via CN needs coordination with RAN WGs.\n3)\tSolution #13 requires NG-RAN to support a partial migration approach with a central CU (m-CU) together with a local CU (gNB-CU).\n4) Solution #16 and #17 need RAN confirmation of the feasibility of updating the UE-AMF regarding the TAC supported by the MBSR via NGAP.\n",

                    "text_content": "For KI#5, the solution #7, #8, #14, #15, solution#18 and solution#19 are related and have the following common and different designs:\n-\tSolution#7 (as updated at SA2#152) proposed that the LMF executes a TRP information procedure and gather information on which TRP is mobile when a MBSR is integrated in any RAN node (including at full migration time if applicable). OAM triggers this procedure and this means that OAM ensures the LMF gathers the info it needs ahead of positioning procedure. then, when the LMF triggers a positioning event towards a RAN node, the LMF determines that one or more of the cells involved in UE positioning operation is a MBSR and the corresponding GPSI (with the serving cell ID) of the MBSR. The LMF uses the GPSI of the MBSR to identify the AMF via UDM serving the MBSR and trigger the positioning procedures for the MBSR via the AMF serving the MBSR. Alternately the LMF, for mobile TRP retrieves the TRP location information from the RAN of the MBSR(s)TRPs by causing the F1-AP to trigger a MO-LR procedure at MBSR IAB-UE (this can avoid contacting the UDM). The LMF uses this location together with the measurements data sets for the Target UE to estimate the location of the Target UE and provides the result to the Target UE's serving AMF. The LMF may instruct the MBSR which the UE is accessing and other cells to start PRS broadcasting. The Target UE may be instructed to perform DL positioning measurements on the cells and report the measurements back to the LMF. The LMF derive from the measurements/cell-ID which measurement data set that belongs to a MBSR.\nThe Target UE may also be instructed to perform DL positioning measurements on the cells and report the measurements back to the LMF. The LMF derive from the measurements/cell-ID which measurement data set that belongs to a MBSR and this triggers the MBSR TRP positioning.\n-\tSolution#8 proposed that the MBSR provides its location to the LMF via NRPPa as part of the UL positioning procedure of the UE (It's not clear if existing NRPPa procedure or new procedure is used), and the MBSR may trigger MO-LR to obtain its own position for this purpose; and for DL positioning of the UE, since the LMF learns that the UE connects to MBSR, the LMF triggers the MBSR to provide its IAB-UE ID (e.g. GPSI) to LMF, which obtains the MBSR positioning and velocity information via MT-LR procedures (i.e. LMF becomes the LCS client initiating request towards GMLC). LMF perform calculation of UE location taking into account the MBSR location and velocity information. For the DL positioning of the UE, the IAB-UE ID (e.g. GPSI) is obtained by the LMF triggered by UE positioning, which introduces additional latency. When multiple UEs accessing the same MBSR need to perform DL positioning, the interaction between LMF and the MBSR via NRPPa message for the purpose of IAB-UE ID retrieval is very redundant. In addition, the AMF also provides LMF with a MBSR indication when the AMF determines that the UE connects to MBSR. During the UL positioning, the NRPPa message including the MBSR location is sent to LMF without the trigger from LMF. Therefore, the MBSR indication from AMF is not necessary for UL positioning.\n-\tSolution#14 proposed that the PLMN level NRF stores the UE ID, cell ID, and the serving AMF of the MBSRs. The AMF serving the UE determines that a UE is accessing via MBSR when received additional ULI, and obtains the AMF information and IAB-UE ID of the MBSR (e.g. SUPI) from the PLMN level NRF. All the information needed for UE positioning can be determined by UE-AMF before LMF initiating a position procedure for a target UE as this is MBSR specific. The AMF provides the information to LMF, which triggers a positioning procedure for the MBSR. The LMF uses the location of the MBSR and the measurement data from the Target UE procedures to estimate the Target UE's location. The two location measurements shall be done at the same time T. During the positioning procedure, this solution does not require any additional interaction between LMF and the RAN.\n-\tSolution#15 proposed that the AMF serving the UE indicates to the LMF the existence of the MBSR. The LMF either obtains the MBSR position information when receiving the measurement reports from MBSR or by querying the MBSR with a specific time information. The interaction between LMF and RAN via NRPPa message to obtain MBSR location introduces additional latency. The MBSR velocity information is taken into consideration to determine the MBSR location at the requested time. The LMF requests the MBSR positioning information via NRPPa procedure similar to obtaining location information of a TRP. It's not clear how MBSR/TRP retrieves the location information.\n-\tSolution #18 proposed that the NG-RAN keeps the 5G-GUTI of the MBSR, and provides that to the UE-AMF in the Initial UE message. All the information needed for UE positioning can be determined by UE-AMF before LMF initiating a position procedure for a target UE as this is MBSR specific. When location request is sent to the LMF, UE-AMF provides also the 5G-GUTI of MBSR, so that additional location procedure for MBSR can be triggered by the LMF. During the positioning procedure, this solution does not require any additional interaction between LMF and the RAN.\n-\tSolution #19 proposed to several options to avoid sending privacy check signalling toward MBSR nodes, in order to optimize the network operations.\nIt is clear from the above that all solutions assume that the AMF serving the UE would need to be informed of the existence of the MBSR. This can be achieved via either an explicit indication from NG-RAN, or the additional ULI information. Solutions 7 and 8 however can derive which TRP in a positioning estimation is mobile and the MBSR UE ID from other means (i.e. NRPPa).\nThe LMF decides that the target UE connects to MBSR based on information received from the AMF. The AMF provides the information to LMF when it determines that the UE connects to MBSR based on the additional information from NG-RAN as described in solution#7, #8, #14, #15 and #18. However, it is not described in solution#15 that how the AMF makes the decision. Furthermore, solution#15 also includes another way for LMF to make the decision, i.e. based on UE positioning capability which is enhanced to include MBSR access provided by UE via LPP. But it is also not described that how the UE determines that it connects to MBSR.\nAll solutions believe that the Target UE shall behave as a legacy UE and no new UE features are needed to support LCS for UEs accessing the network via a MBSR, e.g. the Target UE reports the cell-ID in the DL positioning report to the LMF.\nIn most of the solutions, it is assumed that for the positioning procedure that involves MBSR measurements, the LMF obtains the MBSR location to calculate target UE location. How the LMF derives the location of the MBSR differs between the solutions. The LMF triggers the AMF that serves the MBSR directly (solution #7 with one alternative using UDM, #14 and #18), or the LMF request the GMLC to derive the location (Solution #8). The GMLC will trigger the serving AMF in the next step. In both approaches the LMF needs to obtain the UE-ID of the MBSR. The third approach (in Solution #7 with another alternative, Solution#8 with UL positioning alternative and Solution #15) is that the LMF requests the location and velocity of the MBSR by using modified NRPPa procedure.\nFor Solution#15 and solution 7 with one alternative, the MBSR location is obtained by the UE's LMF using NRPPa query for TRP location, and no UE ID for MBSR is needed.\nHow the LMF resolves the cell-ID may differ slightly between the solutions. In Sol#7 The LMF correlates cell-ID with GPSI of MBSR received by the AMF and/or in TRP information exchanges. In Sol#8 the IAB-donor RAN node provides the GPSI to the LMF. In Sol#14 the AMF-UE queries the PLMN level NRF for the MBSR's SUPI and AMF-ID of the AMF that is serving the MBSR using the cell-ID. The AMF provides this info to the LMF. In Sol#15 the LMF receives the cell-ID with an indication that it is a MBSR from the AMF. In Sol#18, the AMF serving UE provides the cell-ID and AMF ID (e.g. 5G-GUTI of the IAB node) serving the MBSR to the LMF.\nAs indicated in both solution#8 and solution#15, the time of positioning measurements for UE and that for MBSR could be different. In order to reduce positioning error caused by the time difference, it is useful to take MBSR velocity into consideration. This is also applicable to other solutions. Solution#14, solution#7 and solution#18 also touches on ensuring the positioning information to be measured at the same time or as close as possible.\n",

                    "text_content": "For KI#6, the KI definition in clause 5.6 addresses the problem of cell ID/TAC of MBSR not reflecting the location of the UE. The solution#9 (clause 6.9) proposes that the gNB (i.e. IAB-donor gNB) provides the additional ULI (IAB-UE ULI) to the AMF for the UEs when the UEs are connected via a MBSR. The AMF of the UE determines the UE's location by taking the IAB-UE ULI into account.\nThe additional ULI is the cell selected by the MBSR during the registration and managed by the IAB-donor gNB. The details of how to determine the cell that UE is located is a mobile IAB's cell and how to provide additional ULI of IAB-UE on NGAP have RAN dependency.\nConsidering the TAI/NR CGI in additional ULI is managed by gNB, it's static and related to a specific geographic area if the TAI/NR CGI in normal ULI does not reflect a specific geographic area.\nThe geographic area covered by the MBSR is normally also covered by the IAB-donor gNB. Using the additional ULI, together with the normal ULI, to manage mobility related restriction is feasible. However, as below figure 7.6-1 illustrates, there are cases where the additional ULI information of the IAB-UE itself does not provide sufficient information to determine the actual UE location.\nIn this scenario, a UE (User Equipment) is served by a Multi-Band Signal Reconfiguration (MBSR) system, which is designed to optimize signal quality and coverage for various network conditions. The figure depicts the UE's location when served by a MBSR, highlighting the importance of signal strength and the use of multiple frequency bands to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.6-1. Scenario for UE location when served by MBSR\nAs illustrated in figure 7.6-1, depending on the location of the MBSR 1, the UE 1 served by it can be at different locations, e.g. out of coverage of Cell ID 1, or in coverage of Cell ID2. However, according to solution#9, the same additional ULI (e.g. TAC1, Cell ID 1) would be provided to the 5GC.\nTherefore, while providing the additional ULI based on MBSR's serving cell to 5GC can indicate the UE's rough area, it still does not provide accurate location information of the UE1 and could be misleading in some cases. For the 5GC operations that requires more accurate location of the UE (e.g. if Cell 1 has a range of 300m, and Cell 4 has a range of 200m, having two ULIs would only provide a granularity of 500m in UE location), the 5GC would need to obtain the location of the MBSR besides the ULI of MBSR.\nBased on the solutions for KI#5, the LMF of the UE is able to obtain the location information of the MBSR. Therefore, if the AMF requires more accurate ULI information than the combined range, it can obtain the accurate MBSR location from the UE's LMF, which would trigger a NRPPa procedure to query the MBSR location information as a TRP. This should not require triggering the full location service procedure for the UE. Some new indication may be needed in the request to LMF to only request the MBSR location.\n",

The additional ULI includes the TAI/NR CGI of selected by the IAB-Node when it's registered to the network.\n-\tAMF may use the additional ULI, together with the existing ULI, apply the mobility management (e.g. Mobility restriction) and Warning Area List management for Public Warning System.\nNOTE 1:\tProviding additional ULI needs further coordination with RAN WG and further updates may apply.\n-\tThe Solution#9 is recommended for normative specifications as basis for providing serving cell ID/TAC of mobile base station relay to the AMF serving the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case that IAB-UE and IAB-DU are connected to different IAB-donors, the details are subject to RAN WGs, and will be coordinated with RAN WGs.\n",

                    "text_content": "The following conclusions are agreed based on the principles from solution#20:\n- \tCAG Identifier is used to control the access of UE via MBSR (i.e. mobile IAB-node) and existing CAG mechanism defined in clause 5.30.3 of TS 23.501 [2] can be used for managing UE's access to MBSR.\n-\tWhen the MBSR is allowed to be operated as an IAB node for a PLMN, the MBSR is configured, either during the communication with the serving PLMN OAM or pre-configured, with CAG identifier which is unique within the scope of this PLMN. If the MBSR is pre-configured with the PLMN list in which the MBSR is allowed to operate as an IAB node, the corresponding CAG Identifier per PLMN is also configured in the MBSR.\n-\tRAN and CN supports the UE access control based on the CAG identifier associated with the cell and the allowed CAG identifiers for the UE that supports CAG functionality.\n-\tFor the UE that does not support CAG functionality, RAN and CN are allowed to use not only CAG mechanism but also the other existing mechanism e.g. forbidden Tracking Area.\nNOTE 1:\tIf CAG ID associated with MBSR and CAG ID associated with private network, both are broadcasted how to apply access control will be determined during normative phase.\n- \tExtra information (e.g. time duration and location information) may be deployed together with the CAG Identifier for MBSR that UE can access. The enhanced Allowed CAG list will be provided to UE and AMF for enforcement to make sure UE not accessing the MBSR cell outside of the time duration or geographic area, e.g. if the time when a certain CAG is allowed for a UE is up or UE is out of the geographic area, the CAG for the UE is revoked from the network as per TS 23.501 [2]. In normative phase it will be also considered whether a more energy efficient approach based on time and location based information can be pursued.\n-\tExtra information may also be provided with allowed CAG ID list by AMF to the UE for IDLE mode cell access control, e.g. cell (re)selection.\n-\tThe AMF may verify whether UE access via MBSR is allowed by CAG Identifier and corresponding Extra information.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether this Extra information needs to be provided to NG-RAN, e.g. to allow access control for transition from RRC Inactive to RRC Connected state and/or to determine the cells where paging will be performed (as described in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [5]) will be coordinated with RAN WGs in normative phase.\nNOTE 3:\tControl of the MBSR access to the serving network is based on normal mobility restriction management based on subscription data form MBSR (i.e. IAB-UE).\n\n",
