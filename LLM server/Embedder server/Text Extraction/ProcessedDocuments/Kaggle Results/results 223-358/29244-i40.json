In the rest of this specification, no difference is made between Sxa and Sxa', or between Sxb and Sxb'. The Sxa' and Sxb' reference points reuse the protocol specified for the Sxa and Sxb reference points, but comply in addition with the security requirements specified in clause 8 of 3GPP 33.107 [20].\n-\tthe N4 interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].\n-\tthe N4mb interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [72].\nIn this specification the term CP function applies to control plane nodes such as SGW-C, PGW-C, TDF-C, SMF and MB-SMF.\nIn this specification the term UP function applies to user plane nodes such as SGW-U, PGW-U, TDF-U, UPF and MB-UPF.\nThe prefix PFCP in message and procedure names is used to indicate that messages and procedures are common and used on Sx, N4 and N4mb reference points. A PFCP session refers to both Sx and/or N4 sessions, or to an N4mb session. A PFCP association is established between a CP function and a UP function, i.e., for EPC, between an SGW-C/PGW-C/TDF-C and an SGW-U/PGW-U/TDF-U, and for 5GC, between an SMF and a UPF or between an MB-SMF and MB-UPF.\nIn the related stage 2 specifications the prefix Sx, N4 and N4mb is used for these common procedures realised by PFCP.\nClauses or paragraphs that only apply to EPC or 5GC are indicated by the label \"for EPC\" or \"for 5GC\".\n",

A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].\nAssociated PDU Session: A PDU Session associated to a multicast session that is used for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method and for signalling related to a user's participation in a multicast session such as join and leave requests.\nAssociated QoS Flow: A unicast QoS Flow that belongs to the associated PDU Session and is used for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method. The associated QoS Flow is mapped from a multicast QoS Flow in a multicast MBS session.\nCommon Tunnel EndPoint Identifier (C-TEID): See definition in clause 3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]. It is used for the delivery of user plane traffic using multicast transport via a common GTP-U tunnel to NG-RAN nodes over N3mb and/or to UPFs over N19mb.\nCP function: A node with a Control Plane function (see 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]) supporting one or more PFCP entities. A Control Plane function, i.e. a Control Plane Node, is identified by the Node ID that is set to either an FQDN or an IP address.\nLow Layer Source Specific Multicast address (LLSSM): It is used to deliver user plane traffic using multicast transport to NG-RAN nodes over N3mb and/or to UPFs over N19mb. The destination multicast IP address identifies the multicast group, while the related unicast source IP address identifies the source of the multicast traffic (MB-UPF). The MB-UPF sets the outer header of the DL UP packets with the respective source IP address and destination multicast IP address.\nMatch Field: a field of the Packet Detection Information of a Packet Detection Rule against which a packet is attempted to be matched.\nMatching: comparing the set of header fields of a packet to the match fields of the Packet Detection Information of a Packet Detection Rule.\nMBS ingress address: It is used for the delivery of DL MBS UP traffic using unicast transport to the MB-UPF over N6mb or Nmb9 interface. The MBS ingress address identifies the MB-UPF's unicast IP address and port number for receiving DL data.\nMulticast transport: the delivery of user plane traffic by IP multicast transport, as opposed to IP unicast transport. Multicast transport is supported over N3mb, N19mb and N6mb interfaces, but is not supported over Nmb9.\nNode: Either a CP function or an UP function supporting one or more PFCP entities. A Node is identified by the Node ID, which is set to either an FQDN or an IP address.\nPFCP Entity: An endpoint in a CP (or UP) function supporting PFCP, that is identified by the IP address. The IP address of a PFCP entity may or may not be the IP address included in the Node ID.\nSource Specific Multicast address (SSM): It is used to deliver user plane traffic using multicast transport. The destination multicast IP address identifies the multicast group, while the related unicast source IP address identifies the source of the multicast data (e.g. AF/AS or MBSTF).\nUnicast transport: the delivery of user plane traffic by IP unicast transport, as opposed to IP multicast transport. For MBS, unicast transport is supported over N3mb, N19mb, N6mb and Nmb9 interfaces.\nUP function: A node with a User Plane function (see 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]) supporting one or more PFCP entities. A User Plane function, i.e. a User Plane Node, is identified by the Node ID that is set to either a FQDN or an IP address.\n",

These parameters may remain configured in the FAR regardless of the Apply Action parameter value, to minimize the changes to the FAR during the transitions of the UE between the idle and connected modes. The buffering parameters, when present, shall be provisioned in a BAR created at the PFCP session level and referenced by the FAR.\nNOTE 1:\tBuffering refers here to the buffering of the packet in the UP function. The UP function is instructed to forward DL packets to the CP function when applying buffering in the CP function. See clause 5.3.1.\n-\tzero, one or more QERs, which contains instructions related to the QoS enforcement of the traffic;\n-\tzero, one or more URRs, which contains instructions related to traffic measurement and reporting.\n-\tzero or one MAR, which contains instructions related to Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) for the downlink traffic of a Multi-Access (MA) PDU session. See clause 5.2.7.\nNOTE 2:\tA downlink PDR can be associated with two FARs for an N4 session established for an MA PDU session as an MAR contains two FARs for 3GPP and non-3GPP respectively.\nA FAR, a QER, an URR and an MAR shall only be associated to one or multiple PDRs of the same PFCP session context.\nThe QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be assigned by the CP function to correlate QERs from multiple PFCP session contexts. For instance, the enforcement of APN-AMBR in the PGW-U shall be achieved by setting the same QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID to the QERs from different PFCP sessions associated with all the PDRs corresponding to the non-GBR bearers of all the UE's PDN connections to the same APN. The QERs that are associated to the same QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID in multiple PFCP sessions shall be provisioned, with the same QER contents, in each of these PFCP sessions. The QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be only used to enforce the APN-AMBR when the UE is in EPC, it may be provided by the CP function over N4 to the UP function for a PDU session may move to EPC in a later stage.\nThe following principles shall apply for the provisioning of PDRs in the UP function:\n-\tEvery PDR provisioned for a PFCP session shall allow to identify the PFCP session, i.e. every PDR shall contain the information element(s) to identify the PFCP session, which is either a Traffic Endpoint Identifier (if the PDI Optimization feature is supported) or equivalent information, e.g. UE IP address, Local F-TEID, Framed-Route, in the PDI IE.\n-\tThe CP function shall not provision more than one PDR with the same match fields in the PDI (i.e. with the same set of match fields and with the same value). The CP function may provision PDRs with the same value for a subset of the match fields of the PDI but not all;\n-\tdifferent PDRs of a same PFCP session may overlap, e.g. the CP function may provision two PDRs which differ by having one match field set to a specific value in one PDR and the same match field not included in the other PDR (thus matching any possible value);\n-\tdifferent PDRs of different PFCP sessions, not including the Packet Replication and Detection Carry-On Information IE, shall not overlap, i.e. PDRs in each PFCP session shall differ by at least one different (and not wildcarded) match field in their PDI, such that any incoming user plane packet may only match PDRs of a single PFCP session;\n-\tAs an exception to the previous principle, the CP function may provision a PDR with all match fields wildcarded (i.e. all match fields omitted in the PDI) in a separate PFCP session, to control how the UP function shall process packets unmatched by any PDRs of any other PFCP session. The CP function may provision the UP function to send these packets to the CP function or to drop them. The UP function shall grant the lowest precedence to this PDR.\n-\tdifferent PDRs of different PFCP sessions, including the Packet Replication and Detection Carry-On Information IE, may overlap. The Detection Carry-On Indication indicates that the UP function shall proceed with the look-up of other PDRs of other PFCP sessions matching the packet. This is used for broadcast traffic forwarding in 5G VN Group Communication.\n-\tdifferent downlink PDRs of different PFCP sessions, with a PDI including the IP multicast IP address IE, may overlap. The UP function shall proceed with the look-up of other PDRs of other PFCP sessions matching the packet. This is used for downlink IP multicast traffic for IPTV service (see clause 5.25).\n-\tdifferent downlink PDRs of different PFCP sessions, with a PDI including the MBS Session Identifier, may overlap. The UPF shall proceed with the look-up of other PDRs of other PFCP sessions with the same MBS Session Identifier matching the packets. This is used for multicast MBS services in 5GS using 5GC Individual Traffic Delivery (see clause 5.34).\nOn receipt of a user plane packet, the UP function shall perform a lookup of the provisioned PDRs in the UP function to identify only one PDR in a PFCP session according to the following steps:\n-\tidentify first the PFCP session to which the packet corresponds; and\n-\tfind the first PDR matching the incoming packet, among all the PDRs provisioned for this PFCP session, starting with the PDRs with the highest precedence and continuing then with PDRs in decreasing order of precedence. Only the highest precedence PDR matching the packet shall be selected, i.e. the UP function shall stop the PDRs lookup once a matching PDR is found.\nA packet matches a PDR if all the match fields which are identified with different IE type in the PDI of the PDR are matching the corresponding packet header fields unless specified otherwise. If a match field is not included in the PDI, it shall be considered as matching all possible values in the header field of the packet. If the match field is present and does not include a mask, the match field shall be considered as matching the corresponding header field of the packet if it has the same value. If the match field is present and includes a mask (e.g. IP address with a prefix mask), the match field shall be considered as matching the corresponding header field of the packet if it has the same value for the bits which are set in the mask. If a match field has multiple instances, i.e. there are several IEs with the same IE type, a packet matches this match field if any instance is matching the corresponding packet header field.\nThe match fields of the PDI shall correspond to outer and/or inner packet header fields, e.g. uplink bearer binding verification in the PGW-U may be achieved by configuring a PDR with the PDI containing the local GTP-U F-TEID (for outer IP packet matching) and the SDF filters of the data flows mapped to the bearer (for inner IP packet matching).\nNOTE 3:\tA DL PDR can be provisioned with a UE IP address together with a Framed-Route or a Framed-IPv6-Rotue either in the PDI IE or in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE; in such case, the PDR is matched if the packet matches either the UE IP address or the Framed-Route (Framed-IPv6-Route).\nWhen one or more pre-defined PDR(s) are activated for a given PDR (see clause 5.19), an incoming packet matches the PDR if it matches one of activated pre-defined PDR(s).\nThe UP function should drop packets unmatched by any PDRs.\nThe packet processing flow in the UP function is illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-1.\nThe figure depicts the packet processing flow in the Up function of a 5G network, illustrating the various steps involved in data transmission. The flow starts at the source device (e.g., a smartphone) and ends at the destination device (e.g., a smart home appliance). Key components include the source device, the Up function, the network, and the destination device. The figure highlights the importance of efficient packet processing in 5G networks, ensuring high data rates and low latency.\nFigure 5.2.1-1: Packet processing flow in the UP function\nAt the deletion of a PFCP session, the UP function shall delete the PFCP session context and all the associated non-preconfigured rules.\nNOTE 4:\tDeleting a QER in one PFCP session does not result in deleting another QER in another PFCP session even when these two QERs have the same QER ID and/or are associated with the same QER Correlation ID.\nA UP Function controlled by multiple CP functions shall handle Rule IDs from the different CP functions independently from each other.\nRule ID used for PDR, FAR, BAR, QER, URR or MAR is uniquely identifying a rule of the corresponding rule type within a session.\nFor an MA-PDU session, IP addresses translation for MPTCP traffic (see Annex E.3) is independent from the handling of URR/QER/BAR, but it shall be performed before applying the FAR (e.g. before creating the outer header and forwarding the packet).\n",

For 5GC, the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold can be armed in a UPF for triggering the SMF Pause of Charging feature (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]).\n-\ta Measurement Information with the 'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag set to \"1\", to request the UP function to measure the traffic usage before any enforcement, e.g. bitrate enforcement for QoS, Gate control enforcement (as specified in clause 5.4.3) or packets dropped as requested by the FAR;\n-\ta Measurement Information with the 'Measurement of Number of Packets' flag set to \"1\", to request the UP function to measure the number of packets be transferred in UL/DL/Total in addition to the measurement in octets, if the UP function supports the MNOP feature.\nFor the time-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:\n-\ta Time Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report when the measured traffic reaches the threshold;\n-\ta Time Quota, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Time Threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the measured traffic reaches the quota;\n-\ta Measurement Information with the \"Immediate Start Time Metering\" flag set to \"1\", to request the UP function to start time metering immediately at receiving the flag; otherwise, the UP function shall start time metering when the first packet is received; and/or\n-\tan Inactivity Detection Time, to request the UP function to suspend the time measurement when no packets are received during the provisioned Inactivity Detection Time. The time measurement shall then be resumed by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. If an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity Detection Time has been provided by the CP function, the time measurement shall be performed continuously until a new non-zero Inactivity Detection Time is received or the time-based usage measurement is stopped. See Figure 5.2.2.2-1:\nThe figure depicts a charging station with an integrated distribution transformer (IDT) and a power distribution unit (PDU). The IDT is responsible for converting AC power from the grid into DC power for the PDU, which then distributes the DC power to the charging stations. The PDU is responsible for managing the charging process, including monitoring the charging status of the stations and adjusting the charging rates accordingly. The figure illustrates the integration of these components, highlighting the importance of proper design and installation to ensure efficient and safe charging.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-1: IDT based charging\nNOTE 2:\tThe Inactivity Detection Time can be set to the Quota Consumption Timer if received. The Inactivity Detection Time is not used to control when the time metering starts.\n-\tFor EPC, a Time Quota Mechanism, including a Base Time Interval Type, which is either Continuous Time Period (CTP) or Discrete Time Period (DTP), and a Base Time Interval (BTI), to the UP function. See clause 6.5.7 in 3GPP TS 32.299 [18].\n-\tFor CTP (Continuous Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time that traffic has occurred up to the first Base Time Interval (BTI) which contains no traffic. The time measurement shall include the last Base Time Interval, i.e. the one which contained no traffic. The time measurement resumes by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. See Figure 5.2.2.2-2:\nThe figure depicts a charging station with a CTP (Charging Point Terminal) system, which is a key component in the charging infrastructure of electric vehicles. The CTP is responsible for charging the vehicle's battery, and the figure illustrates the various components and their connections, including the CTP, the charging cable, and the vehicle's battery. The figure also shows the charging station's layout, including the charging ports, the charging cables, and the power supply. The CTP is connected to the vehicle's battery through a charging cable, which is then connected to the vehicle's electrical system. The figure provides a clear and detailed representation of the charging station's components and their connections, making it easier to understand the charging process and the overall charging infrastructure.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-2: CTP based charging\n-\tFor DTP (Descrete Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time that traffic has occurred up to the Base Time Interval end. The time measurement shall be resumed by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. See Figure 5.2.2.2-3:\nThe figure depicts a charging station with DTP (Direct To Power) technology, which allows for direct power transfer between the charging station and the vehicle. The charging station features a charging port, a power source, and a display for monitoring the charging process. The DTP technology ensures efficient and fast charging, reducing the time it takes to charge the vehicle.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-3: DTP based charging\nWhen the time-based measurement method applies, and when the Envelope Reporting is required for EPC, the CP function shall request the UP function to report the usage by setting the reporting trigger to Envelope Closure in addition to other Reporting Trigger(s), in the Reporting Triggers IE. The CP function may indicate the UP function to report for just time, time and volume, time and events, or time and volume and number of events by setting Measurement Method accordingly. The CP function may set the Reduced Application Detection Information flag in the Measurement Information of the URR, when requesting the detection of start and stop of an application solely for the purpose of envelope reporting for EPC.\nThe CP function may provision a Volume Threshold IE, a Volume Quota IE, or both (and/or respectively a Time/Event Threshold IE, a Time/Event Quota IE, or both). In such a case, the CP function may set the reporting trigger for threshold (VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH) and/or the reporting trigger for quota (VOLQU/TIMQU/EVEQU)) in the Reporting Triggers IE.\nWhen both a Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE and a Volume (or Time or Event) Quota IE are provisioned and only the reporting trigger for threshold (VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH) is set, the UP function shall send a usage report only when reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold. When subsequently reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Quota, the UP function shall stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) without sending a new usage report to the CP function.\nIf both a Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE and a Volume (or Time or Event) Quota IE are provisioned and both of the respective Threshold and Quota reporting triggers are set, the UP function shall send a usage report when reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold and also later on when subsequently reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Quota.\nNOTE 3:\tA UP Function complying with Release 14 or Release 15 of the specification only sends one usage report when the threshold is reached, even if both reporting triggers (for the threshold and the quota) are set.\nNOTE 4:\tAfter sending a usage report on reaching a threshold, the UP function typically gets a new quota before the earlier provisioned quota exhausts. This implies that the UP function typically sends a quota report when reaching the final quota.\nNOTE 5:\tFor online charging, the Volume Threshold (or Time Threshold) can be set in a PGW-U or TDF-U to the value of the granted volume (or time) quota minus the volume (or time) quota threshold, such as to get a usage report from the UP function when the volume (or time) based credit falls below the remaining quota thresholds provided by the OCS.\nNOTE 6:\tThe Volume Quota or Time Quota can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for online charging to enable the traffic to be forwarded up to an intermediate or final quotas granted by the OCS. The CP function can provision both a Volume (or Time) Threshold and a Volume (or Time) Threshold to request the UP function to:\n-\tsend a usage report when the consumed resources reach the volume (or time) usage threshold provided by the OCS, and\n-\tto stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function), without sending a second usage report, when the granted volume (or time) quota is exhausted.\nFor event based measurement method, the CP function may provision:\n-\tthe Event Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report when the number of events reaches the event threshold;\n-\tthe Event Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets applicable to the event (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Event threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the number of events reaches the event quota;\nNOTE 7:\tAn event is preconfigured with one or more event detection logic in the UPF. Each event detection logic is associated with an Application ID. The CP function activates the detection and reporting of an event by provisioning PDR(s) with the PDI set to an Application ID and by provisioning a URR with an event threshold or event quota reporting trigger. The CP function identifies an event reported in a Usage Report by the URR ID.\nFor all the measurement methods (i.e. volume, time or event), the CP function may also provision:\n-\ta Quota Holding Time, to request the UP function to send a usage report and to also stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) when no packets have been received for the duration indicated in this parameter;\nNOTE 8:\tA Quota Holding Time can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for online charging to request the UP function to send a Usage Report when the Quota Holding Time provided by the OCS (see 3GPP TS 32.299 [18]) expires. The UP function can be instructed in the same Usage Reporting Rule with the Report Triggers – START to generate a new Usage Report upon receiving any subsequent packets associated with this URR.\n-\ta Quota Validity Time, if the VTIME feature is supported by UP function, to request the UP function to send a usage report after the validity duration is over. After Quota validity timer expiry, if packets are received on UPF, the UPF shall stop forwarding packets or only allow forwarding of limited user plane traffic, based on operator's policy in the UP function;\nNOTE 9:\tAfter sending the usage report triggered by the QUHTI or QUVTI (i.e. the Quota Holding Time or Quota Validity Time expires), any remaining quota for the URR is discarded in the UP function.\n-\ta Monitoring Time IE and zero or more Additional Monitoring IEs, to request the UP function to measure the network resources usage before and after the monitoring time in separate counts and to re-apply the volume and/or time, and/or event thresholds at the monitoring time. The CP function may additionally provision a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE and/or a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Quota IE, for a volume (or time or event) based measurement. When being provisioned with a Monitoring Time, the UP function shall:\n-\treset its usage thresholds at the monitoring time to the value provided in the Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE, if provisioned in the URR, or to the remaining value of the Volume (or Time or Event) threshold used before the monitoring time (i.e. excluding the already accumulated volume or time usage);\n-\tshall indicate the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the Monitoring time in separate usage reports as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1;\n-\tan Measurement Period, indicating the period to generate periodic usage reports to the CP function.\n-\tan User Plane Inactivity Timer, to request the UP function to send an usage report when no packets have been received for any of the PDRs associated to the URR for the duration indicated in this parameter.\nIf the UP function indicated support of the Quota Action feature in the UP Function Features IE, when the CP function provisions a Volume Quota or Time Quota or Event Quota in a URR, the CP function may also provision the \"FAR ID for Quota Action\" IE identifying the substitute FAR the UP function shall apply, for the traffic identified by the PDR to which the URR is associated, when exhausting any of these quotas. This FAR may require the UP function to drop the packets or buffer the packets or redirect the traffic towards a redirect destination as specified in clause 5.4.7.\nIf the UP function has indicated support of the QUASF feature as specified in clause 8.2.25, and when the CP function provisions a Volume Quota, Time Quota, or Event Quota in a URR, the CP function may also provision the Exempted Application ID for Quota Action IE or the Exempted SDF Filter for Quota Action IE, to instruct the UP function, that traffic matching the associated PDR(s) and matching the Application ID(s) or SDF Filter(s) shall be handled based on the FAR associated with the PDR as normal, even when the quota has been exhausted.\nNOTE 10:\tThe traffic forwarded after the quota has been exhausted need not to be measured.\nNOTE 11:\tA PDR can be associated with multiple URRs. If one of these URRs requires the UP function to drop the user data packets, e.g. when the Quota has been exhausted, the other URRs associated to the PDR need also to stop their measurements, except for URRs including the Measurement Information with the 'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag set to \"1\".\nThe CP function may request at any time the UP function to activate or deactivate a network resources usage measurement, using the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR.\nNOTE 12:\tThis can be used in a PGW-U for the PGW Pause of Charging procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]).\nWhen the NSPOC feature as specified in clause 5.30 is supported by the CP and UP function, the CP function may provision:\n-\tan Measurement Information with the 'Send Start Pause of Charging' Flag set to \"1\", to request the UP function (SGW-U or I/V-UPF) to send a Start Pause of Charging indication to the upstream GTP-U entity(s) when the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold is reached.\n-\tan Measurement Information with the 'Applicable for Start of Pause of Charging' Flag set to \"1\", to indicate the UP function to stop the usage measurement for the URR when receiving Start Pause of Charging indication from the peer downstream GTP-U entity.\nWhen the NSPOC feature is supported by the CP and UP functions, the CP function may use the \"SUMPC\" and \"RUMUC\" flags in the PFCPSMReq-Flags IE, and the \"SUMPC\" flag in the PFCPSEReq-Flags IE, to request the UP function to stop or resume the usage measurement for all URRs with the ASPOC flag set to \"1\". The CP function may set the \"CIAM\" flag in the Measurement Information IE in a Create URR or a Update URR IE to request the UP function to stop or resume the usage measurement according to the value of the Inactive Measurement flag for a specific URR with the \"ASPOC\" flag set to \"1\" if necessary. See also clause 5.30.\nThe CP function may request the UP function to measure network resources usage and generate the corresponding Usage Reports only for a number of times, by provisioning the \"Number of Reports\" IE in a URR, if the UP function supports the NORP feature (see clause 8.2.25-1). If so, the URR shall become inactive in the UP function after the requested \"Number of Reports\" have been reported.\nThe CP function may resume the measurement for an inactive URR by setting the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR to \"0\" in the Update URR IE in a PFCP Session Modification Request message, with or without the Number of Report IE if the URR was deactivated by setting the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR to from \"0\" to \"1\".\nFor any other cases, i.e. the URR becoming inactive, which is not caused by changing the Inactive Measurement flag from \"0\" to \"1\", the CP may resume the URR:\n-\tby provisioning a Number of Report IE with a (new) non-zero value (to receive the corresponding number of usage reports) or with a null length (to request UP function to perform continous measurement) when the requested Number of Reports has been reached;\n-\tby setting the CIAM flag to \"1\" and the INAM flag to \"0\" if the URR was provisioned with ASPOC bit set to \"1\" in the Update URR (for the URR) when the CP function has requested to stop usage measurement for pause of charging by setting the SUMPC flag to \"1\"; or\n-\tby associating (new) PDR(s) with the URR when the last PDR associated with the URR has been removed.\nIf the CP function wishes the UP function to perform continuous measurement for a URR which was provisioned with a Number of Reports (i.e. to no longer limit the number of reports to be generated), the CP function shall provide the Number of Reports IE in the Update URR with a null length to delete the limit on the number of reports to be generated.\nNOTE 13:\tThe Number of Reports can be provisioned in an URR regardless which Measurement Method is used.\nFor EPC, when the Credit Pool feature is supported and the CP function (e.g. PGW-C) is instructed to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session, the CP function shall create a URR for the Credit Pool, and in this URR, the CP function:\n-\tshall include one Aggregated URR ID IE per URR sharing the credit pool, including the URR ID of the URR sharing the credit pool and the associated Multiplier to measure the abstract service units the corresponding traffic consumes from the credit pool;\n-\tshall set the Time or Volume Threshold or Quota IE to the value calculated as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16] according to the Measurement Method.\nNOTE 1:\tThe value can be calculated using the following formula:\nS = Q1*M1 + Q2*M2 + ... + Qn*Mn,\nwhere the S is the quota for the credit pool, Qn is the quota and Mn is the multiplier for each Rating Group (RG) which are provided via the Multiple Services Credit Control from the OCS.\nAn URRn is defined for each of RG.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the Measurement Method is set to the combined volume/duration, the Time and Volume\tThreshold or Quota are calculated independently.\n-\tmay set the Reporting Trigger to reporting upon reaching a volume or time threshold or quota;\n-\tmay set the Measurement Method to the data volume, duration (i.e. time), combined volume/duration according to the Measurement Method set in the URRs in the Credit Pool.\nNOTE 3:\tThe UP function is instructed to handle a Credit Pool when a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP is included within a Multiple Services Credit Control from the OCS. A Credit Pool is identified by the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP. See clause 6.3.11, 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [18].\nIn addition, the CP function shall also include the Linked URR IE, set to the Credit Pool URR ID, in all the URRs which are sharing the credit pool (i.e. which are associated with RGs sharing the Credit Pool).\nWhen detecting that a provisioned reporting trigger occurs, the UP function shall generate a Usage Report for the related URR and send it to the CP function by initiating the PFCP Session Report procedure.\nWhen providing usage report information for a URR in a message, the UP function shall include the UR-SEQN (Usage Report Sequence Number) identifying the order in which a Usage Report is generated for the given URR. The UR-SEQN (Usage Report Sequence Number) shall be set to \"0\" for the first Usage Report and incremented for every subsequent Usage Report generated by the UP function for the URR. The UP function shall also indicate the trigger that causes the usage report to be generated in the Usage Report Trigger IE.\nUpon generating a usage report for an URR towards the CP function, the UP function shall:\n-\treset its ongoing measurement counts for the related URR (i.e. the UP function shall report in a usage report the network resources usage measurement since the last usage report for that URR);\n-\tre-apply all the thresholds (Volume/Time/Event Threshold) provisioned for the related URR, if the usage report was triggered due to one of the thresholds being reached, i.e. upon the reporting triggers VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH; otherwise, if the usage report was triggered for other reporting triggers, adjust the thresholds (Volume/Time/Event Threshold) respectively by subtracting the (volume/time/event) reported usage in the usage report to determine when to generate the next report for reporting triggers VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH;\n-\twhen the quota (Volume/Time/Event Quota) is provisioned in the URR:\n-\tadjust the quota for volume/time/event respectively by subtracting the (volume/time/event) reported usage in the usage report and use it when applying quota related handling, e.g. to drop or buffer the packets, or apply FAR ID for Quota Action (if provisioned) when the quota becomes \"0\" and to generate the relevant usage report if the corresponding reporting trigger(s)(VOLQU/TIMQU/EVEQU) is set;\n-\tconsider no quota left for the URR when the usage report was triggered for the reporting triggers QUHTI and QUVTI; and\n-\tcontinue to apply the remaining provisioned parameters in the URR and perform the related network resources usage measurement(s), until getting any further instruction from the CP function.\nWhen receiving a new threshold and/or quota from the CP function for a measurement that is already ongoing in the UP function, the UP function shall consider its ongoing measurements counts for the related URR against the new threshold and/or quota to determine when to send its next usage report to the CP function or to apply quota handling, i.e. the UP function shall discard any remaining quota.\nAt receiving a quota with value set to zero, the UP function shall:\n-\thandle packets based on the FAR associated with the PDR, if the packets match the Application ID(s) or the SDF Filter(s) provisioned in the IE Exempted Application ID for Quota Action or the Exempted SDF Filter for Quota Action;\n-\tapply the FAR identified in the FAR ID for Quota Action IE if the CP function has provisioned it, otherwise the UP function shall stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function); and\n-\treport in a usage report the network resources usage measurement since the last usage report for that URR, if applicable.\nWhen the UP function receives a non-zero quota for the same URR in one subsequent PFCP Session Modification Request message, the UP function shall apply the (normal) FAR associated with the PDR (detecting the application traffic) for the buffered traffic if the FAR ID for Quota Action was set to buffer the application traffic at zero quota (either be provisioned with zero quota earlier or the quota has been exhausted).\nNOTE 1:\tThe UP function determines when to send its next usage report to the CP function by deducting from the newly provisioned threshold or quota the traffic it has forwarded since its last usage report. As an example, if the UP function has forwarded 10 Mbytes of traffic since it last usage report to the CP function and the CP function provisions a new volume threshold or quota of 100 Mbytes, the UP function sends its next usage report upon forwarding an additional 90 Mbytes traffic.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen receiving a new threshold or quota from the CP function for a measurement that is already ongoing in the UP function and if the UP function has already generated the usage report but had not sent it, the UP function can send the usage report before performing the update of the URR.\nNOTE 3:\tA URR with the quota set to 0 can be provisioned when a service data flow is not allowed to start before quota is allocated to the service. See clause 5.4.11.\nWhen reporting the network resources usage before and after a Monitoring Time, the UP function shall send two Usage Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. PFCP Session Report Request) for the same URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then include the Usage Information IE indicating whether the reported network resource usage was consumed before or after the Monitoring Time. Omission of this IE in a Usage Report indicates that no monitoring time has occurred. The UP function shall send Usage Reports soon after the occurrence of the Monitoring Time. For a URR, when multiple (Additional) Monitoring Time IEs are provisioned, or a new Monitoring Time is provisioned after the previous Monitoring Time has passed, the UP function may not be able to send the usage report with the Usage Information set to \"AFT\" for the previous Monitoring Time if there is no Reporting Trigger armed before the next Monitoring Time is reached; in such case, the UP function may send multiple usage reports with the Usage Information set to \"BEF\", together with one usage report with the Usage Information set to \"AFT\".\nNOTE 4:\tThe UP function needs to take care to smooth the signalling load towards the CP function if Usage Reports need to be generated for a large number of PFCP sessions after the occurrence of the Monitoring Time.\nFor the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall report the traffic usage after any QoS enforcement. Additionally, if the CP function requested to measure the traffic usage before QoS enforcement, the UP function shall also report corresponding measurements, when measurements needs to be reported for the traffic usage after QoS enforcement, by sending two Usage Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. PFCP Session Report Request) for the same URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then include the Usage Information IE indicating whether the reported network resource usage corresponds to the traffic before or after QoS enforcement. Thresholds provisioned in a URR shall apply to the traffic usage after any QoS enforcement.\nFor the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall include all the counters (Total, Uplink and Downlink) of the URR in the Volume Measurement IE in the Usage Report IE; the UP function shall also include the number of packets counted for Total, Uplink, Downlink in the Volume Measurement IE if requested by the CP function and if the UP function supports the MNOP feature.\nAn usage report triggered only due to the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold (DROTH) or Start of Traffic (START), or MAC Address Reporting (MACAR), or IP Multicast Join/Leave (IPMJL) shall not contain any measurement information, i.e. either the Volume/Duration Measurement set to zero or Volume/Duration Measurement IE is not present.\nWhen being instructed to remove a URR or the last PDR associated to a URR, the UP function shall stop its ongoing measurements for the URR and include a Usage Report in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in an additional PFCP Session Report Request if there are non-null measurements to report for the URR. When being instructed to remove the last PDR associated to a URR, the UP function shall keep the URR and reset any measurement for the URR.\nNOTE 5:\tA URR provisioned in a PFCP session can be provisioned/kept in the UP function without being associated with any PDR and the URR can be associated with a PDR in a later stage. The UP function will not remember any remaining quota and will consider the quota (if provisioned) as it was provisioned.\nWhen being instructed to deactivate a network resources usage measurement via the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR, the UP function shall stop measuring the network resources usage (against the volume/time/event threshold/quota) and store the current measurement counts which will be resumed when the URR is activated again. The UP function shall not generate a usage report upon the deactivation of the URR and it shall send a usage report during the period when the URR is deactivated for the following scenarios:\n-\tif the Quota Holding Time is expired and if the reporting trigger QUHTI is set;\n-\tif the Quota Validity Time is expired and if the reporting trigger QUVTI is set;\nNOTE 6:\tThe Quota Holding Time can have been started before the URR is deactivated or starts from the moment when the URR is deactivated since no quota will be consumed.\n-\tif it is the time for a periodic reporting and if the reporting trigger PERIO is set;\n-\tif it is required to send a usage report for this URR when a usage report is reported for a linked URR and if the reporting trigger LIUSA is set;\n-\tif it is required to send an immeditate report upon a query for the URR, or the URR is removed, dissociated from the last PDR;\nNOTE 7:\tMultiple usage reports can be required to be reported to the CP function when deleting a PDR that is the last one to be associated to multiple URRs.\n-\tif the User Plane Inactivity Timer is expired and if the reporting trigger UPINT is set.\nNOTE 8:\tThe User Plane Inactivity Timer can have been started before the URR is deactivated.\nThe CP function may request the UP function, in a PFCP Session Modification Request, to report its ongoing network resources measurement for one or multiple URRs of the PFCP session. In this case, the UP function shall:\n-\tgenerate usage report(s) (based on the existing definition of any URR(s) included in the PFCP Session Modification Request message before any update) for the URR(s) being queried and for any associated linked usage reports (see clause 5.2.2.4) for which there are non-null measurements to report;\n-\tinclude them in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in additional PFCP Session Report Request messages; and\n-\tproceed as specified above upon generating a usage report for a URR towards the CP function, with the following additions:\n-\tif the PFCP Session Modification Request includes the Update URR IE (for the URR being queried) with a Volume or Time Threshold, the UP function shall re-apply the threshold received in the request;\n-\totherwise, if a threshold and/or a quota had been set for the URR that is queried, since the usage report is not triggered due to the threshold being reached, the UP function shall adjust the threshold and/or quota by subtracting the time/volume reported in the usage report to determine when to generate the next report.\nNOTE 9:\tUpon reaching a threshold that was adjusted due to a URR query as specified above, the UP function re-applies then the threshold that was provisioned in the URR (i.e. not the value of the adjusted threshold).\nNOTE 10:\tThe CP function can query a URR without including a Volume or Time Threshold in the PFCP Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a traffic volume/service container (see clause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251 [17]).\nNOTE 11:\tThe CP function can query a URR including a Volume or Time Threshold in the PFCP Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a CDR (see clause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251 [17]). In such a case, the CP function can include the same threshold for the URR being queried in the Update URR IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request message to trigger the UP function to re-apply the threshold.\nNOTE 12:\tIt is up to the CP function to request the UP function to generate an immediate report (or not) as specified above when the CP function modifies a URR or any other rules of the PFCP session. As an exception, the UP function always generates an immediate report when being instructed to remove a URR.\nWhen additional usage reports need to be sent in additional PFCP Session Report Request messages, i.e. when not all usage reports can be included in the PFCP Session Modification Response message, the UP function shall indicate, in the PFCP Session Modification Response message, either:\n-\tthat more usage reports will follow, by setting the AURI flag to 1 in the Additional Usage Reports Information IE (see clause 8.2.91); or\n-\tthe total number of additional usage reports that will be sent in all the additional PFCP Session Report Request messages (i.e. that will be sent after the PFCP Session Modification/Deletion Response message), by setting this value in the Additional Usage Reports Information IE (see clause 8.2.91).\nIn the former case (i.e. if the UP function indicates in the PFCP Session Modification Response message that more usage reports will follow), the UP function shall indicate, in one of the additional PFCP Session Report Request message, the total number of additional usage reports to be sent after the PFCP Session Modification Response message, by setting this value in the Additional Usage Reports Information IE. In both cases, the UP function may set the AURI flag to 1 in every additional PFCP Session Report Request message but the last one, to indicate that more usage reports will follow.\nBesides, if the PFCP Session Modification Request included the Query URR Reference IE, usage reports sent in response to the query in the PFCP Session Modification Response and/or additional PFCP Session Report Request messages shall include the Query URR Reference IE set to the same value as received in the PFCP Session Modification Request.\nWhen the reporting trigger \"Envelope Closure\" is set in the corresponding Usage Reporting Rule, the UP function shall generate a usage report with the measurement of the time and/or volume as instructed in the Measurement Method:\n-\twhen the Inactivity Detection Time (if included) is expired;\n-\twhen detecting no usage for the first Base Time Interval if the Base Time Interval Type in the Time Quota Mechanism is set to CTP; or\n-\tat the end of each of base time interval if the Base Time Interval Type in the Time Quota Mechanism is set to DTP.\nNOTE 13:\tEvents (e.g. application detection information) are reported individually and independently from the usage report sent for envelope closure.\nWhen the UP function supports the NORP feature and if a URR is provisioned with a \"Number of Reports\" IE, the number of Usage Reports generated according to the Reporting Trigger(s) defined in the URR shall not be more than the value of \"Number of Reports\". If the UP function is requested to resume the measurement for an inactive URR, the UP function shall generate a maximum number of Usage Reports equal to the new value of the Number of Reports IE received in the Update URR if any, or equal to the value of the Number of Reports IE previously provisioned in the URR if any; if no Number of Reports IE was provisioned before, there is no limit on the number of reports to send. If the CP function provisions a \"Number of Reports\" IE together with a Monitoring Time and/or a Measurement Information where the \"Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag is set to \"1\" in a URR,  the UP function shall generate usage reports as required by the Monitoring Time and/or the Measurement Information where the \"Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag is set to \"1\" in a URR, which may lead UP function to generate more usage reports than the value of the \"Number of Reports\" IE.\nNOTE 14: \tIf the CP function expects to receive the exact number of usage reports as requested in the Number of Reports, it can abstain from provisioning a Number of Report IE together with a Monitoring Time and/or a Measurement Information where the \"Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag is set to \"1\" in a URR.\nAt the PFCP session termination, the UP function shall indicate to the CP function, in the PFCP Session Deletion Response, the resources that have been consumed for each URR that was provisioned in the PFCP session since the last usage report (respective to each URR). A CP function may indicate support of Additional Usage Reports in PFCP Session Deletion Request by setting the ARDR flag in the CP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.58). When additional PFCP Session Report Request messages need to be sent:\n-\tthe UP function shall:\n-\tset the cause to \"More Usage Report to send\" in the PFCP Session Deletion Response;\n-\tinclude the Additional Usage Reports Information IE in PFCP Session Deletion Response with either the AURI flag set to \"1\" or indicating the total number of additional usage reports that will be sent in all the additional PFCP Session Report Request messages; as described above:\n-\tin the former case, the UP function shall indicate in one additional PFCP Session Report Request message the total number of additional usage reports that will be sent after the PFCP Session Deletion Response;\n-\tin both cases, the UP function may set the AURI flag to 1 in every additional PFCP Session Report Request message but the last one, to indicate that more usage reports will follow.\n-\tset the PSDBU flag to 1 in the last PFCP Session Report Request message.\n-\twhen the CP function receives a PFCP Session Deletion Response with the Cause set to \"More Usage Report to send\", the CP function shall not delete the PFCP session until it receives a PFCP Session Report Request message with the PSDBU flag set to \"1\" (that indicates this is the last report), or it has received the number of usage reports indicated in the Additional Usage Reports Information IE in PFCP Session Deletion Response, or until an implementation specific timer expires otherwise.\nAt the PFCP session termination, the UP function shall set the PURU flag to \"1\" in the PFCP Session Deletion Response if it has pending PFCP Session Report Request messages which have not been acknowledged yet. This indicates that the CP function should wait for some time before deleting the PFCP Session.\nUpon receiving the Usage Report from the UP function, the CP function may initiate PFCP Session Modification procedure as result of the communication with the PCRF or OCS, as described in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2], e.g. by:\n-\tmodifying the URR (e.g. changing the Volume/Time threshold, Volume/Time quota, disabling the usage monitoring);\n-\tcreating a new FAR (e.g. for redirect) and/or modifying the existing FAR; or\n-\tmodifying the QER (s) in the PFCP session.\nWhen a URR is received with at least one Aggregated URRs IE included, the UP function:\n-\tshall calculate the traffic usage of the URR by applying the Multiplier(s) and aggregating the traffic usage from all URRs indicated in the Aggregated URRs IE(s), as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16];\nNOTE 1:\tThe usage of this URR is calculated using the following formula:\nC1*M1 + C2*M2 + ... + Cn*Mn = U,\nwhere U is the usage counted by this URR, Cn is the usage counted by each aggregated URR (i.e. URR for each RG sharing the credit pool), and Mn is the multiplier for each aggregrated URR.\n-\tshall generate a report when the counted usage exceeds the threshold;\n-\tshall generate a report if the threshold is not provided, and stop packets forwarding (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) for all Aggregated URRs when the counted usage exceeds the quota.\nNOTE 2:\tThe handling of the aggregated URR(s), e.g. generating a Usage Report upon the Reporting Trigger(s) is not impacted by handling of this URR for the Credit Pool.\nThe following requirements shall apply when using Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interfaces or Redundant Transmission at transport layer:\n-\tthe UPF shall not count redundant packets in Usage Reports (e.g. Volume Measurement), i.e. it shall count the traffic only once in Usage Reports;\n-\tthe SMF shall provide the quota for the non-redundant transmission (i.e. not counting redundant traffic).\nThe CP function may instruct the UP function to generate a Usage Report for a URR \"X\" when a Usage Report is generated for another URR \"Y\", by:\n-\tprovisioning the URR \"X\" with the Reporting Triggers IE set to Linked Usage Reporting; and\n-\tincluding in the URR \"X\" the Linked URR ID IE set to the URR ID of the URR \"Y\".\nNOTE 1:\tThis can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to report a Usage Report for an SDF (i.e. URR \"X\") when the UP function reports a Usage Report for a bearer (i.e. URR \"Y\").\nNOTE 2:\tThis can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to report a Usage Report for a RG (i.e. URR \"X\") when the UP function reports a Usage Report for a credit pool to which this RG pertain (i.e. URR \"Y\").\nWhen a usage report is to be generated for the URR \"Y\", regardless of the condition which triggers the report, the UP function shall also send a Usage Report for the URR \"X\" with the accumulated usage information, and the Usage Report Trigger IE set to Linked Usage Reporting.\nNOTE 3:\tThis also applies e.g. when an immediate usage report is requested for the URR \"Y\"within a PFCP session Modification Request.\nThe URR \"Y\" may be linked to more URRs than just URR \"X\".\nA RG level URR may be linked to IP-CAN bearer level URR as well as IP-CAN Session level URR to enable the CP function to generate a CDR on the different level. In such case, a URR \"X\" may link to more URRs than just URR \"Y\".\nThe CP function may request the UP function to report the End Marker reception during UE Triggered Service Request with, or without I-SMF insertion/change/removal procedures (see clauses 4.2.3.2 and 4.23.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]):\n-\tIf a new I-UPF is selected by the SMF to replace the old I-UPF, the SMF may provide two PDRs to the new I-UPF, e.g. PDR-1 for DL data from the PSA UPF, where the Apply Action IE in FAR-1 associated with PDR-1 is set to BUFF; and e.g. PDR-2 for receiving the buffered DL data from the old I-UPF, where the Apply Action IE in FAR-2 associated with PDR-2 is set to FORW. In this case, the SMF shall indicate to the new I-UPF to report the reception of the End Marker packet from the old I-UPF, by providing a URR related to PDR-2 with REEMR flag set to 1 in the Reporting Triggers IE, which is included in a Create URR IE within PFCP Session Establishment Request.\n-\tIf the SMF removes the old I-UPF but does not replace it with a new I-UPF, then the SMF may provide two PDRs to the PSA UPF, e.g. PDR-3 for receiving DL data across N6, where the Apply Action IE in FAR-3 associated with PDR-3 is set to BUFF; and e.g. PDR-4 for receiving the buffered DL data from the old I-UPF, where the Apply Action IE in FAR-4 associated with PDR-4 is set to FORW. The SMF shall indicate to the PSA UPF to report the reception of the End Marker packet from the old I-UPF, by providing a URR related to PDR-4 with REEMR flag set to 1 in the Reporting Triggers IE which is included in a Create URR IE within PFCP Session Modification Request.\nOnce the End Marker packet is received from the old I-UPF, the UPF (either new I-UPF or the PSA UPF) shall inform the SMF about this by sending the PFCP Session Report Request with the Usage Report IE containing the usage measurement as instructed in the URR, where EMRRE flag shall be set to 1 in a Usage Report Trigger IE and shall discard the End Marker packet(s). The SMF shall instruct the UPF to start sending the buffered DL data identified by PDR-1 or PDR-3 by sending a PFCP Session Modification Request message, where the Apply Action IE in the FAR-1/FAR-3 related to PDR-1/PDR-3 shall be changed from BUFF to FORW.\n",

                            "text_content": "Service detection refers to the process that identifies the packets belonging to a service data flow or application. For EPC, see clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.8.1 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. For 5GC, see clause 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44].\nFor EPC, bearer binding is the procedure that associates service data flow(s) to an IP-CAN bearer deemed to transport the service data flow. UL bearer binding verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to no matching service data flow template for the uplink direction. See clauses 6.1.1.4 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7].\nFor 5GC, QoS flow binding is the procedure that associates service data flow(s) to a QoS flow deemed to transport the service data flow. UL QoS flow binding verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to no matching QoS flow for the uplink direction. See clause 6.1.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and clause 5.7.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].\nFor 5MBS, QoS flow binding is the procedure that associates a PCC rule to a QoS Flow within an MBS Session. See clause 6.10 in 3GPP TS 23.247 [72].\nService detection is controlled over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points by configuring Packet Detection Information in PDRs to match the intended service data flows or application.\nFor EPC, the mapping of DL traffic to bearers is achieved by configuring and associating FARs to the downlink PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to the appropriate downstream bearers (S5/S8 or S1/S12/S4/Iu).\nFor 5GC, the mapping of DL traffic to QoS flows is achieved by configuring QERs with QFI(s) for the QoS flow marking and associating FARs to the downlink PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to the appropriate downstream GTP-U tunnel (N9 or N3).\nFor EPC, uplink bearer binding verification is achieved by configuring Packet Detection Information in uplink PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer, the UE IP address (source IP address to match for the incoming packet), and the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink packets received on the uplink bearer but that do not match the SDF filter(s) or Application detection filter associated to the uplink PDRs are discarded.\nFor 5GC, uplink QoS flow binding verification (see clause 5.7.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]) is achieved by configuring Packet Detection Information in uplink PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink PDU session, the UE IP address (source IP address to match for the incoming packet), the QFI of the QoS flow and the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink packets received on the uplink PDU session but that do not match the SDF filter(s) or Application detection filter and QFI associated to the uplink PDRs are discarded.\nNOTE 1:\tFor PCC Rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an application detection filter), uplink traffic can be received on other IP-CAN bearers than the one determined by the binding mechanism. The detection of the uplink part of the service data flow can be activated in parallel on other bearers with non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in addition to the bearer where the PCC rule is bound to. See clauses 6.1.1.1 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. Therefore the uplink PDRs for these bearers can be provisioned with the PDI containing this service data flow and the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.\nNOTE 2:\tTo avoid the PGW-U discarding packets due to no matching service data flow template, the operator can apply open PCC rules (with wildcarded SDF filters) to allow for the passage of packets that do not match any other candidate SDF template. Therefore an uplink PDR can be provisioned with the PDI containing only the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.\nNOTE 3:\tUplink bearer binding does not apply to Non-IP PDN connections.\nNOTE 4:\tThe UPF can be provisioned with a PDR (with low precedence) which contains the CN tunnel info, QFI and filter information that can detect any unwanted/unauthorized traffic with this QFI so that such traffic can be dropped with or without being counted before.\n",

The UP function shall additionally set the AFSFC feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it supports Traffic Steering and support using Metadata (see clause 8.2.25).\nTraffic Steering is supported over the Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points by instructing the UP function to apply a specific Forwarding Policy, that is locally configured in the UP function and that can be used for the uplink, the downlink or for both directions. A Forwarding Policy is identified by a Forwarding Policy Identifier.

Only one PFCP association shall be setup between a given pair of CP and UP functions, even if the CP and/or UP function exposes multiple IP addresses. A single PFCP association may also be setup between a SMF set and a UPF (see clause 5.22.2).\nThe CP function and the UP function shall support the PFCP Association Setup procedure initiated by the CP function (see clause 6.2.6.2). The CP function and the UP function may additionally support the PFCP Association Setup procedure initiated by the UP function (see clause 6.2.6.3).\nA CP function may have PFCP Associations set up with multiple UP functions. A UP function may have PFCP Associations set up with multiple CP functions.\nIn PFCP signaling, a CP function or a UP function shall be identified by a unique Node ID. A Node ID may be set to an FQDN or to an IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6, see clause 8.2.38). When set to an IP address, it indicates that the CP/UP function only exposes one IP address for the PFCP Association signalling. Once a PFCP association is set up between a CP function and a UP function, the same Node ID as signaled respectively by the CP function and the UP function during the PFCP association setup procedure shall be used in all subsequent PFCP node related messages (other than Heartbeat messages) until the PFCP association is released.\nNOTE 1:\tThe control of a PFCP session can be taken over by a new SMF in an SMF set as specified in clause 5.22. When using the MPAS feature (see clause 5.22.3), when a different SMF takes over the control of the PFCP session, the UP function receives the NODE ID of the new SMF that is different from the NODE ID of the SMF that was handling the PFCP session earlier.\nThe PFCP entities shall accept any new IP address allocated as part of F-SEID other than the one(s) communicated in the Node Id.\nNOTE 2:\tThe source IP address to send PFCP Association Setup request can not be used as the destination IP address when the peer sends a PFCP Association Update Request message, e.g. for a scenario when a NAT is deployed in the network.\nPrior to establishing a PFCP Association, the function responsible for establishing the PFCP Association (e.g. CP function) shall look up a peer function (e.g. UP function), e.g. using DNS procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.303 [25]), NRF procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [43]) or local configuration. If the peer function is found to support multiple IP addresses (in the look up information), one of these addresses (any one) shall be used as destination IP address to send the PFCP Association Setup Request. Once the PFCP Association is established, any of the IP addresses of the peer function (found during the look-up) may then be used to send subsequent PFCP node related messages and PFCP session establishment requests for that PFCP Association.\nNOTE 3:\tThe look up information (e.g. in DNS, NRF or local configuration of the function responsible for establishing the PFCP association) needs to be configured consistently with the addressing information of the peer function. If a FQDN is configured to identify a function in DNS or NRF, then the Node ID of that function included in PFCP messages need to be set to the same FQDN. For instance, if the CP function is responsible for establishing the PFCP association, a UP function that exposes multiple IP addresses (for PFCP node related messages and PFCP session establishment requests) needs to be configured in the look up information as one (single) UP function that is associated to multiple IP addresses. The Node ID needs to be set to an SMF set FQDN when a single association is setup between an SMF set and UPF (see clause 5.22.2).\nNOTE 4:\tPFCP session related messages for sessions that are already established are sent to the IP address received in the F-SEID allocated by the peer function or to the IP address of an alternative SMF in the SMF set (see clause 5.22). The former IP address needs not be configured in the look up information. See clauses 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.\n",

The routing of the uplink traffic flows to different PDU Session Anchors is based on the source IP prefix of the uplink packets.\nThe SMF may insert an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point, during a PDU session establishment or modification, by provisioning:\n-\ttwo or more UL PDRs, with the appropriate Packet Detection Information, and with corresponding FARs to route the uplink traffic flows towards the appropriate PDU Session Anchors;\n-\ttwo or more DL PDRs, with the appropriate Packet Detection Information, and with one (or more FARs) to route the downlink traffic flows on the tunnel towards the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThis uses the generic functionalities of the PFCP protocol described in this specification, with two or more DL PDRs (for the traffic coming from the different PDU session anchors).\nNOTE 2:\tA UPF acting as an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point can also behave as a PDU Session Anchor for the PDU session.\nThe SMF may remove an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point, during a PDU session modification, by removing the UL (or modifying the FAR associated to the UL PDR) and DL PDRs that were setup for the traffic to/from the PDU Session Anchor(s) to be removed.\n",

The SMF may instruct the UPF to forward unicast and/or broadcast traffic as described below if the UPF has indicated support of 5G VN Group Communication (see feature GCOM in clause 8.2.25).\nThere are 3 different traffic forwarding methods, i.e. UPF local switching, N6-based forwarding and N19-based forwarding, to forward traffic within the 5G VN group.\nFor all methods, traffic forwarding within the 5G VN group is realized by using a UPF internal interface (\"5G VN Internal\") and a two-step detection and forwarding process. In the first step, the packets received from any 5G VN group member (via it's PDU Session, via N6 or via N19) are forwarded to the UPF internal interface (i.e. Destination Interface set to \"5G VN Internal\"). In the second step, PDRs installed at the UPF internal interface (i.e. Source Interface set to \"5G VN Internal\") detect the packet and forward it to the respective 5G VN group member (via it's PDU Session, via N6 or via N19). If more than one 5G VN group has to be supported, the Network Instance set to a value representing the 5G VN group is used in addition to the UPF internal interface to enable isolation of the 5G VN group communication during the packet detection and forwarding process.\nWhen N19-based forwarding is used, the SMF may correlate all the PDU sessions for the 5G VN Group members to generate the PDR and FAR corresponding to the group level N4-session for UPF as specified in clause 5.29.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].\nFor Ethernet unicast traffic on 5G VN Group Communication, the SMF may either explicitly configure DL PDR with the MAC addresses detected by the UPF on PDU Sessions supporting a 5G VN group, or rely on MAC address learning in UPF related with a 5G VN group by setting the Ethernet PDU Session Information indication in the DL PDR of the \"5G VN internal\" interface as specified in clause 5.8.2.13.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].\nTo enable IP or Ethernet type broadcast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN Group, the SMF may provide the PDRs related to the group level N4-session and each 5G VN group member' N4 Session to the UPF as specified in clause 5.8.2.13.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].\nThe details of the PDR and FAR setting over N4 for unicast traffic forwarding within a 5G VN are specified in clauses 5.8.2.13.1 and 5.8.2.13.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].\nThe details of the PDR and FAR setting over N4 for broadcast traffic forwarding within a 5G VN are specified in clause 5.8.2.13.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].\nIf a PIN has more than one PEGCs, 5G VN Group Communication may be used for the PIN as specified in clause 5.44.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. In this case, separation of multiple PINs communication in the UPF uses different network instances as it is for 5G VN Group.\nThe UPF local switching may be applied to PIN indirect communication when there are multiple PDU sessions for a PIN from different PEGCs connecting to the same UPF. The N6-based forwarding may be applied to PIN-DN communication.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause specifies the N4 requirements for the support of multicast MBS services using 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery. The MBS data may be delivered from the MB-UPF to the UPF using multicast or unicast transport.  It is optional for both the SMF and the UPF to support the multicast MBS service. The following requirements shall apply if the SMF and UPF support the MBSN4 feature (see clause 8.2.25).\nNOTE 1:\tThere is no impact on N4 to support broadcast MBS services in the 5GS.\nNOTE 2:\tFor an MBS session (or an MBS session towards an MBS service area for location dependent MBS), there is only one MB-SMF (set) and one MB-UPF.\nFor a given multicast MBS session, or for a given multicast MBS session and MBS Service Area for a location dependent MBS service, only a single copy of MBS Session data is delivered from the MB-UPF to the UPF. The UPF shall allocate only one N19mb downlink tunnel to receive the MBS session data for the MBS session, or for the MBS session and MBS Service Area for a location dependent MBS service, if unicast transport applies over N19mb or the UPF shall join the multicast group to receive MBS session data if multicast transport applies over N19mb.\nWhen a PDU session needs to be associated with an MBS session (e.g. when a UE requests to join a multicast MBS session, 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used and the request is accepted by the SMF), the SMF shall associate the PDU session with the multicast MBS session by sending a PFCP Session Establishment or Modification Request message to the UPF, for the PFCP session corresponding to the PDU session, with the following information:\n-\tthe MBS Session N4 Control Information IE including the MBS Session Identifier, the Area Session ID, for a location dependent MBS service and, if IP multicast transport applies over N19mb (i.e. a multicast transport address has been received from the MB-SMF):\n-\tthe Multicast Transport Information IE for the given MBS session containing the Low Layer Source Specific Multicast address, i.e. the Multicast address and the source IP address and the GTP-U Common TEID which have been allocated by the MB-UPF for the MBS session, when the SMF considers it is the first PDU session to be associated with the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) in this UPF; the SMF may provide this information even if there are already other PDU sessions associated with the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) in this UPF;\n-\tone or more new DL PDR(s) including:\n-\tthe MBS Session Identifier, the Area Session ID (for a location dependent MBS service), or a Traffic Endpoint IE which is including the MBS Session Identifier, and the Area Session ID (for a location dependent MBS service); this information shall be used by the UPF to:\n-\tdetermine whether the UPF already receives the MBS session data, or if instead it needs to allocate a new N19mb DL tunnel (when using IP unicast transport over N19mb) or send an IGMP JOIN request to join the multicast tree (when using IP multicast transport over N19mb) to receive the MBS session data; the UPF shall allocate the same N19mb DL Tunnel ID when the SMF requests the UPF to allocate a DL F-TEID for N19mb and multiple UE/PDU sessions are already associated with the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) in the UPF (e.g. PDU sessions controlled by other SMFs, or when multiple PDU sessions served by the same SMF need to be associated concurrently with the MBS session).\n-\tidentify the list of PDU sessions (served by the UPF) towards which any DL packet received for this MBS session shall be distributed;\n-\tif unicast transport is used over N19mb:\n-\ta local F-TEID to be allocated at the UPF, with the CHOOSE flag set to \"1\" in the \"Local F-TEID\" IE in the PDI IE or Create Traffic Endpoint IE, if the SMF has no \"N19mb DL F-TEID\" information available for the MBS Session, e.g. for the first PDU Session in the SMF to be associated with the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service); otherwise\n-\tthe Local F-TEID set to the \"N19mb DL F-TEID\" for the MBS Session (or for the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) which is known by the SMF.\n-\tmultiple DL PDRs may be provisioned and associated with different QERs to apply different QoS treaments for different multicast QoS flows within the MBS session. For each multicast QoS flow, the SMF may instruct the UPF to modify the QFI of downlink packets of the multicast QoS flow (received from the MB-UPF) to the QFI assigned by the SMF for the Associated (unicast) QoS flow, by associating a DL PDR including the QFI of the multicast QoS flow with a QER including the QFI IE set to the QFI of the Associated QoS flow.\n-\tthe new DL PDR(s) may be associated with an (existing) Forwarding Action Rule to forward the received MBS session data to the UE via existing downlink N3/N9 tunnel, or with a new Forwarding Action Rule with the Apply Action set to \"Drop\" if the SMF wishes to maintain the MBS data reception over N19mb but suspends the delivery of the data to the UE's PDU session, e.g. when the UE is switching between 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery and 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery due to the UE moving back and forth between MBS non-supporting NG-RAN and MBS supporting NG-RAN.\nThe UPF shall respond with a PFCP Session Establishment or Modification Response message to the SMF, and the UPF shall include an MBS Session N4 Information IE if any of the following information needs to be reported:\n-\tthe allocated \"N19mb DL Tunnel ID\" if it was requested;\n-\tan NN19DT (New N19mb Downlink Tunnel) indication in the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE indicating if the N19mb DL F-TEID has been newly allocated by the UPF or if a N19mb DL F-TEID had already been allocated by the UPF for the MBS session (or for the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service), when the \"N19mb DL Tunnel ID\" is present; this information allows the SMF to determine if it needs to report this N19mb DL Tunnel ID to the MB-SMF;\n-\tan indication \"JMTI\"(Joined N19mb Multicast Tree Indication) in the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE indicating if the UPF has joined the multicast tree from MB-UPF, if the Multicast Transport Information was included in the request message.\nNOTE:\tThe indications \"JMTI\" and \"NN19DT\" are defined to help the SMF to determine if it needs to communicate with the MB-SMF, e.g., to report the newly allocated N19mb DL TEID in order to let the MB-SMF inform the MB-UPF to send a copy of MBS Session data to the UPF. The indication \"JMTI\" indicates to the SMF that no N19mb DL TEID needs to be allocated.\nIf unicast transport is used over N19mb and if the NN19DT (New N19mb Downlink Tunnel) indication is not set in the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE within the PFCP Session Establishment or Modification Response (i.e. if the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE is present and the NN19DT indication is not set, or if the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE is absent), the SMF shall assume that the UPF had already allocated the N19mb DL TEID earlier than the PFCP Session Establishment or Modification Request.\nWhen a PDU Session should be no longer be associated with the MBS session, or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service, (e.g. the PDU session leaves the MBS session, or when switching to 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery), or when the MBS session to which the PDU session is associated is being deactivated, the SMF shall send a PFCP Session Modification Request message to remove the DL PDR(s) that were created to receive the MBS session data, unless the SMF decides to keep the UPF receiving MBS Session data from N19mb, in which case the PDR shall be associated with a FAR set to drop packets. In the former case, when all the DL PDR(s) that were created to receive the MBS session data have been removed, the UPF shall consider that the PFCP session (PDU session) is no longer associated with the MBS session (i.e. the UPF shall delete, from its PFCP session context, the MBS Session N4 Control Information corresponding to the MBS session).\nIn the PFCP Session Modification Response message, the UPF shall include the indication \"N19DTR\" (N19mb Downlink Tunnel Removal) in the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE indicating the N19mb DL Tunnel is to be removed if the UPF was requested to remove the DL PDRs of the MBS session for the PFCP session and this was the last PFCP session associated with the N19mb DL Tunnel in the UPF. This tells the SMF that it shall request the MB-SMF to inform the MB-UPF to stop sending MBS Session data towards this N19mb DL Tunnel.\nThe UPF shall also set the indication \"N19DTR\" (N19mb Downlink Tunnel Removal) in the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE indicating the N19mb DL Tunnel is to be removed in the PFCP Session Deletion Response message when the SMF deleted the last PFCP session who was associated with the N19mb DL Tunnel in the UPF.\nWhen the MBS session to which the PDU session is associated is being re-activated, the SMF shall send a PFCP Session Modification Request message to the UPF:\n-\tincluding the MBS Session N4 Control Information IE and re-creating the DL PDR(s) of the MBS QoS flows, following the same requirements as described above for associating the PDU session with the MBS session, if the SMF removed the DL PDR(s) that were created to receive the MBS session data when the MBS session was deactivated; or\n-\tassociating the DL PDR(s) of the MBS QoS flows with the FAR provisioned with the N3 DL F-TEID to forward packets, if the SMF decided to keep the UPF receiving MBS Session data from N19mb by associating these DL PDR(s) with a FAR set to drop packets when the MBS session was deactivated.\nDuring a restoration procedure for an MB-UPF failure without Restart (see clause 8.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527 []), if multicast transport is used over N19mb:\n-\tthe SMF shall instruct the UPF to use the new Low Layer Source Specific Multicast address, i.e. the Multicast address and the source IP address and the GTP-U Common TEID which have been allocated by the new MB-UPF for the MBS session, by sending a PFCP Session Modification Request message with the MBS Session N4 Control Information IE including the MBS Session Identifier, the Area Session ID (for a location dependent MBS service) and the Multicast Transport Information IE containing the new LL SSM address and GTP-U Common TEID;\n-\tupon receipt of such a request, the UPF shall send an IGMP JOIN request to join the multicast tree to receive the MBS session data from the new MB-UPF and it shall leave delivery from the previous multicast address that was in use for the MBS session. The UPF shall set the indication \"JMTI\"(Joined N19mb Multicast Tree Indication) in the MBSN4Resp-Flags IE in the PFCP Session Modification Response to indicate that the UPF has joined the multicast tree from MB-UPF.\nWhen receiving the MBS session data for a given MBS session, or for a given MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service, either from the N19mb DL Tunnel allocated for this MBS Session (where the packets shall be identified by N19mb DL TEID) when unicast transport is used, or from the low layer Multicast transport address (where the packets shall be identified by the low layer Multicast transport address) when multicast transport is used, the UPF shall replicate the MBS Session data to all PFCP sessions which are associated with the MBS Session, or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service.\nThe UPF shall forward the MBS DL QFI Sequence Number in the PDU Session Container (see 3GPP TS 38.415 [34]) of MBS data packets received from the MB-UPF unmodified.\nThe procedures and requirements to instruct a combined UPF/MB-UPF to associate a PDU session with an MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) for which it serves as the MB-UPF shall be as specified in clauses 5.34.2.2 and 5.34.3.2, with the following additions:\n-\tthe combined UPF/MB-UPF may determine that the PDU session is being associated with an MBS session (or with an MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) for which it serves as MB-UPF by determining whether a specific PFCP session has been established for the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service), as specified in clause 5.34.2.2;\n-\tthe SMF shall instruct the combined UPF/MB-UPF to associate the PDU session with the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) as specified in clause 5.34.3.2, as if the UPF and MB-UPF were not combined; this means in particular that the DL PDR of the PFCP session of the PDU session to be associated with the MBS session (or with the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) shall not contain an N6mb / Nmb9 address or IP multicast addressing information;\nNOTE 1:\tOnly the PFCP session created for the MBS session (or for the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service) as specified in clause 5.34.2.2 can contain a N6mb / Nmb9 address or IP multicast addressing information.\n-\tit is an implementation choice for such combined UPF/MB-UPF to allocate a (possibly virtual / internal) N19mb DL Tunnel ID (i.e. IP address and TEID) or to indicate to the SMF that it has joined the low layer multicast group assigned by the MB-UPF for the MBS session (or for the MBS session and Area Session ID for a location dependent MBS service), and the combined UPF/MB-UPF shall respond to the SMF accordingly, as if it is the UPF and MB-UPF were not combined;\n-\tif the combined UPF/MB-UPF returns a N19mb DL Tunnel ID with the NN19DT (New N19mb Downlink Tunnel) indication set to 1, the SMF shall request the MB-SMF to (or the combined SMF/MB-SMF shall) instruct the MB-UPF to forward and replicate MBS Session data towards the (possibly virtual / internal) N19mb DL Tunnel ID as specified in clause 5.34.2.2, as if the UPF and MB-UPF were not combined.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SMF, MB-SMF or a combined SMF/MB-SMF need not implement any additional logic when communicating with a combined UPF/MB-UPF.\n",

This exposes congestion information by marking ECN bits in the IP header of the user IP packets between the UE and the application server to trigger application layer rate adaptation.\nSupport of this feature is optional for the SMF and UPF. A UPF that supports ECN marking for L4S on behalf of and due to congestion in NG-RAN shall indicate so to the SMF by setting the EML4S flag in the UP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.25).\nECN marking for L4S may be enabled on a per QoS flow basis in the uplink and/or downlink direction and may be used for GBR and non-GBR QoS Flows.\nNOTE 1:\tA QoS flow eligible for ECN marking can be determined statically when a PDU session is established based on configuration in SMF or PCF, or dynamically based on the detection of the L4S traffic (e.g. matching packets with ECT(1) or CE (see IETF RFC 9331 [81]) together with IP 5 tuple in the IP header) whereby SMF or PCF triggers a setup of a QoS Flow enabled for L4S, or by requests by an AF.\nNOTE 2:\tECN marking for L4S in the IP header due to congestion in NG-RAN can be supported by NG-RAN itself or can be delegated to the PSA UPF. If supported by both, it is enabled by the SMF either in the NG-RAN or in the PSA UPF, based on operator's policies. This clause describes requirements for ECN marking done in the PSA UPF.\nNOTE 3:\tIn general, any network layer node that experiences congestion and is capable of performing ECN marking for L4S in the IP header can do so to contribute to the end to end L4S support. This clause describes only the marking due to congestion in NG-RAN with ECN marking delegated to the PSA UPF. It does not prevent though any other network layer node to perform ECN marking of the user IP packets due to other congestion point in the end-to-end path.\nIf the UPF indicated support of ECN marking for L4S (i.e. the EML4S feature), the SMF may instruct the UPF to perform ECN marking for L4S for one QoS flow, in a PFCP Session Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification Request, by setting the ECN marking for L4S indicator in a QER associated with the UL and/or DL PDRs of this QoS flow.\nNOTE 4:\tThe PDR can use SDF filter(s) (e.g. matching packets with ECT(1) or CE (see IETF RFC 9331 [81]) together with IP 5 tuple) to steer traffic to an L4S enabled QoS Flow.\nNOTE 5:\tThe SMF also indicates to NG-RAN to report the congestion information (i.e. a percentage of packets to be used by the UPF for ECN marking for L4S) of the QoS Flow on UL and/or DL directions via GTP-U header extension to PSA UPF. If there is no UL packet when report for DL and/or UL needs to be provided, NG-RAN may generate an UL Dummy GTP-U Packet for such a reporting.\nUpon being instructed to perform ECN marking for L4S for a QoS flow, the UPF shall use the information sent by NG-RAN in GTP-U header extension (see 3GPP TS 38.415 [34] and 3GPP TS 38.300 [42]) of GTP-U packets of the corresponding QoS flow to perform ECN bits marking for L4S for the corresponding direction.\nDuring PDU session establishment procedure, if the SMF receives the ECN Marking or Congestion Monitoring Reporting Status (in the PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer IE) from the NG-RAN which indicates that congestion information reporting for the QoS flow is not active, then the SMF shall instruct the UPF to stop ECN marking for L4S, by setting the ECN marking for L4S indicator to \"0\" in the QER associated with the PDRs of the QoS flows for which ECN marking was enabled, in a PFCP Session Modification Request if the SMF has instructed the UPF to perform ECN marking for L4S for a QoS flow previously.\nDuring a NG-RAN Xn handover and N2 handover, if the congestion information reporting has been enabled on source NG-RAN while the target NG-RAN does not support congestion information reporting, then the SMF shall instruct the UPF to stop ECN marking for L4S, by setting the ECN marking for L4S indicator to \"0\" in the QER associated with the PDRs of the QoS flows for which ECN marking was enabled, in a PFCP Session Modification Request.\nUpon being instructed to stop performing ECN marking for a QoS flow, the UPF shall stop doing so.\nEditor's Note:\tFurther details on how the UPF performs ECN marking for L4S based on the congestion information received from the NG-RAN need to be specified\n",

The load information reflects the operating status of the resources of the UP function.\nLoad control allows for better balancing of the PFCP session load, so as to attempt to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action). Load control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the UP function reports a high load.\nLoad control and overload control may be supported and activated independently in the network, based on operator's policy.\nThe UP function may signal its Load Control Information to reflect the operating status of its resources, at the node level, allowing the receiving CP function to use this information to augment the UP function selection procedures.\nThe Load Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response messages such that the exchange of Load Control Information does not trigger extra signalling.\nNOTE:\tThe inclusion of Load Control Information in existing messages means that the frequency of transmission of load control information increases as the session load increases, allowing for faster feedback and thus better regulation of the load.\nThe calculation of the Load Control Information is implementation dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes.\nA PFCP message may contain one instance of the Load Control Information (LCI) IE.\nWhen providing load control information in a message for the first time or subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of load control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Load Control Information, even if only a subset of the load control information has changed. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the load control information is changed (see clause 6.2.3.3.2.1).\nLoad Control Information shall be linked to the Node ID (i.e. FQDN or the IP address used during the UP function selection) of the UP function providing the Information.\nThe receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer with the newly received load control information from the same peer node if the new load control information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the Load Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored an instance of the load control information for a peer node, it overwrites this instance with the new instance received in a message from the same peer node.\nThe receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for UP function selection.\nThe parameters are further defined in clause 6.2.3.3.2.\nLoad control information may be extended with new parameters in future versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized as:\n-\tNon-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the load control information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.\n-\tCritical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the load control information containing one or more of these parameters.\nThe sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter in an instance of the LCI IE towards a receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters. The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in future).\n6.2.3.3.2.1\tLoad Control Sequence Number\nThe Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be used to differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances by the same UP function.

This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the LCI IE to determine whether the newly received load control information has changed compared to load control information previously received from the same node earlier.\nNOTE:\tThe PFCP sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-order load control information as e.g. load control information may be sent in both PFCP requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.\nIf the receiving entity has already received and stored load control information from the peer UP function, the receiving CP function shall update its load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number received in the new load control information is higher than the stored value of the Load Control Sequence Number associated with the peer UP function. However due to roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or restart of the node, the Load Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer UP function, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) a Load Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the previous value.\n6.2.3.3.2.2\tLoad Metric\nThe Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as the used capacity of the UP function, the load in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in relationship to the total memory/CPU available, etc.).\nThe Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100 means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).\nThe Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.\nConsidering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node selection algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender should refrain from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2), in the Load Metric which does not result in useful improvement in node selection logic at the receiver. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising the new Load Control Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.\nNOTE:\tThe range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender to collect its own load information at every increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Load Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own load information is collected.\nHow often the sender includes the load control information is implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load control information is propagated to the target CP functions within an acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information (i.e. effective load balancing) is achieved. The sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as follows:\n-\tthe sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;\n-\tthe sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;\n-\tthe sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.\nThe sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control Information only in a subset of the applicable PFCP messages.\nThe receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in any of the PFCP messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception, shall be able act upon the received load control information.\n",

A UP function is in overload when it operates over its signalling capacity which results in diminished performance (including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).\nOverload control aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the traffic source as possible generally when an overload has occurred (reactive action), so to avoid spreading the problem inside the network and to avoid using resources of intermediate nodes in the network for signalling that would anyhow be discarded by the overloaded node.\nLoad control and overload control may be supported and activated independently in the network, based on operator's policy.\nWhen a UP function determines that the offered incoming signalling traffic is growing (or is about to grow) beyond its nominal capacity, the UP function may signal its overload, at node level granularity, to its peer CP functions by including Overload Control Information in PFCP signalling which provides guidance to the receiving CP functions to decide actions which lead to signalling traffic mitigation towards the sender of the information. This helps in preventing severe overload and hence potential breakdown of the UP function.\nThe Overload Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response messages such that the exchange of Overload Control Information does not trigger extra signalling.\nNOTE:\tThe inclusion of Overload Control Information in existing messages means that the frequency of transmission of overload control information increases as the signalling load increases, thus allowing for faster feedback and better regulation.\nThe calculation of the Overload Control Information is implementation dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes. The calculation of Overload Control Information should not severely impact the resource utilization of the UP function, especially considering the overload situation.\nThe overload control feature should continue to allow for preferential treatment of priority users (eMPS) and emergency services.\nThe overload mitigation actions based on the reception of the overload related information received from the UP function will not be standardized.\nA PFCP message may contain one instance of the Overload Control Information (OCI) IE.\nWhen providing overload control information in a message for the first time or subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of overload control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Overload Control Information, even if only a subset of the overload control information has changed. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the Overload control information is changed (see clause 6.2.4.3.2.1).\nThe receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a peer with the newly received overload control information from the same peer node if the new overload control information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored an instance of the Overload control information for a peer node, it overwrites this instance with the new instance received in a message from the same peer node.\nThe receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload mitigation action.\nThe parameters are further defined in clause 6.2.4.3.2.\nOverload control information may be extended with new parameters in future versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized as:\n-\tNon-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the Overload control information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.\n-\tCritical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the Overload control information containing one or more of these parameters.\nThe sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any instance of the OCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter in an instance of the OCI IE towards a receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters. The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in future).\nThe Overload Control Information shall be associated by default to the PFCP entity corresponding to the peer node's IP address of the PFCP session, over which the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the \"UP F-SEID\" IE.\nAlternatively, the UP function may send Overload Control Information which is associated with the Node ID of the UP function (i.e. FQDN or the IP address used during the UP function selection). In that case, the UP function shall provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE included in the message belongs to the Node ID.\n6.2.4.3.2.1\tOverload Control Sequence Number\nThe PFCP protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same contents as the original message. Due to PFCP retransmissions, the overload control information received by a CP function at a given time may be less recent than the overload control information already received from the same UP function. The Overload Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the overload control information received from an overloaded UP function. The Overload Control Sequence Number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence number shall be used to differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two different instants, by the same UP function.\nThe Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the Overload Control Information IE.\nThe UP function generating this information shall increment the Overload Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The UP function may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the generation of the overload control information, to populate the Overload Control Sequence Number.\nThis parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly collate out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to PFCP retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine whether the newly received overload control information has changed compared to the overload control information previously received from the same UP function. If the newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information from the same UP function, then the receiver may simply discard the newly received overload control information whilst continuing to apply the overload abatement procedures, as per the previous value.\nNOTE 1:\tThe timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see clause 6.2.4.3.2.2) is not restarted if the newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information. If the overload condition persists and the overloaded UP function needs to extend the duration during which the overload information applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload control information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number (even if the parameters within the overload control information have not changed).\nNOTE 2:\tThe PFCP Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-order overload information as e.g. overload control information may be sent in both PFCP requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.\nIf the receiving CP function already received and stored overload control information, which is still valid, from the overloaded UP function, the receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information is larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated with the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload Control Sequence Number or restart of the UP function, the Overload Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer UP function, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) an Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the previous value.\n6.2.4.3.2.2\tPeriod of Validity\nThe Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the overload condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid (unless overridden by subsequent new overload control information).\nAn overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE is received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is received from the same UP function (at which point the newly received overload control information shall prevail). The timer corresponding to the period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is received. When this timer expires, the last received overload control information shall be considered outdated and obsolete, i.e. any associated overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.\nThe Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload control).\nThe Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:\n-\tit avoids the need for the overloaded UP function to include the Overload Control Information IE in every PFCP messages it signals to its peer CP functions when the overload state does not change; thus it minimizes the processing required at the overloaded UP function and its peer CP functions upon sending/receiving PFCP signalling;\n-\tit allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the peer CP functions having received an overload indication from the overloaded UP function, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these PFCP entities for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes the need for the overloaded UP function to remember the list of CP functions to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction metric and to which it would subsequently need to signal when the overload condition ceases, if the Period of Validity parameter was not defined.\n6.2.4.3.2.3\tOverload Reduction Metric\nThe Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender of the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An Overload Reduction Metric of \"0\" always indicates that the UP function is not in overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be applied) for the indicated scope.\nConsidering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload Control Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated Overload Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every small variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload Reduction Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating the overload situation. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction Metric Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.\nNOTE:\tThe range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender to collect its own overload information at every increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload Reduction Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific criteria, such as the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the current load/overload situation and so on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own overload control information is collected.\nThe computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an implementation choice at the sending UP function.\nThe Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.\nThe inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occurring, unless the Overload Reduction Metric is set to \"0\", which signals that the overload condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a message does not mean that the overload has abated.\nHow often or when the sender includes the overload control information is implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload control information is propagated to the target receivers with an acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the effective overload control protection) is achieved. The following are some of the potential approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI IE:\n-\tthe sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to the given receiver;\n-\tthe sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards the receiver;\n-\tthe sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.\nThe sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a subset of the applicable PFCP messages.\nThe receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information received in any of the PFCP messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such reception, shall be able act upon the received information.\nAs part of the overload mitigation, a CP function shall reduce the total number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload Control Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the messages in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is called \"message throttling\".\nMessage throttling shall only apply to Request messages. Response messages should not be throttled since that would result in the retransmission of the corresponding request message by the sender.\nA CP function supporting PFCP overload control shall support and use the \"Loss\" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.\n6.2.4.4.2.1\tDescription\nAn overloaded UP function shall ask its peers to reduce the number of requests they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control Information including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage, within the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\", as specified in clause 6.2.4.3.2.\nThe recipients of the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\" shall reduce the number of requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an alternate destination if possible (e.g. the PFCP Session Establishment Request message may be redirected to an alternate UP function), or by failing the request and treating it as if it was rejected by the destination UP function.\nFor example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would have otherwise been sent to this UP function.\nThe overloaded UP function should periodically adjust the requested traffic reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is currently in use, the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level) and the desired system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the rate of the current overall received traffic.\nAnnex A.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation of the \"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.\nNOTE 1:\tThis algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic towards the overloaded UP function will be less than the past traffic but it ensures that the total traffic sent towards the overloaded UP function is less than what would have been sent without any throttling in place. If after requesting a certain reduction in traffic, the overloaded UP function receives more traffic than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the worsening rather than an improvement in the overload level, then the overloaded UP function can request for more reduction in traffic. Thus, by periodically adjusting the requested traffic reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that it receives, approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.\nNOTE 2:\tSince the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput towards the overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the source nodes (depending upon the events generated towards these source nodes by other entities in the network), as a potential increase of traffic from some source nodes can possibly be compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from other source nodes.\nWhen performing message throttling:\n-\tPFCP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in 3GPP TS 22.153 [15]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these PFCP requests shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic reduction, and the priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling due to PFCP overload control up to the point where the requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic;\n-\tfor other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are considered as low priority are considered for throttling before the other messages. The relative priority of the messages may be derived from the relative priority of the procedure for which the message is being sent or may be derived from the session parameters such as APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator (LAPI).\nNOTE:\tA random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages without any special consideration, could result in an overall poor congestion mitigation mechanism and bad user experience.\nAn overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part of a self-protection mechanism.\nMessage prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when handling incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the relative PFCP message priority signalled in the PFCP header (see clause 7.2.2.3).\nA PFCP entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority in PFCP signalling, based on operator policy. The requirements specified in this clause shall apply if message priority in PFCP signalling is used.\nA sending PFCP entity shall determine the relative message priority to signal in the message according to the principles specified in clause 6.2.4.5.1. If the message affects multiple bearers, the relative message priority should be determined considering the highest priority ARP among all the bearers.\nA PFCP entity should set the same message priority in a Response message as received in the corresponding Request message.\nFor incoming PFCP messages that do not have a message priority in the PFCP header, the receiving PFCP entity:\n-\tshall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is a Request message;\n-\tshould apply the message priority sent in the Request message, if the incoming message is a Response message.\nThis feature should be supported homogenously across the CP functions and UP functions in the network, otherwise an overloaded node will process Request messages received from the non-supporting nodes according to the default priority while Request messages received from supporting nodes will be processed according to the message priority signalled in the PFCP message.\n",

If so, the following requirements shall apply.\nSeveral PFCP session related requests and/or responses messages, related to the same PFCP session or to different PFCP sessions handled by the same peer PFCP entity (i.e. with the peer's F-SEID having the same IP address, or with the same peer's IP address for PFCP Session Establishment Requests), may be bundled together in a single UDP/IP packet as specified in clause 7.2.1A, when being sent to that peer PFCP entity. PFCP messages may be bundled towards a PFCP entity of a UP function or of a CP function, independently.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the CP function bundles few PFCP session related requests in one UDP/IP packet it sends to a UP function, the UP function can return responses in separate UDP/IP packets or it can bundle some of the responses together with other PFCP session related messages.\nNOTE 2:\tBundling PFCP messages in a single UDP/IP packet enable to enhance performance and scalability (reduced CPU and memory cost thanks to reducing the number of packets to be packetized, exchanged and processed over N4).\nPFCP session related messages handled by different peer PFCP entities (i.e. with the peer's F-SEID having different IP addresses) shall not be bundled together. PFCP node related messages shall not be bundled either.\nThe procedures specified in the rest of this specification shall apply for each PFCP message that is bundled in a UDP/IP packet, as if the PFCP message was sent in its own individual UDP/IP packet, i.e. PFCP messages bundling shall not incur any change to the PFCP protocol other than what is described in this clause.\nNOTE 3:\tEach PFCP message bundled in a single UDP/IP packet has its own sequence number. Besides, if a UDP/IP packet carrying bundled PFCP messages is lost, retransmitted PFCP messages do not need to be bundled in the same manner as when sent originally.\n",

The spare bits shall be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver. For the Version Not Supported Response message, the Sequence Number may be set to any number and shall be ignored by the receiver.\n\nFigure 7.2.2.2-1: PFCP Message Header for node related messages\nThe PFCP message header, for session related messages, shall contain the SEID and Sequence Number fields followed by one spare octet. The PFCP header is depicted in figure 7.2.2.3-1. The spare bits shall be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.\n\nFigure 7.2.2.3-1: PFCP message Header for session related messages\nThe format of the PFCP header is specified in clause 7.2.2.\nThe usage of the PFCP header shall be as defined below.\nThe first octet of the header shall be used is the following way:\n-\tBit 1 represents the \"S\" flag, which indicates if SEID field is present in the PFCP header or not. If the \"S\" flag is set to \"0\", then the SEID field shall not be present in the PFCP header. If the \"S\" flag is set to \"1\", then the SEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in octets 5 to 12. Apart from the node related messages, in all PFCP messages the value of the \"S\" flag shall be set to \"1\".\n-\tBit 2 represents the \"MP\" flag. If the \"MP\" flag is set to \"1\", then bits 8 to 5 of octet 16 shall indicate the relative priority of the PFCP message. It shall be encoded as the binary value of the Message Priority and it may take any value between 0 and 15, where 0 corresponds to the highest priority and 15 the lowest priority.\n-\tBit 3 represents the \"FO\" (Follow On) flag. If the \"FO\" flag is set to \"1\", then another PFCP message follows in the UDP/IP packet (see clauses 6.5 and 7.2.1A).\n-\tBit 4 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the receiving entity shall ignore it.\n-\tBit 5 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the receiving entity shall ignore it.\n-\tBits 6 to 8, which represent the PFCP version, shall be set to decimal 1 (\"001\").\nThe usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified below.\n-\tOctet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the unique value for each type of control plane message. Message type values are specified in Table 7.3-1 \"Message types\".\n-\tOctets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall indicate the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the PFCP header (the first 4 octets). The SEID (if present) and the Sequence Number shall be included in the length count. The format of the Length field of information elements is specified in clause 8.2 \"Information Element Format\".\n-\tWhen S=1, Octets 5 to 12 represent the Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID) field. This field shall unambiguously identify a session endpoint in the receiving Packet Forward Control entity. The Session Endpoint Identifier is set by the sending entity in the PFCP header of all control plane messages to the SEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity (CP or UP function). If a peer's SEID is not available the SEID field shall be present in a PFCP header, but its value shall be set to \"0\", \"Conditions for sending SEID=0 in PFCP header\".\nNOTE:\tThe SEID in the PFCP header of a message is set to the SEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity regardless of whether the source IP address of the request message and the IP Destination Address provided by the receiving entity for subsequent request messages are the same or not.\n-\tOctets 13 to 15 represent PFCP Sequence Number field.\nIf a peer's SEID is not available, the SEID field shall still be present in the header and its value shall be set to \"0\" in the following messages:\n-\tPFCP Session Establishment Request message on Sxa/Sxb/Sxc/N4;\n-\tIf a node receives a message for which it has no session, i.e. if SEID in the PFCP header is not known, it shall respond with \"Session context not found\" cause in the corresponding response message to the sender, the SEID used in the PFCP header in the response message shall be then set to \"0\";\n-\tIf a node receives a request message containing protocol error, e.g. Mandatory IE missing, which requires the receiver to reject the message as specified in clause 7.6, it shall reject the request message. For the response message, the node should look up the remote peer's SEID and accordingly set SEID in the PFCP header and the message cause code. As an implementation option, the node may not look up the remote peer's SEID and set the PFCP header SEID to \"0\" in the response message. However in this case, the cause value shall not be set to \"Session not found\".\n-\tWhen the UP function sends PFCP Session Report Request message over N4 towards another SMF or another PFCP entity in the SMF as specified in clause 5.22.2 and clause 5.22.3.\n",

The handling of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be treated as Optional IEs as specified in clause 7.6.\n-\tOptional: this means that:\n-\tthe IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE may be included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an erroneous optional IE is specified in clause 7.6.\nFor conditional IEs, the clause describing the PFCP message explicitly defines the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or optional for that particular message. These conditions shall be defined so that the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is critical for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other protocol specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.\nFor grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the rules:\n-\tIf the grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the Mandatory grouped IE for the given message;\n-\tif the grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional IE by the receiver.

If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;\n-\tif the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;\n-\tif the grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.\nIn all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in clause 7.6 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.\nOnly the Cause IE at message level shall be included in the response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not accepted, regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional IEs defined for a given response message. The following are exceptions:\n-\tthe Node ID and Offending IE shall be included as per the requirements specified for the corresponding response message;\n-\tthe Load Control Information, Overload Control Information and the Failed Rule ID IEs may be included in a PFCP session related message.\nIf the Cause IE at Grouped IE level contains a value that indicates that the Grouped IE is not handled correctly, the other IEs in this Grouped IE, other than the Cause IE, may not be included.\nA Grouped IE is an IE which may contain other IEs.\nGrouped IEs have a length value in the TLV encoding, which includes the added length of all the embedded IEs. Overall coding of a grouped IE with 4 octets long IE header is defined in clause 8.2. Each IE within a grouped IE also shall also contain 4 octets long IE header.\nGrouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE type values. The clause describing an IE in this specification shall explicitly state if it is a Grouped IE.\nNOTE:\tEach entry into each Grouped IE creates a new scope level. Exit from the grouped IE closes the scope level. The PFCP message level is the top most scope.\nIf more than one grouped IEs of the same type, but for a different purpose are sent within the same message level, these IEs shall have different IE types.\nIf more than one grouped IEs of the same type and for the same purpose are sent within the same message level, these IEs shall have exactly the same IE type to represent a list.\nAssigning the same IE type to grouped IEs which don't have the same content is not recommended, even if these grouped IEs are in different message levels.\nAn IE in a PFCP message or Grouped IE is identified by its IE Type and described by a specific row in the corresponding tables in clause 7.\nIf several IEs with the same Type are included in a PFCP message or Grouped IE, they represent a list for the corresponding IE name.\nAn IE Type value uniquely identifies a specific IE.\nOne IE type value is specified for Vendor Specific IEs.\n",

In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then the last field is not present;\n-\tExtendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable number of octets.\nThe last fields are typically specified with the statement: \"These octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified\". The legacy receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.\nThe 4th column of this table indicates the number of fixed Octets the IE contained when the IE was first defined in the specification, which shall be an integer value reflecting the minimum length of fixed octets defined for the IE.\nAn IE of any of the above types may have a null length as specified in clause 5.6.3.

                            "text_content": "This clause provides an example of a possible implementation of the \"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.\nIt is possible to make use of a statistical loss function (e.g., random selection of messages to throttle based on the indicated percentage) to decide if the given message can be sent or need to be throttled. For example, the source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for each message which is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10% throttling, messages with a random number 10 or less are throttled and hence this achieves approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic. The actual traffic reduction might vary slightly from the requested percentage, albeit by an insignificant amount.\nThe algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of dropping the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in traffic conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For example, in the 50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority messages, 20% reduction to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high priority messages need to be applied in order to achieve the effective reduction in traffic by 10% towards the overloaded node.\n",

In this example, the OCS grants quotas by chunks of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request new credits when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of online charging with intermediate and final quotas in a power grid. It illustrates the process of charging customers with varying quotas, including the initial allocation of resources, the allocation of resources to customers with higher quotas, and the final allocation of resources to customers with lower quotas. The figure shows the flow of resources from the central grid to the distribution grid, and the distribution grid to the end-user. It also includes a visual representation of the distribution grid, showing the distribution of resources to different customers. The figure is a simplified representation of the complex process of online charging, and it is used to understand the flow of resources in a power grid.\nFigure C.2.1.1-1: Online charging with intermediate and final quotas\n1.\tUpon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants an intermediate quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.\n2.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90 Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes.\n3.\tUpon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends a PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Threshold\" and the Volume Measurement set to 90 Mbytes.

This example is similar to the previous one, but the CP function provisions the UP function with the action to apply when reaching the final quota.\nThe figure depicts an online charging scenario with Quota Action provisioned in the UP function, illustrating the process of charging a device while it is connected to the network. The figure shows the various components involved, such as the device, the network, and the Quota Action provisioned in the UP function. This allows for efficient charging and ensures that the device is charged when it is needed.\nFigure C.2.1.1-2: Online charging with Quota Action provisioned in the UP function\n1 to 7'.\tSame as for figure C.2.1.1-1.\n8.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with a Create FAR IE provisioning the action the UP function shall apply when reaching the quota, and with an Update URR IE including the Volume Quota IE set to 50 Mbytes and the FAR ID for Quota Action IE set to the new FAR ID).

The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C provisions the URR1 and URR2 with the quota received from the OCS respectively for RG1 and RG2 (like if there was no credit pooling).\nThis reflects one possible implementation option, whereby each quota remains managed independently from the others. This approach can result in extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is exhausted.\nFigure  C.2.2.2-1: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 1)\n\nThis figure depicts a simplified online charging scenario with credit pooling. In this scenario, a credit pool is used to manage the charging process. The credit pool is a collection of credits that can be used to pay for the electricity consumed by the device. The figure shows the credit pool, which is represented by a rectangle with a line connecting it to the device. The device is represented by a circle with a line connecting it to the credit pool. The credit pool is divided into two parts, with one part representing the credit that can be used to pay for the electricity and the other part representing the credit that can be used to pay for the electricity that has already been consumed. The figure also shows the charging process, with the device being charged by the credit pool and the credit pool being replenished by the device's consumption.\nFigure C.2.2.2-1: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 1)\n1.\tUpon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:\nRG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.1);\nRG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.5);\n2.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function, to create:\nA new URR1 for RG1, quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;\nA new URR2 for RG2, quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;\nA new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with Multiplier 0.5.\nThe UP function accepts the request.\n3.\tThe RG1 has consumed 100 counted by URR1, RG2 consumed 10 counted by URR2; the URR3 for the Credit Pool counts U = 100 x 0.1 + 10 x 0.5 = 15 < S. The URR1 triggers sending a usage report towards the CP function due to reaching the Quota 100. So the UP function sends a PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports for the URR1. The CP function sends the response message.\n4.\tBased on operator's policies, the CP function reports used quota for the RG1 to the OCS. The OCS does not grant any quota since the quota for the Credit Pool has not been consumed yet.\nNOTE: This step is skipped in the rest flow.\n5.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with the modified URR1, with new quota 100.\nStep 6, 7, 8 and 9 repeats step 3 and 5.\n10. The RG1 has consumed another 100 counted by URR1, RG2 consumed another 10 counted by URR2; the URR3 for the Credit Pool counts U = (100 + 100 + 100 + 100) x 0.1 + (10 +10 + 10 + 10) x 0.5 = 60 >= S = 60. So the UP function sends a PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports for:\n- the URR3, generated due to reaching quota (60),\n- for the URR1, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3 and it has reached the quota 100, and\n- for the URR2 generated due to that it is linked to the URR3.\nThe CP function sends the response message.\n11.\tThe CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.\n12.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.\nIn this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C provisions the quotas for URR1 and URR2 taking into account the credit pool quota and the multipliers of the RGs.\nThis reflects another possible implementation option. This approach avoids extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is exhausted, and thus reduces Sxb signalling.\nFigure C.2.2.3-2 illustrates online charging with Credit Pooling, a method that allows users to pay for their electricity consumption using credit. The figure shows a credit pool with multiple credit accounts, each representing a user's electricity consumption. Users can deposit credits into their preferred accounts, and the system will credit their account with the remaining balance. This method is designed to reduce the cost of electricity for users and promote energy conservation.\nFigure C.2.2.3-2: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 2)\n1.\tUpon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:\nRG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.1);\nRG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.5);\n2.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function, to create:\nA new URR1 for RG1, quota=600, Linked URR = URR3;\nA new URR2 for RG2, quota=120, Linked URR = URR3;\nAnd new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with Multiplier 0.5.\nThe UP function accepts the request.\nNOTE 1: To avoid receiving usage report upon exceeding the original Quota for RG1 or RG2, the quota can be set to 60 / 0.1 = 600 for RG1, assuming RG1 consumes the complete Quota for the pool; similarly, for RG2, the quota can be set to 60 / 0.5 = 120;\n3.\tThe URR3 always first reaches the Quota, e.g. when the URR1 has counted 400, and URR2 has counted 40, this results the counted usage for the Credit Pool U=400 x 0.1 + 40 x 0.5 = 60. So the UP function sends a PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports:\n-\tfor the URR3, generated due to that it has reached quota (60);\n-\tfor the URR1, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3; and\n-\tfor the URR2, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3.\nThe CP function sends the response message.\n4.\tThe CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.\n5.\tThe CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.\nURR1 for RG1, quota=70 / 0.1 = 700; \nURR2 for RG2, quota=70 / 0.5 = 140; \nURR3 for The Credit Pool, quota = 200 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 70.\n",

The SYN includes the address and port number of the Server (i.e. remote host), that are extracted by the Transport Converter and used to initiate a Multipath TCP connection towards this Server. As the Server does not support Multipath TCP, it replies with a SYN+ACK that does not contain the MP_CAPABLE option. The Transport Converter notes that the connection with the Server does not support Multipath TCP and returns the extended TCP header received from the Server to the Client.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an outgoing converter-assisted multipath TCP connection in a 5G network.
