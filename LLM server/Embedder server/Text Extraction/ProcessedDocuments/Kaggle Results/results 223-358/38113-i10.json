This test shall be performed on a representative configuration of BS.\nFor BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O, the radiated emission is covered by radiated spurious emission requirement in TS 38.104 [2], conforming to the test requirement in TS 38.141-2 [4].\nThis test assesses the ability of BS to limit unwanted emission from the enclosure port.\na)\tA test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM.329 [24] shall be used. The BS shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads. One of the following two alternative measurement methods shall be used:\n1)\tField strength method measurement\nThe test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 11. The field strength measurements shall be performed on a test site that is validated according to the methods and requirements of CISPR 16-1-4 [30].\nUnless otherwise stated, measurements are conducted at 3 m or 10 m on an open area test site (OATS) or semi anechoic chamber (SAC) for frequencies up to 1 GHz, or at 3 m on a free space open area test site (FSOATS) or fully-anechoic room (FAR) for frequencies above 1 GHz. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done with RMS detector and with the -3 dB bandwidth of the measuring filter equal to the reference bandwidth in table 8.2.1.3-1.\nNOTE 1:\tTest site validation methods for radiated emissions tests are defined in CISPR 16-1-4 [30], clause 6 and 7. Examples of test site validation methods are listed below:\n-\t30 - 1000 MHz frequency range: Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA), Reference Site Method (RSM).\n-\t1 - 18 GHz frequency range: SVSWR standard test procedure, SVSWR reciprocal test procedure.\n2)\tSubstitution method measurement (also called a substitution method)\nMean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at which a component is detected, the BS shall be rotated and the height of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement. The measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in the orthogonal polarization plane. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).\nNOTE 2:\tEffective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant difference of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p, as defined in ITU-R SM.329 annex 1 [24].\ne.r.p. (dBm)  EIRP (dBm)  2.15\nb)\tThe BS shall transmit with maximum power declared by the manufacturer with all transmitters active. Set the base station to transmit a signal as stated in clause 4.5.\nc)\tThe received power shall be measured over the frequency range from 30 MHz to FDL,low - ΔfOBUE and from FDL,high + ΔfOBUE up to 12750 MHz. For some operating bands, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5th harmonic limit of the downlink operating band, as specified in ITU-R SM.329 [24].The video bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution bandwidth. If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver, it shall be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).\nThe frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [24] and SM.1539 [26].\nThe BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H shall meet the limits below:\nTable 8.2.1.3-1: Limits for radiated emissions from BS\n\nThe interpretation of the results recorded in a test report for the radiated emission measurements described in the present document shall be as follows:\n-\tthe measured value related to the corresponding limit will be used to decide whether an equipment meets the requirements of the present document;\n-\tthe value of the measurement uncertainty for the measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report;\n-\tthe recorded value of the measurement uncertainty shall be, for each measurement, equal to or lower than the figures in table 8.2.1-4-1 for BS.\nTable 8.2.1.4-1 specifies the maximum measurement uncertainty of the test system. The test system shall enable the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.\nA confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a population of test equipment.\nTable 8.2.1.4-1: Maximum measurement uncertainty (BS)\n\nNOTE:\tIf the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty greater than that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1, this equipment can still be used, provided that an adjustment is made follows:\nAny additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the test requirements, i.e. making the test harder to pass.\nThis procedure will ensure that a test system not compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT that would otherwise have failed a test if a test system compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1 had been used.\n",

Where cables have to be connected to these ports, or interconnecting cables have to be extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or extension of these cables;\n-\timmunity tests on the entire NR BS shall be performed by establishing communication links at the radio interface (e.g. with the mobile simulator) and the NG interface (e.g. with an NGC simulator) and evaluating the throughput (see figures 9.1-1 and 9.1-2);\n-\timmunity tests shall be performed on both the uplink and downlink paths. The tests shall also include both the radio interface and the NG interface. Throughput evaluation may be carried out at either interface, where appropriate, and the measurements for the uplink and downlink paths may be carried out as a single path looped at either the radio interface or NG interface. In case of looping is used care have to be taken that the throughput information doesn't change due to looping;\n-\tfor NR BS capable of multi-band operation, communication links shall be established in such a way that all operating band(s) are activated during the test according to the applicable test configurations in clause 4.5. Performance assessment may be done separately for each operating band.\nThe figure depicts a communication link set up for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H immunity measurement. It shows a 5G network with a base station (gNB) and a user equipment (UE) at the transmitter, with a fiber-optic backbone and distributed nodes at the receiver. The figure illustrates the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the layered architecture of the optical backbone.\nFigure 9.1-1: Communication link set up for BS type 1-C/BS type 1-H immunity measurement\nThe figure depicts a communication link set up for a base station (BS) type 1-O and a base station type 2-O, with a focus on immunity measurement. The setup includes a communication link, a power supply, and a signal generator.
