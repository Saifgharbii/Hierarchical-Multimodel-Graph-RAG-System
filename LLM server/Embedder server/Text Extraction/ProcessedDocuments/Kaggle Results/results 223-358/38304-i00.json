                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "The RRC_IDLE state and RRC_INACTIVE state tasks can be subdivided into three processes:\n-\tPLMN selection (for UE not operating in SNPN access mode) or SNPN selection (for UE operating in SNPN access mode);\n-\tCell selection and reselection;\n-\tLocation registration and RNA update.\nPLMN selection, SNPN selection, cell reselection procedures, and location registration are common for both RRC_IDLE state and RRC_INACTIVE state. RNA update is only applicable for RRC_INACTIVE state. When UE selects a new PLMN or SNPN, UE transitions from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE, as specified in TS 24.501 [14].\nWhen a UE is switched on, a public land mobile network (PLMN) or a SNPN is selected by NAS. For the selected PLMN/SNPN, associated RAT(s) may be set, as specified in TS 23.122 [9]. The NAS shall provide a list of equivalent PLMNs or a list of equivalent SNPNs, if available, that the AS shall use for cell selection and cell reselection.\nWith cell selection, the UE searches for a suitable cell of the selected PLMN or selected SNPN, chooses that cell to provide available services, and monitors its control channel. This procedure is defined as \"camping on the cell\".\nThe UE shall, if necessary, then register its presence, by means of a NAS registration procedure, in the tracking area of the chosen cell. As an outcome of a successful Location Registration, the selected PLMN/SNPN then becomes the registered PLMN/SNPN, as specified in TS 23.122 [9].\nIf the UE finds a more suitable cell, according to the cell reselection criteria, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it. If the new cell does not belong to at least one tracking area to which the UE is registered, location registration is performed. In RRC_INACTIVE state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA update procedure is performed.\nIf necessary, the UE shall search for higher priority PLMNs at regular time intervals as described in TS 23.122 [9] and search for a suitable cell if another PLMN has been selected by NAS.\nFor UE not operating in SNPN access mode, search of available CAGs may be triggered by NAS to support manual CAG selection. The AS shall report available CAG-ID(s) together with their HRNN (if broadcast) and PLMN(s) to the NAS.\nNAS may also provide the network slice(s) and Network Slice AS Group (NSAG) information, which contains NSAG(s), their applicable TA(s) if present and their priorities, to be considered by the UE during cell reselection (as specified in TS 23.501 [10], TS 24.501 [14]).\nIf the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN/SNPN, either a new PLMN/SNPN is selected automatically (automatic mode), or an indication of available PLMNs/SNPNs is given to the user so that a manual selection can be performed (manual mode). As part of manual SNPN selection, the AS shall report available SNPN identifiers together with their HRNN (if broadcast) to the NAS.\nRegistration is not performed by UEs only capable of services that need no registration.\nThe UE may perform NR sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink communication while in-coverage or out-of-coverage for sidelink, as specified in clause 8.\nThe U2N Remote UE, the U2N Relay UE, the U2U Remote UE, or the U2U Relay UE may perform sidelink discovery transmissions while in-coverage for the purpose of sidelink relay operations, as specified in clause 8. In addition, the U2N Remote UE, the U2U Remote UE, or the U2U Relay UE can also perform sidelink discovery transmissions while out-of-coverage for the purpose of sidelink relay operations.\nAn L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE may perform all the relevant procedures (e.g., acquiring system information and paging message) via the L2 U2N Relay UE. An L2 U2N Remote UE may choose not to perform any procedures related to cell selection and reselection.\nThe UE may perform NR sidelink discovery transmissions while in-coverage or out-of-coverage for the purpose of sidelink non-relay operations, as specified in clause 8.\nThe UE may perform ranging/sidelink positioning while in-coverage or out-of-coverage, as specified in clause 8.\nThe purpose of camping on a cell in RRC_IDLE state and RRC_INACTIVE state is as follows:\na)\tIt enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN or the SNPN.\nb)\tWhen registered and if the UE wishes to establish an RRC connection or resume a suspended RRC connection, it can do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is camped.\nc)\tIf the network needs to send a message or deliver data to the registered UE, it knows (in most cases) the set of tracking areas (in RRC_IDLE state) or RNA (in RRC_INACTIVE state) in which the UE is camped. It can then send a \"paging\" message for the UE on the control channels of all the cells in the corresponding set of areas. The UE will then receive the paging message and can respond.\nd)\tIt enables the UE to receive ETWS and CMAS notifications.\ne)\tIt enables the UE to receive MBS broadcast services.\nf)\tIt enables the UE to receive MBS multicast services in RRC_INACTIVE state.\nWhen the UE is in RRC_IDLE state, upper layers may deactivate AS layer when MICO mode is activated as specified in TS 24.501 [14]. When MICO mode is activated, the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided by dedicated signalling) is kept and all running timers continue to run but the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks. If a timer expires while MICO mode is activated it is up to the UE implementation whether it performs the corresponding action immediately or the latest when MICO mode is deactivated. When MICO mode is deactivated, the UE shall perform all idle mode tasks.\n",

If no nsag-CellReselectionPriority is given for a NSAG at a frequency, the lowest priority value is used (i.e, lower than any of the network configured values for these frequencies).\n-\tFrequencies that support none of the NSAG(s) provided by NAS are prioritized in the order of their cellReselectionPriority.\nFor a UE performing slice-based cell reselection, if the highest ranked cell or best cell in a frequency fulfils the inter- freqeuency cell reselection criteria (see clause 5.2.4.5) based on reselection priority for the frequency and NSAG derived according to this clause or fulfils intra-frequency and equal priority inter-frequency cell reselection criteria (see clause 5.2.4.6), but this cell does not support the NSAG according to this clause:\n-\tif this cell supports any other NSAG(s) according to this clause, the UE shall re-derive a reselection priority for the frequency by considering the NSAG(s) supported by this cell (rather than those of the corresponding NR frequency);\n-\tOtherwise, the UE shall re-derive a reselection priority for the frequency as if none of the NSAG(s) provided by NAS is supported.\nThis re-derived reselection priority is used for a maximum of 300 seconds, or until new network slice(s) and/or NSAG information are received from NAS. UE shall ensure the cell reselection criteria above are fulfilled based on the newly derived priorities.\n",

The UE monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. A PO is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. subframe or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent (TS 38.213 [4]). One Paging Frame (PF) is one Radio Frame and may contain one or multiple PO(s) or starting point of a PO. A L2 U2N Relay UE monitors the paging occasions of its PC5-RRC connected L2 U2N Remote UEs. In this case, the DRX cycle and UE ID mentioned in this clause refer to those of the L2 U2N Remote UE.\nIn multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same paging message and the same Short Message are repeated in all transmitted beams and thus the selection of the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message and Short Message is up to UE implementation. The paging message is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.\nThe UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN initiated paging. If the UE receives a CN initiated paging in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS. However, if a L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_INACTIVE state receives a CN initiated paging for a L2 U2N Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE does not move to RRC_IDLE state.\nNOTE 0a:\tThe L2 U2N Remote UE does not need to monitor the PO in order to receive the paging message.\nNOTE 0b:\tWhile the SDT procedure is ongoing in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE monitors the PO in order to receive only the Short Message as specified in TS 38.331 [3].\nThe PF and PO for paging are determined by the following formulae:\nSFN for the PF is determined by:\n(SFN + PF_offset) mod T = (T div N)*(UE_ID mod N)\nIndex (i_s), indicating the index of the PO is determined by:\ni_s = floor (UE_ID/N) mod Ns\nThe PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are determined according to pagingSearchSpace as specified in TS 38.213 [4] and firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO and nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO if configured as specified in TS 38.331 [3]. When SearchSpaceId = 0 is configured for pagingSearchSpace, the PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are same as for RMSI as defined in clause 13 in TS 38.213 [4].\nWhen SearchSpaceId = 0 is configured for pagingSearchSpace, Ns is either 1 or 2. For Ns = 1, there is only one PO which starts from the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PF. For Ns = 2, PO is either in the first half frame (i_s = 0) or the second half frame (i_s = 1) of the PF.\nWhen SearchSpaceId other than 0 is configured for pagingSearchSpace, the UE monitors the (i_s + 1)th PO. A PO is a set of 'S*X ' consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions where 'S' is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is the nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO if configured or is equal to 1 otherwise. The [x*S+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PO corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x=0,1,…,X-1, K=1,2,…,S. The PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging which do not overlap with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from zero starting from the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PF. When firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO is present, the starting PDCCH monitoring occasion number of (i_s + 1)th PO is the (i_s + 1)th value of the firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO parameter; otherwise, it is equal to i_s * S*X. If X > 1, when the UE detects a PDCCH transmission addressed to P-RNTI within its PO, the UE is not required to monitor the subsequent PDCCH monitoring occasions for this PO.\nNOTE 1:\tA PO associated with a PF may start in the PF or after the PF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple radio frames. When SearchSpaceId other than 0 is configured for paging-SearchSpace the PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple periods of the paging search space.\nThe following parameters are used for the calculation of PF and i_s above:\nT: DRX cycle of the UE.\nIf the UE does not operate in eDRX as defined in clause 7.4:\n-\tT is determined by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value configured by RRC  (if any), the UE specific DRX value configured by upper layers (if any), and a default DRX value broadcast in system information.

For paging in a DL BWP other than the BWP configured by initialDownlinkBWP, the parameter first-PDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO is signaled in the corresponding BWP configuration.\nIf the UE has no 5G-S-TMSI, for instance when the UE has not yet registered onto the network, the UE shall use as default identity UE_ID = 0 in the PF and i_s formulas above.\n5G-S-TMSI is a 48 bit long bit string as defined in TS 23.501 [10]. 5G-S-TMSI shall in the formulae above be interpreted as a binary number where the left most bit represents the most significant bit.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state, if the UE supports inactiveStatePO-Determination and the network broadcasts ranPagingInIdlePO with value \"true\", the UE shall use the same i_s as for RRC_IDLE state.

The first PF of the PFs associated with the PEI-O is provided by (SFN for PF) - floor (iPO/Ns)*T/N, where SFN for PF is determined in clause 7.1, iPO is defined in clause 10.4a in TS 38.213[4], T, Ns, and N are determined in clause 7.1.\nThe PDCCH MOs for PEI are determined as specified in TS 38.213 [4] according to pei-SearchSpace, pei-FrameOffset, firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O and nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO if configured as specified in TS 38.331 [3]. When SearchSpaceId = 0 is configured for pei-SearchSpace, the PDCCH MOs for PEI are same as for RMSI as defined in clause 13 in TS 38.213 [4]. UE determines first PDCCH MO for PEI-O based on pei-FrameOffset and firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O, as for the case with SearchSpaceId > 0 configured.\nWhen SearchSpaceId = 0 is configured for pei-SearchSpace, the UE monitors the PEI-O according to searchSpaceZero. When SearchSpaceId other than 0 is configured for pei-SearchSpace, the UE monitors the PEI-O according to the search space with the configured SearchSpaceId.\nA PEI occasion is a set of 'S*X' consecutive PDCCH MOs, where 'S' is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1, and X is the nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO if configured or is equal to 1 otherwise. The [x*S+K]th PDCCH MO for PEI in the PEI-O corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x=0,1,…,X-1, K=1,2,…,S. The PDCCH MOs for PEI which do not overlap with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from zero starting from the first PDCCH MO for PEI in the PEI-O. When the UE detects a PEI within its PEI-O, the UE is not required to monitor the subsequent MO(s) associated with the same PEI-O.\nIf the UE detects PEI and the PEI indicates the subgroup the UE belongs to monitor its associated PO, as specified in clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 [4], the UE monitors the associated PO as specified in clause 7.1. If the UE does not detect PEI on the monitored PEI occasion or the PEI does not indicate the subgroup the UE belongs to monitor its associated PO, as specified in clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 [4], the UE is not required to monitor the associated PO as specified in clause 7.1.\nIf the UE is unable to monitor the PEI occasion (i.e. all valid PDCCH MO for PEI) corresponding to its PO, e.g. during cell re-selection, the UE monitors the associated PO according to clause 7.1.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state, when the UE uses the same i_s as for RRC_IDLE state as specified in clause 7.1, the UE shall use the same iPO as for RRC_IDLE state. Otherwise, the UE determines the iPO based on the formula defined in clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 [4].\n",
