The time difference between the reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (D.3-1). The timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (TA 31)1664Tc for 15kHz SCS, Δτ - (TA 31)1632Tc for 30kHz SCS and Δτ - (TA 31)168Tc for 120kHz SCS. The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving propagation conditions are shown in Table D.3-1.\nThe figure depicts a moving propagation condition in a 5G network, illustrating how signals propagate in different directions. The diagram highlights the impact of moving obstacles on signal quality, such as buildings and trees, and how these can be mitigated through beamforming techniques.\nFigure D.3-1: Moving propagation conditions\n(D.3-1)\nTable D.3-1: Parameters for UL timing adjustment\n\n\n\n\n",
