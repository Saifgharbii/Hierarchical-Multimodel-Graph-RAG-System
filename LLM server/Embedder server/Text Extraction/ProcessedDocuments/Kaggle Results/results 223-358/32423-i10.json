            "description": "The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:\nTS 32.421:\t\"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace concepts and requirements\";\nTS 32.422:\t\"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace control and configuration management \";\nTS 32.423:\t\"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace data definition and management\";\nSubscriber and MS Trace provide very detailed information at call level on one or more specific mobile(s). This data is an additional source of information to Performance Measurements and allows going further in monitoring and optimisation operations.\nContrary to Performance Measurements, which are a permanent source of information, Trace is activated on user demand for a limited period of time for specific analysis purpose\nTrace plays a major role in activities such as determination of the root cause of a malfunctioning mobile, advanced troubleshooting, optimisation of resource usage and quality, RF coverage control and capacity improvement, dropped call analysis, Core Network and TRAN end to end   procedure validation.\nThe capability to log data on any interface at call level for a specific user (e.g. IMSI or SUPI) or mobile type (e.g. IMEI or IMEISV) allows getting information which cannot be deduced from Performance Measurements such as perception of end-user QoS during his call (e.g. requested QoS vs. provided QoS), correlation between protocol messages and RF measurements, or interoperability with specific mobile vendors.\nMoreover, Performance Measurements provide values aggregated on an observation period, Subscriber and Equipment Trace give instantaneous values for a specific event (e.g. call, location update, etc.).\nIf Performance Measurements are mandatory for daily operations, future network planning and primary trouble shooting, Subscriber and MS Trace is the easy way to go deeper into investigation and network optimisation.\nIn order to produce this data, Subscriber and MS trace are carried out in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external system (e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further evaluation).\n",

            "description": "The present document describes Trace data definition and management. It covers the trace records content, their format and transfer across UMTS networks, EPS networks or 5GS networks. GSM Trace is outside of the scope of this specification..\nThe present document also describes the data definition for Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) across 3GPP networks.\nThe objectives of the present document are:\n-\tTo provide the descriptions for a standard set of Trace and MDT data;\n-\tTo define the common format of trace and MDT records; and\n-\tTo define a method for the reporting of Trace and MDT results across the management interfaces.\nClause 4 details the various Trace records content, Clause 5 defines GPB trace format for NR, Annex A provides Trace and MDT report file format, Annex B provides the trace report file conventions and transfer procedure, Annex C provides the trace reporting functional architecture and Annex D provides some trace and MDT files examples, Annex G provides normative GPB trace record schema and examples.\nTrace and MDT concepts and requirements are covered in TS 32.421 [2] while Trace control and configuration management are described in 3GPP TS 32.422 [3].\nThe definition of Trace and MDT data is intended to result in comparability of Trace and MDT data produced in a multi-vendor wireless 3GPP networks.\nThe following is beyond the scope of the present document, and therefore the present document does not describe:\n-\tAny notification mechanisms or IRPs for trace. Only file transfer mechanism is specified for trace data transfer;\n-\tAny data compression mechanisms for trace data transfer;\n-\tAny Trace capability limitations (e.g. maximum number of simultaneous traced mobiles for a given NE).\n",

The  Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload. The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the  Trace Record Header is set to \"TRACE_SESSION_START\". The start trace session administrative message is not used for signalling based activation as there is no separate trigger for starting the session and the trace recording session.\nThe Trace Session Stop administrative message shall be used to convey the stop of a Trace Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for details). The Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload. The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Trace Record Header is set to \"TRACE_SESSION_STOP\".The stop trace session administrative message is not used for signalling based activation as there is no separate trigger for stoping the session and the trace recording session.\nThe Trace Recording Session Start administrative message shall be used to convey the start of a Trace Recording Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for details). The Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload. The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Streaming Trace Record Header is set to \"TRACE_ RECORDING_SESSION_START\".\nThe Trace Recording Session Stop administrative message shall be used to convey the stop of a Trace Recording Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for details). The Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload in the normal case, For the abnormal case, the trace record should include the reason for the session stop. One of the reasons could be overloaded. The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Streaming Trace Record Header is set to \"TRACE_ RECORDING_SESSION_STOP\".\nThe Trace Stream Heartbeat administrative message may be used in absence of the captured trace data and other administrative messages from the MnS Producer to the MnS Consumer. The message is intended to indicate that a streaming trace connection is alive and does not indicate whether there is an ongoing Trace Session or not.\nTransport protocol level keep-alive mechanisms may be used as an alternative (e.g. use of Ping and Pong WebSocket frames in IETF RFC 6455 [40]) and are out of scope of the present document.\nThe Trace Recording Session Not Started administrative message shall be used to convey that a trace recording session could not be started. For example, the number of simultaneous UE traces may be limited so that UE traces are not started when this limit is reached. It includes the detailed reason as string in the payload.\nThe Trace Recording Session Dropped Events administrative message shall be used to convey the number of dropped trace records. The message provides indication that trace records are dropped from a particular trace recording session. It includes the number of trace records dropped in the payload.\nThe Trace File Open administrative message shall be used to convey that trace file is opened for trace recording at the start of ROP period. The message provides indication when a file is opened.\nThe Trace File Close administrative message shall be used to convey that trace file is closed for trace recording at the end of ROP period. The message provides indication when a file is closed.\nThe Trace File Abnormal Closed administrative message shall be used to convey that trace file is closed abnormally. For example, the trace file is closed due to resource constraint such as out of memory.\nThe Trace Recording Session Throttled Start administrative message shall be used to convey that the lower priority trace records are missing. A possible reason is due to overload condition for a Trace Recording Session. The Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload or include which kind of contents are missing. The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Trace Record Header is set to \"TRACE_ RECORDING_SESSION_THROTTLED_START\".\nThe Trace Recording Session Throttled Stop administrative message shall be used to convey that throttling is cleared for a Trace Recording Session. The Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload. The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Trace Record Header is set to \"TRACE_ RECORDING_SESSION_THROTTLED_STOP\".\nThe Trace Session Not Started administrative message shall be used to convey that a trace session could not be started.

Depending on the data retrieval and storage mechanisms, several consecutive trace result files could be generated for a single traced call. The file naming convention shall allow rebuilding the temporal file sequences.\n-\tSince the files are transferred via a machine-machine interface, the files should be machine-readable using standard tools.\n-\tThe file format should be independent from the data transfer protocol used to carry the file from one system to another.\n-\tThe file format should be generic across UMTS and EPS systems.\n-\tThe file format should be flexible enough to support further trace data types and decoded IEs, as well as vendor specific trace data.\n",

            "description": "The following convention shall be applied for trace result file naming:\n<Type><Startdate>.<Starttime>-<SenderType>.<SenderName>.[<TraceReference>].[<TraceRecordingSessionRef>]\n1)\tThe Type field indicates if the file contains trace data for single or multiple calls, where:\n-\t\"A\" means single Trace Recording Session, single sender NE;\n-\t\"B\" means multiple Trace Recording Sessions, single sender NE;\n-\t\"C\" means IMSI/IMEI (SV)  information for cell traffic trace or IMEI-TAC if area based MDT trace is involved (3GPP TS 32.422 [3] clause 4.4) .\n\n2)\tThe Startdate field indicates the date of the first record in the trace file. The Startdate field is of the form YYYYMMDD, where:\n-\tYYYY is the year in four-digit notation;\n-\tMM is the month in two digit notation (01 - 12);\n-\tDD is the day in two digit notation (01 - 31).\n3)\tThe Starttime field indicates the time of the first record in the trace file. The Starttime field is of the form HHMMSSshhmm, where:\n-\tHH is the two digit hour of the day (local time), based on 24 hour clock (00 - 23);\n-\tMM is the two digit minute of the hour (local time) (00 – 59);\n-\tSS is the two digit second of the minute (local time) (00 – 59);\n-\ts is the sign of the local time differential from UTC (+ or -), in case the time differential to UTC is 0 then the sign may be arbitrarily set to \"+\" or \"-\";\n-\thh is the two digit number of hours of the local time differential from UTC (00-23);\n-\tmm is the two digit number of minutes of the local time differential from UTC (00-59).\n4)\tSenderType field is the type of NE defined by IOC attribute managedElementType in 3GPP TS 32.622 [12] that recorded and sent the trace file; SenderName field is the identifier of the NE that recorded and sent the trace file.\n5)\tTraceRecordingSessionReference field is set only if the type field is A, and is represented in hexa-decimal format. TraceRecordingSessionReference is a 4 digit hexadecimal number and will not include filler digits for values less than 4 digits in length. All hexadecimal letters (A thru F) are capitalized.\n6)\tTraceReference field is set if the type field is A. For type B the Trace Reference is optional and will be used when one trace file is created per trace session with multiple trace recording session. Trace Reference is represented in hexadecimal format. Trace Reference as defined in 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] is composed of PLMN ID (MCC, MNC) and Trace ID. The PLMN identity consists of 3 digits for MCC followed by either - a filler digit plus 2 digits from MNC (in case of 2 digit MNC) or 3 digits from MNC (in case of a 3 digit MNC). MCC and MNC are in BCD format.\nExample: If MCC: 405, MNC: 139\noctet 1: 0x04 (MCC digit 2, MCC digit 1)\noctet 2: 0x15 (MNC digit 1, MCC digit 3)\noctet 3: 0x93 (MNC digit 3, MNC digit 2)\nAlso if the MNC is 2 digits (MCC: 405 and MNC 39)\noctet 1: 0x04 (MCC digit 2, MCC digit 1)\noctet 2: 0xF5 (MNC digit 1, MCC digit 3)\noctet 3: 0x93 (MNC digit 3, MNC digit 2)\n7)\tTrace Reference is set if the type field is C.\nSee bullet 6 above for details regarding the representation of the Trace Reference.Some examples describing file naming convention:\n1)\tfile name:\tA20090928.231500+0200-MME.MME5. 13F23200056.125,\nmeaning:\tfile produced by MME< MME5> on September 28, 2009, first trace record at 23:15:00 local time with a time differential of +2 hours against UTC. The file contains trace data for the Trace Session with the Trace reference 13F232000056 (where MCC is 312, MNC is 23, and Trace ID is 000056, all in hexadecimal format) and for the Trace Recording Session with the reference 125.\n2)\tfile name:\tB20030115.170000-0300-RNC.RNC02,\nmeaning: file produced by RNC<RNC02> on January 15, 2003, first trace record at 17:00:00 local time with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The file contains trace data for several Trace Recording Sessions.\n3)\tfile name:\tB20030115.170000-0300-RNC.RNC02. 4358070034D7,\nmeaning: file produced by RNC<RNC02> on January 15, 2003, first trace record at 17:00:00 local time with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The file contains trace 4358070034D7 (where MCC is 348, MNC is 570, and Trace ID is 0034D7) data for Trace reference  and several Trace Recording Sessions.\n4)\tfile name C20030115.170000-0300-MME.MME02. 26F452550021\nMeaning: file produced by MME<MME02> on January 15, 2003, first trace record at 17:00:00 local time with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC.
