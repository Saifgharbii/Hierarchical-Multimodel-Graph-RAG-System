Annex A in [3] also provides a comprehensive overview of the cloud-native related industry initiatives.\nRequirements on the list of services offered by architectural elements providing the container management related functions described in [3] are specified in [6].\nIn [4] the types of VNF management functions which can be generalized and provided as \"generic OAM functions\" are analysed and defined. Possible solutions for realizing such generic functions are also described.\nIn [5] NFV architectural capabilities and features are profiled based on their utility in addressing the 5G network capabilities and features and enhancements to NFV architectural framework are recommended to further support 5G network characteristics\n",

Load balancing is done over several VNFC instances. In the case of a failing VNFC instance, fail-over can happen to another VNFC instance.\nThe figure depicts a cloud-native VNF load balancing and failover system, illustrating how virtual network functions (VNFs) are managed and distributed across multiple cloud instances. Key components include load balancing algorithms, failover mechanisms, and monitoring tools, ensuring efficient and reliable network performance.\nFigure 5.4-1: Cloud-native VNF load balancing and failover\nAs a pre-condition to this use case, the network is running normally. The 3GPP management system has initiated collection of measurements from the cloud-native VNF.\nThe use case begins when a VNFC instance (for example VNFC-1) fails.\nAs described in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 [3], the VNFM, the failover agent, and the load balancer may work together to execute failover to a replacement VNFC instance.\nIn case the failover is too slow or the failover is unsuccessful, the VNF may experience an overload situation. This overload situation will result in abnormal values in the performance measurements which are collected by the 3GPP management system. In some cases, this may result in notifications from the 3GPP management system if pre-defined thresholds are crossed. Depending on the impact to the VNF functionality, the 3GPP management system may issue alarms to indicate that functionality is lost or impaired.\nThe end result is that the 3GPP management system may issue alarms or performance data indicating a VNF overload situation if the failover is too slow or if the failover is unsuccessful.\n",

One of the recommendations from ETSI GR NFV-FA 029 [3] is to introduce support for container management in ETSI NFV MANO, such as introducing support for MCIOP (Managed Container Infrastructure Object Package) and CISM (Container Infrastructure Service Management).\nThe use case begins when the 3GPP management system decides to deploy a NF as a containerised VNF.\nThe 3GPP management system requests to interact with ETSI NFV MANO for instantiation of the VNF (See in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 008 V4.3.1 [8] and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 V4.3.1 [9]). NFV MANO inspects the relevant VNF Descriptor (as defined in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 V4.3.1 [12]) to get the required containerised resource information.\nNFV MANO will request CISM for containerised resource creation ( as defined in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 V4.3.1 [6]).
