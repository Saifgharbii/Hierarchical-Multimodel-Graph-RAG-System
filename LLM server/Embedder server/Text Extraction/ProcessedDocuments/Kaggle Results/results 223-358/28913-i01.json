The energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource instance X runs.

Thus, the definition of the estimated energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance combines both virtual CPU mean usage and virtual disk mean usage.\nIn this potential solution #1, the energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource runs. This proportion is obtained by multiplying relative mean virtual CPU usage and virtual disk usage of the virtual compute resource instance X. The relative mean virtual CPU usage of the virtual compute resource instance X is obtained by dividing the vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI Node as X, The relative mean virtual disk usage of the virtual compute resource instance X is obtained by dividing the vDisk mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the vDisk mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI Node as X. This is defined by the equation below:\n\nwhere:\n- VCpuUsageMean is the mean virtual CPU usage of the virtual compute resource instance during the observation period, provided by NFV MANO;\n-  is the sum of the mean virtual CPU usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI Node during the same observation period, all separately provided by NFV MANO (see clause 7.1.2 of [3];\n- VDiskUsageMean is the mean virtual disk usage of the virtual compute resource instance during the observation period, provided by NFV MANO;\n- is the sum of the mean virtual disk usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI Node during the same observation period, all separately provided by NFV MANO (see clause 7.1.6 of [3];\n- ECNFVINode,measured is the measured energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource instance runs, during the same observation period, as per ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4];\nIn this potential solution #2, it is proposed to consider the mean virtual disk usage of the virtualised compute resource instance only.\nIn this potential solution, the energy consumption of a virtual compute resource X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource runs, this proportion being obtained by dividing the vDisk mean usage of the virtual compute resource X, by the sum of the vDisk mean usage of all virtual compute resources running on the same NFVI Node as X, as defined by the equation below:\n\nwhere:\n- VDiskUsageMean is the mean vDisk usage of the virtual compute resource during the observation period, provided by NFV MANO;\n-  is the sum of the vDisk mean usage of all virtual compute resources running on the same NFVI Node during the same observation period, all separately provided by NFV MANO (see clause 7.1.6 of [3];\n- ECNFVINode,measured is the measured energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource runs, during the same observation period, as per ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4].\nIn this potential solution #3, it is proposed to consider four types of metrics related to virtualized compute resources which can be provided by ETSI NFV MANO:\n# Mean virtual CPU usage of the virtualized compute resource (see clause 7.1.2 of [3]);\n# Mean memory usage of the virtualized compute resource (see clause 7.1.4 of [3]);\n# Mean disk usage of the virtualized compute resource (see clause 7.1.6 of [3]);\n# I/O traffic of the virtualized compute resource, measured by the sum of the number of incoming bytes on virtual compute (see clause 7.1.8 of [3]) and the number of outgoing bytes on virtual compute (see clause 7.1.9 of [3]).\nThus, four separate definitions of the estimated energy consumption of a virtualized compute resource are proposed, based on the four aforementioned measurements.\nWhich of these four KPIs is to be used for estimating the energy consumed by different virtualized compute resources is not subject to standardization and is left to operators' decision.\n4.1.2.3.2.0\tGeneral\nIn this potential solution #3, the energy consumption of a virtualized compute resource X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtualized compute resource runs.\nThis proportion is obtained by considering either:\n- the relative mean virtual CPU usage, or\n- the relative mean virtual memory usage, or\n- the relative mean virtual disk usage, or\n- the relative incoming/outgoing traffic volume of the virtual compute resource instance X.\nThe relative mean virtual CPU usage of a virtual compute resource instance X is obtained by dividing the vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI node as X.\nThe relative mean memory usage of a virtual compute resource instance X is obtained by dividing the mean memory usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the mean memory usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI node as X.\nThe relative mean disk usage of a

Most of their emissions would come from Scope 3. Part of their Scope 3 emissions could come from the telecommunication services they use.\nSometimes, under the pressure of their stakeholders, these companies (playing, in the context of this key issue, the role of NSC) may be willing to cooperate with their providers (in general) to reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

                            "text_content": "This potential solution focuses on the 'Ultra Reliable' (UR) characteristic of the URLLC network slice. The solution considers reliability of Network Slice as \"percentage of successfully delivered packets within a time constraint\" as defined in TS 22.261 [15] and TS 22.289 [16]. This enables CSPs/NOPs to have a robust and complete view of its URLLC slice's EE KPI. The solution involves dividing the Reliability Performance of URLLC slice (based on percentage of successfully delivered packets within a time constraint) by the total amount of energy consumption of the URLLC slice in same time period.\nEnergy Efficiency KPI of a URLLC network slice based on its reliability performance is represented as EEURLLC,Reliability. Since generic EE KPI formula of a slice is the ratio of Performance of network slice to the Energy Consumption of network slice hence EEURLLC,Reliability is given as below:\n\nEquation 1\nwhere PNS is the performance of a network slice. For a URLLC slice it can be both latency and reliability. Since the proposed solution is to establish EE KPI with respect to its reliability, thus here, performance of Network Slice is in terms of its reliability and hence PNS is actually denoted as PURLLC,Reliability. ECNS is the Energy Consumption of the whole slice as specified in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.3.3.\nReliability performance of URLLC slice i.e. PURLLC,Reliability can be judged by \"Packet Success Rate percentage\" (PSR%). The definition of reliability in TS 22.261 [15] says \"Reliability is defined in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as percentage value of the packets successfully delivered to a given system entity within the time constraint required by the targeted service out of all the packets transmitted.\".\nSo, in this case, PURLLC,Reliability is denoted by PURLLC,Reliability,PSR and is defined as:\n\nEquation 2\nwhere:\n# PSR% is Packet Success Rate percentage and is calculated over different interfaces and direction (UL/DL) as explained below;\n# X is the total number of bits of packets sent over an interface in a URLLC slice, within the considered time frame T1.\nIt can be obtained by the measurements defined in clauses 5.4.1.4 & 5.1.2.1.2.1 of TS 28.552 for DL and UL respectively.\nNote: \tMeasurement from clause 5.4.1.4 needs to be multiplied by 8.\nIf PURLLC,Reliability,PSR is divided by Energy Consumption of network slice (ECNS), then EE KPI i.e. EEURLLC,Reliability is obtained. It tells that \"with an evaluated reliability (PSR%), how many packets can be successfully sent per Joule of energy in a URLLC slice in a given time frame constraint\".\nSo, in this case, EE KPI is given by:\n\nEquation 3\nSpecifically, EE KPI in DL and UL is given by equations 4 and 5 as below:\n\nEquation 4\n\n\nEquation 5\nPURLLC,Reliability,PSR can be calculated independently for DL and UL directions. With PSR% based approach the EEURLLC,Reliability of a URLLC slice has the unit of bits per Joule. EEURLLC,Reliability can be calculated per interface and per DL and UL direction.\nThroughout the slice, the same or different PSR% might exist on different interfaces.\n# If it is same, the PSR % (reliability) of a slice can be calculated at any one segment of network i.e. between UE and gNB or between gNB and UPF.\n# In case, if it is not same, the implementations may choose to calculate the PSR% of a URLLC slice at any interface deemed appropriate for the operator e.g. N3 or if end to end PSR% reliability is required, then it can consider combined (multiplied) PSR% reliability of all the interfaces together.\nFollowing are the possible options and related calculations:\n# Reliability calculation for uplink over Uu interface – PURLLC,Reliability,PSR is obtained for Uu interface by using PSR% calculated in equation below:\nPSRUL,Uu = ULRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI\nEquation 6\n\nwhere PSRUL,Uu is equal to ULRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI which is PSR% in UL for Uu interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.2.\n# Reliability calculation for downlink over Uu interface: PURLLC,Reliability,PSR is obtained for Uu interface by using corresponding PSR% as calculated in equation below.\nPSRDL,Uu = DLRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI\nEquation 7\n\nwhere PSRDL,Uu is equal to DLRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI which is PSR% in DL for Uu interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.1.\n# Reliability calculation over N3 interface in uplink: PURLLC,Reliability,PSR is obtained for N3 interface by using PSR% calculated in equation below. It is based on number of GTP data packets measurement.\nPSRUL,N3 = ULRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI\nEquation 8\nwhere PSRUL,N3 is equal to ULRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI which is PSR% in UL for N3 interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.4.\n# Reliability calculation over N3 interface in downlink: PURLLC,Reliability,PSR is obtained for N3 interface by using PSR% calculated in equation below. It is based on number of GTP data packets measurement.\nPSRDL,N3 = DLRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI\nEquation 9\nwhere PSRDL,N3 is equal to DLRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI which is PSR% in DL for N3 interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.3.\nSo,\n# end to end PSR% Reliability in UL = PSRUL,Uu × PSRUL,N3\n# end to end PSR% Reliability in DL = PSRDL,Uu × PSRDL,N3\nThese end to end PSR% values in DL and UL will be fed in equation 2. Accordingly, equations 4 and 5 will provide Energy efficiency value for URLLC network slice in DL and UL respectively.\nIn this potential solution #2, it is proposed to define a variant of Energy Efficiency KPI that considers reliability performance of a URLLC slice for comprehensive assessment of EE. Specifically, some of KPI and parameters refer to definitions in TS 28.554 [2].\na) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type URLLC based on reliability. The Pns for a network slice of type URLLC is the multiplication of downlink packet transmission reliability and uplink packet transmission reliability of the network slice [2].
