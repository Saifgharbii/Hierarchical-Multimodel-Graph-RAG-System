In this case there is also charging information generated in the home MNO for retail purposes, studied in clause 7.2.\nThe figure depicts a 5G roaming connection and mobility scenario in a service-based interface representation, illustrating the various components and their interactions.\nFigure 7.1.4.6.2-1: Roaming 5G connection and mobility scenario in service-based interface representation\nThe figure depicts a 5G roaming connection and mobility scenario in reference point representation, illustrating the various elements involved in a 5G network, such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 7.1.4.6.2-2: Roaming 5G connection and mobility scenario in reference point representation\nThe flows for 5G connection and mobility charging would be the same as in clause 5.2.2.5 of TS 32.256 [5],\nA possible solution for key issue #1g covering requirements REQ-CH_VMNO-05 and REQ-CH_VMNO-08, using preconfigured roaming charging triggers.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in clauses7.1.4.1.2, 7.1.4.2.2, and 7.1.4.5.2.\nThe negotiation of how the charging triggers should be configured is done as part of the roaming agreement between the VPLMN and HPLMN outside the scope of 3GPP SA5.\nThe negotiated roaming charging triggers are configured in the VPLMN’s V-CHF, V-SMF, AMF, and SMSF. These preconfigured charging triggers could be specific to the HPLMN of the UE. In SMF case the roaming charging triggers would only be exchanged between the V-SMF and V-CHF.\nA possible solution for key issue #1d covering requirements REQ-CH_VMNO-01, and REQ-CH_VMNO -02, about the FBC negotiation between visited MNO and home MNO.\nThe FBC (Flow Based Charging) is not used for wholesale and settlement between visited MNO and home MNO. The triggers of FBC are not used for negotiation between visited MNO and home MNO. The V-CHF sets the FBC triggers independent of HPLMN.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #1.3 clause 7.1.4.3.2.\nThe detailed message flows would be the same as in clause 5.2.2.18.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. V-CHF receives charging information based on FBC triggers and generates records. There is no negotiation of FBC triggers between visited MNO and Home MNO.\nA possible solution for key issue #1a, covering requirements REQ-CH_VMNO-01, and REQ-CH_VMNO-02, the charging information for 5G data connectivity provided to the CHF in the visited MNO and CHF in home MNO (via V-CHF), From the standpoint of the V-SMF, there are two charging sessions between V-SMF and V-CHF, covering local breakout case.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as Figure 7.2.4.1.2-2.\nFor the V-SMF communicating with the H-CHF, the V-CHF is responsible for sending the charging messages between V-SMF and H-CHF.\nThe figure depicts a message flow for two charging sessions, illustrating the various steps and interactions between the charging devices and the charging infrastructure. The flow includes the initiation of a charging session, the transfer of power from the charging device to the charging infrastructure, and the completion of the charging session. The figure provides a visual representation of the complex process involved in charging devices, highlighting the importance of efficient communication and coordination between the charging devices and the charging infrastructure.\nFigure 7.1.4.9.3-1: Message flow for two charging sessions\nDuring the PDU session establishment, V-SMF establishes the two charging sessions in the separate charging resource with V-CHF.\nIn the interaction between the V-SMF and V-CHF, V-SMF reports the charging information to V-CHF.\nIn the interaction between the V-SMF and H-CHF, V-SMF reports the charging information to the V-CHF in the charging session between the V-SMF and V-CHF, V-CHF sends the charging information to H-CHF in the charging session between the H-CHF and V-CHF. For QBC, the triggers and charging information are same for both charging sessions.\nFor FBC, trigger does not have synchronization mechanism, i.e. for V-CHF and H-CHF, it’s possible that the FBC charging information and trigger are not same for the two charging sessions.\nA possible solution for key issue #1f covering requirements REQ-CH_VMNO-01, and REQ-CH_VMNO -02, about the PDU Session level setting for QBC triggers.\nThe QBC triggers and FBC triggers have separate PDU session level triggers i.e., there will be QBC specific PDU session triggers and FBC specific PDU session triggers.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as the local breakout architecture in solution #1.3 clause 7.1.4.3.2, or home routed architecture in Figure 4.2.4 of TS 32.255.\nFor home routed scenario, the message flow is same with the PDU session establishment message flow in clause 5.2.2.12.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. In step 11ch-d of Figure 5.2.2.12.2.1 in TS 32.255 [4], the H-CHF acknowledges by sending Charging Data Response to the H-SMF and optionally includes a \"Roaming Charging Profile\". The \"Roaming Charging Profile\" may include both QoS flow and PDU session level triggers (e.g. , both QoS change and user location change) for QBC, for FBC both rating group and PDU session level triggers may be included in the trigger elements of Charging Data Response.\nFor local breakout scenario, the message flow is same with the PDU session establishment message flow in clause 5.2.2.18.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. In step 9ch-d2 of Figure 5.2.2.18.2-1 in TS 32.255 [4], the H-CHF acknowledges by sending Charging Data Response to the V-SMF and optionally includes a \"Roaming Charging Profile\". The \"Roaming Charging Profile\" may include both QoS flow and PDU session level triggers (e.g. , both QoS change and user location change) for QBC, for FBC both rating group and PDU session level triggers may be included in the trigger element of Charging Data Response.\nThis means that the values and status of PDU session level triggers may be different for QBC and FBC. For example, a PDU Session level \"Expiry of data time limit per PDU session\" for FBC is set to 600 seconds while it for QBC is set to 900 seconds, this means that after 600 seconds all the rating groups shall be reported but no QoS flows, then after another 300 seconds all QoS flows shall be reported but no rating groups. While updates can in some cases coincide, it would be difficult to sort out the reason for and order of the trigger and would therefore preferably always be separate for FBC and QBC.\nA possible solution for key issue #1e covering requirements REQ-CH_VMNO-05, about the QoS flow level trigger setting during the PDU session.\nThe QBC triggers mechanism is specified in the clause 5.2.1.6 TS 32.255 [4] and Roaming Charging Profile is specified in clause 5.2.1.7 of TS 32.255 [4]. The QBC triggers include PDU session level triggers and QoS Flow level triggers.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as the local breakout architecture in solution #1.3 clause 7.1.4.3.2 or Home Routed architecture in Figure 4.2.4 of TS 32.255 [4].\nThe message flow is same with the PDU session establishment message flow in clause 5.2.2.12.2 or 5.2.2.18.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. In a Roaming Charging Profile negotiation, a QBC triggers is common for all QFIs, and applies individually for each QFI.\nA possible solution for key issue #1f covering requirement REQ-CH_VMNO-08 about the PDU session level setting for QBC triggers.\nThe QBC triggers and FBC triggers share PDU session level triggers, this means that there is one set of PDU session level triggers from the CHF, even when both QBC and FBC is applicable at the same time. The roaming charging profile is controlled by the H-CHF, since it is the H-CHF that is the last network function to update the roaming charging profile, and the V-CHF will only be informed of the update. For FBC it is only the H-CHF that sets the triggers. This means that H-CHF that controls both the QBC and FBC triggers and can synchronise the PDU session level triggers. To ensure that the QBC triggers for both home and visited MNO are the same, the QBC triggers settings would overwrite any setting based on FBC for the PDU session level triggers, if they would differ.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #1.3 clause 7.1.4.3.2 or figure 4.2.4 of TS 32.255 [4].\nFor home routed scenario, the message flow is same as the PDU session establishment message flow in clause 5.2.2.12.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. In step 11ch-d of Figure 5.2.2.12.2.1 in TS 32.255 [4], the H-CHF acknowledges by sending Charging Data Response to the H-SMF and optionally includes a \"Roaming Charging Profile\". The \"Roaming Charging Profile\" may include both QoS flow and PDU session level triggers (e.g., both QoS change and user location change) for QBC, for FBC both rating group and PDU session level triggers may be included in the trigger element of Charging Data Response. For FBC the PDU session level triggers may be replaced by the QBC PDU session level triggers.\nFor local breakout scenario, the message flow is same with the PDU session establishment message flow in clause 5.2.2.18.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. In step 9ch-d2 of Figure 5.2.2.18.2-1 in TS 32.255 [4], the H-CHF acknowledges by sending Charging Data Response to the V-SMF and optionally includes a \"Roaming Charging Profile\". The \"Roaming Charging Profile\" include both QoS flow and PDU session level triggers (e.g., both QoS change and user location change) for QBC, for FBC both rating group and PDU session level triggers may be included in the trigger element of Charging Data Response. For FBC the PDU session level triggers are replaced by the QBC PDU session level triggers, if included.\nThis means that the trigger category, if they are enabled/disabled and the values of PDU session level triggers will be the same for both QBC and FBC. For example, a PDU Session level \"Expiry of data time limit per PDU session\" for FBC is set to 600 seconds while it for QBC is set to 900 seconds, then the 900 seconds value will be used for all.\n",

The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of optical fiber-optic backbone for redundancy and failover.\nFigure 7.2.4.5.2-2: Roaming 5G connection and mobility scenario in reference point representation\nThis would be same as TS 32.256 [9] clause 5.2.2.5.\nA possible solution for key issue #2d covering requirements REQ-CH_CVTOH-01, REQ-CH_CVTOH-02, REQ-CH_CVTOH-03, REQ-CH_CVTOH-04, REQ-CH_CVTOH-05, and REQ-CH_CVTOH-06, service based interface to use between visited CHF and home CHF, would be to reuse the Nchf_ConvergedCharging service API. This would mean that the V-CHF would proxy the request from the AMF, SMF or SMSF to the H-CHF, and the same with the response. The V-CHF could do some changes to message like: filter (e.g. trigger), enrich, or convert (e.g., rating groups).\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nA possible solution for key issue #2d covering requirements REQ-CH_CVTOH-01, REQ-CH_CVTOH-02, REQ-CH_CVTOH-03, REQ-CH_CVTOH-04, REQ-CH_CVTOH-05, and REQ-CH_CVTOH-06, service based interface to use between visited CHF and home CHF, would be to create a new service API. This would mean that the V-CHF would translate the request from the AMF, SMF or SMSF to the new service API towards the H-CHF. This would mean that the message could look completely different and even the triggers in the V-CHF for sending the message towards the H-CHF wouldn’t have to be related to the request from AMF, SMF or SMSF.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nA possible solution for key issue #2c, finding the correct CHF for solutions #2.1 and #2.3 where V-CHF communicating with H-CHF.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1 and #2.3 clause 7.2.4.3.\nThe V-CHF would in this case use the vNRF provided service to find the H-CHF, where the vNRF and hNRF may communicate according to TS 23.501 clause 6.2.6.\nA possible solution for key issue #2c, finding the correct CHF for solutions #2.1 and #2.3 where V-CHF communicating with H-CHF.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1 and #2.3 clause 7.2.4.3.\nThe V-CHF would in this case use the SUPI i.e., the IMSI number series, to find the V-CHF. In this case the H-CHF address would be pre-provisioned in the V-CHF and allocated to a IMSI series.\nA possible solution for key issue #2j, would be to have the charging session between V-CHF and H-CHF on a per UE basis for 5G data connectivity. In specific, V-CHF establishes a charging session with H-CHF based on that the V-CHF gets a charging data request containing a SUPI that the V-CHF don’t have a session with a H-CHF setup. V-CHF releases the charging session with H-CHF when it receives the charging data request for service release from the last PDU session for the SUPI. This requires the UE to reach the same V-CHF.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nIn this case, the SMF, AMF, and SMSF establish the charging session and events with the V-CHF per as specified in the TS 32.255 [4], TS 32.256 [5], and TS 32.274 [8]. The V-CHF would establish the charging session with the H-CHF based on the SUPI i.e., on a per UE basis.\nFigure 7.1.4.10.3-1 shows the message flow of V-CHF-to-H-CHF communication per UE for Session Based Charging (SCUR). Applicable for SMF. Regarding the PDU session establishment request for a UE, the V-CHF determines to establishes a charging session with H-CHF per UE. The additional PDU sessions for this UE continue to exchange messages using the same charging session between V-CHF and H-CHF. Upon receiving the service release request from the last PDU session for this UE, the V-CHF determines to terminate the charging session between V-CHF and H-CHF.\nFor event-based charging scenario, it is not applicable to wait for multiple charging data requests [event] per UE. Hence, the message flow for event-based charging scenario is the same as the figure 7.2.4.1.3-2 (IEC) and figure 7.2.4.1.3-3 (PEC) in solution #2.1. Applicable to SMSF and AMF.\n\n\nStep 1 to 11 describe the message flow of the delivery procedure for establishing the first PDU session by a UE. At the establishment of the first PDU session for a UE, V-CHF setups an interaction session with H-CHF for exchanging charging information for the current UE as shown in step 4. Step 12 summarizes ongoing service delivery for the #1 PDU session.\n1)\tRequest for service delivery: A request for session establishment is received in NF (CTF).\n2)\tUnits determination: NF (CTF) determines the number of units depending on the service requested by the UE in \"Decentralized Units determination\" scenario.\n3)\tCharging data request [Initial, Quota requested]: NF (CTF) sends an initial charging data request to V-CHF for the service to be granted authorization to start, and to reserve the number of units if determined in item 2.\n4)\tDetermine H-CHF: V-CHF determines whether there is an existing session to interact with H-CHF for the current UE (based on SUPI). If no session has been created for the current UE, it creates a charging resource for the NF (CTF), determines which H-CHF it should contact, and generates an initial charging home request to H-CHF.\n5)\tCharging home request [Initial, Quota requested]: V-CHF sends the request to H-CHF for the service to be granted authorization to start, and to reserve the number of units.\n6)\tAccount, Rating, Reservation control: H-CHF rates the charging home requests either based on the number of units requested or on internal unit determination, checks if corresponding funds can be reserved on the user's account balance. If the account has sufficient funds, H-CHF performs the corresponding reservations.\n7)\tOpen CDR: based on policies, H-CHF opens a CDR related to the service.\n8)\tCharging home response [Initial, Quota granted]: H-CHF grants authorization to V-CHF for the service to start, with the reserved number of units.\n9)\tOpen CDR: based on policies, V-CHF opens a CDR related to the service.\n10)\tCharging data response [Initial, Quota granted]: V-CHF grants authorization to NF (CTF) for the service to start, with the reserved number of units.\n11)\tGranted units supervision: NF (CTF) monitors the consumption of the granted units.\n12)\tOngoing service delivery: ongoing messages within the quota management and usage reporting procedure for the first PDU session. The messages that need interaction between V-CHF to H-CHF are exchanged in the existing session between V-CHF and H-CHF for the current UE.\nStep 13 to 22 describe the message flow of the delivery procedure for establishing another PDU session for this UE. Given that the UE already has an ongoing PDU session, the step to determine H-CHF is not required. The messages between V-CHF and H-CHF continues to exchange in the existing session between V-CHF and H-CHF that has been created for this UE. Step 23 summarizes ongoing service delivery for the first and/or the second PDU session.\n13)\tRequest for service delivery: Another request for session establishment for the current UE is received in NF (CTF).\n214)\tUnits determination: NF (CTF) determines the number of units depending on the service requested by the UE in \"Decentralized Units determination\" scenario.\n15)\tCharging data request [Initial, Quota requested]: NF (CTF) sends an initial charging data request to V-CHF for the service to be granted authorization to start, and to reserve the number of units if determined in item 14.\n16)\tCharging home request [Update, Quota requested]: V-CHF sends the request to H-CHF for the service to be granted authorization to start, and to reserve the number of units.\n17)\tAccount, Rating, Reservation control: H-CHF rates the charging home requests either based on the number of units requested or on internal unit determination, checks if corresponding funds can be reserved on the user's account balance. If the account has sufficient funds, H-CHF performs the corresponding reservations.\n18)\tUpdate CDR: based on policies, H-CHF updates the CDR with charging data related to the service.\n19)\tCharging home response [Update, Quota granted]: H-CHF grants authorization to V-CHF for the service to start, with the reserved number of units.\n20)\tOpen CDR: based on policies, V-CHF opens a CDR related to the service.\n21)\tCharging data response [Initial, Quota granted]: V-CHF grants authorization to NF (CTF) for the service to start, with the reserved number of units.\n22)\tGranted units supervision: NF (CTF) monitors the consumption of the granted units.\n23)\tOngoing service delivery: ongoing messages within the quota management and usage reporting procedure for the first and/or second PDU session. Similarly, the messages that need interaction between V-CHF to H-CHF are exchanged in the existing session between V-CHF and H-CHF for this UE.\nStep 24 to 31 describe the message flow of the post delivery procedures regarding the first PDU session. Since it is not the last PDU session for this UE, the session between V-CHF and H-CHF continues to support the message exchanges afterwards this release request. Step 23 summarizes ongoing service delivery for the second PDU session.\n24)\tService release: the service for the first PDU session is terminated or released.\n25)\tCharging data request [Termination, Unit used]: NF (CTF) sends a terminate charging data request to the V-CHF, for charging data related to the service termination with the final consumed units.\n26)\tCharging home request [Update, Unit used]: V-CHF sends an update charging home request to the H-CHF, for charging data related to the service termination with the final consumed units for this PDU session.\n27)\tAccount, Rating control: H-CHF performs the service termination process involving rating entity and user's account balance regarding this PDU session.\n28)\tUpdate CDR: based on policies, H-CHF update the CDR with charging data related to the service termination and the last reported units for the this PDU session.\n29)\tCharging home response [Update]: H-CHF informs the V-CHF on the result of the update charging home request.\n30)\tClose CDR: based on policies, V-CHF closes the CDR with charging data related to the service termination and the last reported units.\n31)\tCharging data response [Termination]: V-CHF informs the NF (CTF) on the result of the terminate charging data request.\n32)\tOngoing service delivery: ongoing messages within the quota management and usage reporting procedure for the second PDU session. Similarly, the messages that need interaction between V-CHF to H-CHF are exchanged in the existing session between V-CHF and H-CHF for this UE.\nStep 33 to 41 describe the message flow of the post delivery procedures regarding the second PDU session. Since it is the last PDU session for this UE, V-CHF terminates the session to interact with H-CHF as shown in step 35.\n33)\tService release: the service for the second PDU session is terminated or released.\n34)\tCharging data request [Termination, Unit used]: NF (CTF) sends a terminate charging data request to the V-CHF, for charging data related to the service termination with the final consumed units.\n35)\tDetermine to release the session with H-CHF: V-CHF identifies that it is the last PDU session for this UE. It determines to release the session with H-CHF.\n36)\tCharging home request [Termination, Unit used]: V-CHF sends an update charging home request to the H-CHF, for charging data related to the service termination with the final consumed units.\n37)\tAccount, Rating control: H-CHF performs the service termination process involving rating entity and user's account balance.\n38)\tClose CDR: based on policies, H-CHF closes the CDR with charging data related to the service termination and the last reported units.\n39)\tCharging home response [Termination]: H-CHF informs the V-CHF on the result of the terminate charging home request.\n40)\tClose CDR: based on policies, V-CHF closes the CDR with charging data related to the service termination and the last reported units.\n41)\tCharging data response [Termination]: V-CHF informs the NF (CTF) on the result of the terminate charging data request.\nA possible solution for key issue #2e and #2x, the trigger for interaction for V-CHF communicating with H-CHF, i.e. message exchange within a charging session between V-CHF and H-CHF, is based on the reception of a charging data request by the V-CHF.\nIn this case, the charging session between V-CHF and H-CHF is on the same granularity as the interaction between NF(CTF) and V-CHF. In specific,\nRegarding the session-based charging scenario (e.g. SCUR), V-CHF would establish the charging session with H-CHF on a per PDU session basis.\nRegarding the event-based charging scenario (e.g. IEC, PEC), V-CHF would establish the charging session with H-CHF on a per event basis.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nIn this case V-CHF as the NF consumer towards the H-CHF, triggers a charging data request based on the reception of a charging data request from another NF consumer. The V-CHF to may filter or convert the trigger from the V-CHF’s NF consumer i.e., for 5G data connectivity charging the V-CHF may use either FBC or QBC triggers to trigger a charging data request towards the H-CHF.\nThe message flow is the same as the figure 7.2.4.1.3-1 in solution #2.1.\nA possible solution for key issue #2e covering requirements REQ-CH_CVTOH-01, and REQ-CH_CVTOH-02, trigger handling between VPLMN and HPLMN, is to use the roaming charging profile and allow it to be updated.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.2 clause 7.2.4.2.\nThe Roaming charging profile may be requested at any time by the V-SMF. This means that the V-SMF could include it in every charging data request, allowing the V-SMF, V-CHF or H-CHF to change it:\n1.\tThe V-SMF includes Roaming charging profile in a Charging data request [Update] to V-CHF\n2.\tChanged by V-CHF and transferred to V-SMF\n3.\tTransferred from V-SMF to H-CHF\n4.\tChanged by H-CHF and transferred to V-SMF\n5.\tApplied in V-SMF\nA possible solution for key issues #2a, #2b, #2f, #2g, #2h, and #2i, the charging information provided to the CHF in the visited MNO and CHF in home MNO (via V-CHF) in single charging session (From the standpoint of V-SMF, all the charging information for V-CHF and H-CHF are exchanged in one charging session between V-SMF and V-CHF), V-CHF is responsible for the charging reporting for H-CHF.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as figure 7.2.4.1.2-2.\nDuring the PDU session establishment, V-SMF establishes the charging session with V-CHF, same with the figure 7.2.4.1.3-1 in solution #2.1.\nV-CHF is responsible for distinguishing the charging information for H-CHF and V-CHF.\n1.\tThe V-SMF sends Charging data request to V-CHF with the charging information;\n2.\tV-CHF determines the charging information for V-CHF and handled it.\n3.\tBased on the triggers on V-CHF, V-CHF constructs and reports the charging information to H-CHF;\n4.\tH-CHF sends the charging data response to V-CHF;\n5.\tV-CHF sends charging data response from H-CHF and/or sends the charging response from V-CHF.\nA possible solution for key issue #2a and #2b, the charging information for 5G data connectivity provided to the CHF in the visited MNO and CHF in home MNO (via V-CHF) in single charging session, V-SMF is responsible for the charging reporting for the V-CHF and H-CHF.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as figure 7.2.4.1.2-2.\nDuring the PDU session establishment, V-SMF establishes the single charging session with V-CHF, same with the figure 7.2.4.1.3-1 in solution #2.1.\nV-SMF is responsible for distinguishing the charging information for H-CHF and V-CHF.

In this case the home MNO uses charging architecture defined in TS 32.240 [12] annex E, to generate charging information.\nThis solution is based on the architecture in clause 4.4.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIn the below architectures the CHF in home MNO is only added for completes and the SMS-SC will only interact with the CDF and OCF.\nThe figure depicts a roaming SMS scenario in a service-based interface representation, illustrating the various components and their interactions.\nFigure 7.2.4.16.2-1: Roaming SMS scenario in service-based interface representation\nThe figure depicts a roaming SMS scenario in reference point representation, illustrating the various elements involved in the roaming SMS process.\nFigure 7.2.4.16.2-2: Roaming SMS scenario in reference point representation\nThe flows for SMS charging would be the same as in TS 32.274 [8], that are based on the interactions specified in TS 23.540 [10] and TS23.040 [11].\nA possible solution for key issue #2e covering requirements REQ-CH_CVTOH-01, and REQ-CH_CVTOH-02.\nIn some 5G use case, PDU session may keep for a long time, it’s possible that triggers in HPLMN change during PDU session for some reason like user subscription change, if so, the triggers in VPLMN needs to keep alignment with HPLMN.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as the local breakout architecture in solution #2.2 clause 7.2.4.2 or Home Routed architecture in Figure 4.2.4 of TS 32.255.\nThe message flow is same with the PDU session establishment message flow in clause 5.2.2.12.2 or 5.2.2.18.2 of TS 32.255 [4]. If the roaming charging profile is requested at the PDU session establishment by the V-SMF, the H-CHF may provide multiple Roaming Charging Profiles in the charging data response at the PDU session establishment, some Roaming Charging Profiles are with Profile change time, some Roaming Charging Profiles are without Profile change time, the Roaming Charging Profiles without Profile change time are applied immediately, the Roaming Charging Profiles with Profile change time are applied at the Profile change time.\nTable 7.2.4.x.3-1 is an example of two Roaming Charing Profiles. One Roaming Charging Profile is with Profile change time, the other Roaming Charging Profile is without Profile change time, the Roaming Charging Profile without Profile change time is applied immediately, the Roaming Charging Profile with Profile change time is applied at the Profile change time.\nTable 7.2.4.17.3-1: Multiple Roaming Charing Profiles\n\nA possible solution for key issue #2e covering requirements REQ-CH_CVTOH-01, and REQ-CH_CVTOH-02, trigger handling between VPLMN and HPLMN, is to use the roaming charging profile and allow it to be updated.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nThe Roaming charging profile may be requested at any time by the V-SMF. This means that the V-SMF could include it in every charging data request, allowing the V-SMF, V-CHF or H-CHF to change it:\n1.\tThe V-SMF includes Roaming charging profile in a Charging data request [Update] to V-CHF\n2.\tChanged by V-CHF and transferred to H-CHF\n3.\tChanged by H-CHF and transferred to V-CHF\n4.\tTransferred from V-CHF to V-SMF\n5.\tApplied in V-SMF\nA possible solution for key issue #2j, would be to have the charging session between V-CHF and H-CHF with the same granularity as the interaction between NF(CTF) and V-CHF.\nRegarding the session-based charging scenario (e.g. SCUR), V-CHF would establish the charging session with H-CHF on a per PDU session basis.\nRegarding the event-based charging scenario (e.g. IEC, PEC), V-CHF would establish the charging session with H-CHF on a per event basis.\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nIn this case, the SMF, AMF, and SMSF establish the charging session and events with the V-CHF per as specified in the TS 32.255 [4], TS 32.256 [5], and TS 32.274 [8]. The V-CHF would establish the charging session with the H-CHF based on the charging session between NF(CTF) and V-CHF.\nThe message flow for session-based charging scenario is the same as the figure 7.2.4.1.3-1 in solution #2.1. Applicable for SMF.\nThe message flow for event-based charging scenario is the same as the figure 7.2.4.1.3-2 (IEC) and figure 7.2.4.1.3-3 (PEC) in solution #2.1. Applicable for SMSF and AMF.\nA possible solution for key issue #2e, the trigger for interaction for V-CHF communicating with H-CHF, i.e. message exchange between V-CHF and H-CHF, is based on the quota management. In other words, V-CHF may trigger a charging data request to H-CHF only when receiving a charging data requests from NF(CTF) that the requested units exceed the granted quota managed at V-CHF.\n-\tQuota management at V-CHF: V-CHF could reserve a large amount of quota granted by H-CHF and distribute quota to NF(CTF) based on the units requested in a charging data request. This requires V-CHF to manage a large amount of quota granted by H-CHF.\n-\tThe reservation for a large amount of quota could either initiated by H-CHF or V-CHF. V-CHF could request for a large amount of quota from H-CHF upon the reception of the first charging data request per PDU session. Alternatively, H-CHF could assign a large amount of quota upon receiving the charging data requests from V-CHF based on internal unit determination, e.g. estimating the upcoming unit requests from a roaming subscriber within a short period of time.\n-\tThe interaction between V-CHF and H-CHF for requesting and granting a large amount of quota reuses the Nchf_ConvergedCharing service API.\nNOTE: Large amount of quota refers to that the V-CHF request a larger amount from the H-CHF than it is requested from the NF(CTF).\nThe reference architecture would be the same as in solution #2.1 clause 7.2.4.1.\nFigure 7.2.4.20.3-1 shows the message flow of charging message exchanges between V-CHF and H-CHF based on quota management for Session Based Charging (SCUR). Applicable for SMF. V-CHF interacts with H-CHF when granted quota is not enough to support the request from NF. As noted, there are two possible ways of initiating the reservation of a large amount of quota by V-CHF, either triggered by V-CHF or H-CHF. This figure assumes that V-CHF triggers the request for a large amount of quota from H-CHF. The alternative way where H-CHF actively grant a large amount of quota to V-CHF is also applicable.\nThe message flow for event-based charging scenario is the same as the figure 7.2.4.1.3-2 (IEC) and figure 7.2.4.1.3-3 (PEC) in solution #2.1. Applicable for AMF and SMSF.\n\nStep 1 to 12 describe the message flow of the delivery procedure for establishing a PDU session. At the establishment of the PDU session, V-CHF setup an interaction session with H-CHF for exchanging charging information. In addition, V-CHF request for a large amount of quota from H-CHF that are expected to support multiple requests from NF. Step 13 starts to deliver service.\nRequest for service delivery: A request for session establishment is received in NF (CTF).\nUnits determination: NF (CTF) determines the number of units depending on the service requested by the UE in \"Decentralized Units determination\" scenario.\nCharging data request [Initial, Quota requested]: NF (CTF) sends an initial charging data request to V-CHF for the service to be granted authorization to start, and to reserve the number of units if determined in item b.\nDetermine H-CHF: V-CHF creates a charging resource for the NF (CTF), determines which H-CHF it should contact, and generates an initial charging home request to H-CHF.\nCharging home request [Initial, Quota-2 requested]: V-CHF sends the request to H-CHF for the service to be granted authorization to start, and to reserve a large number of units that might support ongoing services.\nAccount, Rating, Reservation control: H-CHF rates the charging home requests either based on the number of units requested or on internal unit determination, checks if corresponding funds can be reserved on the user's account balance. If the account has sufficient funds, H-CHF performs the corresponding reservations.\nOpen CDR: based on policies, H-CHF opens a CDR related to the service.\nCharging home response [Initial, Quota-2 granted]: H-CHF grants authorization to V-CHF for the service to start, with the requested large number of units for V-CHF to supervise.\nQuota management: V-CHF checks if the units requested by NF is sufficient based on the available number of units that has been granted by H-CHF. If the account has sufficient funds, V-CHF performs the corresponding unit reservations.\nOpen CDR: based on policies, V-CHF opens a CDR related to the service.\nCharging data response [Initial, Quota granted]: V-CHF grants authorization to NF (CTF) for the service to start, with the reserved number of units.\nGranted units supervision: NF (CTF) monitors the consumption of the granted units.\nStart of service delivery: NF (CTF) starts to deliver the content/service based on the reserved number of units.\nStep 14 to 19 describe the message flow of a quota management and usage reporting procedure where V-CHF has enough units reserved by H-CHF to support the current request. Step 20 describes ongoing services that could be supported by the granted large amount of quota.\nQuota management trigger: A trigger associated to quota management is met. Unit determination is performed when applicable.\nCharging data request [Update, Unit used, Quota requested]: NF (CTF) sends an intermediate charging data request to V-CHF, for more units to be granted for the service to continue and reporting the used units.\nQuota management: V-CHF checks if the units requested by NF is sufficient based on the available number of units that has been granted by H-CHF. If the account has sufficient funds, V-CHF performs the corresponding unit reservations.\nUpdate CDR: based on policies, H-CHF updates the CDR with charging data related to the service.\nCharging data response [Update, Quota granted]: V-CHF grants quota to NF (CTF) for the service to continue, with the reserved number of units.\nGranted units supervision: NF (CTF) monitors the consumption of the granted units.\nService delivery ongoing: ongoing service delivery for additional requests.\nStep 21 to 33 describe the message flow of a quota management and usage reporting procedure where V-CHF does not have enough units reserved by H-CHF to support the current request. Step 33 describes ongoing services. Step 34 release the service, followed with the post delivery procedure.\nQuota management trigger: A trigger associated to quota management is met. Unit determination is performed when applicable.\nCharging data request [Update, Unit used, Quota requested]: NF (CTF) sends an intermediate charging data request to V-CHF, for more units to be granted for the service to continue and reporting the used units.\nQuota management: V-CHF checks if the units requested by NF is sufficient based on the available number of units that has been granted by H-CHF. If the account has sufficient funds, V-CHF performs the corresponding unit reservations. Otherwise, V-CHF initiates to request for additional large amount of quota from H-CHF.\nQ request trigger: A trigger associated to request a large amount of quota is met. A large amount of unit determination is performed when applicable.\nCharging home request [Update, Unit used, Quota-2 requested]: V-CHF sends an intermediate charging home request to H-CHF, for additional large bundle of units to be granted for the service to continue and reporting the used units.\nAccount, Rating, Reservation control: H-CHF performs the process related to the reported usage and the requested reservation, involving rating entity and user's account balance.\nUpdate CDR: based on policies, H-CHF updates the CDR with charging data related to the service.\nCharging home response [Update, Quota-2 granted]: H-CHF grants quota to V-CHF for the service to continue, with the reserved large number of units for V-CHF to supervise.\nBundled quota management: V-CHF checks if the units requested by NF is sufficient based on the available number of units that has been granted by H-CHF. If the account has sufficient funds, V-CHF performs the corresponding unit reservations.\nUpdate CDR: based on policies, V-CHF updates the CDR with charging data related to the service.\nCharging data response [Update, Quota granted]: V-CHF grants quota to NF (CTF) for the service to continue, with the reserved number of units.\nGranted units supervision: NF (CTF) monitors the consumption of the granted units.\nService delivery ongoing: describes ongoing service delivery, which might contain additional requests for quota.\nService release: release the service.\n",
