Some services have ultra-low latency, high data capacity, and strict reliability requirements, as any faults or performance issues in the networks can cause service failure which may result in property damage and body injury. Therefore, it is necessary to collect real-time performance data that can be used by analytic applications (e.g., network optimization, SON, etc.) to detect the potential issues in advance, and take appropriate actions to prevent or mitigate the issues. Also, the performance data shall be able to be consumed by multiple analytic applications with specific purposes.\n",

The management analytical data can be used to diagnose ongoing issues impacting the performance of the mobile network and predict any potential issues (e.g., potential failure and/or performance degradation). For example, the analysis of NSI/NSSI resource usage can form a management analytical data  indicating whether a certain resource is deteriorating. The analysis and correlation of the overall performance data of mobile network may indicate overload situation and potential failure(s).\nSON Capacity and Coverage Optimization (CCO) is one typical case that may consume the management analytical data. CCO provides optimal coverage and capacity for the E-UTRAN, see clause 4.5 of TS 28.628 [13], which may also be applicable for 5G radio networks. The management analytical data related to coverage and capacity help the SON CCO to realise the situation of coverage and capacity or interference, and  to trigger corresponding optimization if needed.\nNote: \tDetails of the management analytical data including e.g. format, categorisation and method/algorithm of calculations are to be defined.\n",

In order to guarantee the performance of network slice, NSI modification can be triggered by NSI provisioning service. During the NSI performance supervision, the end to end KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [21], performance measurements defined in TS 28.552[2] and optionally slice QoE provided by NWDAF in 3GPP TS 23.288 [22] should be used for SLA fulfilment evaluation. According to the evaluation result, NSI modification defined in TS 28.531[24] can be triggered for network slice performance assurance.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in identifying and mitigating NSI and NSSI issues in a wireless communication system. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the process from the source to the receiver, and a matrix that represents the different types of NSI and NSSI scenarios. The figure is crucial for understanding the complexity of wireless communication systems and the importance of proper performance assurance measures.\nFigure H.2-1: Example of procedure for NSI and NSSI performance assurance\n1.\tThe authorized consumer requests NSMS_Producer to allocate a new NSI. NSMS_Producer consumes provisioning services provided by NSSMS_Producer to create the NSI. After NSI allocation, the NSMS_Producer and NSSMS_Producer perform NSI and NSSI performance supervision.\n2.\tThe NSMS_Producer or NSSMS_Producer may get slice QoE analytics provided by NWDAF.\n3.\tThe NSMS_Producer or NSSMS_Producer checks whether the performance requirements can be met by NSI or NSSI by utilizing the end to end KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [21], performance measurements defined in TS 28.552[2] and slice QoE analytics provided by NWDAF in 3GPP TS 23.288 [22].\n4a. If the performance requirements of NSI cannot be met, the NSMS_Producer triggers the NSI modification procedure. NSMS_Producer modifies the capacity of the network slice, or modifies the network slice configuration to guarantee the performance requirements.\n4b. If the performance requirements of NSSI cannot be met, the NSSMS_Producer of CN modifies virtualized resources and the configuration of 5GC NFs to guarantee the performance requirements. NSSMS_Producer of AN reconfigures RRMPolicy to optimize performance.\n",
