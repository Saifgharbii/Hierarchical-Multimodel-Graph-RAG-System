            "description": "The CBS service is analogous to the Teletex service offered on television, in that like Teletex, it permits a number of unacknowledged general CBS messages to be broadcast to all receivers within a particular region. CBS messages are broadcast to defined geographical areas known as cell broadcast areas. These areas may comprise of one or more cells, or may comprise the entire PLMN or SNPN. Individual CBS messages will be assigned their own geographical coverage areas by mutual agreement between the information provider and the PLMN or SNPN operator. CBS messages may originate from a number of Cell Broadcast Entities (CBEs), which are connected to the Cell Broadcast Centre. CBS messages are then sent from the CBC to the cells, in accordance with the CBS's coverage requirements.\nA CBS page comprises of 82 octets, which, using the default character set, equates to 93 characters. Other Data Coding Schemes may also be used, as described in 3GPP TS 23.038 [3]. Up to 15 of these pages may be concatenated to form a CBS messagee. Each page of such CBS message will have the same message identifier (indicating the source of the message), and the same serial number. Using this information, the MS/UE is able to identify and ignore re-broadcasts of already received messages.\nCBS messages are broadcast cyclically by the cell at a frequency and for a duration agreed with the information provider. The frequency at which CBS messages are repeatedly transmitted will be dependent on the information that they contain; for example, it is likely that dynamic information such as road traffic information, will require more frequent transmission than weather information. The repetition period will also be affected by the desire for CBS messages to be received by high speed mobiles which rapidly traverse cells.Reception of CBS messages for an MS/UE is not a requirement if it is connected in the CS domain. It should be possible for an MS/UE to receive messages if it is connected in the PS domain and no data is currently transmitted.\n\nNOTE:\tIn case the UE is in CS-Idle and PS-Connected Mode it depends on the  whether reception of CBS messages is possible. The relevant states are described in 3GPP TS 25.331 [16].\nGSM only [CBS messages may be broadcast on two different cell broadcast channels, which are characterized by different QoS. A MS is always able to read the basic channel (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [8]). The reading of the extended channel may collide with other tasks of the MS. Therefore the probability of receiving a CBS message on the extended channel is smaller than on the basic channel. The reading of the extended channel for MSs is optional. The scheduling on the channels will be done independently].\nTo permit mobiles to selectively display only those CBS messages required by the MS/UE user, CBS messages are assigned a message class which categorises the type of information that they contain and the language (Data Coding Scheme) in which the CBS message has been compiled. Through the use of appropriate MMI, the user is then able to ignore message types that he does not wish to receive, e.g. advertising information or messages in an unfamiliar language.\nA network may be able to remotely activate mobile terminals in order to enable them to receive CBS messages, according to regulatory requirements (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [16]).\nPWS provides a service that allows the network to distribute warning messages on behalf of public authority. PWS enables the distribution of ETWS, CMAS (aka WEA), KPAS and EU-Alert warning messages in GSM, UMTS, E-UTRAN, and NG-RAN.\nSome of the PWS warning message distribution mechanisms are access technology specific, but some CBS procedures and related message structures are common for GSM and UMTS, and some CBS procedures and related message structures are common for E-UTRAN and NG-RAN.\nThe language-independent content mapped to an event or a disaster can be included in a warning message that is transparently passed from CBC to UEs. UEs with user interface which support the ePWS language-independent content functionality can display the entire warning message that they receive.\nUEs with no user interface which support the ePWS disaster characteristics functionality can derive the characteristics of a disaster from the message identifier of a received warning message.\n",

It permits a number of unacknowledged warning messages to be broadcast to MS/UEs within a particular area. Reception of warning messages is enabled as defined later on in this specification.\nFor warning messages received from a PLMN, 3GPP TS 31.102 [18] defines a USIM data file for configuration of warning messages reception. In case of a non-existing or empty USIM data file, the MS/UE accepts all warning messages on all PLMNs.

The warning message request from the CBE will trigger a broadcast of an ETWS emergency message (containing the ETWS Primary Notification) and/or a CBS message (constituting a Secondary Notification) on the radio interface. The ETWS emergency message is conveyed by the paging message which can invoke mobile terminals to start receiving CBS messages without MMI. Mobile stations invoked to start receiving CBS messages this way may stop receiving CBS messages (without MMI) after a predefined period of time.\nThe figure depicts a warning message delivery procedure in GERAN, a software tool used for managing and monitoring the communication system. The message is displayed on a screen, and the user can interact with the message to receive a warning. The figure shows the steps involved in the message delivery process, including the display of the warning message, the user's response, and the subsequent action taken by the system. The figure is a visual representation of the complex process involved in managing and monitoring communication systems, highlighting the importance of proper message delivery procedures in ensuring the reliability and security of communication systems.\nFigure 9.1.3.2-1: Warning message delivery procedure in GERAN\n1.\tNetwork registration and security procedures are performed.\nNOTE 1:\tThis step is performed each time an MS is attached to a NW (e.g. after each power-on).\n2.\tCBE (e.g. Information Source such as PSAP or Regulator) sends emergency information (\"warning type\", \"warning message\", \"impacted area\", and \"time period\") to the CBC. The CBC shall authenticate this request. The \"warning type\" takes one of the following values: earthquake, tsunami, earthquake and tsunami, test, or other.\n3.\tUsing the \"impacted area information\", the CBC identifies which BSCs need to be contacted and constructs the \"Cell list\" for the cells in which the information is to be broadcast.\nThe CBC shall send a WRITE-REPLACE message to all the identified BSCs. If the emergency information received from the CBE contains warning information to be sent both in an ETWS emergency message and in a CBS message, then the CBC need to send this information in separate WRITE-REPLACE messages to the identified BSCs accordingly:\n-\tWhen containing an ETWS emergency message the WRITE-REPLACE message includes the \"Paging ETWS Indicator\" to differentiate it from a normal CBS message, as well as (among other parameters) the \"Cell list\", \"warning type\" (which constitutes a part of the ETWS Primary Notification message, see clause 9.4.1.3), and the \"warning period\" parameter.\n-\tWhen containing a CBS message the WRITE-REPLACE message includes the \"Channel Indicator\" to differentiate it from an ETWS emergency message, as well as (among other parameters) the \"Cell list\", \"Repetition Period\", \"No of Broadcasts Requested\" and the \"CBS Message Information\" parameter(s).\nThe CBC shall not include the \"digital signature\" or \"timestamp\" information.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to requirements in earlier versions of this document, it is possible for \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" information (included in the \"Warning Security Information\" parameter) to be transmitted within the WRITE-REPLACE message.\n4.\tThe BSCs use the \"Cell list\" information to identify in which cells the warning message needs to be broadcasted.\na)\tWhen the WRITE-REPLACE message contains an ETWS emergency message, the BSC/BTS:\n1)\tshall include the ETWS emergency message within the paging message and start sending the paging messages in all paging groups for the time duration requested by the CBC in the \"warning period\" parameter. The paging message contains the \"ETWS indicator\", based on the \"Paging ETWS Indicator\" received in the WRITE-REPLACE message, and the ETWS Primary Notification message as defined in clause 9.4.1.3. When the \"warning type\" in the ETWS Primary Notification message is set to 'other', all of the warning information is included in the broadcasted CBS message.\n2)\tmay send the ETWS Primary Notification message in other messages (Application Information, see 3GPP TS 44.018 [26], and Packet Application Information, see 3GPP TS 44.060 [27]) in order to reach mobiles in connected mode.\nb)\tWhen the WRITE-REPLACE message contains a CBS message the BSC/BTS shall start to broadcast the CBS message on the Cell Broadcast channel according to the \"Repetition Period\" and \"No of Broadcasts Requested\" requested by the CBC.\n5.\tUpon reception of the paging message containing the ETWS Primary Notification message, if the MS is configured to accept warnings on that PLMN (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [18]) the ETWS capable MS alerts the user immediately as indicated by the \"warning type\" value, and starts reading the Cell Broadcast channel in order to acquire a possible broadcasted CBS message containing the Secondary Notification message.\nUpon reception of the CBS message containing the Secondary Notification message, the ETWS capable MS immediately indicates the contents of the Secondary Notification message to the user.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the MS receives the same ETWS Primary Notification message more than once it silently discards the last received Primary Notification message.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen the \"warning type\" is set to 'test', the MS silently discards the ETWS Primary Notification message. The MS does not start reading the Cell Broadcast channel in this case. However, the MS specially designed for testing purposes can perform user alerting and proceed to the reception of the broadcasted CBS message as described above.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the MS is configured to ignore warnings on that PLMN (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [18]), the MS does not try to acquire the broadcasted CBS message described above.\nThe MS shall perform duplication detection of the received message as specified in clause 8.2.\nThe MS shall ignore the values of \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" if received in the \"Warning Security Information\" parameter.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to requirements in earlier versions of this document, it is possible for \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" information (included in the \"Warning Security Information\" parameter) to be transmitted within the WRITE-REPLACE message.\n6.\tThe BSC sends a WRITE-REPLACE COMPLETE message to the CBC in response to the WRITE-REPLACE message.\n7.\tCBC sends acknowledgement message to CBE.\nWhen a warning message is sent in UTRAN, the following message flow applies. In this case, the paging message with a new emergency indication can invoke mobile terminals to start receiving CBS messages without MMI. Mobile stations invoked to start receiving CBS messages this way may stop receiving CBS messages (without MMI) after a period of time, which should not be less than 30 minutes in case DRX-Level-2 is used, and 2 minutes in case DRX-Level-1 is used.\nThe figure depicts a warning message delivery procedure in UTRAN, a technology used in 5G networks. The message is delivered to the network through a series of steps, including the use of a warning message, the transmission of the message, and the reception of the message by the network. The figure illustrates the process in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the warning message delivery procedure in UTRAN.\nFigure 9.1.3.3-1: Warning message delivery procedure in UTRAN\n1.\tNetwork registration and security (e.g. mutual authentication) procedures are performed.\nNOTE 1:\tThis step is performed each time a UE is attached to a network (e.g. after each power-on).\n2.\tCBE (e.g. Information Source such as PSAP or Regulator) sends emergency information (\"warning type\", \"warning message\", \"impacted area\", and \"time period\") to the CBC.

The message shall include an \"emergency indication\" to differentiate it from normal Cell Broadcast information, as well as the \"Service Area ID list\", \"warning type\", \"warning message\".\nThe CBC shall not include the \"digital signature\" or \"timestamp\" information.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to requirements in earlier versions of this document, it is possible for \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" information to be transmitted within \"warning message\".\n4.\tThe RNCs use the \"Service Area ID list\" information to identify which Node Bs they need to reach, and then, they relay information to them using the appropriate Iub interface message.\n5.\tThe Node B receives the Iub message containing the emergency indication. As parallel actions, the RNC/Node B:\na)\tshall start to broadcast the \"warning message\". This is broadcast by using a Cell Broadcast channel and modified System Information messages. This broadcast information is repeated continuously by the Node B for the \"time period\" requested by the CBE.\nb)\tshall use paging messages in every paging group to alert idle mode mobiles to receive the broadcast warning message. Typically these paging messages are repeated in all paging groups for several DRX periods. The paging message contains the \"ETWS indication\" based on the \"warning type\" information. When the \"warning type\" is set to 'other', all of the warning information is included in the broadcast \"warning message\".\nc)\tmay send the \"ETWS indication\" in other messages (System Information Change Indication or ETWS Primary Notification With Security) in order to reach mobiles in connected mode. Inclusion of \"ETWS indication\" is the same as that of the paging message mentioned above.\n6.\tIf the UE is configured to accept warnings on that PLMN (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [18]) the UE alerts the user immediately, using \"warning type\" value upon the reception of the \"ETWS Indication\".\nNOTE 3:\tIf the UE received the \"ETWS Indication\" more than once it will silently discard the optional primary notification.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen the \"warning type\" is 'test', the UE silently discards the \"ETWS Indication\" and does not perform the reception of the broadcast message described below. However, the UE specially designed for testing purposes can perform user alerting described above and proceed to the reception of the broadcast message described below\nNOTE 5:\tIf the UE is configured to ignore warnings on that PLMN (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [18]) the UE does not perform the reception of the broadcast message described below.\nUpon the reception of the\"ETWS Indication\", the UE activates the reception of the broadcast messages containing the \"warning message\" as the secondary notification. The UE indicates the contents of the \"warning message\" to the user.\nThe UE shall perform duplication detection of the received message as specified in clause 8.2.\nThe UE shall ignore the values of \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" if received.\nNOTE 6:\tThe \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" can be received due to requirements in earlier versions of this document.\n7.\tThe RNC node sends a BMC REPORT-SUCCESS to the CBC in response to Write-Replace.\n8.\tCBC sends acknowledgement message to CBE.\nThe maximum size of the warning message for E-UTRAN is different from that for UTRAN/GERAN.\nWhen S1-flex is used, the eNodeB may receive duplicated warning messages. Duplicated messages can be detected by checking the message identifier and serial number fields and they shall not be transmitted on the radio interface.\nE-UTRA connected to both EPC and 5GCN (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [46]) may receive warning messages from both EPC and 5GCN. Duplicated messages can be detected by checking the message identifier and serial number fields and duplicate messages shall not be transmitted on the radio interface.\nThe warning message to be broadcast is delivered via MMEs to multiple eNodeBs. The eNodeB(s) are responsible for scheduling the broadcast of the new message and the repetitions in each cell.\nThe overall warning message delivery procedure is presented in figure 9.1.3.4.2-1:\nThe figure depicts a warning message delivery procedure in E-UTRAN, illustrating the steps taken to ensure the delivery of warnings to the network. The figure shows a series of steps, including the initiation of the message, the transmission of the message, and the reception of the message. The steps are depicted in a step-by-step manner, with each step represented by a different color, making it easy to follow the sequence of events. The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different colors and their meanings. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the warning message delivery procedure in E-UTRAN.\nFigure 9.1.3.4.2-1: Warning message delivery procedure in E-UTRAN\n0.\tNetwork registration and security (e.g. mutual authentication) procedures are performed.\nNOTE 1:\tThis step is performed each time a UE is attached to a network (e.g. after each power on).\n1.\tCBE (e.g. Information Source such as PSAP or Regulator) sends emergency information (e.g. \"warning type\", \"warning message\", \"impacted area\", \"time period\") to the CBC. The CBC shall authenticate this request.\nNOTE 2:\tA warning message can include a language-independent content mapped to an event or a disaster that is compatible with texts used to describe user information contained in the content of a CBS-Message-Information-Page transparently passed from CBC to UEs if the ePWS language-independent content functionality (see clause 8.3) is supported by CBE.\n2.\tUsing the \"impacted area\" information, the CBC identifies which MMEs need to be contacted and determines the information to be place into the Warning Area List Information Element. The CBC sends a Write-Replace Warning Request message containing the warning message to be broadcast and the delivery attributes (Message identifier, Serial Number, list of TAIs, Warning Area List, OMC ID, CWM Indicator, Send Write-Replace-Warning-Indication, Global eNB ID, Warning Area Coordinates) to MMEs.\nThe warning messages use the coding scheme for CBS data specified in 3GPP TS 23.038 [3].\nThe list of TAIs is only used by the MME. The MME uses it for selecting which eNodeBs to forward the Write-Replace Warning Request message to.\nIf the Write-Replace Warning Request message is sent to reload cells served by an eNodeB, for which the CBC has previously received a Restart Indication (see clause 15A.1 of TS 23.007 [38]), the CBC shall include the Global eNB ID IE with the identity of this eNodeB in the Write-Replace Warning Request message.\nThe Warning Area List shall be a list of Cell IDs or a list of TAIs or one or more Emergency Area IDs. The Warning Area List is only used by the eNodeB. The eNodeB is configured with the TAI(s) and Cell ID(s) it serves and the Emergency Area ID(s) that it belongs to. The eNodeB checks for any match of the contents of the Warning Area List with these IDs to identify the cells where to distribute the warning message. The Warning Area List is an optional information element. If the Warning Area is absent, it shall be interpreted as \"all cells on the eNodeB\". The number of cell IDs will be limited by the message size on SBc and S1-MME. An Emergency Area ID is unique within the PLMN.\nThe message may include an OMC ID. If present, it indicates the OMC to which the Trace record generated in step 9 is destined. Co-location of that OMC with the CBC is an operator option.\nCBC shall set the Concurrent Warning Message (CWM) indicator in all Write-Replace Warning Request messages, if the PLMN supports concurrent warning message broadcasts.\nThe CBC shall not include the \"digital signature\" or \"timestamp\" information.\nCBC shall set the Send Write-Replace-Warning Indication element in case the MME is requested to forward the Broadcast Scheduled Area List in a Write-Replace Warning Indication for the warning message.\nNOTE 3:\tDue to requirements in earlier versions of the specification, it is possible that \"digital signature\" and \"timestamp\" information are transmitted within the \"warning message\".\nCBC includes the Warning Area Coordinates in the Write-Replace-Warning Request message based on operator policy.\n3.\tThe MME sends a Write-Replace Warning Confirm message that indicates to the CBC that the MME has started to distribute the warning message to eNodeBs.\nThe Write-Replace Warning Confirm message may contain the Unknown Tracking Area List IE. The Unknown Tracking Area List IE identifies the Tracking Areas that are unknown to the MME and where the Request cannot be delivered.\nIf this message is not received by the CBC within an appropriate time period, the CBC can attempt to deliver the warning message via another MME in the same pool area.\n4.\tUpon reception of the Write-Replace Confirm messages from the MMEs, the CBC may confirm to the CBE that it has started to distribute the warning message.\n5.\tThe MME forwards Write-Replace Warning Message Request to eNodeBs. The MME shall use the list of TAIs to determine the eNodeBs in the delivery area. If the list of TAIs is not included and no Global eNB ID has been received from the CBC, the message is forwarded to all eNodeBs that are connected to the MME. If a Global eNB ID has been received from the CBC, the MME shall forward the message only to the eNodeB indicated by the Global eNB ID IE.\n6.\tWhen S1-flex is used the eNodeB may receive same message from multiple MMEs. The eNodeB detects duplicate messages by checking the message identifier and serial number fields within the warning message. If any redundant messages are detected only the first one received will be broadcasted by the cells. The eNodeB shall use the Warning Area List information to determine the cell(s) in which the message is to be broadcast. The eNodeBs return a Distribute Warning Message Response to the MME, even if it was a duplicate.\nIf there is a warning broadcast message already ongoing and the CWM Indicator is included in the Write-Replace Warning Message Request, the eNodeB does not stop existing broadcast message but start broadcasting the new message concurrently. Otherwise the eNodeB shall immediately replace the existing broadcast message with the newer one.\nNOTE 4:\tIf concurrent warning messages are not supported, this requires the CBE/CBC to take care that 'lower' priority warnings are not sent while a higher priority warning is still being sent.\nThe eNodeB broadcasts the message frequently according to the attributes set by the CBC that originated the warning message distribution.\n7.\tIf the UE has been configured to receive warning messages, and the UE is configured to accept warnings on that PLMN (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [18]), then the UE proceeds as follows:\nThe UE can use \"warning type\" values, 'earthquake', 'tsunami' or 'earthquake and tsunami', immediately to alert the user. When \"warning type\" is 'test', the UE silently discards the primary notification, but the UE specially designed for testing purposes may proceed with the following procedures.\nThe UE activates reception of the broadcast messages containing the \"warning message\".\nIf the Warning Area Coordinates are not present:\nThe UE indicates the contents of the \"warning message\" to the user.\nIf the Warning Area Coordinates are present, and if the UE is unable to determine its location:\nThe UE indicates the contents of the \"warning message\" to the user.\nIf the Warning Area Coordinates are present, and the UE determines it is inside the Warning Area Coordinates:\nThe UE indicates the contents of the \"warning message\" to the user.\nIf the Warning Area Coordinates are present, and the UE determines it is outside the Warning Area Coordinates:\nThe UE does not indicate the contents of the \"warning message\" to the user. The UE shall store the \"warning message\" in the list of \"warning messages\" to be checked for geo-fencing during a UE implementation specific time which shall not be greater than 24 hours. Upon expiration of the UE implementation specific time, the UE shall remove the stored \"warning message\" from the list of \"warning messages\" to be checked for geo-fencing.\nIf the \"warning message\" is a geo-fencing trigger message (see clause 9.4.1.2.2) then:\n-\tif the list of \"warning messages\" to be checked for geo-fencing stored at the UE is not empty, the UE shall, for each \"warning message\" stored at the UE in the list of \"warning messages\" to be checked for geo-fencing, compare the Serial Number and Message Identifier combination of the stored \"warning message\" to the list of Serial Number and Message Identifier combinations included in the Warning Message Content IE (CB Data) of the geo-fencing trigger message and encoded as specified in ATIS-0700041 [47], and:\n1)\tif the Serial Number and Message Identifier combination of the stored \"warning message\" matches one of the Serial Number and Message Identifier combinations included in the geo-fencing trigger message, and:\na)\tthe UE:\ni)\tis able to determine its location and determines it is inside the Warning Area Coordinates of the stored \"warning message\"; or\nii)\tis unable to determine its location,\nindicate the contents of the stored \"warning message\" to the user, remove the \"warning message\" from the list of \"warning messages\" to be checked for geo-fencing and then discard the geo-fencing trigger message; or\nb)\tthe UE is able to determine its location and determines it is outside the Warning Area Coordinates of the stored \"warning message\", discard the geo-fencing trigger message; or\n2)\tif none of Serial Number and Message Identifier combinations of the stored \"warning message\" matches any of the Serial Number and Message Identifier combinations included in the Warning Message Content IE (CB Data) of the geo-fencing trigger message, discard the geo-fencing trigger message; and\n-\tif the list of \"warning messages\" to be checked for geo-fencing stored at the UE is empty, the UE shall discard the geo-fencing trigger message.\nIf a language-independent content mapped to an event or a disaster (e.g. character such as Unicode based pictogram mapping to a disaster) is included as part of user information contained in the content of a CBS-Message-Information-Page transparently passed from CBC to UEs:\n-\tUEs with user interface which support the ePWS language-independent content functionality (see clause 8.3) and which are capable of displaying text-based warning messages should be capable of displaying the entire warning message that they receive.\nEditor's note [WI: ePWS, CR#203]: FFS on what character(s) such as Unicode based pictogram(s) are the language-independent content mapped to an event or a disaster.\n8.\tIf the Send Warning-Message-Indication parameter was present in the Write-Replace Warning Request and it is configured in the MME based on operator policy, the MME shall forward the Broadcast Scheduled Area Lists in a Write-Replace Warning Indication(s) to the CBC. The Broadcast Scheduled Area List shall contain the Broadcast Completed Area List the MME has received from the eNodeB. The MME may aggregate Broadcast Completed Area Lists it receives from eNodeBs.\nNOTE 5: Support for sending of Write-Replace Warning Indication(s) to the CBC is optional in the MME.\n9.\tFrom the Write-Replace Warning Response messages returned by eNodeB's the MME determines the success or failure of the delivery and creates a trace record. Any OMC ID received in step 2 is written to the trace record to permit the O&M system to deliver them to the desired destination.\nThe cancel warning message delivery procedure takes place when CBE requests to stop the on-going broadcast of warning messages.\nThe figure depicts a warning message cancel procedure in E-UTRAN, which is a protocol used in 4G and 5G networks for managing network traffic. The message is displayed in a warning box, indicating that the user should take action to resolve the issue. The figure shows the steps to be taken, such as selecting the correct action, entering the correct code, and following the instructions. The message is displayed in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for users to understand and follow the procedure.\nFigure 9.1.3.4.3-1: Warning message cancel procedure in E-UTRAN\n1.\tCBE initiates procedure by sending Stop Emergency Broadcast Request (e.g. \"Message Identifier and Serial Number\"), to the CBC. The CBC shall authenticate this request.\n2.\tThe CBC identifies which MMEs need to be contacted and determines the information to be place into the Warning Area Information Element. The CBC sends a Stop Warning Request message (Message Identifier, Serial Number, Tracking Area ID list, Warning Area, OMC ID, Send Stop Warning Indication) to MMEs.\nThe message may include an OMC ID. If present, it indicates the OMC to which the Trace record generated in step 8 is destined. Co-location of that OMC with the CBC is an operator option.\nThe CBC sets the Send Stop Warning Indication element in case the MME is requested to forward the Broadcast Completed Area List in a Stop Warning Indication for the warning message.\n3.\tThe MME sends a Stop Warning Confirm message that indicates to the CBC that the MME has started to distribute the Kill Request message to eNodeBs.\nIf this message is not received by the CBC within an appropriate time period, the CBC can attempt to send Stop Warning Request via another MME in the same pool area.\n4.\tUpon reception of the Stop Warning Confirm messages from the MMEs, the CBC may confirm to the CBE that it has initiated the Warning message cancel procedure.\n5.\tThe MME forwards the request from the CBC by Kill Request to eNodeB's. The MME shall use the Tracking Area ID list to determine the eNodeBs that may have warning message broadcast ongoing. In case the Tracking Area ID list is not included the Kill Request is forwarded to all eNodeBs that are connected to the MME.\n6.\tThe eNodeB shall stop broadcasting the warning message identified by the Message Identifier and Serial Number in the areas identified by Warning Area IDs. If the Warning Area is absent, it shall be interpreted as \"all cells on the eNodeB\").\nWhen S1-Flex is used the eNodeB may receive same Kill Request from multiple MMEs, if any redundant Kill Requests are detected only the response to the first MME shall contain statistics related to the cancelled broadcast.\n7.\tIf the Send Stop Warning Indication parameter was present in the Stop Warning Request and it is configured in the MME based on operator policy, the MME forwards the Broadcast Cancelled Area List it has received from the eNodeB in a Stop Warning Indication(s) to the CBC. The MME may aggregate Broadcast Cancelled Area Lists it receives from eNodeBs.\nIf the CBC has requested the MME to send Stop Warning Indications, then the CBC releases the Serial Number of a message after it has stopped receiving the Stop Warning Indications for that message.\nNOTE:\tSupport for Stop Warning Indication(s) is optional in the MME.\n8.\tFrom the Kill Response messages returned by eNodeB's the MME creates a trace record (e.g. number of times a particular message has been broadcasted in a given warning area) related to the cancelled message. Any OMC ID received in step 2 is written to the trace record to permit the O&M system to deliver them to the desired destination.\nThe maximum size of the warning message for NG-RAN is the same as the maximum size defined for E-UTRAN.\nWhen the CBCF sends warning messages to multiple AMFs for the same warning area, the gNodeB may receive duplicated warning messages. Duplicated messages can be detected by checking the message identifier and serial number fields and they shall not be transmitted on the radio interface.\nThe Warning Message Delivery procedure messages and the Warning Message Cancel procedure messages are transported with the NonUeN2MessageTransfer service operation between CBCF and AMF (see clause 9A) and via N2 between AMF and NG-RAN.\nThe warning message to be broadcast is delivered via AMFs to multiple NG-RAN nodes. The NG-RAN node(s) are responsible for scheduling the broadcast of the new message and the repetitions in each cell.\nThe overall warning message delivery procedure is presented in figure 9.1.3.5.2-1:\n\nThe figure depicts a warning message delivery procedure in NG-RAN, illustrating the steps taken by the network to deliver warnings to the network. The figure shows the network's architecture, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the network's control center (CC). The warning message is delivered through a series of steps, including the use of a central controller, the transmission of the message over the network, and the reception of the message by the UE. The figure provides a clear and concise overview of the warning message delivery procedure in NG-RAN, making it easier to understand the process and its components.\nFigure 9.1.3.5.2-1: Warning message delivery procedure in NG-RAN\n0.\tNetwork registration and security (e.g. mutual authentication) procedures are performed.\nNOTE 1:\tThis step is performed each time a UE is attached to a network (e.g. after each power on).\n1.\tCBE (e.g. Information Source such as PSAP or Regulator) sends emergency information (e.g. \"warning type\", \"warning message\", \"impacted area\", \"time period\") to the CBC.

The number of cell IDs will be limited by the message size on N50 and N2. An Emergency Area ID is unique within the PLMN or SNPN.\nThe message may include an OMC ID. If present, it indicates the OMC to which the Trace record generated in step 9 is destined. Co-location of that OMC with the CBCF is an operator option.\nThe CBCF shall set the Concurrent Warning Message (CWM) indicator in all Write-Replace Warning Request NG-RAN messages, if the PLMN or SNPN supports concurrent warning message broadcasts.\nThe CBCF shall not include the \"digital signature\" or \"timestamp\" information.\nThe CBCF shall set the Send Write-Replace-Warning Indication element in case the AMF is requested to forward the Broadcast Scheduled Area List in a Write-Replace Warning Indication NG-RAN for the warning message.\nThe CBCF includes the Warning Area Coordinates in the Write-Replace-Warning-Request-NG-RAN message based on operator policy.\n3.\tThe AMF sends a Write-Replace Warning Confirm NG-RAN message that indicates to the CBCF that the AMF has started to distribute the warning message to NG-RAN nodes.\nThe Write-Replace Warning Confirm NG-RAN message may contain the Unknown Tracking Area List IE.

If the Warning Area is absent, it shall be interpreted as \"all cells on the NG-RAN node\".\nWhen the CBCF sends cancel messages to multiple AMFs for the same warning area, the NG-RAN node may receive same Cancel Request from multiple AMFs, if any redundant Cancel Requests are detected only the response to the first AMF shall contain statistics related to the cancelled broadcast.\n7.\tIf the Send Stop Warning Indication parameter was present in the Stop Warning Request NG-RAN and it is configured in the AMF based on operator policy, the AMF forwards the Broadcast Cancelled Area List it has received from the NG-RAN node in a Stop Warning Indication(s) NG-RAN to the CBCF. The AMF may aggregate Broadcast Cancelled Area Lists it receives from NG-RAN nodes.\nIf the CBCF has requested the AMF to send Stop Warning Indications NG-RAN, then the CBCF releases the Serial Number of a message after it has stopped receiving the Stop Warning Indications NG-RAN for that message.\nNOTE:\tSupport for Stop Warning Indication(s) NG-RAN is optional in the AMF.\n8.\tFrom the Cancel Response messages returned by NG-RAN nodes the AMF creates a trace record (e.g. number of times a particular message has been broadcasted in a given warning area) related to the cancelled message. Any OMC ID received in step 2 is written to the trace record to permit the O&M system to deliver them to the desired destination.\n",

The term primitive is used to indicate \"an abstract, implementation independent interaction between a service user and a service provider\" (see ITU-T Recommendation X.210 [12]). For the CBC-BSC/RNC/MME or CBCF-AMF interface, the service provider would be the protocol interconnecting the CBC and BSC/RNC/MME or the CBCF and AMF. A Primitive may therefore be viewed as an abstract, implementation independent request/indication or response/confirm interaction between the service user (CBC/CBCF or BSC/RNC/MME/AMF) and the service provider (protocol). A set of primitives for use between the CBC and BSC/RNC/MME and CBCF and AMF are specified appropriate to the functionality assigned to the CBC/CBCF and BSC/RNC/MME/AMF in clause 5 and clause 6. In order to allow future extensions to the primitives, where possible a primitive shall not be rejected because a parameter is not recognized; the recipient shall ignore the parameter in question and process the remainder of the primitive's parameters as usual.\nNOTE: The primitives for the CBCF-AMF interface are also applicable to the PWS-IWF – AMF interface, and the primitives for the CBC-MME interface are also applicable to the CBC-PWS-IWF interface.\nThe following table gives an overview over the existing primitives:\n\nIn GSM the CBC is integrated into the Core Network. The protocol between the CBC and BSC is defined in 3GPP TS 48.049 [30].\nIn UMTS the CBC is integrated into the Core Network.

The protocol between the CBCF/PWS-IWF and AMF is defined in 3GPP TS 29. 518 [41].\nNOTE 1:\tThe primitives used in NG-RAN are transported with the NonUeN2MessageTransfer and NonUeN2InfoNotfy service operations between CBCF and the AMF (see clause 9A) and via N2 from AMF to NG-RAN.\nNOTE 2:\tIn the following definitions, M indicates \"mandatory parameter\", O indicates \"optional parameter\" and C indicates \"conditional parameter\".\n",

How to manage the ambiguity is described subsequently.\nThis unique identification of a CBS message across the CBC-BSC interface is used in all the primitives defined hereafter.

                            "text_content": "The CBS messages which are transmitted by the BTS for the MS include the CBS Message (information for the user) and Schedule Message (schedule of CBS messages).\nThe use and the formatting of the CBS messages, which contain information for the MS user, is described in this clause.\nThe Schedule Message is broadcast to support CBS DRX mode for Mobile Stations. The Schedule Message is helpful in minimizing battery usage for Cell Broadcast in the Mobile Station, because it allows the MS to ignore transmissions of CBS messages the customer is not interested in. The use and formatting of the Schedule Message is described in 3GPP TS 44.012 [7].\nThe handling of the GSM only applicable ETWS Primary Notification messages differ from what is stated in this clause and is instead described in clause 9.4.1.3.\nEach page of a CBS Message sent to the MS by the BTS is a fixed block of 88 octets as coded in 3GPP TS 44.012 [7]. This is sent on the channel allocated as CBCH by 3GPP TS 45.002 [8]. The 88 octets of the CBS Message are formatted as described in clause 9.3.2.\n\nThe octets in the above table are transmitted in order, starting with octet 1. The bits within these octets are numbered 0 to 7; bit 0 is the low order bit and is transmitted first.\nThis parameter is a 16-bit integer which identifies a particular CBS message (which may be one to fifteen pages in length) from the source and type indicated by the Message Identifier and is altered every time the CBS message with a given Message Identifier is changed.\nThe two octets of the Serial Number field are divided into a 2-bit Geographical Scope (GS) indicator, a 10-bit Message Code and a 4-bit Update Number as shown below:\n\nThe most significant bit of the update number is octet 2 bit 3. The most significant bit of the Message Code is octet 1 bit 5 and the least significant bit of the Message Code is octet 2 bit 4. The most significant bit of the Geographical Scope is octet 1 bit 7.\nMessage Code:\nThe Message Code differentiates between CBS messages from the same source and type (i.e. with the same Message Identifier). Message Codes are for allocation by PLMN or SNPN operators.\nThe Message Code identifies different message themes. For example, let the value for the Message Identifier be \"Automotive Association\" (= source), \"Traffic Reports\" (= type). Then \"Crash on A1 J5\" could be one value for the message code, \"Cow on A32 J4\" could be another, and \"Slow vehicle on M3 J3\" yet another.\nIn the case of transmitting CBS messages for ETWS, i.e. the Message Identifier has a value for ETWS (see clause 9.4.1.2.2), a part of Message Code can be used to command mobile terminals to activate emergency user alert and message popup in order to alert the users. Message Code format for this purpose is as follows:\n\nNOTE 1:\tThe exact behaviour of the UE is specified in 3GPP TS 22.268 [28]. Whether the UE setting is overridden is subject to regulatory requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tEmergency user alert includes alerting tone and other user alerting means such as vibration, according to the UE's capability. The types of alert (e.g. the kind of tone, vibration, etc) are implementation　dependent and may be subject to regulatory requirements.\nNOTE 3:\tThe popup indication shall take precedence over the setting of the DCS Message class (see 3GPP TS 23.038 [3]), and the Geographical Scope with regard to Display Mode 'immediate'.\nThe codings of the Emergency User Alert and Popup fields are shown below:\n\nGeographical Scope:\nThe Geographical Scope (GS) indicates the geographical area over which the Message Code is unique, and the display mode. The CBS message is not necessarily broadcast by all cells within the geographical area. When two CBS messages are received with identical Serial Numbers/Message Identifiers in two different cells, the Geographical Scope may be used to determine if the CBS messages are indeed identical.\nIn particular, the Geographical Scope tells the mobile if the CBS message is:\n-\tonly cell wide (which means that if a message is displayed it is desirable that the message is removed from the screen when the UE selects the next cell and if any CBS message is received in the next cell it is to be regarded as \"new\"), or\n-\tPLMN/SNPN wide (which means that the Message Code and/or Update Number must change in the next cell, of the PLMN or SNPN, for the CBS message to be \"new\". The CBS message is only relevant to the PLMN or SNPN in which it is broadcast, so any change of PLMN (including a change to another PLMN which is an ePLMN) or SNPN means the CBS message is \"new\"), or\n-\tLocation Area wide (in GSM) (which means that a CBS message with the same Message Code and Update Number may or may not be \"new\" in the next cell according to whether the next cell is in the same Location Area as the current cell), or\n-\tService Area wide (in UMTS) (which means that a CBS message with the same Message Code and Update Number may or may not be \"new\" in the next cell according to whether the next cell is in the same Service Area as the current cell), or\nNOTE 4:\tAccording to 3GPP TS 23.003 [2] a Service Area consists of one cell only.\n-\tTracking Area wide (in E-UTRAN) (which means that a warning message with the same Message Code and Update Number may but need not be \"new\" in the next cell according to whether the next cell is in the same Tracking Area as the current cell), or\n-\tTracking Area wide (in NG-RAN) (which means that a warning message with the same Message Code and Update Number may but need not be \"new\" in the next cell according to whether the next cell is in the same Tracking Area as the current cell).\nThe display mode indicates whether the CBS message is supposed to be on the display all the time (\"immediate\") or only when the user wants to see it (\"normal\"). In either case, the CBS message will be displayed only if its Message Identifier is contained within the \"search list\" of the mobile (see clause 9.3.2). These display modes are indicative of intended use, without indicating a mandatory requirement or constraining the detailed implementation by mobile manufacturers. The user may be able to select activation of these different modes.\nThe coding of the Geographical Scope field is shown below:\n\nImmediate = default direct display.\nNormal = default display under user interaction.\nCode 00 is intended for use by the network operators for base station IDs but this code can also be used for other applications. Use of GS=00 takes precedence over the setting of the DCS Message class (see 3GPP TS 23.038 [3])\nUpdate Number:\nThe Update Number indicates a change of the message content of the same CBS message, i.e. the CBS message with the same Message Identifier, Geographical Scope, and Message Code.\nIn other words, the Update Number will differentiate between older and newer versions of the same CBS message, within the indicated geographical area. A new CBS message may have Update Number 0000; however this number will increment by 1 for each update.\nThis parameter identifies the source and type of the CBS message. For example, \"Automotive Association\" (= source), \"Traffic Reports\" (= type) could correspond to one value. A number of CBS messages may originate from the same source and/or be of the same type. These will be distinguished by the Serial Number. The Message Identifier is coded in binary.\nThe ME shall attempt to receive the CBS messages whose Message Identifiers are in the \"search list\". This \"search list\" shall contain the Message Identifiers stored in the EFCBMI, EFCBMID and EFCBMIR files on the SIM (see 3GPP TS 11.11) and any Message Identifiers stored in the ME in a \"list of CBS messages to be received\". If the ME has restricted capabilities with respect to the number of Message Identifiers it can search for, the Message Identifiers stored in the SIM shall take priority over any stored in the ME.\nThe use/application of the Message Identifier is shown in the following table, with octet 3 of the Message Identifier in hex shown first, followed by octet 4. Thus \"1234\" (hex) represents octet 3 = 0001 0010 and octet 4 = 0011 0100.\nIn a PLMN, the MS shall discard a CBS message in Message Identifier value range \"A000hex-AFFFhex\" unless it is received from:\n-\tHPLMN;\n-\tEHPLMN; or\n-\tPLMN that is equivalent to either HPLMN or EHPLMN.\nIn an SNPN, the MS shall discard a CBS message in Message Identifier value range \"A000hex-AFFFhex\" unless it is received from a subscribed SNPN.\nNetworks shall only use Message Identifiers from the range 4352 – 6399 (1100 hex – 18FF hex) for Public Warning System as defined in 3GPP TS 22.268 [28]. If a message Identifier from this range is in the \"search list\", the ME shall attempt to receive this CBS message. Processing of different language codes is specified in clause 9.4.1.2.3 and clause 9.4.2.2.4.\n\nGenerally, the MMI for entering any Message in the ME is left to the manufacturers' discretion. However, the codes allowed to be set by MMI in the table above shall be capable of being specified via their decimal representation i.e.:\nOctet 3\tOctet 4.\n0000 0000\t0000 0000\t(decimal '000').\n0000 0000\t0000 0001\t(decimal '001').\n0000 0000\t0000 0010\t(decimal '002').\n0000 0000\t0000 0011\t(decimal '003').\n:\t:\t:\n0000 1111\t1111 1111\t(decimal '4095').\n\n0001 0001\t0000 0000\t(decimal '4352').\n:\t:\t:\n0001 0001\t0001 0001\t(decimal '4369').\n\n0001 0001\t0001 0011\t(decimal '4371').\n:\t:\t:\n0001 0001\t0001 1110\t(decimal '4382').\n\n0001 0001\t0010 0000\t(decimal '4384').\n:\t:\t:\n1110 1111\t1111 1111\t(decimal '61439').\n\n\nThis parameter indicates the intended handling of the CBS message at the MS, the alphabet/coding, and the language (when applicable). This is defined in 3GPP TS 23.038 [3].\nWhen the SIM indicates one or more language preferences, the ME shall, by default, use the language(s) stored in the SIM (in the EFPL file) to set any language filter mechanisms provided by the ME.\nOptionally, when allowed by language code processing specified below, the user can select the language(s) required by using an MMI, to determine whether a particular CBS message should be displayed.\nWhere the message relates to a public warning system, the Message Identifier values 4370 through 4382, 4396 and 4398 relate to warning messages delivered in languages which are mandatory to receive. The ME shall not use any language filter mechanisms or use the language(s) selected through the MMI to determine whether a particular CBS message should be displayed for these Message Identifier values. This does not affect the ability to set a particular message identifier by MMI.\nWhere the message relates to a public warning system, the Message Identifier values 4383 through 4395, 4397 and 4399 relate to warning messages delivered in languages which are optional to receive. For these values, the ME can use language filter mechanisms and the MS may use the language(s) selected through the MMI to determine whether a particular CBS message should be displayed. Even if the Message Identifier is not settable by MMI, the message shall still be discarded if the language is not set to be displayed.\nThis parameter is coded as two 4-bit fields. The first field (bits 0-3) indicates the binary value of the total number of pages in the CBS message and the second field (bits 4-7) indicates binary the page number within that sequence. The coding starts at 0001, with 0000 reserved. If a mobile receives the code 0000 in either the first field or the second field then it shall treat the CBS message exactly the same as a CBS message with page parameter 0001 0001 (i.e. a single page message).\nThis parameter is a copy of the 'CBS-Message-Information-Page' as sent from the CBC to the BSC.\nThe ETWS Primary Notification message is transmitted to a MS in idle mode and dedicated mode as described in 3GPP TS 44.018 [26], and to a MS in packet transfer mode as described in 3GPP TS 44.060 [27]. The ETWS Primary Notification message is structured as in the table in clause 9.4.1.3.2.\nThis message is only applicable in GSM.\n\n\nThe octets in the above table are transmitted in order, starting with octet 1. The bits within these octets are numbered 0 to 7; bit 0 is the low order bit and is transmitted first.\nThis parameter identifies a particular ETWS Primary Notification message from the source and type indicated by the Message Identifier and is altered every time the ETWS Primary Notification message with a given Message Identifier is changed. The coding of this parameter is same as that defined in clause 9.4.1.2.1.\nThis parameter identifies the source and type of the ETWS Primary Notification message. The coding of this parameter is same as that defined in clause 9.4.1.2.2.\nThis parameter identifies the warning type of the ETWS Primary Notification message. It is identical with the Warning Type described in clause 9.3.24 with respect to its structure and possible value range.\nThis parameter identifies the warning security information of the ETWS Primary Notification message. The coding of this parameter is same as that defined in clause 9.3.25. The UE shall ignore this parameter.\nNOTE:\tThe Warning Security Information parameter is included due to requirements in earlier versions of this document.\n",

On layer two of the UMTS radio interface the logical channel CTCH is used.\n\nThe octets in the above table are transmitted in order, starting with octet 1. The bits within these octets are numbered 0 to 7; bit 0 is the low order bit and is transmitted first.\nFor ETWS, the transmission order of the parameter is only applicable to the secondary notification.\nFor value N in the above table see 3GPP TS 25.324 [19].\nThis parameter indicates the type of a message, either a CBS message or a Schedule Message. The Coding of the Message Type is described in 3GPP TS 25.324 [19].\nThis parameter identifies the source and type of the CBS Message (see also 3GPP TS 25.324 [19]). It is identical with the Message Identifier described in clause 9.4.1.2.2 with respect to its structure and possible value range.

The ME shall not use any language filter mechanisms or use the language(s) selected through the MMI to determine whether a particular CBS message should be displayed for these Message Identifier values. This does not affect the ability to set a particular message identifier by MMI.\nWhere the message relates to a public warning system, the Message Identifier values 4383 through 4395, 4397 and 4399, relate to warning messages delivered in languages which are optional to receive. For these values, the ME can use language filter mechanisms and the MS/UE may use the language(s) selected through the MMI to determine whether a particular CBS message should be displayed.

                    "text_content": "Cell Broadcast messages may be compressed in accordance with the compression algorithm described in 3GPP TS 23.042 [14].\nThe Data Coding Scheme parameter (see clause 9.4.1.2.3) indicates whether or not a CBS Message is compressed.\nCompression and decompression may take place between a CBE and an MS/UE or between a CBC and an MS/UE.\nThe compression applies only to user information sent between the CBC and the MS/UE i.e. excludes any padding octets.\nPadding in the case of CBS compression is defined as an integral number of octets where each padding octet has a value FF hexadecimal. The insertion of padding for different scenarios is described in the paragraphs below.\nThe compression footer (see 3GPP TS 23.042 [14]) delimits the compressed user information bit stream at an octet boundary. The remainder of the 'CBS-Message-Information-Page' sent between the CBC and the BSC contains padding octets. The parameter 'CBS-Message-Information-Length' identifies the sum of the compressed octets, the compression header, and the compression footer (see 3GPP TS 23.042 [14]), but not any padding.\nCompression may apply to a single 'CBS-Message-Information-Page' or across multiple 'CBS-Message-Information-Page's.\nIn the case where Compression applies only to a single 'CBS-Message-Information-Page', the compression header shall be the first octet in that 'CBS-Message-Information-Page' and the compression footer shall immediately follow the compressed data stream. Any remaining octets after the compression footer shall contain padding up to and including the 82nd octet position. However, if the 82nd octet position contains the compression footer then there is no padding.\nIn the case where compression applies across multiple 'CBS-Message-Information-Page's, the compression header shall be present only in the first octet position of the first 'CBS-Message-Information-Page'. The compression footer shall immediately follow the compressed data stream which will terminate within the last 'CBS-Message-Infirmation-Page'. Any remaining octets after the compression footer in the last 'CBS-Message-Information-Page' shall contain padding up to and including the 82nd octet position in the last 'CBS-Message-Information-Page'. However, if the 82nd octet position of the last 'CBS-Message-Information-Page' contains the compression footer then there is no padding.\nIf it is required to convey different blocks of information which are to be treated by the MS/UE as though they were physically independent pages rather than concatenated information then page break characters (see 3GPP TS 23.038 [3]) may be inserted in the character stream prior to compression. The boundaries created by the page breaks will not normally align with the boundaries set by the page number parameters and so the page number parameters cannot be used to identify physically separate blocks of meaningful information.\nThe decoding at the MS/UE may be achieved by first locating the compression footer octet by working back from the 82nd octet in the last 'CBS-Message-Information-Page'. If padding is present, the MS/UE must skip backwards over the padding until a non padding octet is found. By definition this octet must be the compression footer. The compression footer has a pre-defined bit combination which can never replicate a padding octet. If padding is not present in the 82nd octet position of the last 'CBS-Message-Information-Page', by definition the 82nd octet must be the compression footer.\nThe compression footer defined in 3GPP TS 23.042 [14] indicates whether there are any compressed data bits contained within the compression footer octet and, if not, how many compressed data bits are contained within the octet immediately preceding the compression footer. In order to prevent possible replication of the padding octet value in the compression footer octet value, the compression mechanism must ensure that when bits 0, 1, 2 in the compression footer are all ones all other bits in the compression footer octet are set to 0.\n",

            "description": "An index structure is defined in this clause. Index can be used by the operator to inform the end user about the type of CBS services available. Index has the structure of a tree. It can thus have sub parts which are called subindexes. A subindex can be embedded in the same index message as its parent (\"embedded subindex\") or it can physically be in a separate index message (\"child subindex\"). Every index message has a unique message identifier. They are always of the same type. Message Code 1010101010b shall be used to indicate this type. The root of the index structure shall be the index message with message identifier 0. Other index messages are linked to the root index with links. Definition of their message identifiers is left to the operator.\nA format (\"enhanced format\") for the index messages is described in this clause. If this enhanced format is used in the index message the MS/UE can present the index messages in its preferred format.\nAvailable CBS services are introduced in the index. This means that their message identifier and name are stated. Enhanced format includes a mechanism for separating a normal service introduction from embedded subindex introduction and child subindex introduction. The introduction of an embedded subindex specifies the \"subindex-id\" used for identifying services that belong to this subindex. Embedded subindexes can have subindexes embedded in them etc. If these \"second level embedded subindexes\" are introduced their subindex-id shall begin with the subindex-id of their parent. Same principle applies for subindexes in third, fourth etc. level. An example of an index structure is given in figure 6.\nEnhanced format includes a mechanism which allows the terminals to identify that the format of the index message is enhanced. The index-id -field and the above mentioned Message Code (1010101010b) constitute this mechanism:\nmessage-format\t=\tindex-id index-element-intro+.\nindex-id\t=\t\"EI\" version crlf.\nversion\t=\tnumber+.\nnumber\t=\t\"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\" | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\" | \"0\".\nindex-element-intro\t=\tsubindex-intro | service-intro.\nsubindex-intro\t=\tsubindex-id \" \" subindex-name crlf.\nsubindex-id\t=\tsubindex-character+.\nsubindex-character\t=\t\"a\" | \"b\" | … | \"z\" | \"A\" | \"B\" | … | \"Z\".\nsubindex-name\t=\tname-character+.\nname-character\t=\t<gsm03.38character excluding <CR> and <LF> >.\ncrlf\t=\t<CR> <LF>.\nservice-intro\t=\tsubindex-id message-id delimiter service-name crlf.\nmessage-id\t=\tnumber+.\ndelimiter\t=\t\".\" | \" \".\nservice-name\t=\tname-character+.\nCurrent version used is 1.\nThe use of \".\" as delimiter means that this service is a child subindex of the index structure.\nDelimiter \" \" is used in all other cases.\nSubindex-id shall not be used if the service introduced is in the first level of the index. Subindex-id:s are used in alphabetical order within an index message. They can be re-used in a child subindex.\n\nFigure 6\n",

In this option the PWS-IWF implements functionality to transfer messages between N50 and SBc reference points, and vice versa.\nThe figure depicts a 5G PWS (Physical-to-Software) architecture with PWS-IWF (Physical-to-Software-In-Wired) components. The PWS-IWF is a key component in the 5G network, responsible for managing the physical layer of the network. The figure shows the physical layer, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure B.1-1: 5GS PWS architecture with PWS-IWF\nThe PWS architecture using PWS-IWF contains the following reference points:\nN2:\tReference point between the NG-RAN and the AMF.\nNOTE 1:\tNG-RAN can be NR based or E-UTRA based (See 3GPP TS 23.501 [39] and 3GPP TS 38.413 [40]).\nSBc:\tReference point between the PWS-IWF and the CBC.\nNOTE 2:\tThe requirements for SBc in this deployment option corresponds to the requirements for SBc in the EPS network architecture as (see 3GPP TS 29.168 [35]).\nN50:\tReference point between the AMF and the PWS-IWF.\nNOTE 2:\tN50 uses service-based interfaces, further described in clause 9A of the present document.\nThe CBE and the interface between CBE and CBC are out of scope of 3GPP specifications.\nThe present document describes logical functional entities, and how these are realized in actual deployments is an implementation and deployment issue. It can however be foreseen that the PWS-IWF functionality may be co-located with the AMF, with the CBC, or deployed as a stand-alone network function. At AMF/PWS-IWF co-location, the AMF/PWS-IWF entity interacts with the CBC via SBc. At CBC/PWS-IWF co-location, the CBC/PWS-IWF interacts with the AMF via N50. At stand-alone PWS-IWF, the PWS-IWF interacts with the AMFvia N50 and with the CBC via SBc.\nA PWS-IWF co-located with AMF or a stand-alone PWS-IWF may interface to one CBC or multiple CBCs (i.e. the PWS-IWF is allowed to have SCTP transport associations established with one or multiple CBCs). A stand-alone PWS-IWF or a PWS-IWF co-located with the CBC may interface to several AMFs.\n",
