            "description": "The present document specifies a profile of AT commands and recommends that this profile be used for controlling Mobile Termination (MT) functions and network services from a Terminal Equipment (TE) through Terminal Adaptor (TA). The command prefix +C is reserved for Digital Cellular in ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14]. The present document has also the syntax details used to construct extended commands. Commands from ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] and existing digital cellular standards (TIA IS-99 [15] and TIA IS-135 [16]) are used whenever applicable. Some of the new commands are defined such way that they can be easily applied to MT of other networks.\nNOTE:\tThe terms GSM and GSM/UMTS are used whenever appropriate for SIM/UICC GSM applications or GSM/UMTS bearer services or to represent specific mobile accesses covered by the present specification.\nITU-T Recommendation T.31 [11] and ITU-T Recommendation T.32 [12] fax AT commands may be used for GSM/UMTS fax transmission from TE. Short Message Service AT commands are defined in 3GPP TS 27.005 [24]. AT commands for packet systems are defined in clause 10 of this specification. The present document assumes an abstract architecture comprising a TE (e.g. a computer) and a MT interfaced by a TA (see figure 1). The span of control of the defined commands should allow handling of any physical implementation that this abstract architecture may lead to:\n-\tTA, MT and TE as three separate entities;\n-\tTA integrated under the MT cover, and the TE implemented as a separate entity;\n-\tTA integrated under the TE cover, and the MT implemented as a separate entity; and\n-\tTA and MT integrated under the TE cover as a single entity.\nThe commands described in the present document may be observed on the link between the TE and the TA. However, most of the commands retrieve information about the MT, not about the TA.\n\nThe figure depicts a setup for a 5G network, illustrating the various components involved in signal propagation, including base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths for failover reliability. The setup is designed to align with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and automation.\nFigure 1: Setup\nInterface between TE and TA is intended to operate over existing serial (ITU-T Recommendation V.24) cables, infrared link, and all link types with similar behaviour. For correct operation many of the defined commands require eight bit data and therefore it is recommended that TE-TA link is set to eight bits/ byte mode. (For infrared operation implementation, refer informative references IrDA. For embedding AT commands and data during on-line data state, refer TIA-617/ITU-T V.80.) Interface between TA and MT is dependent on the interface in the MT.\nThe functional blocks shown in figure 1, using AT commands, shall follow the principles described in the interactions handling framework 3GPP TS 23.227 [63].\n",

Implementations must therefore analyse all parameters provided from the TA and discard (ignore) any parameters received following the parameters expected by the TE software.\nFor further information refer ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14].\nIn the tables for the commands syntaxes, the possible response(s) are outlined as follows:\n-\tthe responses from ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] (like OK and ERROR) are normally not shown; and\n-\tthe final response +CME ERROR is shown when a final result code in clause 9.2 can be provided.\nIn certain implementations, AT commands are used as an internal interface within the physical handset, e.g. between the application and the radio interface layer 3 stack implemented on different processors. Certain AT commands transfer information in the clear that can be regarded as sensitive with regards to security or privacy. Care must be exercised in AT commands that:\n-\ttransfer passwords (e.g. +CLCK, +CPWD or +CPBS);\n-\ttransfer identities (e.g. IMSI) or details of a call (e.g. +COLP);\n-\ttransfer the current location of the phone (e.g. +CMOLR);\n-\treveal the IMEI (e.g. +CGSN);\n-\tallow the TE to take unintentionally control over the SIM-MT interface (e.g. +CSIM);\n-\tenable/disable access to commands protected by security mechanism (e.g. +CSCC); or\n-\texchange security related parameters and keys with the UICC (e.g. +CEAP and +CERP).\nThe above mentioned AT commands and parameters are examples to illustrate the concerns and is not meant to be a comprehensive list.\n",

                    "text_content": "When beginning to build a communication link, a general TE application controlling a TA needs to determine the TA and the MT to which it is connected. ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] has seven commands for TA identification from which four are mandatory to be implemented in a TA. An example of this command sequence requesting manufacturer (+GMI), model (+GMM), revision (+GMR) and serial number (+GSN) information would be:\nAT+GMI\nManufacturer ABC\nOK\nAT+GMM\nGSM Ultimate Data Device\nOK\nAT+GMR\n1.00\nOK\nAT+GSN\n987612345-123\nOK\n\nThe maximum lengths of the information responses are defined to be 2048 characters, but it is recommended that they are kept as simple as in the example. The serial number command is defined as optional. Another optional command is Global Object Identification command (+GOI) which should return the object identifiers of ITU-T Recommendation X.208 as numeric strings delimited by periods. The Complete Capabilities List command (+GCAP) indicates the major capability areas of the TA. The support of different areas is presented in the response of +GCAP command. Each area can be presented by the selection command name of a specific capability area (e.g. +FCLASS for fax support) or some other predefined response. For instance, a GSM TA with fax capabilities could respond as follows:\nAT+GCAP\n+GCAP: +CGSM,+FCLASS,+W\nOK\n\nThe first supported area in the response is presented with +CGSM. It is the response text to show that some or all GSM commands of the present document are supported. Second response text (+FCLASS) informs that some fax or voice capabilities are present, and the third text (+W) about the presence of wireless commands as specified by PCCA STD-101 [17]. Command +FCLASS=? (refer e.g. ITU-T Recommendation T.31 [11] and ITU-T Recommendation T.32 [12]) can be used to query the supported fax capabilities and +WS46=? to query the wireless data services available:\nAT+FCLASS=?;+WS46=?\n0,1,2,2.0\n(12)\nOK\n\nThe TA of this example supports GSM data services, and fax service class 1 (TIA-578-A), 2 (manufacturer specific) and 2.0 (ITU-T Recommendation T.32 [12] / TIA-592).\nThe present document defines commands for MT identification which are similar to those for TA identification in ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14], for an example:\nAT+CGMI\nMobile Manufacturer XYZ\nOK\nAT+CGMM\nGSM Phone 1234\nOK\nAT+CGMR\n1.00\nOK\nAT+CGSN\n123456121234561\nOK\n\nManufacturer, model and version commands work similarly as for TA, except that the serial number query returns the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. IMEI is fifteen digits long and consists of a type approval code, a final assembly code, a serial number and a spare digit (refer 3GPP TS 23.003 [7]). When the TA is implemented inside MT, the responses for both TA and MT queries will most likely follow the responses of MT identification.\n",

                    "text_content": "The alternating mode call handling (voice and fax, or voice and data) and the data call setup commands are defined such that the dialling command of ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] (D) still always originates a call. The purpose is to support all current TE applications using the dialling command as default. Fax calls are controlled following the rules of ITU-T Recommendation T.31 [11] and ITU-T Recommendation T.32 [12] standards.\nAn example where a voice call is originated:\nATD+1 812 555673I; (type of address defaults to 145, CLI presentation is restricted for this call)\nOK\t\t(call setup was successful)\n\nAn example where a voice call is attempted from a phonebook:\nATD>\"Doe Joe\"G;\t(enable CUG control for this call)\n+CME ERROR: 22\t(entry \"Doe Joe\" is not found)\n\nAlso supplementary services can be controlled using dial command according to 3GPP TS 22.030 [19]. An example of call forwarding on no reply for telephony with the adjustment of the no reply condition timer on 25 seconds:\nATD**61*+1812555673*11*25#\nOK\t(modification was successful)\n\nTwo new commands are created for controlling the alternating mode calls. First one, Call Mode (+CMOD), selects between single and alternating mode. Because this is a crucial command, it is defined that the value is set back to zero (single mode) after every successfully originated alternating mode call. Also on power-up and factory or user resets, the value is set to zero. The second new command, Hangup Call (+CHUP), is not a replacement of ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] command H, but a command which reliably disconnects the call in GSM/UMTS network. This is defined because the H command is used to switch from fax or data mode to voice mode.\nThe setting of GSM/UMTS bearer service (data circuit duplex asynchronous and synchronous, PAD access circuit asynchronous, or data packet duplex synchronous), is done with Select Bearer Service Type (+CBST). It chooses one of the four mentioned bearer services, the data rate of the service (or actually the modulation when modem IWFs are used), and enables or disables RLP. Command Radio Link Protocol (+CRLP) is used to set the RLP parameters in the radio path.\nService Reporting Control command (+CR) is defined similarly as the reporting of modulation, V.18, error control, and data compression which are ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] features used to show information about the type of the established connection before the CONNECT intermediate result code. +CR command has one subparameter which specifies whether the intermediate result code +CR: <serv> is returned or not. The result code is typically returned before any ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] reporting result codes. An example of setting up an asynchronous 9600 bit/s modem connection with service reporting:\nAT+CBST=7,0,1\t(asynchronous modem 9600 bit/s and RLP)\nOK\nAT+CR=1\t(enable reporting)\nOK\nATD1234567890\n+CR: REL ASYNC\nCONNECT 9600\n\nAs GSM/UMTS network offers more information about the reason of the failure in call originating and answering than normal PSTN, it is useful to add an extra command to return this information to the TE. This information should not be returned always after unsuccessful call originating or answering, because many TE applications look for just the regular NO CARRIER, BUSY, NO ANSWER and CONNECT messages. Action command Extended Error Report (+CEER) does not have any subparameters, and it returns the cause of the latest call setup failure. This information can be the textual presentation of the GSM/UMTS network failure code (refer 3GPP TS 24.008 [8] Annex H), or some other information defined by the TA manufacturer.\n",

If the selected access technology is not available, then the same operator shall be selected in other access technology.

When this function is activated in the ME, the ME informs about events for calls with unsolicited result codes.\nThe purpose of the call monitoring function is to:\n1)\tgather relevant information for the detected calls in a TE; and\n2)\tmake it possible for the TE to display call state information for ongoing calls.\nThe unsolicited result code+CMCCSI is used for basic call information.\n+CMCCSI: <ccidx>,<dir>,<neg_status_present>,<neg_status>,<SDP_md>,<cs_mode>,<ccstatus>,<mpty>,<numbertype>,<ton>,<number>,<exittype>,<exitcause>\nThe unsolicited result code +CMCCSI is provided when <n>=2. For an originating call, the parameters <numbertype>, <ton> and <number> in +CMCCSI provide the number (line identity) information which has been dialled with +CDU or ATD. For a terminating call, the parameters <numbertype>, <ton> and <number> in +CMCCSI provide the number (line identity) information of the calling user.\nThe unsolicited result codes +CMCCSS<x> / +CMCCSSEND are used for supplementary service related information.\n+CMCCSS1: <ccidx>,<dir>,<service>\n[+CMCCSS2: <numbertype>,<ton>,<number>]\n[+CMCCSS3: <CLI_validity>]\n[+CMCCSS4: <name>]\n[+CMCCSS5: <subaddr>,<satype>]\n[+CMCCSS6: <priority>]\n[+CMCCSS7: <CUG_index>]\n[+CMCCSS8: <eCNAM_meta>]\n+CMCCSSEND\nThe unsolicited result codes +CMCCSS<x> / +CMCCSSEND are used for supplementary service related information and are reported when <n>=3.

It is manufacturer specific when and if this additional service reporting will be issued. Whenever a service event is to be reported using these unsolicited result codes, the codes +CMCCSS1 and +CMCCSSEND are mandatory. +CMCCSS1 contains essential information that is always needed (for example <ccidx>) and +CMCCSSEND indicates the end of this particular set of unsolicited result codes. The other unsolicited result codes (+CMCCSS2 to +CMCCSSn) are optional, intended to provide information related to a given service. E.g. for the supplementary service CNAP, the unsolicited result code +CMCCSS4 (containing <name>) may be issued. It is implementation specific which of the unsolicited result codes +CMCCSS<x> / +CMCCSSEND that are supported and provided to the TE. The unsolicited result codes should be provided to the TE as soon as the information is available in the ME. The parameters <numbertype>, <ton> and <number> in +CMCCSS2 are, if applicable, normally the line identity information that is related to the parameter <service>.\nNOTE 1:\tFor situations where ringing is applicable, the unsolicited result codes +CMCCSS<x> / +CMCCSSEND are typically returned after the first RING (or +CRING: <type>; refer clause \"Cellular result codes +CRC\") result code sent from TA to TE.\nA subset of the information provided by the call monitoring function can be provided by the command +CLCCS.\nWhen the unsolicited result code +CMCCSI report that the <ccstatus>=1 (Idle), the call identification number is reset and the call identification number <ccidx> can be used by new calls.

                    "text_content": "Phone Activity Status (+CPAS) is a general command used to detect the presence of the MT, if there is an incoming call, or if there is a call in progress. This command is normally used before trying to operate the MT from the TE. Note that the activity status can change at any time after the execution of +CPAS, and hence the returned value can be obsolete. Detachment of the MT from the TA is indicated with a special final result code that indicates all errors related to the operation of the MT. Result code is +CME ERROR: <err>, where <err> is an integer or verbose value giving useful information about the reason for the command failure (refer clause \"Mobile termination error result code +CME ERROR\").\nSet Phone Functionality (+CFUN) can be used to reset the MT or set the power consumption level of the MT by disabling certain parts of the MT (e.g. the transmit and receive RF circuits). Mobile Termination Control Mode (+CMEC) is a command which manages access sharing between the MT and the TE to operate the user interface of the MT. It has four subparameters which describe the access to keypad, display, indicators, and touch screen. Each subparameter has values for restricting the operation of the corresponding user interface part only to the MT or only to the TE, or to give the access for both of them.\nKeypad Control command (+CKPD) is used to operate the keypad of the MT. Here lies the problem of different keypad types between manufacturers, and also between their MT models. The keypresses are sent to the MT as a string type subparameter of this command. Each character in that string represents a key which will be logically pressed. A special character (colon) followed by any character can be used by manufacturers (or TE application programmers) to represent a key which is not defined in this profile. An escape character (semicolon) for direct string entering is also defined. All text between single semicolon characters is treated as an alphanumeric entry and is not converted to keypressings. All semicolon characters inside the text is duplicated in the TE and stripped back to one before entering them to the MT. Command has also optional second and third parameters which can be used to alter the time to strike each key, and the pause to wait between keystrokes (in tenths of a second). A special pause character (W or w) can be added in the string type subparameter for an extra pause of the same length as given by the third subparameter. In the following example alphanumeric mode is entered and a person predefined in the MT phonebook, \"Ilkka\", is called; each key is struck for half a second and pauses between strokes are a tenth of a second:\nAT+CKPD=\"@:Ilkka:S\",5,1\nOK\n\nDisplay Control command (+CDIS) is used both for writing to the display text fields and for reading the current status of the fields. Mobile Termination usually has a character set of its own, so the TA will do a conversion between the TE and the MT character sets. TE can have several character sets and the TA must be informed of the character set in use before starting to write or read the display. Character set is set with general command select TE character set +CSCS. The +CDIS=? query command is a way to get information about the length of the fields. In the following example an MT is first queried about the supported conversions and the lengths of the fields. The response shows there are three ten character long and two six character long fields. Then the TE character set is set to be IRA and the current status of the display is read. The last command writes the text \"Hello, I'm writing to display\" in the three fields, and keeps the contents of the two other fields same (the last two commas could also be left out).\nAT+CSCS=?;+CDIS=?\n+CSCS: (\"IRA\",\"PCCP850\",\"8859-1\")\n+CDIS: 10,10,10,6,6\nOK\nAT+CSCS=\"IRA\"\nOK\nAT+CDIS?\n+CDIS: \"RADIOLINJA\",\"\",\"\",\"Menu\",\"Memory\"\nOK\nAT+CDIS=\"IRA\",\"Hello, I'm\",\"writing to\",\"display\",,\nOK\n\nThe writing is possible only when it is permitted by the Mobile Termination Control Mode command (and by the manufacturer). If a certain field is not writable (but is readable), writing to it is ignored. The order of the text fields is determined by manufacturers and follow the rule: first field is in the upper left corner, second in the next field to the right, and so on, until to the last field in the lower right corner.\nTouch screen action Control command (+CTSA) is used to operate the touch screen of the MT. The x, y coordinates of the phone are fixed even if the device's orientation is changed. In the following example commands are sent to the MT to emulate a user drawing on the ME's touch screen; it is relevant that the gesture starts from the top of the touch screen. A gesture is emulated, starting at location 10,10 in a non-display area of the ME's (touch) screen, then dragged to 50,50 (during which the gesture crosses the boundary between the non-display area and a display area), then dragged to 100,100 and finally the touch screen is released at location 100,100.\nAT+CSO=?\t\tobtain the touch screen orientation\n+CSO=2,0\nAT+CSS=?\t\tobtain the touch screen size\n+CSS=200,600\nAT+CDSB=?\t\tdetermine if a boundary between the non-display area and a display area exists, and its location\n+CDSB=20,20,180,580\nAT+CTSA=1,10,10\t\tstart emulating a gesture\nAT+CTSA=1,50,50\t\temulate that the gesture crosses the boundary between non-display area and a display area\n+CTSA=0,100,100\t\tend emulating the gesture\n\nIndicators can be handled with Indicator Control command (+CIND). Its query command returns a short description (abbreviation) of the purpose of the indicators and the supported values for each indicator. The setting and reading is done similarly as with Display Control command. In the following example the indicators of a phone are queried, their current value is read, and the value of message indicator is tried to set (but it is forbidden):\nAT+CIND=?\n+CIND: (\"memory\",(0-2)),(\"call\",(0,1)),(\"data\",(0,1)),(\"roam\",(0,1)),\n(\"alpha\",(0,1)),(\"message\",(0,1)),(\"index1\",(0-11)),(\"index2\",(0-11)),\n(\"index3\",(0-11)),(\"signal\",(0-5)),(\"service\",(0,1)),(\"sel1\",(0,1)),\n(\"sel2\",(0,1)),(\"sel3\",(0,1)),(\"battchg\",(0-5))\nOK\nAT+CIND?\n+CIND: 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5\nOK\nAT+CIND=,,,,,0\n+CME ERROR: 10\n\nThe subparameter order in the command is defined by the query command order, not by the actual display order. The zero value of an indicator means that it is off (or in state which can be identified as \"off\"-state), value one means that the indicator is on (or in a state which is more substantial than \"off\"-state), value two is more substantial than one, and so on.\nTo this point, only operating through the TE is covered. But when MT can be operated also through its keypad, or touch screen, or there are changes in the status of the display elements, the information about these actions is given to the TE also. This can be solved only with unsolicited result codes which return keypad, display text and indicator, and touch screen events. Each event group has a result code of its own: +CKEV returns the key code and if the key pressed (1) or released (0), +CDEV returns the display text field running number (as specified by command +CDIS) and the new status of the field, and +CIEV returns the running number of the indicator (refer +CIND) and the new value of it, and +CTEV returns the location of the action performed on the touch screen. In the following example number key 1 is pressed, updated on the display, released, and signal strength changes its state to five, the touch screen is pressed at coordinates 10,10, and it is released at the same coordinates, 3 seconds after initially pressing the screen:\n+CKEV: 49,1\n+CDEV: 1,\"1\"\n+CKEV: 49,0\n+CIND: 10,5\n+CTEV: 1,10,10,0;\n+CTEV: 0,10,10,0,3000\n\nMobile Termination Event Reporting command (+CMER) has been specified for the purpose of controlling the sending of these unsolicited result codes to the TE. Four ways are provided to handle the buffering of the result codes (see figure 8). The first is to buffer them always. The second possibility is to discard them when in on-line data mode and otherwise forward them directly to the TE. The third possibility is to buffer them in data mode and otherwise forward them to the TE. The last possibility is to send them always to the TE (some inband technique - e.g. V.80 - is used in data mode to send the result codes within the data). This is the first subparameter of +CMER command. Next three subparameters are used to enable or disable each of the keypad, text field and indicator result codes. Sending codes can be enabled either so that only events generated from the MT user interface are returned, or so that also events caused by Keypad, Display and Indicator Control commands are returned. The fifth subparameter controls the flushing of the buffer when the value of the first subparameter is changed to a value from one to three.\nThe figure depicts a mobile termination event reporting system, illustrating the flow of data from the mobile device to the network. It shows the data being transmitted over various paths, including the mobile device's network, the network's core switches, and the network's distributed nodes. The figure also highlights the use of redundancy paths to ensure data reliability and failover.\nFigure 8: Mobile termination event reporting\nAn example of complete setup of the TA where TE takes the control of keypad, but does not want to write to display nor control the indicators (in the start MT is powered off):\nAT+CMEE=2;+CREG=1\t(use verbose <err> values; report registration)\nOK\nAT+CPAS\t\t(query MT status)\n+CPAS: 5\t\t(MT is asleep)\nOK\nAT+CFUN=1\t\t(set MT to full functionality state)\n+CME ERROR: SIM PIN required\t(SIM requests PIN)\nAT+CPIN=\"1234\"\n+CME ERROR: incorrect password\t(user entered wrong PIN)\nAT+CPIN=\"4321\"\nOK\t\t(correct PIN)\nAT+COPS=0,0\t\t(ask for automatic operator selection and registration)\nOK\n+CREG: 1\t\t(registered in the network)\nAT+COPS?\n+COPS: 0,0,\"RADIOLINJA\"\t(get the operator name)\nOK\nAT+CMEC=1,0,0\t\t(take over the keypad, leave display to MT)\nOK\nAT+CDIS=?;+CIND=?\t(query display text and indicator formats)\n+CDIS: 10,10,10,6,6\n+CIND: (\"memory\",(0-2)),(\"call\",(0,1)),(\"data\",(0,1)),(\"roam\",(0,1)),\n(\"alpha\",(0,1)),(\"message\",(0,1)),(\"index1\",(0-11)),(\"index2\",(0-11)),\n(\"index3\",(0-11)),(\"signal\",(0-5)),(\"service\",(0,1)),(\"sel1\",(0,1)),\n(\"sel2\",(0,1)),(\"sel3\",(0,1)),(\"battchg\",(0-5))\nOK\nAT+CSCS=\"IRA\"\t\t(set TE character set for display text results)\nOK\nAT+CMER=1,0,2,2,0\t(return display text and indicator result codes when\nOK\t\tin command state, in data mode discard them)\nAT+CDIS?;+CIND?\t\t(read current state of display texts and indicators)\n+CDIS: \"\",\"\",\"     12345\",\"Menu\",\"Memory\"\t(user had pressed number buttons before\n+CIND: 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5\tTE took control with +CMEC)\nOK\nAT+CKPD=\"C\",20\t\t(clear main display text '12345' by holding the\nOK\t\t'clear' button down two seconds)\n+CDEV: 3,\"1234\"\t\t(first only one character deleted)\n+CDEV: 3,\"\"\t\t(while holding continues, whole display is cleared)\n+CDEV: 1,\"RADIOLINJA\"\t(operator name comes to the display)\n\nThe start of the previous example could go as follows when MT has already been powered on but is waiting for the PIN:\nAT+CMEE=2;+CREG=1\t(use verbose <err> values; report registration)\nOK\nAT+CPAS\t\t(query MT status)\n+CPAS: 0\t\t(MT is ready to receive commands)\nOK\nAT+CPIN?\t\t(is MT asking passwords?)\n+CPIN: SIM PIN\t\t(yes, SIM PIN required)\nAT+CPIN=\"4321\"\nOK\t\t(correct PIN)\n\nOne of the most regular operations done through the MT user interface is phonebook control. To lessen the workload of the TE, some direct commands for phonebook reading and writing are practical. Command Select Phonebook Memory Storage +CPBS query version returns supported phonebook memories, read version returns current settings, and set version selects the memory. For GSM, the normal storages are SIM, MT and TA.\nRead Phonebook Entries (+CPBR) can be used to read either one or many phonebook locations at the same time. A regular phonebook entry consists of three elements: memory index number, the phone number and its alphanumeric equivalent given by the user. Query version of this returns supported index values of the selected memory, and the maximum lengths of the number and alphanumeric elements. The query version of the Write Phonebook Entry command (+CPBW) is similar, but the action version sets or clears an entry in the phonebook. Find Phonebook Entries (+CPBF) can be used to search alphanumeric entries starting with specific string. An example where the whole phonebook of the MT is read, index number four is cleared, and number three is written:\nAT+CPBS=?\n+CPBS: (\"ME\",\"SM\")\t(MT and SIM have phonebooks)\nOK\nAT+CPBS=\"ME\"\t\t(select MT memory)\nOK\nAT+CPBR=?\t\t(read index range and element lengths)\n+CPBR: (1-99),30,30\nOK\nAT+CPBR=1,99\t\t(read all entries but only the ones set are returned)\n+CPBR: 1,\"931123456\",129,\"Ilkka\"\n+CPBR: 2,\"9501234567\",129,\"\"\n+CPBR: 4,\"901234567\",129,\"Hesari\"\nOK\nAT+CPBW=4;+CPBW=3,\"921123456\",,\"TS\" (clear index 4 and write index 3)\nOK\nCircuit switched fallback (+CCSFB) can be used to control circuit switched fallback operation. Reporting of CSFB related CS paging requests can be switched on or off by +CCSFB=1 and +CCSFB=0. CSFB related CS paging requests are reported with unsolicited result code +CCSFBU. CSFB calls can be automatically accepted or rejected by +CCSFB=2, +CCSFB=3, +CCSFB=4 and +CCSFB=5. CSFB calls can be manually accepted or rejected by +CCSFB=6 and +CCSFB=7. In the example the ME interrogates the current CSFB settings, enables reporting and accepts a CSFB call:\nAT+CCSFB=?\n+CCSFB: 0\t\t(reporting and automatic acceptance/rejection disabled)\nOK\nAT+CCSFB=1\t\t(enable reporting)\nOK\n+CCSFBU: 2,1,12345678,17\t(incoming CSFB paging request with clip supplementary service)\nAT+CCSFB=6\t\t(accept CSFB call)\nOK\n\n",

                    "text_content": "This clause defines commands that a TE can use to control a MT supporting packet switched services.\nPacket Domain MTs vary widely in functionality. At one extreme, an advanced MT can support multiple PDP types, and use multiple external networks and QoS profiles. At the other extreme, an MT can support only a single PDP type using a single external network, and rely on the HLR to contain the PDP context definition.\nA comprehensive set of Packet Domain-specific commands is defined in clause 10.1 to provide the flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands are designed to be expandable to accommodate new PDP types and interface protocols, merely by defining new values for many of the parameters. Multiple contexts can be activated if the interface link-layer protocol is able to support them. The commands use the extended information and error message capabilities described in this specification.\nFor MTs of intermediate complexity, most commands have simplified forms where certain parameters can be omitted.\nFor certain simple MTs, and for backwards compatibility with existing communications software as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [47], it is possible to control access to the Packet Domain using existing modem-compatible commands. A special dial-string syntax is defined for use with the D command. This \"modem compatible\" mode of operation is described in clause 10.2.\nA discussion on the interaction of the AT commands, Packet Domain Management and Packet Data Protocols, together with examples of command sequences for some applications can be found in 3GPP TS 23.060 [47] and 3GPP TS 27.060 [34].\n",

For bearer resources activated by the network a context identifier is allocated by the MT/TA.\nFor easy reading the term PDP context is used for PDP contexts in UMTS/GPRS as well as PDN/default EPS bearers and traffic flows in EPS.\nThe feature \"initial PDP context\" may be supported and is a manufacturer specific option. For this option, the context with <cid>=0 (context number 0) is defined upon startup and does not need to be created with the +CGDCONT command. The initial PDP context has particular manufacturer specific default settings disassociated with any other default settings of +CGDCONT. When in E-UTRAN or according to the AT-command +CIPCA in GERAN and UTRAN, the initial PDP context is automatically activated by the MT following a successful registration to the network. If all active contexts are deactivated, the initial PDP context can be (re)established. This is manufacturer specific and depends on the current RAT as well as how the active contexts are deactivated.\nNOTE 1:\tCare must be taken to secure that repetitive PDP context activations / deactivations are not performed and that PDP contexts are not activated in situations where it is a determined choice by the terminal or the network to discontinue connectivity. Examples of such deliberate discontinuation of connectivity are the AT-commands +CGATT=0 or +CGACT=0, receipt of a detach request from the network with \"re-attach not required\" or when all PDP contexts are deactivated by the network.\nTable 10.1.0-1: AT commands/results applicable for EPS\n(equivalence between PDP context / PDN Connection or Default EPS Bearer)\n\nTable 10.1.0-2: AT commands/results applicable for EPS\n(equivalence between PDP context / EPS Bearer Resources)\n\nTable 10.1.0-3: AT commands applicable for EPS\n\nNOTE 2:\tThe above is not a complete list of AT commands for EPS but only those applicable to PDN connections and EPS bearer resources.\n",

There can be other reasons for the UE to use security protected transmission of ESM information, e.g. if the UE needs to transfer an APN. The number of PDP contexts that may be in a defined state at the same time is given by the range returned by the test command.\nFor EPS the PDN connection and its associated EPS default bearer is identified herewith.\nFor 5GS the PDU session and its associated QoS flow of the default QoS rule is identified herewith.\nA special form of the set command, +CGDCONT=<cid> causes the values for context number <cid> to become undefined.\nIf the initial PDP context is supported, the context with <cid>=0 is automatically defined at startup, see clause 10.1.0. As all other contexts, the parameters for <cid>=0 can be modified with +CGDCONT. If the initial PDP context is supported, +CGDCONT=0 resets context number 0 to its particular default settings.\nThe read command returns the current settings for each defined context.\nThe test command returns values supported as compound values.

The concept is further described in the 3GPP TS 23.060 [47], 3GPP TS 23.501 [165] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [161]. A TFT consists of from one and up to 16 Packet Filters, each identified by a unique <packet filter identifier>. A Packet Filter also has an <evaluation precedence index> that is unique within all TFTs associated with all PDP contexts that are associated with the same PDP address.\nThe set command specifies a Packet Filter that is to be added to the TFT stored in the MT and used for the context identified by the (local) context identification parameter, <cid>. The specified TFT will be stored in the GGSN, the Packet GW and UPF only at activation or MS-initiated modification of the related context. Since this is the same parameter that is used in the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands, the +CGTFT command is effectively an extension to these commands. The Packet Filters consist of a number of parameters, each of which may be set to a separate value.\nA special form of the set command, +CGTFT=<cid> causes all of the Packet Filters in the TFT for context number <cid> to become undefined. At any time there may exist only one PDP context with no associated TFT amongst all PDP contexts associated to one PDP address. At an attempt to delete a TFT, which would violate this rule, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command. Refer clause 9.2 for possible <err> values.\nThe read command returns the current settings for all Packet Filters for each defined context.\nThe test command returns values supported as compound values. If the MT supports several PDP types, the parameter value ranges for each PDP type are returned on a separate line. TFTs shall be used for PDP-type IP and PPP only. For PDP-type PPP a TFT is applicable only when IP traffic is carried over PPP. If PPP carries header-compressed IP packets, then a TFT cannot be used.\nDefined values\n<cid>: integer type. Specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).\n<PDP_type>: string type. Specifies the type of packet data protocol (see the +CGDCONT command).\nFor the following parameters, see also 3GPP TS 23.060 [47], 3GPP TS 23.501 [165] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [161]:\n<packet filter identifier>: integer type. Value range is from 1 to 16.\nNOTE:\tWhile the numbering of packet filter identifier in this specification ranges from 1 to 16, the numbering of packet filter identifier in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8] ranges from 0 to 15.

The <response> parameter allows the TE to accept or reject the request.\nIf <response> is 0, the request is rejected and the MT returns OK to the TE.\nIf <response> is 1, the following procedure is followed by the MT.\nCommands following the +CGANS command in the AT command line shall not be processed by the MT.\nIf the <L2P> parameter value is unacceptable to the MT, the MT shall return an ERROR or +CME ERROR response. Refer clause 9.2 for possible <err> values. Otherwise, the MT issues the intermediate result code CONNECT and enters V.250 online data state.\nThe detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in 3GPP TS 27.060 [34] and in more detail in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and the specifications for the relevant PDPs. PDP context activation procedures shall take place prior to or during the PDP startup.\nOne or more <cid>s may be specified in order to provide the values needed for the context activation request.\nDuring the PDP startup procedure the MT has the PDP type and the PDP address provided by the network in the Request PDP Context Activation message. The MT may also have some or all of the following information:\nThe MT may have a priori knowledge, for example, it may implement only one PDP type.\nThe command may have provided an <L2P> parameter value.\nThe TE may provide one or both of PDP type and PDP address to the MT in the PDP startup.\nIf any of this information is in conflict, the command will fail.\nIf one or more <cid> is given then an attempt shall be made to identify an appropriate context definition by matching the PDP type and PDP address in the network request with the PDP type and PDP address in each of the specified context definitions (in the order in which their <cid>s appear in the command) as follows:\nThe PDP type must match exactly.\nThe PDP addresses are considered to match if they are identical or if the address in the context definition is unspecified.\nThe context shall be activated using the values for PDP type and PDP address provided by the network, together with the other information found in the PDP context definition. An APN may or may not re required, depending on the application.\nIf no <cid> is given or if there is no matching context definition, the MT will attempt to activate the context using the values for PDP type and PDP address provided by the network, together with any other relevant information known to the MT. The other context parameters will be set to their default values.\nIf the activation is successful, data transfer may proceed.\nAfter data transfer is complete, and the layer 2 protocol termination procedure has completed successfully, the V.250 command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code OK\nIn the event of an erroneous termination or a failure to startup, the V.250 command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code NO CARRIER or, if enabled, +CME ERROR. Refer clause 9.2 for possible <err> values. Attach, activate and other errors may be reported. It is also an error to issue the +CGANS command when there is no outstanding network request.\nNOTE:\tThis is not the same as if the MT issues a +CGDATA (or +CGACT) command after receiving a +CRING unsolicited result code. A +CGDATA (or +CGACT) does not command the MT to acknowledge the network request but rather to make a new request for context activation. The network request would be ignored.\nThe test command returns the values of <response> and <L2P> supported by the MT as compound values.\nThis command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.\nDefined values\n<response>: integer type; specifies how the request should be responded to.\n0\treject the request\n1\taccept and request that the PDP context be activated\nIf <response> is omitted it is assumed to be 0.\n<L2P>: string type; indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used (see +CGDATA command).\n<cid>: integer type; specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).\nImplementation\nOptional.\n",

The commands use the extended information and error message capabilities described in this specification.\nFor the simplest MTs, and for backwards compatibility with existing communications software, it is possible to control access to the VGCS and VBS using existing modem-compatible commands. A special dial-string syntax is defined for use with the D command. This \"modem compatible\" mode of operation is described in clause 11.2.\n",

In all other cases the command responds with +CME ERROR: 14 (SIM busy).\n+CUSATD=<download>,1 also enables the unsolicited result code +CUSATS: <UICC_state>. The MT uses this unsolicited result code to indicate that a profile download is performed (setting +CUSATD=0,1 or +CUSATD=1,1) or that it is ready for profile download (setting +CUSATD=2,1). In both cases, the MT also indicates the end of UICC start-up by the unsolicited result code +CUSATS: 4. If the UICC is awaiting PIN verification during start-up, this is also reported.\nWhen using +CUSATD=1, the +CUSATA=1 command has to be used to enable TE profile facility handling after restart. In the time between profile download and issuance of +CUSATA=1, the UICC may already attempt to issue proactive commands. The MT will not send these to the TE, but rather give the UICC the response \"terminal currently unable to process command\" autonomously. The UICC may implement only a limited number of retries, which can potentially leave USAT in an unwanted state if the +CUSATA=1 command arrives late.\nNOTE:\tCare has to be taken when using +CUSATD=2. If no +CUSATA=2 or +CUSATA=3 is sent during start-up, USAT is also blocked for the MT.\nTest command returns supported values as compound values.\nRefer clause 9.2 for possible <err> values.\nDefined values\n<download>: integer type.

There are various types of eMBMS services that can be provided to the end user such as Mobile TV, streaming, file download, etc.\neMBMS information is sent over SystemInformationBlockType13 information element (SIB-13) according to 3GPP TS 36.331 [86] clause 6.3.1. Information on eMBMS parameters can be found in 3GPP TS 36.443 [150] and 3GPP TS 29.061 [39].\nA comprehensive set of eMBMS-specific commands is defined to provide the flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands are designed to be expandable to accommodate new eMBMS feature options and interface protocols, merely by defining new values for many of the parameters. The commands use the extended information and error message capabilities described in this specification.\nThe +CEMBMSCFG command enables or disables the eMBMS support in the MT. Once the eMBMS service is enabled then the status of the eMBMS session can be received by enabling the URC using the +CEMBSR command. The +CEMBSR command also provides information about the TMGI and eMBMS session being used by the MT. The +CEMBMSDATA command can be used by the MT to configure the data channel to use for receiving eMBMS services. The +CEMBMSSRV command is used to configure and activate the eMBMS service for a specific TMGI and listen for any service change indications. The +CEMBMSCNT command can be used to set the list of TMGIs from which the MT can receive eMBMS services.\n",

            "description": "The \"Voice Control Interim Standard for Asynchronous DCE\", TIA IS-101, contains some commands that are useful when passing audio \"data\" (that is, data which represents audio information) between the computer and the TA.\nSome of the following clauses describe commands from IS-101 which are central to this TA application. However, with the exception of necessary extensions, these descriptions are not intended to replace the definitions found in IS-101. Other novel commands from the interim standard are not included because they are peripheral to TA operation.\nNOTE 1:\tIS-101 also uses ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14] AT commands, but these are not mentioned here.\nThe standard specifies the following modes:\n-\tcommand mode, where there is no transfer of audio \"data\" between the TA and the computer. In command mode, the computer is neither sending audio data to the TA nor receiving audio data from the TA.\n-\ttransmit mode, where audio \"data\" is being transferred from the computer to the TA. No audio \"data\" is transferred from the TA to the computer in this state. A transition back to command mode occurs when an embedded command indicates \"end of play\" or \"flush data\", or an inactivity timer times out.\n-\treceive mode, where audio \"data\" is being transferred from the TA to the computer. No audio \"data\" is transferred from the computer to the TA in this state. A transition back to command mode occurs when any command is sent from the computer, or an inactivity timer times out. During the receive mode, the TA embeds result codes into the audio \"data\". These result codes indicate pertanent events such as \"silence detected\", \"busy detected\", and so on.\nStrictly, the standard specifies another mode (translation), but this is not directly of interest here.\nNOTE 2:\tThe TA \"knows\" the type of an incoming call (whether it is voice, data, fax, whatever), and certain POTS events cannot occur. Hence some standard result codes for indication of events and discrimination of call type are unnecessary.\nThere are three possible levels of service:\n-\ta TA supporting level A performs the following operations and detects the following events: audio transmit, audio receive, DTMF detection, DTMF generation and single tone generation. The following indications are supported:\nEvent\tDescription\t\tHandset state\n3\tring\t\tidle\n4\tDTMF received\tidle\n5\treceive buffer overrun\treceive\n6\tunsolicited fax request\tidle\n8\tphone on/off hook\tidle\n9\tpresumed hangup\treceive\n10\tpresumed end of message\treceive\n18\tringback\t\tidle\n19\tbusy\t\tidle\n23\tplayback buffer underrun\ttransmit\n25\tfax or data request acknowledged\tidle\n-\ta TA supporting level B performs the operations and events of level A, and also supports DTMF detection while in the transmit state.\n-\ta TA supporting level C performs the operations and events of level B, and also supports double DTMF tone generation.\nSince DTMF detection and generation cannot be guaranteed over current digital networks, it follows that none of the three levels of service can be supported.\n",

An integer <n> different than zero implies a time of <n>/10 seconds. A value of zero disables the timer.\nTable C.7: +VIT parameter command syntax\n\n",
