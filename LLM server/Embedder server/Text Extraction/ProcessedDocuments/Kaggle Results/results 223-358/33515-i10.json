If there is a mismatch, the SMF sends its locally stored UE's UP security policy of the corresponding PDU sessions to the target gNB. This UP security policy information, if included by the SMF, is delivered to the target ng-eNB/gNB in the Path-Switch Acknowledge message. The SMF logs capabilities for this event and may take additional measures, such as raising an alarm.\nThreat References: TR 33.926 [4], clause J.2.2.4, Unchecked UP security policy.\nTEST CASE:\nTest Name: TC_UP_SECURITY_POLICY _SMF\nPurpose:\nVerify that the SMF checks the UP security policy that is sent by the ng-eNB/gNB during handover.\nPre-Conditions:\nThe SMF under test is preconfigured with a UE UP security policy.\nExecution\n1. The tester sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request message to the SMF under test. A UE UP security policy different than the one preconfigured at the SMF under test is included in the Request message.\n2. The tester captures the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message sent from the SMF under test.\nExpected Results:\nThe preconfigured UE security policy is contained in the ‘n2SmInfo’ IE in the captured Response message.\nExpected format of evidence:\nFiles containing the triggered HTTP messages (e.g. pcap trace).\nRequirement Name: Charing ID uniqueness.\nRequirement Reference: TS 32.255 [6], clause 5.1.2\nRequirement Description: According to TS 32.255 [6], clause 5.1.2:\n-\tThe SMF supports PDU session charging using service based interface.\n-\tThe SMF collects charging information per PDU session for UEs served under 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.\n- Every PDU session is assigned a unique identity number for billing purposes per PLMN. (i.e. the Charging Id).\nThreat Reference: TR 33.926 [4], clause J.2.2.3, \"Failure to assign unique Charging ID for a session\"\nTEST CASE:\nTest Name: TC_CHARGING_ID_UNIQUENESS_SMF\nPurpose:\nVerify that the charging ID generated by the SMF for each PDU session is unique.\nPre-Conditions:\nTest environment is set up with a Charging Function (CHF), which may be real or simulated, and the SMF under test. The tester is able to capture the traffic between the SMF under test and the CHF.\nExecution Step\n1)\tThe tester intercepts the traffic between the SMF under test and the CHF.\n2)\tThe tester triggers the establishment of the maximum number of concurrent PDU sessions that the SMF under test can handle.\n3)\tThe tester captures each Charging Data Request [initial] sent from the SMF under test to the CHF, and verifies the charging ID contained in the ‘PDU Session Charging Information’ IE in each Charging Data Request [initial] is unique.\nExpected Results:\nThe charging ID in each Charging Data Request [initial] is unique.\nExpected format of evidence:\nFiles containing the Charging Data Request [initial] messages (e.g. pcap trace).\n",
