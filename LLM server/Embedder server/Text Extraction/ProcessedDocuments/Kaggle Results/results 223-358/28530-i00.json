The SLS may contain service requirements that should be used for performance monitoring, configuration and some service requirement attributes may influence the dimensioning of new network slices and network slice subnets.\nThe fulfilment of the performance requirements in the service profile and slice profile is monitored by KPIs.\nConfigured attributes in the service profile and slice profile may be enforced by the 3GPP system, or their fulfillment monitored by the management system, e.g. for charging reasons.\nNetwork slice data may be exposed to the customer.\nThe next generation 3GPP management system is expected to support the management of 3GPP 5G system and 3GPP legacy systems.\n3GPP management system directly manages 3GPP managed network components (e.g. 5G RAN, 5G CN).

For example, a network slice customer can also play the role of NOP and could build their own network containing the network slice obtained from the CSP as a \"building block\". In this model, both CSP offering NSaaS and CSC consuming NSaaS have the knowledge of the existence of network slices. Depending on service offering, CSP offering NSaaS may impose limits on the NSaaS management capabilities exposure to the CSC, and the CSC can manage the network slice according to NSaaS management capabilities exposed and agreed upon limited level of management by the CSP.\nThe NSaaS offered by the CSP could be characterized by certain properties (capabilities to satisfy service level requirements), e.g.\n- \tradio access technology,\n-\t bandwidth,\n- \tend-to-end latency,\n-\t reliability,\n- \tguaranteed / non-guaranteed QoS,\n- \tsecurity level, etc.\nFigure 4.1.6.1 illustrates some examples on how network slices can be utilized to deliver communication services, including network slice as a Service.

In this case, CSC-A plays the role of NOP-B and builds his own network. The network slice obtained by CSC-A from CSP-A becomes a \"building block\" or a network slice subnet of CSC-A in its role of NOP-B. The NOP-B (a.k.a.
