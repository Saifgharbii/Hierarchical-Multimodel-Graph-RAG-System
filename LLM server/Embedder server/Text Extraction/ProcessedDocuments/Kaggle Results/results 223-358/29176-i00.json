The consumer NF may also include application function (e.g. DCSF, DC AS) specification information requested by the application layer to be applied on the media by the MF.\n\nThe NF service consumer shall request a new context by using HTTP method POST with \"{apiRoot}/nmf/<apiVersion>/contexts\" as resource URI representing the \"Contexts Collection\", see clause 6.1.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a media context, specifically a 2.2.2.2-1 network, which is a crucial component in the creation of a media context. This network is designed to support various media services, such as video, audio, and data, and is essential for the smooth functioning of a media context. The network is composed of various components, including routers, switches, and network devices, which work together to ensure the efficient delivery of media content. The figure also highlights the importance of network security, as it is crucial to protect the network from potential threats and ensure the smooth operation of media services. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the 2.2.2.2-1 network and its components, highlighting its importance in the creation of a media context.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1 Creation of a media context\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create an \"Individual Context\" resource in the MF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a representation of the individual context resource to be created.\nThe NF service consumer shall include list of termination descriptors in the HTTP message body. Each termination descriptor shall include list of media stream descriptors. Each media stream descriptor shall include:\n-\tMedia ID, i.e. a unique identity of the media stream within the media context instance;\n-\tRemote Mb specifications, i.e. the media stream IP address and port allocated at the remote endpoint, i.e. remote UE, remote network.\n-\tMedia resource description, which includes\n1)\tMedia resource type, e.g. DC, AR.\n2)\tIf media resource type is set to \"DC\", the DC media specification shall be included. The DC media specification shall include:\na)\tData Channel Mapping and Configuration information when originating/terminating data channel media flows on the Mb interface. It shall include the SCTP stream Id for the DC, and may include subprotocol, order, maxRetry, maxTime and priority may be included.\nb)\tMaximum Message Size, which represents the maximum size to be expected.\nc)\tData Channel Port, which represents the port of SCTP port for the Data Channel.\nd)\tSecurity Setup, which identifies the security setup of the DTLS connection.\ne)\tSecurity Certificate Fingerprint, which identifies the security certificate fingerprint.\nf\tSecurity Transport Identity, which identifies transport layer identity.\nFor establishing bootstrap data channel or P2A/A2P application data channel, the following parameters shall be included:\na)\tmedia proxy configuration applicable to the media flow;\nb)\tremote MDC1/MDC2 media specification information to be applied on the media by the MF;\nc)\tReplacement HTTP URL for each streamId allocated by the application layer representing the application list (e.g. graphical user interface) offered to the IMS subscriber via the MDC1 interface.\n3)\tIf media resource type is set to \"AR\", the AR media resource description shall be included, which includes:\na)\tMedia processing specification.\n2a.\tUpon the reception of the HTTP POST request, if the request is accepted and no error occur, the MF shall:\n-\tcreate a new media context;\n-\tassign a media contextId;\n-\tassign a terminationId for each termination descriptor; and\n-\treserve media resources for each mediaId.\nThe MF shall include a HTTP Location header to provide the location of a newly created resource (MediaContext) together with the status code 201 indicating the requested resource is created in the response message.\n2b.\tOn failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.\nOn redirection, the MF shall include 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint to another MF (service) instance.\n\nThe Nmf_MRM_Update service operation is used by an NF service consumer to update one or multiple existing media resources within a specific media context on MF. Terminations and/or Medias can be added, modified, or deleted within an Update request.\nThe NF Service Consumer shall modify the context by using HTTP method PATCH with the URI \"{apiRoot}/nmf/<apiVersion>/contexts/{contextId}\" as resource URI representing the \"Individual Context \", see clause 6.1.3.3.\n\nThe figure depicts a media context with various elements such as a user, a media, and a media context. The user is positioned at the center, while the media is located at the bottom. The media context is situated at the bottom right corner.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.2-1 Update a media context\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a PATCH request to modify a context resource in the MF. The modification may be for adding, updating or deleting terminations of the existing media context.\nFor adding, removing or updating a termination in an existing MediaContext, the payload body of the PATCH request shall contain an \"add\", \"remove\" or \"replace\" PATCH operation respectively, with one item of the attribute \"terminations\" of the MediaContext.\n2a.\tOn success, if the change is to delete the existing termination and MF accepts the request change, the MF shall return the status code 204 No Content.\n2b. On success, if the change is to add a new termination or to update the existing termination and DCMF accepts the request change, the MF shall return the status code 200 OK. The response shall contain the new resource representation of the resource Individual Context, which includes the added and modified resource or its sub-resource.\n2c\tOn failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3 indicating the error shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.\nOn redirection, the MF shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint to another MF (service) instance.\n\nThe Nmf_MRM_Delete service operation is used by an NF service consumer to delete an existing media context including all existing terminations and medias on MF previously created by itself.\nThe NF Service Consumer shall delete an existing context by using HTTP method DELETE with the URI \"{apiRoot}/nmf/<apiVersion>/contexts/{contextId}\" as resource URI representing the \"Individual Context \", see clause 6.1.3.3.\nThe figure depicts a media context with a 2.2.4.2 IP address, indicating that the media context is a part of a larger network. The IP address is a crucial component in network management, allowing network administrators to track and manage the network's resources.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.2-1 Delete a media context\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing context resource in the MF.\n2a.\tOn success, the request is accepted, the MF shall reply with the status code 204 No Content indicating the resource identified by context ID is successfully deleted in the response message.\n2b.\tOn failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.2-3 indicating the error shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.2-3.\nOn redirection, the MF shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint to another MF (service) instance.\n\n",
