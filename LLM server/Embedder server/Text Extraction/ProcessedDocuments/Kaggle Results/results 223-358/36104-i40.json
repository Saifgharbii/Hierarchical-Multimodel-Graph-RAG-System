Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and Operating band unwanted emissions. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink operating band plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.\nFor a BS supporting multi-carrier or intra-band contiguous CA, the unwanted emissions requirements apply to channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier larger than or equal to 5 MHz.\nThere is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.\n",

                            "text_content": "Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band.\nThe requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification. In addition, for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.\nFor BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are not applicable.\nFor a BS supporting E-UTRA with NB-IoT guard band operation, the Operating band unwanted emissions requirements apply to E-UTRA carrier with channel bandwidth larger than or equal to 5 MHz.\nThe unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [2].\nEmissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables below, where:\n-\tf is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink operating band.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor E-UTRA or  E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band) BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with Wgap < 20 MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The minimum requirement for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Tables 6.6.3.1-1 to 6.6.3.3-3 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in other supported operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as defined in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (fmax), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted. And no cumulative limit is applied in the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted.\nFor a multicarrier E-UTRA BS or BS configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified frequency band.\nIn addition inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The minimum requirement for each sub block is specified in Tables 6.6.3.1-1 to 6.6.3.3-3 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n\nFor Wide Area BS, the requirements of either clause 6.6.3.1 (Category A limits) or clause 6.6.3.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.\nFor Local Area BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.3.2A shall apply (Category A and B).\nFor Home BS, the requirements of clause .2B shall apply (Category A and B).\nFor Medium Range BS, the requirements in clause 6.6.3.2C shall apply (Category A and B).\nThe application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in clause 6.6.4.1.\nThe requirements of clauses 6.6.3.1 and 6.6.3.2 apply to Wide Area BS that supports E-UTRA or  E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band).

The requirements for Local Area BS that supports NB-IoT standalone are in clause 6.6.3.2F.\nThe requirements of clauses 6.6.3.2B apply to Home BS that supports E-UTRA or  E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band). The requirements for Home BS that supports NB-IoT standalone are in clause 6.6.3.2G.\nThe requirements of clauses 6.6.3.2C apply to Medium Range BS that supports E-UTRA or  E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band).

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, this exclusion applies for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the multi-band exclusions and provisions are not applicable. Exceptions are the requirements in Table 6.6.4.3.1-2, Table 6.6.4.3.1-3, and specifically stated exceptions in Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 that apply also closer than 10 MHz from the downlink operating band and Table 6.6.4.3.1-1a that applies inside the downlink operating band.

It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table 6.6.4.2-1.\nTable 6.6.4.2-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of the BS receiver\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS downlink operating band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.3.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nAdditional co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.4.3.1-1a may apply for some regions.\nTable .3.1-1a: BS Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with systems operating in Band 46\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.4.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements.

Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable .3.1-1A assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor E-UTRA Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 5:\tFor E-UTRA Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and 10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-2: E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with PHS\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Bands 13, 14 and 103 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-3: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-4: Void\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band 26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-5: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 41 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable .3.1-6: Additional E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 41\n\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 30 in certain regions.

The regional requirements may be in the form of conducted power, power spectral density, EIRP and other types of limits. In case of regulatory limits based on EIRP, assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H.\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 48 and Band 49 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-8: Additional E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 48 and Band 49\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to BS operating in Band 54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.4.3.1-9 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,B54,a, PEM,B54,b, PEM,B54,c, PEM,B54,d, PEM,B54,e and PEM,B54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.4.3.1-9: Declared Band 54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with an E-UTRA BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nThe requirements of clause 6.6.4.4 do not apply to base stations only supporting LTE based 5G terrestrial broadcast.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 for a Wide Area BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.4.4.1-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for Wide Area BS co-located with another BS\n\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table .4.1-2 for a Local Area BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-2 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-2 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable .4.1-2: BS Spurious emissions limits for Local Area BS co-located with another BS\n\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 for a Medium Range BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.4.4.1-3: BS Spurious emissions limits for Medium range BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [8].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 assume that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nFor LTE based 5G terrestrial broadcast base stations operating in band 107 or 108, the transmitter spurious emission requirements are according to regional regulations, as captured in Annex A.2.3 TR 36.972 [30].\n\n",

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 7 shall be met with the transmitter(s) on. If any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).\nNOTE:\tIn normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter may be off for some of the tests as specifed in 36.141 [4].\nUnless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the base station receive period.\nThe figure depicts a set of test ports used for receiver testing in a 5G network. These ports are crucial for ensuring the proper functioning of the receiver equipment, as they allow for the testing of signal quality, interference, and other performance metrics. The presence of these test ports indicates the importance of receiver testing in the overall 5G network testing process.\nFigure 7.1: Receiver test ports\nThe throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.\nWhen the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier. For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge and positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\nNOTE:\tRequirements may only be supported for certain frequency ranges within the operating band(s).

The layered design aligns with SDN principles. at the reference signal subcarriers  are obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every third subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19. For reference subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the window size is reduced accordingly as per figure E.6-1.\n4.\tPerform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients  and  to compute coefficients ,  for each subcarrier.\nThe figure depicts a reference subcarrier smoothing technique in the frequency domain, illustrating how it is used to reduce the impact of noise on the signal. The technique involves the use of a reference subcarrier, which is a subcarrier that is not being modulated, to smooth out the signal. This helps to improve the signal quality and reduce interference.\nFigure E.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain\n",

These cases can be applied on a per-channel and/or per-region basis, i.e. for the same channel different cases can be applied in different geographic areas (e.g. area related to DTT coverage) and different cases can be applied to different channels in the same geographic area.\nFor band 20, compliance with the regulatory requirements in Europe referenced above can be assessed based on the manufacturer's declaration of PEM,N specified in clause 6.6.3.3, together with the deployment characteristics. Maximum output Power in 10 MHz (P10MHz) is also declared by the manufacturer. The parameters Gant and Nant are deployment specific parameters related to the deployment of the BS, where Gant is the antenna gain and Nant is the number of antennas.\nFor each channel (N) the EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP,N = PEM,N + Gant  + 10*log(Nant ). The regulatory requirement in [12] limits the EIRP level to the Maximum level in Table G-1 for the protection case(s) defined in the regulation.\nTable G-1: EIRP limits for protection of broadcasting (DTT) service\n\n",
