The TS/TR related to KQI will be listed here as the basis of the study.\nIn TR 21.905 [1], no definition or abbreviation of KQI is provided.\nTR 32.862 [2] gives a description of KQI and some related survey on that:\n- The introduction of Key Quality Indicators (KQIs), which reflect the end-to-end service performance and quality, could be used to better represent real customer experience. NGMN NGCOR has defined principles for KQIs which could be used to evaluate the customer experience for fixed and mobile networks. It is proposed that SA5 takes the responsibility to study how to standardize the related service KQIs providing a standardised common base for end-to-end measurements and to fulfil the NGCOR requirements.\n- The intention of KQI for the service experience is to try to reflect the customer experience with indicators reflecting them for example how many stalls occur while watching a movie, time delay before seeing the first screen of a movie. With this information, KQI could closely reflect the customer experience. The KPIs defined in the current specifications, e.g. TS 32.450, are not differentiated by services, they only measure the bearer.\nETSI GS F5G 005 [3] gives a description of KQI:\nThe Key Quality Indicators (KQI) are composed by the QoS metrics, which have the largest impact on QoE, namely\nuser centric and service specific quality patterns that directly influence the user perception for each service category.\nQoS is a measure of the performance of networked services at the network or application level. QoS also refers to a set\nof techniques that enable the network administrator to manage the network performance differentiating between\ndifferent users. QoS metrics may include network layer measurements such as packet loss, delay or jitter or application\nlevel measurements such as video frame loss, frame freezing, image distortion.\nThere are some studies related to KQIs, or relevant to, 5G service experience, with below a list of related ITU-T Recommendations and other output documents such as Technical Reports by ITU-T SG12, as well as work items under study.\nThere are also the different prediction models for speech and video quality available from SG12’s work (e.g. P.1201, P.1202, P.1203, P.1204 for video), which can directly provide KQI related information.\nList of related in-force ITU-T Recommendations and Technical Reports are given according to video streaming and cloud VR:\nVideo streaming related documents:\n–\tITU-T Y.1540 [4]: Internet protocol data communication service - IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters\n–\tITU-T P.1201 [5]: Parametric non-intrusive assessment of audiovisual media streaming quality\n–\tITU-T P.1202 [6]: Parametric non-intrusive bitstream assessment of video media streaming quality\n–\tITU-T P.1203 [7]: Parametric bitstream-based quality assessment of progressive download and adaptive audiovisual streaming services over reliable transport\n–\tITU-T P.1204 [8]: Video quality assessment of streaming services over reliable transport for resolutions up to 4K\n–\tITU-T GSTR-5GQoE [9]: Study of existing QoE requirements for 5G services\n–\tITU-T P.10/G.100 (11/2017) [10]: Vocabulary for performance and quality of service.\nCloud VR related documents:\n–\tITU-T G.1035 [11]: Influencing factors on quality of experience for virtual reality services\nConsented draft ITU-T Recommendations:\n–\tDraft ITU-T P.1320 (ex P.QXM) [12]: QoE assessment of eXtended Reality (XR) meetings\n–\tDraft ITU-T G.1036 (ex G.QoE-AR) [13]: Quality of experience (QoE) influencing factors for augmented reality (AR) services\n–\tDraft ITU-T G.QoE-VR (G.QoE-VR) [14] \"Influencing Factors on Quality of Experience (QoE) for Virtual Reality Services\" (for consent)\nCloud VR related documents:\n–\tITU-T SG 9 TD 896-GEN [15]: \"Output - Draft New Recommendation J.

The new services of video uploading (uplink media streaming), URLLC and cloud VR have requirements e.g. related to latency, reliability and UL throughput for 5G networks or the combination of them. The metrics of network performance are defined as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the 5G network, defined in TS28.554 [17]. However, it is not enough to only define separate network performance indicators. The ultimate goal of network management of services is to provide a good service experience to the user. Network resources are limited. Only focusing on the network management may not ensure optimal service experience. User experience-driven management may be enabled with key quality indicators (KQIs) which are used to better represent a user’s experience.\nKQIs are important for service management. In user experience-driven management, KQIs may be used to propose service management objectives and express experience optimization requirements. Experience optimization requirements may be mapped to the network, and are ultimately achieved through network resource assurance and network performance optimization.\nKQI (Key Quality Indicator): An indicator which reflects the end-to-end service experience as perceived by the end user. It may be derived from a combination network layer measurements, service layer measurements and includes qualitative as well as quantitative components.\nTS 28.554 [17] specifies end-to-end Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the 5G network and network slicing.\nKQI (Key Quality Indicator) is defined to be a measure of the experience perceived by the user.\nIn ITU-T P.10/G.100 [10] the definition of QoE is given:\nQuality of experience (QoE)\nThe degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or service.\nQoE is defined as the degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or service. It includes the complete end-to-end system effects (client, terminal, network, services infrastructure, etc.) and may be influenced by user expectations and context.\nFrom the above definition of QoE we see that QoE is an overall value to reflect the degree of the user experience.\nThere are also measurements in SA4 that may be used to estimate QoE. These measurements are collected by the client and may be reported to the OAM or QoE server in the QoE metrics reporting. How to make use of these QoE metrics is not specified. One difference is that the QoE measurements are collected from the client side for all of the aspects of the media e.g. the buffer, play list, MPD information besides network aspects. KQIs may be calculated from KPIs, or calculated based on some of the collected QoE metrics. QoE metrics may be one component of KQI.\n",

In these scenarios, a large number of videos are captured and uploaded to the server and are required to be low latency and High-definition. There are various requirements for the service experience of video uploading. For example, real-time video transmission is required in industrial control scenarios such as ports and mines, which requires short video transmission delay; in addition, for transmission of high-definition video, the high video transmission rate is required.\nKQIs for video uploading is important for the management: In user experience-driven management, KQIs are used to declare management objectives of video uploading and indicate whether user experience need to be optimized.\n",

Packet loss greatly degrades the quality of multimedia content because in the event of a packet loss containing an I-frame, all subsequent frames depending on that frame will be lost, which may cause frame blocking, and video output stall. During packet loss measurement, packet loss is classified into average packet loss ratio measurement and burst packet loss ratio measurement.

Real-time interactive services are mainly small-packet transmission services, which do not require network bandwidth but require ultra-low latency. For industrial-grade URLLC services, too big delay may cause service failures instead of performance problems. Therefore, it is important to analyze the delay and the delay fulfillment boundary.\nFurthermore, the packet loss is also an important factor to be considered. As URLLC refers to “ultra-reliability” and packet loss is one of the most important factors to reflect reliability. If the packet loss rate is too high, the control instruction fails. Therefore, the packet loss rate and the threshold of the packet loss rate need to be considered when defining the quality indicator for the service.\n",

It applies to scenarios such as VR games, VR 360-degree video, VR live broadcast, giant-screen cinema, and VR education. With fast and stable transport networks, VR content is stored and rendered in the cloud, and video and audio outputs are coded, compressed, and transmitted to user terminals. The large-scale deployment of Cloud VR services requires the joint effort from the enterprises to address E2E quality management and monitoring. Therefore, the development of measurable and manageable key quality indicators will be a key basis for operator to ensure the satisfaction of consumers. There are already some standards for studying the KQIs for Cloud VR. In this clause, the background and the use case of the KQI of the cloud VR are provided.\nIt describes the service indicators based on the experience evaluation factors of VR in ITU SG9-TD896 GEN, the experience evaluation factors of VR include sense of reality, interaction, and pleasure. The sense of reality depends on resolution, colour depth, frame rate, and encoding compression technologies. Cloud VR implements computing and rendering on the cloud, any latency from remote processing compromises the sense of immersion and imagination. The sense of pleasure depends on the smoothness of VR services.\nThe Cloud VR includes the service indicators:\nTable 4.5.1.2.1-1: Service indicators\n\nIn ITU SG12 G.QoE-VR, it describes that the VR QoE is assessed by the level of immersion provided by the VR system combined with the quality of the interaction between the user and the VR environment, and the level of immersion can be determined by the quality of the immersive media and the presentation quality delivered by the device. It also summarizes some key influences factors that impact quality of the immersive media, presentation quality, and interaction quality.\nIt includes the key influences factors:\nTable 4.5.1.2.2-1: Service indicators\n\nStalling is an important indicator for end users to perceive the smoothness of streaming media when using Cloud VR services (e.g. VR games). In the process of VR video, there will be a certain amount of buffer. Because the download rate of the network is not enough to meet the output requirements of video coding quality, there will be no data in the buffer for playback, which will cause stalling and affect the end users’ experience. Therefore, This KQI is of great importance to estimate the service quality.\n",

GST attributes are used by 3GPP as inputs to network slice Network Resource Model (NRM) ServiceProfle and then further translated into relevant attributes of constituted network slice subnets SliceProfile (i.e. 5GC SliceProfile and NG-RAN SliceProfile) and TN requirements, and finally, being translated into different 5G domain configuration parameters (i.e. 5GC domain and NG-RAN domain). The related service performance requirements (ServiceProfile) given in 3GPP are SLS requirements.\n\nSLS requirements are used between the CSC and the CSP: The CSC provides the SLS requirements for an assured communication service to the CSP, the CSP provides the corresponding communication service. The CSP also provides feedback to the CSC.\nThe goal of a CSP is to meet service experience requirements. KQI reflects the end-to-end service experience as perceived by the end user.
