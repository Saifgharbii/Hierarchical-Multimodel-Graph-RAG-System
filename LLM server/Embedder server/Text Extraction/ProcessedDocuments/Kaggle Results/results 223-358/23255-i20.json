The figure includes various components such as the C2 node, C1 node, and the network interface controller (NICA), which are essential for managing the communication between the two nodes.\nFigure 7.4.2.1-1: C2 operation mode management request / response\n1.\tThe UAS application specific server sends to the UAE Server a C2 operation mode management request for managing the operation modes for the C2 communication for a UAS (consisting a UAV and a UAV-C) and to subscribe for UAE notifications. If ProSE/PC5 is supported for direct C2 communications, such request may also include a C2 direct mode availability reporting requirement including the ProSe configuration information for direct C2 operation, the UAV and UAV-C IDs and addresses, and the time and area for which the monitoring of availability will apply.\n2.\tThe UAE Server sends to the UAS application specific server a C2 operation mode management response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request, based on capability of UAE server to undertake this task.\n3.\tUAE server executes C2 communication modes configuration according to clause 7.4.2.2.\n4.\tAfter execution of C2 communication modes configuration, the UAE server notifies the UAS application specific server with a C2 operation mode management complete.\nThis procedure enables the configuration of the UAE Client, based on an application request from UAS application specific server (which can be the USS/UTM) to manage the C2 operation modes (direct, network-assisted) of C2 communication for a UAS.\nFigure 7.4.2.2-1 illustrates the C2 communication modes configuration procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe UAS UEs are connected to 5GS and authenticated and authorized by UAS application specific server as specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [4].\n2.\tUAE Server has established a UAE session with the respective UAE Clients as the UAE clients are successfully registered to the UAE server.\n3.\tUAE Server has performed the C2 mode switching/selection capability initiation as in clause 7.4.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a configuration of C2 communication modes, which are used for data transmission in a 5G network. The diagram illustrates the various communication paths, including the use of different modulation schemes and the presence of multiple antennas at the base station (gNB) and user equipment (UE). The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing functions (NSF) in managing network resources and ensuring efficient communication.\nFigure 7.4.2.2-1: C2 communication modes configuration\n1.\tThe UAE Server sends a C2 communication modes configuration request including the UAS identifier, allowed C2 communication modes (e.g., direct, network assisted, UTM-Navigated), primary and optionally secondary C2 communication mode and policy for switching.

The figure illustrates the switching process, with the C2 mode being activated when the network needs to switch to a different mode. The UAE's network is shown to be equipped with advanced technology, such as the use of dynamic C2 mode, to ensure efficient and reliable network operations.\nFigure 7.4.2.4-1: UAE-assisted dynamic C2 mode switching\n1.\tThe UAE Client detects a condition for switching C2 communication mode based on local conditions (e.g. using the C2 communication mode switching policy) or based on a command from the UAS application specific server (as described in clause 7.4.2.5). A C2-related trigger event report is sent from the UAE Client of the UAV and/or the UAV-C to the UAE Server, denoting a command from the UAS application specific server or an application QoS attribute change (experienced or expected) e.g. based on the experienced packet delay or packet loss for the Uu or direct link (e.g. packet loss greater than a pre-defined threshold).\nIf a C2 direct mode availability reporting requirement exists based on clause 7.4.2.1 step 1, the detection of UAV/UAV-C(s) can be based on the PC5 discovery due to the configurations received due procedures in clause 7.4.2.1 and clause 7.4.2.2. In this case, the C2-related trigger event report message can include also a C2 direct mode availability report including PC5 related configuration information.\n2.\tAdditionally, the UAE Server receives a location report for the UAV/UAV-C by the SEAL's LM server. The report can be either periodical or event-based (e.g. UAV moving towards an area covered by a different cell or different operator), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5] SEAL's LM server procedures (UAE Server acting as a VAL server).\n3.\tThe UAE Server determines the switching of the C2 mode from direct to network assisted or vice versa or to UTM-Navigated. If the switching is from direct to network assisted or vice versa, this is done by calculating the relative actual or expected UAV-to-UAV-C location, as well as other factors like QoS fulfilment/unfulfilment, augmented location, mobility/speed, direction, topography, weather conditions.\n4.\tThe UAE Server sends a C2 mode switching confirmation request to the UAS application specific server, which includes the UAS identifier as well as the cause for switching and the switching option (direct to network-assisted or network-assisted to direct or to UTM-Navigated). The UAE Server sends this request to obtain confirmation from the UAS application specific server before proceeding with switching to UTM-Navigated. This step is optional in the case of switching from direct to network assisted or vice versa.\n5.\tConditional on Step 3, the UAE Server receives from the UAS application specific server a C2 mode switching confirmation response indicating a positive or negative result for the requested change.\n6.\tThe UAE Server sends to the involved UAE Clients, a C2 operation mode switching message which provides an instruction to the UAV and UAV-C to switch to network-assisted mode or to direct mode or to UTM-Navigated. The UAV and UAV-C start C2 communication using the indicated C2 communication mode (e.g., direct, network assisted, UTM-Navigated).\n7.\tIf an emergency switch of the C2 communication is deemed necessary by the UAE Client (e.g. sudden loss of the active C2 link), the UAE Client changes the link prior to the steps 1-6, which are skipped. The UAE Clients send a C2 operation mode switching performed message to the UAE Server to confirm the switching of the C2 communication mode.\nThis procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic switching between direct or network assisted C2 communications to UTM-Navigated, initiated by the UAS application specific server (which can be the USS/UTM) after detecting a C2 switching condition which may be required while the UAV enters a no-fly zone. For example, the UAS application specific server needs to take over the control of UAV and fly it to safety (see 3GPP TS 22.125 [2] clause 4.2).\nFigure 7.4.2.5-1 illustrates a UAS application specific server triggered C2 communication mode switching.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tUAE Server has activated the dynamic C2 mode switching capability, as described in clause 7.4.2.1.\n2.\tUAE Client has selected a primary C2 communication mode as described in clause 7.4.2.3, and UAV and UAV-C are engaged in (e.g., direct or network assisted) C2 communication.\nThe figure depicts a UAS application-specific server triggering communication mode switching in a 4.2.5-1 network. The server is connected to a C2 communication mode switch, which enables the server to switch between different communication modes. This feature is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable communication in a network.\nFigure 7.4.2.5-1: UAS application specific server triggered C2 communication mode switching\n1.\tThe UAS application specific client is instructed directly by a command from the UAS application specific server to switch to UTM-Navigated mode.\nNOTE:\tThis procedure between the UAS application specific server and the UAS application specific client is out of scope of the present document.\n2.\tThe UAE Client initiates the procedure described in clause 7.4.2.4.\n",

The diagram illustrates the hierarchical structure of the USS management process, with each protocol represented by a different color and symbol. The figure also includes a flowchart to illustrate the sequence of actions and decisions taken during the USS management process.\nFigure 7.6.2.1-1: Multi-USS management procedure\n1.\tThe UAS application specific server sends to the UAE server a Multi-USS management request. The request includes the UAV (UAE client) identifier and the Multi-USS policies. A Multi-USS policy contains: allowed target USSes (identified by e.g. FQDN), serving USS information, and additional information for change of USS (USS change constraints parameter geo location/area threshold for change of USS by UAV). The UAE server stores the Multi-USS policies corresponding to the UAV ID. In case of removal of a Multi-USS policy for a USS from the UAE server, the request shall include the UAV identifier and a USS identifier (e.g. FQDN) for the USS that will be removed.\n2.\tThe UAE server sends to the UAS application specific server a Multi-USS management response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request.\n3.\tUAE server executes the multi-USS configuration according to clause 7.6.2.2.\n4.\tAfter execution of USS management configuration, the UAE server notifies the UAS application specific server with a Multi-USS management complete based on the configured capabilities of the UAE client.\nThis procedure enables the configuration of the UAE client, based on a request from UAS application specific server to configure multi-USS policies to the UAE client.\nFigure 7.6.2.2-1 illustrates the Multi-USS configuration procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe UAS UEs are connected to 5GS and authenticated and authorized by UAS application specific server as specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [4].\n2.\tUAE server has established a UAE session with the respective UAE clients as the UAE clients are successfully registered to the UAE server.\n3.\tUAE server has performed the Multi-USS management procedure according to clause 7.6.2.1.\n\nThe figure depicts a multi-USS configuration, which is a crucial aspect of network architecture. It illustrates the various types of user equipment (UE) and the way they are connected to the base station (gNB). The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy in ensuring network reliability.\nFigure 7.6.2.2-1: Multi-USS configuration\n1.\tThe UAE server sends a Multi-USS configuration request to the UAE client. The UAE client receives a Multi-USS configuration request that includes the Multi-USS policies from the UAE server. In case of removal of one or more Multi-USS policies for a USS from the UAE client, then the request shall only include a USS identifier (e.g. FQDN) for the USSes that will be removed.\n2.\tThe UAE client stores or removes the Multi-USS policies as per the information received in step 1.\n3.\tThe UAE client sends a Multi-USS configuration response to the UAE server.\nThis procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic change of USS which may be performed while the UAV flight is ongoing, due to expected location/mobility of the UAV, emergency events, etc.\nFigure 7.6.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the change of USS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tUAE client has indicated support of change of USS by the Multi-USS capability.\n2.\tUAS application specific server has provided Multi-USS policies to the UAE client and the UAE server.\n\nThe figure depicts a 6.2.3 layer assisted change of USS in the UAE, illustrating the process of network transformation and the use of network virtualization (NUVA) to enhance network performance and efficiency.\nFigure 7.6.2.3-1: UAE layer assisted change of USS\n1.\tThe UAE server receives a USS change request from a serving USS (UAS application specific server #1), indicating that a target USS (UAS application specific server #2) an take over the communication. The request includes the UAV (UAE client) identification information, target USS information and USS change authorization information (e.g. authorization token). Optionally, updated Multi-USS policies for one or more USSes can be included. The UAE server verifies that the request is authorized (e.g., Multi-USS capability is enabled, new USS part of the allowed USS information).\n2.\tIf required, the UAE server translates this to a UP path change and interacts with NEF as AF for influence UP path (switching to target DNAI). In particular UAE server (acting as AF) checks whether it can serve the target DNAI corresponding to the target USS based on the mapping of USS to DNAI which was performed in step 2 of clause 7.6.2.5. Interaction with 5GC is performed according to functionality for application function influence on traffic routing, see 3GPP TS 23.502 [13] clause 4.3.6.3.\n3.\tThe UAE server forwards the USS change request to the UAE client including target USS information and updated Multi-USS policies.\n4.\tPerform change of USS.\nThe UAE client initiates communication with the target USS based on the USS change request and the Multi-USS policies.\n5.\tThe UAE client sends a USS change response indicating to what USS the change of USS has been performed.\n6.\tThe UAE server sends a USS change response to the UAS application specific server indicating that a change of USS has been performed.\nThis procedure enables the UAE client to provide a dynamic change of USS while the UAV flight is ongoing, due to an emergency change of USS deemed necessary by the UAE client. The UAE client initiates the change of USS on behalf of the USS based on previously provided Multi-USS policy.\nFigure 7.6.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the change of USS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tUAE client has indicated support of change of USS by the Multi-USS capability.\n2.\tUAS application specific server has provided Multi-USS policies to the UAE client and the UAE server.\n\nThe figure depicts a client-assisted change of USS in the UAE, illustrating the process of changing the user's status on a USS. The figure includes a client, a USS, and a change of status button, all connected to a network. The client is connected to the USS, and the change of status button is used to change the user's status. The figure shows the process of changing the user's status on the USS, with the client and USS connected to the network.\nFigure 7.6.2.4-1: UAE client assisted change of USS\n1.\tAn emergency change of USS is deemed necessary by the UAE Client, and the UAE client initiates the change of USS on behalf of the USS based on previously provided Multi-USS policy.\n2.\tPerform change of USS. The UAE client initiates communication with the target USS (UAS application specific server #2) based on the previously provided Multi-USS policies.\n3.\tThe UAE client sends a USS change notification indicating to what USS the change of USS has been performed. The identity of the target USS (UAS application specific server #2) is included. The USS change notification is only sent if the UAE client has a connection to the UAE server.\n4.\tThe UAE server sends a USS change notification to the UAS application specific server #1 indicating that a change of USS has been performed.\nIn multi-USS scenarios, each USS can be physically located in different clouds, and it is also possible that a USS is deployed at the edge.\nFigure 7.6.2.5-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports change of USS for a multi-USS/LUN scenario, where the interaction with the communication network for supporting a UAS session requires the interaction to more than one USS e.g., due to UAV mobility to different geographical area covered by different edge clouds.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe UAV has performed the UAS UE registration procedure.\n-\tUAE client and UAE server have indicated multi-USS support.\nThe figure depicts a server-triggered change of the Unified Service Catalog (USC) in the UAE region. The USC is a central repository of service information, including details such as service names, descriptions, and pricing. The server-triggered change of the USC is a common occurrence in the IT industry, where changes to the USC are made to reflect changes in the service offerings or pricing. This change can be initiated by the server, which is responsible for managing the USC and ensuring that the information is up-to-date. The figure provides a visual representation of this process, showing the server's role in triggering the change and the subsequent actions taken by the system.\nFigure 7.6.2.5-1: UAE server triggered change of USS\n1.\tThe UAE server has performed the USS management procedure of clause 7.6.3.1; however, at the multi-USS management request, UAE server also receives from UAS application specific server the USS service areas (geographical) for all allowed USSs, and optionally the USS to DNAI mapping and a USS list per given Local USS network (LUN).\n2.\tThe UAE server maps each USS with different topological areas based on the USS to DNAI mapping (based on step 1), for all USSs which are allowed for a target area where the UAV is allowed to fly (e.g. within the LUN). Then it also maps and stores all pairs of <USS x, DNAI y> per LUN or for the areas of interest for the UAV (e.g., based on the allowable routes).\n3.\tThe UAE server tracks the location of the UAV, by requesting on-demand location monitoring from SEAL LMS (acting as VAL server in procedure of clause 9.3.4 or clause 9.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5]) or via subscribing for monitoring the UAV location deviation (specified in clause 9.3.11 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5]).\n4.\tThe UAE server detects an expected UAV location change to an area covered by a different USS (based on SEAL LMS monitoring subscription/request as in step 3), it generates a trigger event indicating that the UE moves to an area where the USS is overlapping with other USS, or another overlapping USS within LUN area is not available.\nIf it is an overlap, the UAE server checks whether the performance of serving USS is expected to get impacted (e.g., by requesting DN performance analytics for the target area) or if the serving USS is not supported at target area, checks what is the best available USS and whether this can provide the same services. The criteria for the best available USS may relate to the location of the UAV, but it can also be the priorities of the USS (based on the policies received) at the target area and the capabilities (services) provided by the target USS.\n5.\tThe UAE server sends to the UAS application specific server a USS change trigger notify indicating the recommendation for a USS change for the UAS and provides the target USS ID. Alternatively, the trigger message indicates a UAV mobility event, based on steps 3/4.\n6.\tThe UAS change procedure follows as specified in 7.6.2.3.\n",
