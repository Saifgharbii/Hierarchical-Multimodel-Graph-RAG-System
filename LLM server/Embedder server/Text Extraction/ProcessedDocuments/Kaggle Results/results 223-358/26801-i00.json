However, UEs featuring non-traditional earpieces may not feature a centre of an acoustic port raising the question of how to properly position a handset for testing. Therefore, an update to P.64 would be required for SA4 to reference this Recommendation also for handsets with non-traditional earpieces, if the present study is followed by normative work in 3GPP.\nSuch update to P.64 may describe how to specify a reference point for handsets where there are no acoustic outlets in the earpiece area of the handset.\nThis sub-clause suggests an alternative method for positioning the handset that is suitable for UEs featuring non-traditional earpieces.\nWithin the context of FS_HaNTE, the MECRP is defined in terms of distance from the upper edge of the handset (this is equivalent what is sometimes referred to as \"end stop\" for positioning fixtures) and the distance from a centre/symmetry line.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the MECRP (Model for End-to-End Communication in Heterogeneous Networks) for handsets in the Future Services on the Next Generation (FS_HaNTE) network. It illustrates the various components and their interactions, such as the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and network elements, to ensure efficient communication.

                            "text_content": "3GPP UE's Receive Frequency Response (RFR) and Receive Loudness Rating (RLR) are measured with Head and Torso Simulators (HATS). With traditional earpiece designs, the perceived loudness comes from acoustic radiation into the ear canal. With non-traditional earpieces, such as vibrating displays, sound may be transmitted to the user by other mechanisms (e.g. tissue conduction). Because HATS primarily measure acoustic radiation through the ear canal, one question is whether HATS is suitable for measurement of handsets featuring non-traditional earpieces.\nTo compare objective and subjective assessments of loudness on devices featuring a traditional and non-traditional earpiece (vibrating display), an experimental methodology was developed by the source.\nTwo handset prototypes were developed for this experiment. Prototype 1 incorporates a 27ohm 15x6 mm earpiece (traditional earpiece) radiating sound through an acoustic port on the display, and Prototype 2 incorporates an 8ohm 15x6mm actuator directly attached to the prototype display. Apart from this difference, both prototypes are identical. See Figure 4-3. Improved prototype acoustic sealing was achieved through an added layer of material at the bottom of the prototype screen and putty for screen fastening.\nThe figure depicts two prototypes of a wearable device, one with a traditional earpiece and the other with a vibrating display, which are designed to be worn on the ear and face respectively. The earpiece prototype is equipped with a microphone and speaker, while the vibrating display prototype features a touch-sensitive screen and a vibrating mechanism. These devices aim to provide a more immersive and interactive user experience, potentially enhancing communication and interaction in various real-world scenarios.\nFigure 4-3: Prototypes produced (one with traditional earpiece, other with vibrating display)\nHandsets were positioned on two HATS models for objective frequency response measurement. In both cases, the prototypes were positioned according to ITU-T Rec. P.64 (A = 21.2°, B = 12.9°, C = 2.3°) [4]. HATS 1 was a Bruel & Kjaer Type 5128 with Type 4606 Handset Positioner and Centering Fork UA-1537. HATS 2 was a Head Acoustics HMS II.3 artificial head with HHP III handset positions system. In both cases, the prototypes were mounted with End-Stop adjustment set to 17mm (MECRP defined as ye = 17mm, yz = 0mm). See Figure 4-4.\nThe figure depicts a handheld device, HATS 1 and HATS 2, with a focus on the positioning of the device on the two antennas of a 5G network. The device is positioned at a 45-degree angle, with the antennas facing the user, illustrating the importance of antenna selection and positioning in 5G networks.\nFigure 4-4: Handset positioned on HATS 1 and HATS 2\nNOTE:\tThe Bruel & Kjaer Type 5128 HATS does not comply with the current ITU-T Recommendations P.58 [3] and P.64 [4].\nTo drive Prototype 1 and Prototype 2, a personal computer (PC) was connected to an RME MADIface Pro USB digital audio interface. Prototype 1 was directly driven by the MADIface headphone output (Analog 3). Prototype 2 was driven by a Bruel & Kjaer Type 2716C amplifier with +12dB of gain which was in turn connected to the MADIface Analog 1 output.\nFor wideband objective measurements in clause 4.2.1.3.1 and band-passed level adjustment in clause 4.2.1.3.2, Adobe Audition was used for digital audio playback. For level adjusted measurements in clause 4.2.1.3.2 and the subjective loudness matching in clause 4.2.1.3.3, Max/MSP was used for digital audio playback. A Griffin Technology PowerMate USB Volume Knob was used to allow control of the playback level during subjective loudness matching. See Figure 4-5 for the block diagram.\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of a test apparatus for the experiment, illustrating the various components and their connections. The diagram includes a central block labeled \"Test Apparatus,\" which contains the main components such as the test fixture, test fixture controller, and test fixture power supply. The fixture is connected to the test fixture controller, which in turn is connected to the test fixture power supply.

The force was adjusted to 2N, 8N, 13N to span a range of mounting conditions. The measurements were accomplished by playing -18dBFS pink noise through the playback system described in clause 4.2.1.2.2 (using Adobe Audition for digital audio playback). The system playback gain was adjusted such that the acoustic sound pressure level was 79dBSPL at the Ear Reference Position (ERP) for Prototype 1 (traditional earpiece) mounted on HATS 1 (Bruel & Kjaer Type 5128) with a force of 8N. The same system gain was then used for Prototype 2 (non-traditional earpiece), HATS 2 (Head Acoustics HMS II.3), and all other mounting forces (2N and 13N). Figures 4-6a and 4-6b show the ERP level measurements in 3rd octave bands for all Prototype, HATS, and force conditions.\nThe figure depicts two prototypes of earpiece and actuator level on HATS 1, showcasing the design and functionality of the device. The earpiece level prototype is designed for a more comfortable fit, while the actuator level prototype is optimized for precise control and monitoring.\nFigure 4-6a: Earpiece level (Prototype 1) and Actuator level (Prototype 2) level on HATS 1\nThe figure depicts two prototypes of earpiece and actuator level on HATS 2, showcasing the design and functionality of the device. The earpiece level prototype features a microphone and speaker, while the actuator level prototype includes a control module and a motor. The figure illustrates the integration of these components, highlighting the importance of proper design and functionality in creating a reliable and user-friendly hearing aid.\nFigure 4-6b: Earpiece level (Prototype 1) and Actuator level (Prototype 2) level on HATS 2\nAttenuation at low frequencies (below 1.6kHz for HATS 1 and below 2kHz for HATS 2) is seen for both HATS and both prototypes as the application force is decreased from 13N to 2N. Table 4-4 presents the mean attenuation (200Hz-1.6kHz) between 13N and 2N of application force for all conditions. For both HATS, Prototype 1 demonstrates more low frequency leakage than Prototype 2 (~3dB). Furthermore, HATS 2 demonstrates more low frequency loss than HATS 1 independent of prototype (~4dB).\nTable 4-4: Mean attenuation (200Hz-1.6kHz) with varying application force\n\nBand-passed pink noise level calibration was accomplished by playing 1/3rd octave band-passed pink noise through the playback system described in clause 4.2.1.2.2 with Adobe Audition. The level of each noise band was adjusted to match roughly 79dBSPL at the Ear Reference Position (ERP) when Prototype 1 (traditional earpiece) was mounted with a force of 8N on HATS 1.\nAfter calibration, band-passed pink noise responses were measured through Max/MSP with both prototypes on both HATS using the level calibrated band-passed pink noise as stimuli. Figure 4-7 shows the ERP level measurements in each 1/3rd octave band for both prototypes on both HATS at 8N of force.\nThe figure depicts two prototypes of earpiece-level and actuator-level sensors on both HATS (Head-Mounted Displays) for enhanced audio quality and user experience. The earpiece-level sensors are designed to provide a more immersive audio experience by capturing the audio from the wearer's ears, while the actuator-level sensors are used to control the display's brightness and color settings. The prototypes are designed to be compact and lightweight, making them suitable for use in various applications.\nFigure 4-7: Band-passed Earpiece level (Prototype 1) and Actuator level (Prototype 2) on both HATS\nPrototype 1 was successfully calibrated to +/-1dB around a nominal level of 77dBSPL for all bands from 200Hz to 12.5kHz on HATS 1. The -2dB difference between the target level of 79dBSPL and achieved nominal level of 77dBSPL may be due to a software switch between Audition and Max/MSP for digital audio playback.\nThe relative level between Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 for each 3rd octave band is used as the objective transfer function in the following section. Figure 4-10 includes the transfer functions () computed for both HATS, where  and  are the 3rd octave band responses of Prototype 1 and 2, respectively.\nFor the subjective loudness matching, eight participants were tasked with comparing the perceived loudness of Prototypes 1 and 2 for each level adjusted, band-passed pink noise stimulus. Participants were asked to hold both handsets in a comfortable position. The test administrator ensured consistent positioning throughout the test. Figure 4-8 demonstrates a standard positioning for one subject.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of handset positioning during loudness matching in a 5G network. It illustrates the positioning of the handset relative to the base station (gNB) and the surrounding environment, with the handset's orientation and distance from the gNB being critical factors in the loudness matching process. The figure also highlights the importance of signal strength and noise levels in determining the loudness of the signal, and the use of beamforming techniques to improve the signal quality.\nFigure 4-8: Indicative handset positioning during loudness matching\nEach participant completed two sessions. In each session, nineteen 3rd octave bands (200Hz-12.5kHz) were assessed. Between each session the side where Prototype 2 was held (left or right) was reversed. In each trial, participants were asked to adjust the level of Prototype 2 to match the perceived loudness of Prototype 1 using the Griffin Technology PowerMate USB Volume Knob. The volume knob allowed adjustment in steps of 0.5dB and a range of -24dB to +24dB. The starting gain of Prototype 2 was randomly adjusted between -5dB and +5dB. The order of the frequencies presented was also randomized.\nAn interface for the listening test was developed in Max/MSP and is shown in Figure 4-9. Playback switching between the two prototypes (left and right) was signalled by the subject (verbally or through gestures) and carried out by the test administrator. All tests were completed in an anechoic chamber.\nThe figure depicts a graphical user interface (GUI) for a listening test, with various elements such as a microphone, speaker, and a display showing the test results. The GUI allows users to adjust the test parameters, such as the microphone sensitivity and speaker volume, and view the test results in real-time. The figure is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to understand and use the test effectively.\nFigure 4-9: Graphical User Interface for listening test\nFigure 4-10 shows the results of the listening tests (i.e. the gain that will be applied to Prototype 2 to match Prototype 1) including mean and 95% confidence intervals, along with the equivalent objective measurement on both HATS at 8N. A full table of descriptive statistics can be found in Table A-1 of Annex A.\nThe figure depicts the results of subjective loudness matching and objective transfer functions from HATS, a human auditory system model. The results show that the subjective loudness of sounds is highly correlated with the objective transfer function, which is a measure of the system's ability to reproduce the original sound. The objective transfer function is a key metric in evaluating the performance of a sound system.\nFigure 4-10: Results of subjective loudness matching and objective transfer functions from HATS\nGenerally strong agreement exists between the measured transfer function between earpiece and actuator prototypes on HATS and the mean subjective actuator level adjustment. There is a strong positive correlation between subjective level matching and the HATS 1 transfer function (ρ=0.775; p<0.000) and a strong (although slightly lower) positive correlation between subjective level matching and the HATS 2 transfer function (ρ=0.656; p<0.001). Table A-2 of Annex A provides more details on the correlation analysis.\nTable A-3 of Annex A presents squared error (SE) per 3rd octave band and wideband root mean squared error (RMSE) calculations comparing the subjective level matching and the two HATS generated transfer functions. The RMSE between subjective results and HATS 1 measurements (RMSE=1.79dB) is ~1dB lower than the RMSE between subjective results and HATS 2 measurements (RMSE=2.83dB). It is interesting to note that the RMSE is nearly identical for the two HATS below 8kHz. However, at and above 8kHz the HATS 2 RMSE is nearly 4dB higher than that of HATS 1. Table 4-5 presents RMSE data for these two frequency ranges.\nTable 4-5: RMSE by frequency range\n\nSubjective loudness matching results for each 3rd octave band were compared to HATS data using a two-tailed, one sample t-test with 15 degrees of freedom (t[15] = 2.1314) and a 95% confidence interval. Full t-test results with HATS 1 as reference are presented in Table A-4 of Annex A. Of the nineteen tested frequency bands, subjective adjustment varies significantly from HATS 1 measurements in five (400Hz, 500Hz, 800Hz, 2kHz, and 12.5kHz). A maximum absolute error of 3.065dB occurs at 800Hz.\nTable A-5 of Annex A presents the same t-test methodology with HATS 2 as the reference. Seven of the nineteen frequency bands demonstrate a statistically significant difference between subjective and objective level matching (200Hz, 400Hz, 630Hz, 4kHz, 5kHz, 8kHz, and 12.5kHz). A maximum absolute error of 9.074dB occurs at 12.5kHz.\nThe results support the performance of HATS as a measurement tool for the vibrating display prototype in the frequency range 200Hz to 12.5kHz. There exists a significant and strong positive correlation between subjective loudness matching of traditional and non-traditional earpieces and objectively measured transfer functions between the same two prototypes. The positive correlation exists for both HATS models investigated herein. For these specific prototypes, HATS 1 demonstrated less error than HATS 2 (particularly at high frequencies) between the measured transfer function and subjective level matching. Furthermore, the transfer function measured on HATS 1 has fewer frequency bands, which vary significantly from the corresponding subjective level adjustment, than the transfer function measured on HATS 2.\n",

                            "text_content": "3GPP UE's Receive Frequency Response (RFR) and Receive Loudness Rating (RLR) are measured with Head and Torso Simulators (HATS) and handset positioners. Handset positioners exert force at multiple points on the Device Under Test (DUT), including stationary supports on the back of the DUT. These supports may or may not be indicative of a user's hand position while interacting with the DUT.\nThe receiver transducer of a traditional earpiece design is decoupled from the surrounding mechanical system and will not be greatly affected by the existence and placement of physical supports. However, with non-traditional earpiece designs (e.g. a vibrating display) the receiver transducer may be coupled with the entire mechanical structure of the device. Therefore, it is important to consider any physical supports and the force they exert when mounting non-traditional earpiece devices for RFR and RLR testing. This contribution explores mounting induced RFR variability on devices with both traditional and non-traditional earpieces.\nSee clause 4.2.1.2.1 for a detailed description of the prototypes used in this study.\nFive commercial devices were tested along with the two prototypes mentioned in the previous section. Four of the five commercial devices employ non-standard, vibrating display earpieces, while one device has as traditional earpiece. Table 4-6 provides more information.\nTable 4-6: Further information on commercial devices\n\nFor RFR measurement, handsets were positioned on a Bruel & Kjaer Type 5128 HATS as described in clause 4.2.1.2.1.\nFor a comparison of mounting conditions, all devices were measured with and without the handset positioner support pins in place. See Figure 4-11.\nThe figure depicts a handheld device with and without support pins, illustrating the various ways in which the device can be supported. The presence of support pins allows the device to be more stable and secure, while the absence of support pins indicates that the device is less stable and more susceptible to damage. The figure also shows the different types of support pins, such as the metal pins and the plastic pins, which can be used to secure the device in different ways. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive view of the handheld device's support system, highlighting the importance of proper support for the device's stability and security.\nFigure 4-11: Handset positioned with and without support pins\nSee clause 4.2.1.2.2 for a description of the prototype playback system. Wideband pink noise was used for RFR measurement on both prototypes. Playback of the pink noise stimulus was accomplished using Adobe Audition.\nThe five commercial devices were driven by a Rohde & Schwarz CMW500 Wideband Radio Communication Tester. AMR-WB (20Hz–8kHz) at 12.65kbps was used for transmission speech coding. The measurement stimulus was an ITU-T Recommendation P.501 speech file with twelve utterances (six male and six female). ACQUA from Head Acoustics was used for stimulus playback. See Figure 4-12.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 4-12: Block diagram of commercial device playback system,\" depicts a complex system architecture. It illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and network interface controllers (NICs). The figure also includes a block diagram of the playback system, showing the flow of data between the CPU and the playback device. The system is designed to support commercial device playback, with a focus on efficient data transfer and user experience.\nFigure 4-12: Block diagram of commercial device playback system\nThe RFR for each DUT was measured at the drum reference point (DRP) of Bruel & Kjaer Type 5128 HATS. Recordings were captured by a Head Acoustics MFE VI frontend and analysed with a Head Acoustics ACQUA system. All recordings were DRP-to-ERP (ear reference point) equalized prior to third octave band analysis.\nAll devices were measured under two conditions, as described in clause 4.2.2.3.1. The transfer function between the measured RFR with supports and the RFR without supports was computed for each device. Figure 4-13 shows the results for all devices, divided between standard and non-standard earpieces. Table 4-7 presents the same data along with the root mean squared error (RMSE).\nThe figure depicts a comparison of device RFR (Relative Friction Resistance) with and without supporting pins. The device RFR is a critical component in the design of electric motors, and its performance can significantly impact the overall efficiency and reliability of the motor. The supporting pins are added to the device RFR to provide additional resistance, which can help to reduce the motor's overall friction and improve its performance. The figure shows the effect of the supporting pins on the device RFR, highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate pins for optimal performance.\nFigure 4-13: Comparing device RFR with and without supporting pins\nTable 4-7: Comparing device RFR with and without supporting pins\n\nIt is shown in Figure 4-13 and Table 4-7 that standard earpiece devices (Prototype 1 and Device 1) demonstrate low levels of variability (< 1dB) as supporting pins are added or removed from the back of the device. Devices with a non-standard earpiece (e.g. Prototype 2 and Devices 2-5) tend to demonstrate higher levels of variability (> 2dB), particularly at frequencies below 1.25kHz. Furthermore, the non-standard earpiece variability is device and frequency dependent.\nThe results in clause 4.2.2.4 support the hypothesis that the receiver frequency response of a non-standard, vibrating display (HaNTE) is subject to mounting specific variability. Furthermore, the decoupled nature of a standard earpiece mitigates such variability.\n",

This noise is present in the WB case (frequencies> 7kHz) and it is even more noticeable in NB (frequencies > 4kHz).\nTo address these issues, the following test cases are proposed to be included in TS 26.131 and TS 26.132.\nFigures 4-16a and 4-16b show the SWB RFR data measured at maximum and nominal volume control, when using the SWB RFR test method specified in TS 26.131 clause 7.4.2.1 and TS 26.132 clause 9.4.2.1, for the WB phones under test (DUT A to C). This measurement provides a frequency analysis range extended to the at least [100, 16000] Hz.\nNOTE 1: The SWB RFR test method in TS 26.132 specifies that a double resolution (1/12 octaves and 1/3 octaves) is used for measurement, however the 1/12 octave band is hard-limited to a maximum frequency of about 8 kHz in the setup used in this study. Therefore only 1/3 octave band results are reported in Figures 4-16a and 4-16b.\nNOTE 2: The SWB frequency masks in Figures 4-16a and 4-16b do not apply in the WB case and they are only used for information.\nNOTE 3: It was observed that DUT A has signal saturations (with clipped audio) in two specific time segments in the 23-25s time interval when volume control is set to maximum in receiving (recalling that the RFR test signal consisting of concatenated British English single sentences is about 35s long); such saturations were observed only for DUT A and only at maximum volume control and it should be considered when interpreting the estimated frequency response.\nThe figure depicts a 16-port RFR (Remote Frequency Reconfiguration) system for three different devices (DUT A, B, and C) with extended frequency range and 1/3 octave band analysis. The system includes 16 ports, each with a 1/3 octave band analysis, allowing for maximum volume control.\nFigure 4-16a: RFR for DUT A, B, and C with extended frequency range and 1/3 octave band analysis (maximum volume control)\n\nThe figure depicts a 16-bit RFR (Receiver-Filter-Rejector) system for three different devices (DUT A, B, and C) with extended frequency range and 1/3 octave band analysis. The system includes a 16-bit RFR, a 16-bit filter, and a 16-bit rejector. The figure also includes a 16-bit RFR with extended frequency range and 1/3 octave band analysis for DUT C. The system is designed to provide a 1/3 octave band analysis for DUT C, which is a 16-bit RFR with extended frequency range.\nFigure 4-16b: RFR for DUT A, B, and C with extended frequency range and 1/3 octave band analysis (nominal volume control)\nIt can be noted that DUT B has some out-of-band energy in the 1/3 octave bands centered at 8 and 10 kHz. One caution is that the test signal is typically pre-processed with a pass-band filter which does not allow conducting a spectral analysis in the stop band region, therefore results above 12.5 kHz are not relevant here.\nTo complement the 1/3 octave band analysis, the test signals recorded when measuring SWB RFR at nominal volume control were also directly analysed. These recorded signals are sampled at 48 kHz, and a periodogram using an FFT size of 4096 samples, with Hanning window and 75 % overlap is reported in Figure 4-17.\nThe figure depicts a periodogram of SWB RFR output test signal for DUT A, B, and C, with nominal volume control. The periodogram is a graphical representation of the power spectral density (PSD) of the signal, showing the frequency content of the signal. The figure shows the power spectral density (PSD) of the signal at different frequencies, with the amplitude of the signal at each frequency. The figure is used to analyze the signal's frequency content and identify any potential issues or anomalies in the signal.\nFigure 4-17: Periodogram of SWB RFR output test signal for DUT A, B, and C (nominal volume control)\nThe out-of-band energy level is shown to be significantly higher for DUT B.\nTest results are provided here only for WB terminals; however, it was found that the same out-of-band energy issue is even more noticeable when the same phone (DUT B) operates in NB.\nThe measured values (using POLQA v2.4) for DUT A, B, and C, at nominal and maximum volume control are reported in Table 4-9. It may be noted that the MOS-LQO value measured at nominal level ('Test Condition 0') for delay tests specified in TS 26.131, clause 6.11.1 and TS 26.132, clause 8.10.4 is already part of existing test cases. In principle, no extra measurement is therefore necessary for the nominal case; one may consider at least reporting this value for the nominal case.\nThe values reported in Table 4-9 may be used to quantify quality issues reported in user feedbacks.\nTable 4-9: DUT description\n\nTS 26.132 clause 5.1 specifies that nominal volume control should be used for RFR measurement. The measured WB RFR at three volume control settings (minimum, nominal, and maximum) is shown in Figures 4-18a, 4-18b, and 4-18c for DUT A, B and C.\nIt can be observed that RFR at maximum volume control is spectrally less balanced than at nominal and minimum volume position for DUTs A and B, while for a traditional UE such as DUT C the RFR does not vary significantly across the volume range. This may explain the user feedback on timbre degradation reporting for the maximum volume settings.\nThe figure depicts a WB RFR (Redundancy and Frequency Reconciliation) for DUT A at minimum, nominal, and maximum volume control. It illustrates the process of adjusting the volume of the signal to ensure a stable and reliable communication system. The figure includes various components such as the transmitter, receiver, and the network infrastructure, highlighting the importance of proper signal management in a wireless communication system.\nFigure 4-18a: WB RFR for DUT A at minimum, nominal and maximum volume control\n\nThe figure depicts a WB RFR (Redundancy and Frequency Reconciliation) system for a device under test (DUT B) at minimum, nominal, and maximum volume control. The system includes a transmitter, receiver, and a control unit. The transmitter generates a signal with a specific frequency and power level, while the receiver receives the signal and adjusts the power level accordingly. The control unit manages the system by adjusting the power levels of the transmitter and receiver to maintain the desired volume level. The figure shows the system in three different configurations: minimum, nominal, and maximum volume control.\nFigure 4-18b: WB RFR for DUT B at minimum, nominal and maximum volume control\n\nThe figure depicts a WB RFR (Relative Flow Rate) chart for a DUT C (Device Under Test) at minimum, nominal, and maximum volume control. The chart illustrates the relationship between the RFR and the volume of the device, allowing for optimal control of the device's performance.\nFigure 4-18c: WB RFR for DUT C at minimum, nominal and maximum volume control\nNOTE:\tIt was observed that DUT A has signal saturations (with clipped audio) in two specific time segments in the 23-25s time interval when volume control is set to maximum in receiving (recalling that the RFR test signal consisting of concatenated British English single sentences is about 35s long); such saturations were observed only for DUT A and only at maximum volume control and it should be taken into account when interpreting the estimated frequency response.\n",

On HATS 1, the devices were measured at an additional 9 points in an equally spaced grid proposed in [3]. Furthermore, HATS 1 measurements were made with a standard mounting position and with an alternative mounting position. RLR and RFR results for all measurements were assessed according to the requirements in [2] and variability between HATS, measurement points, and mounting positions was reported.\nDevice 1 exemplifies a relatively high performing HaNTE device. RLRs stay within an acceptable range over a larger area of the device display when mounted in a standard position (MP1). Although no RFR measurements on HATS 1 pass the mask defined in [2], all positions are within 8dB of passing no matter the mounting position. Furthermore, Device 1 passes the RFR sensitivity mask when measured on HATS 2. Finally, mounting specific variability is limited to < 6dB in the frequency range 100Hz – 2kHz.\nDevice 2, however, demonstrates poor performance for a HaNTE device. The RLR is more susceptible to measurement point variability and fewer points fulfil the requirements of [2]. Furthermore, Device 2 RFR is far from passing the frequency mask no matter the measurement point (>20dB absolute error) or HATS. Lastly, the Device 2 RFR is prone to high levels of mounting specific variability at frequencies below 2kHz.\n",

Both HATS comply with ITU-T P.58 [3] and are equipped with ear simulators of Type 3.3 [2]. The handset positioners both comply with ITU-T P.64 [4].\nTable 4-14: HATS and Positioner systems used in the round robin test\n\nParticipating labs in the round robin test could also test with more than one HATS/positioner system. An overview of the measurement systems vs labs is shown in Table 4-15.\nTable 4-15: HATS and Positioner systems per lab\n\nFor testing of receive loudness rating and frequency response, 3GPP TS 26.132 [6] specifies the usage of the British English single talk sequence according to clause 7 of ITU-T P.501 [9]. In order to reduce testing time, in several test cases also a shorter measurement signal according to Annex D of ITU-T P.501 [9] was utilized, too. Thus, results obtained with the longer default sequence are denoted as \"Long\" in the following, while results obtained with the short sequence are denoted as \"Short\".\nIn order to further minimize testing time and to re-use recordings as often as possible, all HATS measurements were conducted without DRP-ERP or DF-correction. For the analysis of receive frequency responses (RFR) and speech quality according to ITU-T P.863 [8], DF-correction according to ITU-T P.58 [3] was applied. For the calculation of receive loudness ratings, DRP-ERP-correction according to ITU-T P.57 [2] was applied.\nFor the automated handset positioner HHP IV, the test suite used for the evaluation provided an optional automated volume control check, which sweeps all possible volume settings of a device (via Bluetooth remote control). Volume control settings for maximum (MAX) and nominal (NOM) loudness ratings were determined with the short British English test sequence according to Annex D of ITU-T P.501 [9]. In addition, the resulting maximum volume steps were double-checked in lab #2 by manually counting the possible volume steps (from minimum to maximum) during a call.\nSince RLR methodology was not yet investigated with (possibly) non-linear sound radition of HaNTE devices, in some cases the existing recordings were analyzed with the loudness measures ISO 532-1  [11] and ITU-T P.700 [12]:\n-\tThe loudness level (in phon) according to ISO 532-1 utilizes the time-varying loudness, which was calculated over the whole signal. The overall result is obtained by temporally aggregating with the 95% percentile versus time (\"N5 percentile\").\n-\tThe loudness level (in phon) according to ITU-T P.700 is also based on the time-varying loudness as per ISO 532-1, but the temporal aggregation is adapted for speech signals:\n-\tSpeech pauses larger than 400 ms are excluded.\n-\tInstead of a percentile analysis, the average of the loudness versus time is used.\nAll DUTs were connected via 3G/UMTS to the test equipment, calls were setup with AMR-WB codec at 12.65 kbit/s. An application force of 8 N was used for all tests.\nDuring the round robin test, DUT6 was damaged, and the display showed multiple compound cracks. For the re-testing in Lab1 at the end of the round robin, it was decided not to use this device again and was left out for the measurements.\n\nFor speech quality testing at nominal and maximum volume, eight sentences of British English speech (two female, two male talkers) from ITU-T P.501 [9] were concatenated to an overall sequence of 32.0s. The source signal for the receive direction was pre-filtered to wideband and then calibrated to an active speech level (ASL) according to ITU-T P.56 [10] of -16 dBm0.\nThe recording is then analyzed with the speech quality prediction method according to ITU-T P.863 [8] in super-wideband mode (version 2.4), analyzing sentences pairs. The resulting four MOS values are averaged to an overall result value.\nAs a measure for acoustic sound radiation of the devices, the differences in RLR between handset mode and far-field (measured at a radius of 42 cm in front of the HATS EEP) is evaluated as shown in Figure 4-30. Different angles between symmetry plane of the HATS and the measurement microphone are used for testing, i.e., points A, B, C, D and E as defined in Table 4-16. The test is run with maximum volume setting at the DUT. Only the short sequences are available for the analysis.\n\nThe figure depicts a test setup for privacy, showing a 30-meter long cable with a 100-meter long extension. The setup includes a 100-meter long cable with a 10-meter long extension, and a 10-meter long cable with a 10-meter long extension. The cables are connected to a 10-meter long cable with a 10-meter long extension, and a 10-meter long cable with a 10-meter long extension. The setup is designed to test the privacy of the cables, ensuring that they are not visible to anyone passing by.The figure depicts a test setup for privacy, showing a 30-meter long cable with a 100-meter long extension, a 100-meter long cable with a 10-meter long extension, and a 10-meter long cable with a 10-meter long extension.

Figure 4-31 shows the resulting grid located around the default ECRP (marked in green). Four mandatory (marked in red) and four optional (marked in blue) points are evaluated. Table 4-17 provides unique labels (S0-S8) for the shifts to be applied. Table 4-18 shows a rearranged view of these labels according to the geometry of the grid in Figure 4-31.\nRLR and RFR are evaluated with the long and short speech sequence as defined in clause . The test is run with nominal volume setting.\n\nThe figure depicts a variation of the ECRP (Energy-Constrained Rate-Polarity) algorithm, which is a key component in energy-efficient communication systems. The algorithm is used to optimize the transmission of data packets in a wireless network, ensuring that the energy consumption is minimized while still maintaining the required data rate. The figure shows the ECRP algorithm in action, with different scenarios represented by different colors and shapes, illustrating the impact of different parameters on the algorithm's performance.\nFigure 4-31: Variation of ECRP\n\nTable 4-17: Shifts around ECRP (=S0)\n\nTable 4-18: Gemeotric representation of shifts\n\n\nTo investigate the impact of the clamping fork positions, the round robin test evaluates three different positions. Initial results from lab #1 defined these three positions as offsets in Ye-axis. The general positioning strategy for the forks shown in Table 4-19 and is not bound to a vendor-specific handset positioner.\nTable 4-19: Fork positions\n\nAll measurements except Test 3b are conducted with position #1. Only Test 3b evaluates positions #2 and #3. Exact values for bottom, middle and top fork position were initially provided by lab #1. However, it was found to be extremely impractical to measure the fork positions at each mounting.\nThus, the following general positioning strategy was chosen for lab #2 (and was then adopted by lab #3 and #4):\n-\tBottom position: the fork is moved and tightened as close as possible at the lower edge of the device. This fork positioning did not conflict with any button at the sides of the devices.\n-\tMid position: the fork is moved and tightened as close as possible at the center of the device (regarding Ye axis). In case of collisions with buttons at the sides of the device, the fork is moved to the closest collision-free position (typically, this is towards the lower edge of the device since most buttons are in the upper half of the device).\n-\tTop position: the fork is moved and tightened as close as possible at the most upper edge of the device. In case of collisions with buttons at the sides of the device, the fork is moved downwards to the closest collision-free position.\nIn addition to the Mid and Top positions, care was taken that the clamps of the forks did not produce an overhang, as shown in Figure 4-32. In this case, the head of the clamp (red color) might push against the ear/cheek of the HATS and the screen of the device (orange color) is not mounted correctly.\nThe figure depicts a possible overhang of fork positions in a 32-node network, illustrating the distribution of fork positions across the network. The overhang is a critical factor in network design, as it affects the network's capacity and performance.\nFigure 4-32: Possible overhang of fork positions\n\nRLR and RFR are evaluated with the long and short speech sequence as defined in clause 4.5.3.1.

Even though it was suggested to use the same determined volume settings in the following labs, in some cases different volume settings were used. All used volume settings per lab and per HATS/positioner are provided in Table 4-20.\nTable 4-20: Volume settings for MAX and NOM\n\nSome DUTs showed strange behaviour here:\n1)\tDUT2 does not provide a valid nominal volume setting. During incremental testing, RLR \"jumps\" from ~8.5 dB at step 5/7 to ~-2.5 dB at step 6/7.\n2)\tDUT4 seems to have an incorrect implementation of volume control. At a certain volume increase step, the recorded signal level decreased. This was confirmed by measurements as well as by expert listening.\n3)\tDUT5 provides a “boost mode” in the volume control. This mode was disabled and not used for testing.\nThe resulting RLR values for all labs, DUTs and long test sequence are shown in Figure 4-33 (nominal volume) and Figure 4-34 (maximum volume). Performance requirements according to clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] are indicated as tolerances in the figures as well. If available, results for the long and short sequence (see clause 4.5.3.1) are provided. Loudness levels in phon according to ITU-T P.700 are provided for reference in Figure 4-35 (nominal volume) and Figure 4-36 (maximum volume). Limits indicated in these figures are derived from the RLR requirements.\n\nThe figure depicts a 33-channel RLR (Remote Radio Head) for NOM (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) volume, illustrating the distribution of radio resources across the network. The RLR is designed to support NOM, which is a technology that allows multiple users to share the same radio frequency spectrum. The figure shows the distribution of radio resources, including the number of channels, the number of users, and the number of antennas. This helps to ensure that the network can efficiently allocate resources and support a high number of users.\nFigure 4-33: RLR for NOM volume\n\nThe figure depicts a 34-channel RLR (Remote Radio Head) for a MAX volume, illustrating the various configurations and functionalities of the RLR system.\nFigure 4-34: RLR for MAX volume\n\nThe figure depicts the loudness levels of ITU-T P.700 for NOM volume, which is a standard used to measure the loudness of noise in telecommunications. The figure shows the distribution of loudness levels across different categories, with the highest loudness levels being in the 100-150 dB range. The figure is important for understanding the noise levels in telecommunications systems and for designing and implementing noise reduction techniques.\nFigure 4-35: Loudness levels according to ITU-T P.700 for NOM volume\n\nThe figure depicts the loudness levels according to ITU-T P.700 for MAX volume, illustrating the range of loudness levels in a typical telephone conversation.\nFigure 4-36: Loudness levels according to ITU-T P.700 for MAX volume\n\nThe results of the RFR measurements according to clause 8.4.2 of 3GPP TS 26.132 [6] (using the long single talk sequence from ITU-T P.501 [9]) are shown for NOM and MAX volumes and for all devices in Figure 4-37 to Figure 4-44.\nNOTE 1:\tIn all figures below, the tolerances according to clause 6.4.2 of 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] are provided only for reference and better visual orientation. The graphs are intended to illustrate the variance across labs, HATS and/or positioners. Any evaluation of the performance requirement is out of scope for this analysis. Furthermore, 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] also does not specify performance requirements for RFR and MAX volume setting.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the illustration of this variance, any level difference between curves in one graph should remain. For this purpose, the frequency responses in each graph are adjusted commonly with one single offset. This offset is calculated by adjusting the average RFR (not shown) to the upper tolerance.\n\nThe figure depicts the results of a simulation of the RFR (Relative Friction Resistance) of a DUT1 (Dynamic Unit 1) for NOM (Non-Metallic) and MAX (Metallic) materials, respectively.

In several cases, the decrease in quality between these two volume settings is more than 0.5 MOS. Lower performance of some devices may be explained by the frequency response results as shown in clause 4.1.\n\nThe figure depicts the results of a study comparing the performance of a 45-nm process technology (P.863) in terms of volume setting (V) and the number of labs (N) for a specific material. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the V and N parameters on the overall performance of the material. The results show that the V and N values have a significant impact on the material's properties, with the optimal V and N values being 0.01 and 100, respectively. The study also highlights the importance of considering the material's properties when designing and optimizing the process.\nFigure 4-45: P.863 results for NOM volume setting vs labs\n\nThe figure depicts the results of a study comparing the maximum volume setting (MVS) of a P.863 test with the results of laboratory experiments. The MVS is a parameter that affects the performance of a test, and the study aims to determine the optimal MVS value for the P.863 test. The figure shows the relationship between the MVS and the number of tests conducted, with the results indicating that the optimal MVS value is 100.\nFigure 4-46: P.863 results for MAX volume setting vs labs\n\nNOTE:\tThe performance of DUT6 at MAX volume (see Figure 4-46) seems to be unreasonably low and/or inconsistent for lab #2 and #3. After investigation and expert listening, it was noticed that in some cases, DUT6 emits an extremely high peak level (> 30 dBPa!), which was not taken into account by the dynamic range settings in both labs and results in a clipped amplitude. This artifact leads to a clear degradation in listening quality prediction of P.863. This behaviour occurred for two different HATS and in labs (using different measurement equipment).\n\nFor testing of privacy, the test plan for the round robin test specified RLR measurements at MAX volume setting. At the same time, RLR was measured at the ear (DUT) and in the vicinity (microphone) and the difference between both should reveal performance regarding sound radiation. After an initial analysis of the results, the method of (Delta-)RLR calculation seems not to be suitable.\nDue to the low overall level of the recorded signals at the microphone position, the analysis of RLR or Delta-RLR seems not to provide reasonable results. Loudness ratings according to ITU-T P.79 [7] are based on a linearized loudness model, which only works for levels in a suitable \"operational range\" and the recorded signal at the microphone is not considered to be a valid \"signal under test\". In general, the level at the microphone should be as low as possible.\nFor this reason, a post-analysis of the RLR measurements was conducted. The unweighted and A-weighted levels are calculated for the microphone signals (short speech sequence). Leading/trailing silence segments are excluded (0.5 to 6.0 s) and frequency range from 100 to 8000 Hz was considered. Results for all angles and labs are shown in Figure 4-47 and Figure 4-48.\nNOTE:\tDue to the low level (and thus, lower SNR), the usage of active speech level according to ITU-T P.56 [10] is not possible here in all cases.\n\nThe figure depicts a level (unweighed) for privacy tests and labs, with a focus on the level of privacy protection for different scenarios. The figure illustrates the comparison between unweighed and weighted levels, highlighting the importance of privacy in testing and lab environments.\nFigure 4-47: Level (unweigthed) for privacy tests vs labs\n\nThe figure depicts a level (A-weighted) for privacy tests versus labs, illustrating the comparison between the two scenarios. The level is a measure of privacy, with higher values indicating higher privacy levels. The figure shows that the level is higher in labs, indicating a higher level of privacy protection.\nFigure 4-48: Level (A-weigthed) for privacy tests vs labs\n\nAs expected, for all devices the highest sound radiation is obtained at position C (microphone pointing directly to back side of the device). For some devices, the level of the test signal at the microphone position is rather high. One reason for this is the corresponding low RLR at the DUT (e.g., DUT3, DUT4). On the other hand, some devices with a low RLR at the DUT seem to radiate less than others (e.g., DUT3: similar as DUT4 / RLRmax of ~-13dB - but rather low level at the microphone). Vice versa, devices with moderate RLRmax values obtain higher levels at the microphone than devices with lower RLRmax values (e.g., DUT5, DUT6: RLRmax =~ -9dB, but highest overall levels).\nThe non-HaNTE device DUT8 obtains the lowest overall level at almost all angles/positions. However, the small level differences observed here do not indicate a sound radition issue for HaNTE devices: DUT8 also has one of the lowest RLRmax values, so a lower level is expected.\nAt first sight, it seems like those measurements from lab #4 are in general lower in level, even though the trend across angles and devices is similar. This can be explained by the rather low idle noise level, which is differently pronounced in the recordings. Table 4-21 provides the idle noise levels in dBSPL(A) for each lab, measured in a speech pause of the microphone recordings for DUT1.\nTable 4-21: Idle Noise\n\nTo further investigate the psychoacoustic relevance of absolute speech levels and noise floor, the existing recordings were analyzed again with the loudness measures ISO 532-1  [11] and ITU-T P.700 [12]. Results of these two analyses are shown in Figure 4-49 (ISO 532-1) and Figure 4-50 (ITU-T P.700).\n\nThe figure depicts a comparison of loudness levels for privacy tests and labs, with ISO 532-1 standards being used to measure the noise levels. The figure shows the loudness levels for different scenarios, such as laboratory tests and real-world scenarios, with a focus on the noise levels in the presence of different types of noise sources.\nFigure 4-49: Loudness Level according to ISO 532-1 for privacy tests vs labs\n\nThe figure depicts a comparison of loudness levels for ITU-T P.700 privacy tests and labs, illustrating the differences in noise levels between the two settings.\nFigure 4-50: Loudness Level according to ITU-T P.700 for privacy tests vs labs\n\nResults of the RLR measurements for the robustness against shifts regarding (M)ECRP across labs are shown for each device in Figure 4-51 to Figure 4-58. Each figure only provides results for the long speech sequence. For sake of clarity, RLR values are clipped to the range -6 dB to 20 dB. Requirements of clause 6.2.2 of 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] (-1 to +5 dB for NOM volume setting), are indicated in the figures as well.\n\nThe figure depicts the results of a randomized linear regression (RLR) analysis conducted on the performance of a device (DUT1) under different conditions (shifts, sequences, and labs).

The figure also includes a comparison of the MSE values for different shifts, sequences, and labs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the device's performance under various conditions.\nFigure 4-57: RLR Results for DUT7 vs shifts, sequences and labs\n\nThe figure depicts the results of a randomized linear regression (RLR) analysis conducted on the performance of a DUT8 device under different shifts, sequences, and lab conditions. The results show a significant improvement in performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.001, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting the performance of the device. The figure also includes a comparison with other sequences and labs, highlighting the robustness of the RLR model.\nFigure 4-58: RLR Results for DUT8 vs shifts, sequences and labs\n\nThe left sides of Figure 4-59 to Figure 4-66 illustrate the RFR results for each device and each shift. Since many curves are provided per figure, for sake of clarity RFR is shown in 1/3rd octave bands. In both sub-figures, the tolerances according to clause 6.4.2 of 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] are provided for reference. Since only few data is available for the optional shifts, only S0 to S5 are considered in the following analyses.\nWhile the left graphs are showing the robustness regarding positioning, the right sides of Figure 4-59 to Figure 4-66 provide a different analysis. Here the RFRs are first averaged across all shifts and are then reported for each lab. This can be interpreted as a kind of \"robustness vs labs\".\nAll frequency responses in each figure are adjusted with the same offset for better (overall) comparison and to remain level differences, which may be caused by the shifts. The single offset per figure is determined by the average curve to the upper tolerance, which is provided in both subplots as well (black dashed line).\n\nFigure 4-59: RFR Results for DUT1, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-60: RFR Results for DUT2, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-61: RFR Results for DUT3, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-62: RFR Results for DUT4, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-63: RFR Results for DUT5, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-64: RFR Results for DUT6, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-65: RFR Results for DUT7, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\n\nFigure 4-66: RFR Results for DUT8, averaged vs labs (left) and vs shifts (right)\nSince the results for default RFR and RLR seem to include quite some variance across labs and also equipment (see clause 4.5.3.1, Figure 4-37 to Figure 4-44), this average measure may help to reduce such scatter. In most cases, RFR results here are a) similar to the ones of clause 4.5.3.1 and b) seem to be less variant. Considering all eight shift positions would possibly decrease the variance even more.\nResults of the RLR measurements for the robustness against different fork positions are shown in Figure 4-67 for the long test sequence. Requirements of clause 6.2.2 of 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] (-1 to +5 dB for NOM volume setting) are indicated in the figures as well.\n\nThe figure depicts the results of RLR (Randomized Local Reconfiguration) for all DUTs (Different Units of Traffic) in a 67-node network, with fork positions (long sequence) as the reference. The results show the average number of fork positions per node, indicating the network's resilience to random failures.\nFigure 4-67: RLR Results for all DUTs vs fork positions (long sequence)\n\nThe results of the RFR measurements according to clause 8.4.2 of 3GPP TS 26.132 [6] (using only the long single talk sequence from ITU-T P.501 [9]) versus fork positions and labs are shown in Figure 4-68 to Figure 4-75 for all devices. To evaluate differences between labs and fork positions, an RFR averaged across fork positions and labs is additionally provided. For sake of clarity, curves are shown in 1/3rd octave bands.\nIn both sub-figures, the tolerances according to clause 6.4.2 of 3GPP TS 26.131 [5] are provided for reference.

Several pecularities of the devices were identified and described to reduce effort for the subsequent labs in the round robin test. The following observations per sub-test were made:\nTest 1 (Speech Quality)\nDue to the low performance in frequency response for NOM and/or MAX, some devices cannot provide constant and acceptable quality across volume settings. However, since also good performance was achieved by other devices (e.g., DUT3 meets RFR requirement and MOS > 3.5), it seems in general possible to provide acceptable quality for HaNTE-devices.\nTest 2 (Privacy)\nAfter reviewing (Delta-)RLR results, an absolute level measure was found to be more suitable for the evaluation of direction-dependent sound radiation. Levels measured at the microphone between ~34 dBSPL / dBSPL(A) and 53-54 dBSPL / dBSPL(A) were obtained. The rather high variance in the results per DUT can be explained by the quite different idle noise floor, which depends highly on the measurement equipment/configuration, measurement room and/or microphone used.\nHowever, there are noticeable differences between the devices and some reach about 50 dBSPL/dBSPL(A), which is rather soft, but already audible. To investigate the degree of sound radiation with regard to psychoacoustics/intelligibility, also loudness levels according to ISO 532-1 and ITU-T P.700 were provided.\nTest 3a (Robustness vs. shifts)\nLarge differences in performance regarding RLR and RFR could be observed, depending on the shifts and devices. Only few devices can be regarded as robust against shifts.\nThe average measure across shift positions seem to reduce the scatter versus labs and provids better consistency between labs. This approach should be investigated more in detail (for example, if the same result can be achieved with the short sequences).\nTest 3b (Robustness vs. fork positions)\nMost devices perform quite similar regarding the different fork positions. However, some devices show high deviations here, which refer back to issues in the corresponding frequency responses as well.\n",

            "description": "The present document reports on investigations of testing UEs featuring non-traditional earpieces (\"HaNTE device\") and identifies related gaps to existing 3GPP specifications and recommended test equipment. The feasibility study resulted in the following main findings:\n-\tUEs featuring non-traditional earpieces may not feature a center of an acoustic port, raising the question of how to properly position a handset for testing. Therefore, an update to ITU-T Recommendation P.64 was found required to reference this Recommendation also for handsets with non-traditional earpieces.\n-\tWhen measured with manufacturer provided MECRP and mounting instructions, at least one HaNTE device was found compliant to current 3GPP terminal acoustic specifications.\n-\tHowever, even when measured with manufacturer provided MECRP and mounting instructions, certain HaNTE devices were found not compliant to current 3GPP terminal acoustic specifications.\n-\tIn contrast to devices featuring a traditional earpiece, the manner of holding the device with the handset positioner was found of significance for the receive frequency response and receive loudness rating of certain HaNTE devices. The mechanical contact of the handset positioner to the HaNTE device structure may alter the device's acoustic radiating properties.\n-\tBecause a significant portion of the display vibrates and radiates sound, the listening \"sweet spot\" may be larger for certain HaNTE devices when compared to handsets featuring a traditional earpiece.\n-\tPrivacy was found of concern for certain HaNTE devices studied, with audible sound radiating to areas in proximity to the user.\n-\tHigh distortion was identified as a concern with certain HaNTE devices studied.\n-\tOut of band noise was identified as a concern with certain HaNTE devices studied.\nA round robin test in four different labs was conducted, which targeted at introducing possible new test methods for 3GPP TS 26.132 and performance requirements for 3GPP TS 26.131. The round robin resulted in the following main findings:\n-\tSimilar as in previous studies, it was noted that certain HaNTE devices are in general able to achieve a sufficient level of quality (ITU-T P.863 prediction of ~3.5 MOS). New test methods for 3GPP TS 26.132 (and in consequence, also requirements for 3GPP TS 26.131) were not considered to be necessary.\n-\tThe sound radiation of HaNTE devices was identified to be higher than for traditional handsets. However, since it could not be determined if this leads to an issue regarding privacy, i.e., if the receive signal is intelligible at the distant position, new test methods for 3GPP TS 26.132 (and in consequence, also requirements for 3GPP TS 26.131) were not considered to be necessary.\n-\tThe results of the robustness experiments (variation of ECRP) were found to be relevant for positioning HaNTE devices in cases where no MECRP is provided. An iterative procedure in 3GPP TS 26.132 was specified to identify the most suitable testing position for such handsets.\n-\tThe results of the robustness experiments (variation of fork position) indicated that only a few devices seem to have issues with different fork positions, which are also reflected in corresponding RFR measurements. Thus, new test methods for 3GPP TS 26.132 (and in consequence, also requirements for 3GPP TS 26.131) were not considered to be necessary.\nTable A-1: Subjective level matching descriptive statistics\n\nTable A-2: Objective-Subjective correlation analysis\n\nTable A-3: SE and RMSE calculated between subjective results and HATS data\n\nTable A-4: One-sample, two-tailed t-test with HATS 1 as reference\n\nTable A-5: One-sample, two-tailed t-test with HATS 2 as reference\n\n\n\n\n",
