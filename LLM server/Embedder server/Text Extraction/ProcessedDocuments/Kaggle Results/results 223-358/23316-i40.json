Such subscriptions are by definition restricted to a specific location.\nNOTE 2:\tFor FN-CRG subscriptions, HFC Node ID is used to identify the location of FN-CRG, thus service area restrictions for the FN-CRG can be identified by an HFC_Node ID, or by a list of HFC_Node ID.\nMobility Restrictions for wireline access consists of Forbidden Area and Service Area Restrictions, as described in the following clauses.\nIn a Forbidden Area, the 5G-RG, based on subscription, is not permitted by the 5GC to initiate any communication with the 5GC for this PLMN or SNPN.\nThe UDM stores the Forbidden Area for wireline access in the same way as for 3GPP access, with the following differences:\n-\tFor subscriptions for 5G-BRG, GLI is used to describe the Forbidden Area.\n-\tFor subscriptions for 5G-CRG and FN-CRG, HFC Node IDs are used to describe the Forbidden Area (instead of TA).\n-\tThe Forbidden Area in UDM can be encoded as a \"allow list\" indicating the non-forbidden area. In this case all GLI or HFC_Node ID values not included in the list are considered forbidden.\nNOTE:\tThe use of \"allow list\" is to ensure an efficient Forbidden Area definition if only a small set of GLI / HFC Node ID values are not forbidden.\nForbidden Area is enforced by AMF, based on subscription data and the location information received from W-AGF. The AMF rejects a Registration Request from a 5G-RG or the W-AGF acting on behalf of a FN-CRG in a Forbidden Area with a suitable cause code. The 5G-RG behaviour depends on the network response (cause code from AMF) that informs the RG that communication is forbidden.\nThe subscription data in the UDM for a 5G-BRG includes a Service Area Restriction which may contain either Allowed or Non-Allowed Areas specified by using explicit GLI(s) and/or other geographical information (e.g., longitude/latitude, zip code, etc.).\nThe subscription data in the UDM for a 5G-CRG and FN-CRG includes a Service Area Restriction which may contain either Allowed or Non-Allowed Areas specified by using explicit HFC Node IDs and/or other geographical information (e.g., longitude/latitude, zip code, etc.).\nThe geographical information used to specify allowed or non-allowed area is only managed in the network, and the network will map it to a list of GLI(s) or HFC Node IDs before sending Service Area Restriction information to the PCF.\nThe UDM stores the Service Area Restrictions for the 5G-RG or FN-CRG as part of the subscription data. The PCF in the serving network may (e.g. due to varying conditions such as 5G-RG's location, time and date) further adjust Service Area Restrictions of a 5G-RG, either by expanding an allowed area or by reducing a non-allowed area. The UDM and the PCF may update the Service Area Restrictions of a 5G-RG or a FN-CRG at any time.\nDuring registration, if the Service Area Restrictions of the 5G-RG or FN-CRG is not present in the AMF, the AMF fetches from the UDM the Service Area Restrictions of the 5G-RG or FN-CRG that may be further adjusted by the PCF. The serving AMF shall enforce the Service Area Restrictions of a 5G-RG and a FN-CRG. The AMF receives the location information (GLI, HFC Node IDs) where the RG is connected from the W-AGF via N2.\nThe network does not send any Allowed Area or Non-Allowed Area to the 5G-RG for wireline access. If the 5G-RG initiates communication in an Allowed Area, the network accepts the communication as allowed by the subscription. If the 5G-RG initiates Service Request or SM signalling in a Non-Allowed Area, the AMF rejects the request with a suitable cause code indicating that the 5G-RG/W-AGF should not retry Service Request and SM signalling while being connected to the same line.\nUpon change of serving AMF due to mobility, the old AMF may provide the new AMF with the Service Area Restrictions of the 5G-RG that may be further adjusted by the PCF.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in determining the appropriate classification and UPM for each flow, as well as the mapping of these flows to W-UP resources. The figure is crucial for understanding the process and ensuring that QoS requirements are met for PDU sessions.\nFigure 4.5-1: The principle for classification and User Plane marking for QoS Flows and mapping to W-UP resources for a PDU Session\nWhen the W-AGF receives N2 requests related with PDU Session resources, the W-AGF maps the QoS profile(s) received from the 5GC to W-UP level QoS.\nWhen the 5G-RG receives NAS message related with PDU Session QoS, the 5G-RG maps the QoS rule(s) received in NAS to W-UP level QoS.\nOne W-UP resource can be used as the default W-UP resource. There shall be one and only one Default W-UP resource per PDU session. The 5G-RG shall send all QoS Flows to this W-UP resource for which there is no mapping information to a specific W-UP resource.\nHandling of UL traffic by the 5G-RG:\n-\tWhen the 5G-RG transmits an UL PDU, the 5G-RG shall determine the QFI associated with the UL PDU (by using the QoS rules of the PDU Session), it shall encapsulate the UL PDU inside an access layer dependent W-UP packet and shall forward the W-UP packet to W-AGF via the W-UP resource associated with this QFI.\nHandling of DL traffic by W-AGF:\n-\tWhen the W-AGF receives a DL PDU via N3, it identifies of the PDU Session and optionally the QFI in order to determine the W-UP resource to use for sending the DL PDU to the 5G-RG. The W-AGF may include also in the W-UP header the Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI), which shall be used by the 5G-RG to enable reflective QoS.\nThe W-AGF will map 5QI received from the 5GC into access-specific QoS parameters relevant to the wireline access network. The mapping of 5QI to W-5GBAN QoS parameters is specified by the BBF for W-5GBAN in [9]. The mapping of 5QI to W-5GCAN QoS parameters is specified for W-5GCAN in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\nQFI or other QoS parameters are carried via W-UP to the 5G-CRG as specified in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\nThe QFI and RQI are carried via W-UP to 5G-RG as specified in BBF TR-456 [9].\n",

The AMF should not provide the subscribed UE-AMBR to the W-AGF.\n\nThe wireline access networks may exhibit QoS control mechanisms and related thresholds, such as QoS class specific maximum bit rates, which the W-AGF needs to be aware of, in order to provide appropriate mapping of the QoS characteristics of the 5G QoS flows to the wireline technology specific QoS parameters.\nThese wireline access characteristics are considered to be relevant for a specific wireline access subscription, and correspond to RG level QoS information in the 5GC.\nWhile the wireline access characteristics are important for implementing the end to end QoS mechanisms, across the 5G-RG/FN-RG, the W-5GAN and the 5GC, they only need to be acted on in the 5G-RG/FN-RG and the W-5GAN.\nIn the case of 5G-RG serving the AUN3 devices, the RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics stored in 5G-RG's subscription includes a maximum bit rate for the aggregated traffic of the 5G-RG and of the AUN3 devices served by this 5G-RG.\nIn order to support the W-AGF in implementing the mapping between 5G QoS parameters and wireline access specific parameters, the AMF may provide the RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics (RG-LWAC) to the W-AGF at the time of the RG registration.

The details of IPv6 address allocation using DHCPv6 are described in clause 4.6.2.2.\nb.\tIPv6 Prefix Delegation using DHCPv6 may be supported for allocating additional IPv6 prefixes for a PDU Session. The details of Prefix Delegation are described in clause 4.6.2.3.\nThe mechanisms in a. and b. above are only applicable for IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDU Session types.\nThe requested IPv6 address or set of IPv6 Prefixes may be (as defined in TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.8.2.2.1):\n-\tallocated from a local pool in the SMF or\n-\tobtained from the UPF. In that case the SMF shall interact with the UPF via N4 procedures to obtain a suitable IP address/Prefix, or\n-\tobtained from an external server.\nWhen obtaining the IP address from the UPF, the SMF provides the UPF with the necessary information allowing the UPF to derive the proper IP address (e.g. the network instance, IP version, size of the IP address or Prefix the UPF is to allocate).\nThe SMF may also provide IP configuration parameters (e.g. MTU value) to the 5G-RG, as described in clause 5.6.10 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE:\tIn order to provide an IP MTU value that is specifically suitable for W-5GAN without considering N3 in case of combined W-AGF/UPF, the SMF can e.g. be configured with such MTU for a given DNN and/or for a given slice whether the DNN and/or the slice only serves wireline access and a UPF combined with the W-AGF has been selected for the PDU Session.\nIn this clause, unless specified otherwise, the RG may correspond either to a 5G RG or to a FN RG.\nOptionally, and instead of using Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration, individual 128-bit IPv6 address(es) may be assigned to a PDU Session.\nIn this case, after PDU Session Establishment, the SMF sends a Router Advertisement message (solicited or unsolicited) towards the RG. The SMF shall set the Managed Address Configuration Flag (M-flag) in the Router Advertisement messages to indicate towards the RG that IPv6 Address allocation using DHCPv6 is available, as described in RFC 4861 [34]. In that case the IPv6 address of the RG is allocated using DHCPv6 Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA) and mechanisms defined in RFC 8415 [47].\nThe SMF may receive a Router Solicitation message, soliciting a Router Advertisement message.\nWhen using DHCPv6 address allocation, a prefix (e.g. /64) may be allocated for the PDU Session at PDU Session Establishment from which the /128 addresses are selected. The SMF determines the size of the prefix for a PDU Session to a specific DNN and S-NSSAI based on subscription data and local configuration. The individual /128 address(es) allocated to the RG as part of DHCP IA_NA procedure are then selected from the prefix allocated to the PDU Session. For statically assigned prefix, the subscription data in UDM for a DNN and S-NSSAI includes the prefix. Alternatively, individual 128-bit address(es) are allocated for the PDU Session without allocating a prefix to the PDU Session and provided to the RG as part of DHCP IA_NA procedure.\nWhen a prefix is allocated to the PDU Session, the SMF provides the prefix to the PCF instead of each /128 address. When individual /128 address(es) are allocated without allocating a prefix to the PDU Session, the SMF provides the /128 bits address(es) to PCF. Whether the SMF allocates a prefix for the PDU Session or individual 128-bit addresses is transparent to the RG and W-5GAN.\nIf Prefix Delegation (as described in clause 4.6.2.3) is also supported, a SMF may receive both DHCP options for IA_NA and IA_PD together in a single DHCPv6 message. An SMF may provide a reply to both IA_NA and IA_PD in the same message or alternatively process the DHCPv6 IA_NA before the DHCPv6 IA_PD.\nThe SMF may receive multiple different IA_NA related DHCP requests within the same PDU Session.\nNOTE:\tThis is applicable if the RG acts as a DHCP relay for devices behind the RG.\nWhen IPv6 Address Allocation using DHCPv6 is used, 5GC does not support IPv6 multi-homing for enabling SSC mode 3 and PDU Sessions with multiple PDU Session Anchors.\nIn addition to what is the specified in clause 5.8.2.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2], there is following difference:\n-\tUE is replaced by 5G-RG and FN-RG.\n-\tFor IPv6 stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration or IPv6 address allocation using DHCPv6, the SMF determines the maximum size of the prefix that may be allocated for the PDU Session based on subscription data and local configuration.\n-\tIf IPv6 address allocation using DHCPv6 is used, the DHCPv6 message may include a request for a delegated prefix (IA_PD) together with a request for an IPv6 address (IA_NA). Alternatively, a delegated prefix may be requested after an IPv6 address has been assigned using IA_NA.\n-\tIf the DHCPv6 request indicates support for prefix exclusion via the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in an OPTION_ORO option and if the SMF accepts this option, the SMF delegates a prefix excluding the default prefix with help of OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE. Prefix exclusion procedures shall follow IETF RFC 6603 [16].\nStateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration applies as described in clause 5.8.2.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2] with the differences described below.\nWhen the W-AGF is serving an FN-RG, the W-AGF may include in the PDU Session Establishment Request an interface identifier of the FN-RG IPv6 link-local address associated with the PDU Session. If the SMF receives an interface identifier in the PDU Session Establishment Request message, the SMF provides this interface identifier value as the UE interface identifier in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. To ensure that the link-local address used by the FN-RG does not collide with the link-local address of the SMF in this case, the SMF selectes a different link-local address for use as the SMF link local address for the PDU Session. If the PDU Session Establishment Request message does not contain an interface identifier, the SMF selects interface identifier for the UE, and SMF link-local address, as described in clause 5.8.2.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 1:\tAn FN-RGs is configuring its IPv6 link local address based on its MAC address and is not able to use an interface identifier selected by SMF as described in clause 5.8.2.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIn case of wireline access, independent of whether SMF received an interface identifier in the PDU Session Establishment Request message or not, the SMF includes the SMF link local address in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SMF link local address is needed by the W-AGF to support procedures towards the FN-RG defined in BBF TR-456 [9].\n",

                    "text_content": "An RG connecting via W-5GAN or NG-RAN access towards 5GC can provide connectivity for a UE behind the RG to access an N3IWF or TNGF. It is assumed that the UE is 5GC capable, i.e. supports untrusted non-3GPP access and/or trusted non-3GPP access. This allows the RG, W-5GAN and the RG's connectivity via 5GC to together act as untrusted/trusted N3GPP access to support UEs behind the RG.\nWhen FN-RG/5G-RG is serving a UE, the control and user plane packets of the UE is transported using a FN-RG/5G-RG IP PDU session and then from PSA UPF of that PDU session to an N3IWF or TNGF. A single FN-RG/5G-RG IP PDU session can be used to serve multiple UEs.\nFigure 4.10-1 shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a 5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via TNGF where the combination of 5G-RG, W-5GAN and UPF serving the 5G-RG is acting as a trusted Non-3GPP access network.\nFigure 4.10-2a shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a FN-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF.\nFigure 4.10-2b shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a 5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF.\nAnnex A shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a FN-RG/5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF where the combination of FN-RG/5G-RG, W-5GAN and UPF serving the 5G-RG is acting as an untrusted Non-3GPP access network.\nNOTE 1:\tFN-RG and W-5GAN acting as trusted Non-3GPP access is not considered in this specification as it is assumed that FN-RG is not 5G capable and therefore it does not support Ta reference point.\nThe figure depicts a non-rotating architecture for an UE behind a 5G-RBG using trusted N3GPP access, illustrating the use of non-rotating elements to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4.10-1: Non-roaming architecture for UE behind 5G-RG using trusted N3GPP access\nThe 5G-RG can be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN, NG-RAN or via both accesses. The UE can be connected to 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access with 5G-RG acting as TNAP, NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nThe figure depicts a UE (User Equipment) behind a fiber-optic network, utilizing untrusted N3GPP access. The architecture includes untrusted N3GPP access points (NAPs) and a fiber-optic network with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, ensuring failover reliability.\nFigure 4.10-2a: Architecture for UE behind FN-RG using untrusted N3GPP access\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RAN architecture with an untrusted N3GPP access point (UE) behind a 5G-RAN using a 5G-RAN-based access network (RAN-based access network). The architecture includes a 5G-RAN, a 5G-RAN-based access network, and an untrusted N3GPP access point (UE). The figure highlights the use of 5G-RAN-based access networks, which are designed to provide reliable and efficient communication services.\nFigure 4.10-2b: Architecture for UE behind 5G-RG using untrusted N3GPP access\nThe FN-RG can only be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN. The 5G-RG can be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN, NG-RAN or via both accesses. The UE can be connected to 5GC via untrusted non-3GPP access with FN-RG/5G-RG acting as WLAN access point, NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nThe TNGF and Ta reference point are defined in TS 23.501 [2]. In addition to the requirements described in TS 23.501 [2], the Ta reference point should be able to carry the TNAP ID to the TNGF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe reference architecture in figure 4.10-1/4.10-2a/4.10-2b only shows the architecture and the network functions directly connected to W-5GAN or TNGF/N3IWF, and other parts of the architecture are the same as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tThe reference architecture in figure 4.10-1 supports service based interfaces for AMF, SMF and other NFs not represented in the figure.\nNOTE 4:\tThe two N2 instances in Figure 4.10-1/4.10-2b apply to a single AMF for a 5G-RG which is simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network over 3GPP access and W-5GAN.\nNOTE 5:\tFor trusted non-3GPP access, UE connects to the overlay 5G network using the trusted non-3GPP access approach. In addition to being connected to the underlay 5G network, the 5G-RG also acts as TNAP with respect to the TNGF in the overlay network i.e. it has an established Ta reference point with the TNGF.\nNOTE 6:\tSupport for QoS differentiation can be achieved in a similar way as it is handled when a UE connects to a PLMN via SNPN (as defined in clauses 5.30.2.7 and D.7 of TS 23.501 [2]). Also differentiated charging, both in the RG's PLMN and in the UE's PLMN, can be achieved based on existing mechanisms. This is further described in Annex B.\nSupport of NSWO for 3GPP UE behind an RG is specified in clause 4.10d.\nA 5G-RG acting as a TNAP shall provide its TNAP ID. to the TNGF and the TNGF provides this TNAP ID as part of ULI (User Location Information) sent to the 5GC; this information is propagated to the PCF that may use it to determine PCC rules depending on whether an UE is using a 5G-RG as a host or as a guest.\nNOTE 7:\tQoS and charging differentiation based on user location (e.g. home or guest users) can be applied when the user is connected via a TNGF reached over a 5G-RG. The PCF may use the TNAP ID, which is available to it as a part of ULI. For example, if the TNAP ID is included in the UE's policy control subscription information the UE is considered a home user. Alternatively, the PCF may use TNAP ID provided by an AF using the Service Specific parameter provisioning as defined in clause 9.8.\n",

The following call flow describes the overall registration procedure of such a device.\nRoaming is not supported for N5GC devices.\nThe usage of N5GC device correspond to a subscription record in UDM/UDR that is separate from that of the CRG.\nThe figure depicts a 5G registration process for non-5GC devices, illustrating the steps involved in ensuring compatibility and interoperability with the 5G network.\nFigure 4.10a-1: 5GC registration of Non-5GC device\n1.\tThe W-AGF registers the FN-CRG to 5GC as specified in clause 7.2.1.3 or the 5G-CRG registers to 5GC as specified in clause 7.2.1.1.\n2.\tThe CRG is configured as L2 bridge mode and forwards any L2 frame to W-AGF. 802.1x authentication may be triggered. This can be done either by N5GC device sending a EAPOL-start frame to W-AGF or W-AGF receives a frame from an unknown MAC address.\nHow the CRG is configured to work in L2 bridge mode and how the W-AGF is triggered to apply procedures for N5GC devices is defined in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\nThe N5GC device send an EAP-Resp/Indentity including its Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the form of username@realm.\n3.\tW-AGF, on behalf of the N5GC device, sends a NAS Registration Request message to AMF with a device capability indicator that the device is non-5G capable. For this purpose, the W-AGF creates a NAS Registration Request message containing a SUCI. The W-AGF constructs the SUCI from the NAI received within EAP-Identity from the N5GC device as defined in TS 33.501 [11].\nOver N2 there is a separate NGAP connection per N5GC device served by the W-AGF.\nWhen it provides (over N2) ULI to be associated with a N5GC device, the W-AGF builds the N5GC's ULI using the GCI (see clause 4.7.9) of the CRG connecting the N5GC device.\nNOTE:\tHow the W-AGF determines the CRG connecting a N5GC device is specified in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n4.\tAMF selects a suitable AUSF as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 6.3.4.\n5.\tEAP based authentication defined in TS 33.501 [11] is performed between the AUSF and N5GC device.\nOnce the N5GC device has been authenticated, the AUSF provides relevant security related information to the AMF. AUSF shall return the SUPI (this SUPI corresponds to a NAI that contains the username of the N5GC device and a realm as defined in TS 33.501 [11]) to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\nNOTE:\tEach N5GC device is registered to 5GC with its own unique SUPI.\n6.\tThe AMF performs other registration procedures as required (see TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2).\nWhen providing a PEI for a N5GC device, the W-AGF shall provide a PEI containing the MAC address of the N5GC device. The W-AGF may, based on operator policy, encode the MAC address of the N5GC device using the IEEE Extended Unique Identifier EUI-64 format (see IEE Publication [41]).\n7.\tThe AMF sends Registration Accept message to W-AGF.\nOnce the registration procedure is completed, the W-AGF requests the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the N5GC device. Only one PDU session per N5GC device is supported. The procedure is the same as the PDU Session establishment procedure specified in clause 7.3.4 with the difference as below:\nAfter successful registration, PDU Session establishment/modification/release procedure specified in clause 7.3.4, 7.3.6, and 7.3.7 apply with the difference as below:\n-\tFN-RG is replaced by N5GC device.\nThe W-AGF shall request the release of the NGAP connection for each N5GC device served by a CRG whose NGAP connection has been released.\n5G-CRG behaves as FN-CRG (i.e. L2 bridge mode) when handling N5GC devices.\n",

The devices that connect to a certain logical port are considered part of the same Connectivity Group ID.

It is positioned behind a 5G-RG, which is a 5G radio unit. The device is connected to a 5G-RZI, which is a 5G radio unit. The 5G-RZI is connected to a 5G-RZI, which is a 5G radio unit.

This includes maintaining a GUTI and NAS (RM, CM, security, etc.) context per AUN3 device.\n-\tA 5G-RG shall be connected to the 5GC (be in RM-REGISTERED and CM-CONNECTED mode) over Wireline access to serve an AUN3 device: the 5G-RG shall not issue a NAS register or service request on behalf of an AUN3 device if it is itself not registered and connected to the 5GC.\n-\tThe 5G-RG is configured with URSP for each AUN3 devices it serves. The UE PCF selected by the AMF at the registration of an AUN3 device sends this URSP to 5G-RG via the AMF and the NAS connection of the AUN3 device.\n-\tThe AUN3 devices and the 5G-RG belong to the same PLMN.\n-\tA 5G-RG uses default values, which are the same for all AUN3 devices it serves, to populate the parameters in the Registration Request message built on behalf of an AUN3 device. For example, the 5G-RG issues the Registration Request with no S-NSSAI and the AMF selects the default S-NSSAI in the subscription of the AUN3 device.\n-\tThere shall be a separate N2 connection per AUN3 device that is in state CM-CONNECTED.\n-\tThe W-AGFshall determine that a W-CP connection is for an AUN3 device and apply corresponding policies. The W-AGF indicates to the AMF when an N2 connection relates to an AUN3 device.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the W-AGF determines the W-CP connection is for an AUN3 device is defined by BBF and CableLabs.\n-\tThe same W-AGF shall serve a 5G-RG and all AUN3 devices connected via this 5G-RG.\n-\tThe W-CP and W-UP protocols shall be able to manage multiple connections for different subscribers (the 5G-RG itself and the different AUN3 devices) between the same pair of 5G-RG and W-AGF. In particular, W-CP needs to be able to differentiate NAS messages related to a 5G-RG and to each different AUN3 device served by this 5G-RG and W-UP needs to distinguish between user plane packets for a 5G-RG and user plane packets for each different AUN3 device served by this 5G-RG.\n-\tWhen the registration of an AUN3 device has successfully completed, the 5G-RG establishes a PDU Session on behalf of the AUN3 device. This PDU Session is handled by 5GC as part of the AUN3 subscription and is associated with the SUPI of AUN3 device. An AUN3 device can at a given time only use a single PDU Session. The parameters to establish this PDU session are based on the URSP (if any) for the AUN3 device.\n-\tDifferent QoS parameters may apply to PDU sessions of different AUN3 devices.\n-\tRoaming is not applicable to subscriptions for AUN3 devices.\n-\tThe RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics sent to the W-AGF for a 5G-RG may contain a maximum bit rate for the aggregated traffic of the 5G-RG and of the AUN3 devices served by this 5G-RG. The W-AGF uses this information to limit the maximum bit rate of the aggregated user plane traffic of the 5G-RG and of the AUN3 devices served by this 5G-RG.\nNOTE 2:\tThe coding of the maximum bit rate in RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics is defined by BBF and CableLabs specifications.\nIf W-AGF detects that a 5G-RG is unreachable, then W-AGF triggers the N2 UE context release. The W-AGF identifies if there exists any AUN3 device connected to the 5G-RG through the W-AGF. For each identified AUN3 device, the W-AGF invokes step 5 and 6 of Figure 7.2.8.3-1 which releases the PDU sessions of these AUN3 devices.\n",

It is based on the Registration procedure specified in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2. The NAS protocol is transported between 5G-RG and W-AGF as documented in BBF TR-456 issue 2 [43] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27]. If the 5G-RG needs to be authenticated, mutual authentication is executed between the 5G-RG and AUSF. The details of the authentication procedure are specified in TS 33.501 [11]. In Registration and subsequent Registration procedures via W-5GAN access, the NAS messages are always exchanged between the 5G-RG and the AMF. When possible, the 5G-RG can be authenticated by reusing the existing UE security context in AMF for the 5G-RG.\nFigure 7.2.1.1-1 only shows authentication flow using EAP-AKA' (specifically in step 6c, step 7a and step 7b) but other methods are possible: Authentication procedures that 5G-RG and the 5GC shall support, are specified in TS 33.501 [11]. Specific EAP authentication methods (see TS 33.501 [11]) for 5G-CRG with non-3GPP identities and credentials may be used for isolated network (see TS 33.501 [11]).\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RG registration process using the W-5GAN algorithm, which is a novel approach to wireless network registration. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the registration process, including the selection of a registration algorithm, the generation of a registration code, and the verification of the registration code. The figure also includes a visual representation of the registration process, with the registration algorithm and the registration code being highlighted. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the 5G-RG registration process and its implementation in the W-5GAN algorithm.\nFigure 7.2.1.1-1: 5G-RG Registration via W-5GAN\n1.\tThe 5G-RG connects to a W-5GAN with procedures outside the scope of 3GPP and creates an initial signalling connection using W-CP protocol stack. This connection shall support transfer of AS parameters and NAS messages between 5G-RG and W-AGF.\n2.\tVoid.\n3.\tThe 5G-RG using W-CP protocol stack sends a message that contains the Access Network parameters (GUAMI if available, the selected PLMN or SNPN, Requested NSSAI and Establishment Cause) and a NAS Registration Request message (SUCI or 5G-GUTI as defined in TS 24.501 [22], security parameters/UE security capability, NSSAI parameters, UE MM Core Network Capability, PDU session status, Follow-on request). The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting a signalling connection with 5GC.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile PLMN or SNPN selection is not supported for W-5GAN access, the 5G RG provides a selected PLMN or SNPN ID in Access Network parameters sent to the W-AGF. In this version of the specifications, this selected PLMN or SNPN ID is the home domain of the SUCI. This information is transparently transferred from 5G RG to AUSF via the W-AGF and the AMF; it ensures the AUSF and the 5G RG consider the same information for Key derivations defined in TS 33.501 [11].\nNOTE 2:\tThe steps from 1 to 3 depend on BBF decision for what protocols to use for NAS transport. The step needs to be revised based on their decision.\n4.\tThe W-AGF shall select an AMF based on the received AN parameters and local policy, as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The W-AGF shall then forward the Registration Request received from the UE to the selected AMF within an N2 initial UE message (NAS message, ULI, Establishment cause, UE context request, selected PLMN or SNPN ID).\n5.\tThe selected AMF may decide to request the SUCI by sending a N2 Downlink NAS transport message (NAS Identity Request) message to W-AGF. This NAS message and the response are sent between W-AGF and 5G-RG as described in BBF TR-456 [43] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27]. In this case the RG shall answer with a NAS Identity response.\n6.\tThe AMF may decide to authenticate the 5G-RG by invoking an AUSF. In this case, the AMF shall select an AUSF as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 6.3.4 based on SUPI or SUCI. As defined in 33.501 [11], the AMF transfers the SUCI and the selected PLMN or SNPN ID to the AUSF.\nThe AUSF executes the authentication of the UE as specified in TS 33.501 [11]. The AUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets the authentication data from UDM. The authentication packets are encapsulated within NAS authentication messages. Between W-AGF and AMF, the messages are encapsulated within N2 downlink/uplink NAS transport messages. After the successful authentication the AUSF provides relevant security related information to the AMF. If the AMF provided a SUCI to AUSF, the AUSF shall return the SUPI to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\nThe AMF decides if the Registration Request needs to be rerouted as described in clause TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.3, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF.\n7a.\tIf NAS security context does not exist, the NAS security initiation is performed as described in TS 33.501 [11]: the AMF initiates NAS Security Mode command. If the 5G-RG had no NAS security context in step 1, the UE includes the full Registration Request message as defined in TS 24.501 [22]. If an EAP-AKA' authentication was successfully executed in step 6, the AMF shall encapsulate the EAP-Success received from AUSF within the NAS Security Mode Command message. The message is encapsulated within a N2 downlink NAS transport message.\nThe AMF initiates a NGAP/N2 procedure to provide the 5G-AN with security context as specified in TS 38.413 [23].\n7b.\tThe W-AGF shall forward the NAS Security Mode Command message to 5G-RG.\n7c.\tThe 5G-RG completes the authentication procedure (if initiated in step 6), creates a NAS security context as defined in TS 33.501 [11] and sends the NAS Security Mode Complete message (IMEISV) to the AMF.\n7d.\tThe W-AGF relays the NAS Security Mode Complete message to the AMF in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message.\n8.\t[Conditional] The AMF may request the PEI from the 5G-RG as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2, step 11 of TS 23.502 [3].\n9.\tThe AMF performs step 12-16 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2. At AMF registration to UDM for the 5G-RG, the Access Type non-3GPP access is used. The RAT type used toward PCF and UDM shall indicate wireline access. The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type based on the Global RAN Node ID associated with the N2 interface.\n10.\tThe AMF sends an N2 Initial Context Setup Request message as defined in TS 38.413 [23] and TS 29.413 [42] possibly including as additional W-AGF specific parameter the RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics.\n11a.\tVoid.\n11b.\tVoid.\n12.\tW-AGF notifies the AMF that the 5G-RG context was created by sending a N2 Initial Context Setup Response.\n13.\tThe AMF sends N2 Downlink NAS transport with the NAS Registration Accept message (as defined in step 21 TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2) to the W-AGF, which forwards the NAS Registration accept message to the 5G-RG.\n14.\t[Conditional] The 5G-RG responds with NAS Registration Complete message as described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2 step 22 and W-AGF forwards the NAS Registration Complete message to AMF in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message. The N2 Uplink NAS transport message to AMF may contain W-AGF identities. The AMF stores the received W-AGF identities in the UE context.\nNOTE 3:\tThe W-AGF identities contains a list of Identifiers (i.e. a list of FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations at W-AGF and can be used by SMF as input to select an UPF during PDU Session Establishment, as described in clauses 7.3.1.1 and 7.3.4.\n15.\tThe AMF performs step 23-24 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RG Deregistration procedure via W-5GAN, illustrating the steps involved in deregistering a 5G-RAN (Radio Access Network) from the network. The figure shows the process of deregistering the 5G-RAN, including the steps of deregistering the 5G-RAN, deregistering the 5G-RAN, and deregistering the 5G-RAN. The figure also includes a visual representation of the 5G-RAN, highlighting its components and the steps involved in deregistering it.\nFigure 7.2.1.2-1: 5G-RG Deregistration procedure via W-5GAN\n1.\tThe Deregistration procedure is triggered by one of the events:\n1a.\tFor 5G-RG-initiated Deregistration as in Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, steps 1 to 7 of TS 23.502 [3].\n1b.\tFor network initiated deregistration as in Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1, steps 1 to 6 of TS 23.502 [3].\nIf the 5G-RG is in CM-CONNECTED state either in 3GPP access, W-5GAN access or both:\n-\tthe AMF may explicitly deregister the 5G-RG by sending a Deregistration request message (Deregistration type, access type set to -W-5GAN) to the 5G-RG as in Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1, step 2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The 5G-RG will interpret access type set to non-3GPP as referring to wireline access.\n-\tthe UDM may want to request the deletion of the subscribers RM contexts and PDU Sessions with the reason for removal set to subscription withdrawn to the registered AMF as in Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1, step 1  of TS 23.502 [3].\n2.\tAMF to W-AGF: The AMF sends a N2 UE Context Release Command message to the W-AGF with the cause set to Deregistration to release N2 signalling as defined in clause 4.12.4.2, step 4 of TS 23.502 [3].\n3.\tThe W-AGF may initiate the release of the signalling connection between 5G-RG and W-AGF.\nNOTE:\tWhether this step is needed, and if so, the details of this step is defined by BBF.\n4.\tW-AGF to AMF: The W-AGF acknowledges the N2 UE Context Release Command message by sending N2 UE Context Release Complete message to the AMF as defined in clause 4.12.4.2, step 7 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe FN-RG registration management procedures are followed for both W-5GBAN and W-5GCAN. The FN-RG does not support N1 but instead the W-AGF handles the NAS signalling on behalf of the FN-RG as defined by BBF TR-456 [9] and WT-457 [10] for FN-BRG and by WT-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27] for FN-CRG.\nWhen the connectivity is established between the FN-RG and the W-AGF in the W-5GAN, the W-AGF may authenticate the FN-RG; this is controlled by local policies and defined in BBF specifications. Then when the RM state of the FN-RG is \"RM-DEREGISTERED\" the W-AGF shall perform registration to 5GC as described in this clause, otherwise it performs Service Request as defined in clause 7.2.2.\nOnce the FN-RG is in RM-REGISTERED and CM-CONNECTED the W-AGF may setup PDU session(s) on behalf of the FN-RG (as described in clause 7.3.4).\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a FN-RG registration process using a W-5GAN algorithm. The process involves the registration of a FN-RG (Fiber-Optic Reconfigurable Grating) in a 3D space, with the aim of improving the performance of the network. The figure shows the process in three dimensions, allowing for a better understanding of the steps involved. The W-5GAN algorithm is used to generate a new registration, which is then compared to the original registration to ensure accuracy and reliability.\nFigure 7.2.1.3-1: FN-RG Registration via W-5GAN\n1.\tThe FN-RG connects to a W-AGF (W-5GAN) via a layer-2 (L2) connection, based on Wireline AN specific procedure.\nThe FN-RG is authenticated by the W-5GAN based on Wireline AN specific mechanisms.\n2.\tW-AGF selects an AMF based on the AN parameters and local policy. W-AGF may use the Line ID / HFC identifier provided from the Wireline AN to determine the 5GC and AN parameters to be used for the FN-RG registration. How the W-AGF can determine the necessary 5GC and AN parameters is defined in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] or CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n3.\tW-AGF performs initial registration on behalf of the FN-RG to the 5GC. The W-AGF sends a Registration Request to the selected AMF within an N2 initial UE message (NAS Registration Request, ULI, Establishment cause, UE context request, Allowed NSSAI, Authenticated Indication).\nThe NAS Registration Request contains the SUCI or 5G-GUTI of the FN-RG, security parameters/UE security capability, UE MM Core Network Capability, PDU Session Status, Follow-on request, Requested NSSAI. The 5G-GUTI, if available, has been received from the AMF during a previous registration and stored in W-AGF.\nThe NSSAI parameters are provided based on W-AGF configuration. Based on W-AGF configuration of the 5GC NAS parameters, one or multiple Requested S-NSSAI may be used; e.g. when the W-AGF has been configured to use a specific slice for RG management purposes.\nThe following differences exist, compared to 5G-RG case:\n-\tThe W-AGF use SUCI as defined in clause 4.7.3 and clause 4.7.4.\n-\tThe Authenticated Indication indicates to AMF and 5GC that the FN-RG has been authenticated by the access network.\nThe SUCI is built by the W-AGF based on:\n-\tIn the case of a BBF access: the GLI as defined in clause 4.7.8 together with an identifier of the Home network as described in TS 23.003 [14].\n-\tIn the case of a Cable access: the GCI as defined in clause 4.7.8 together with an identifier of the Home network as described in TS 23.003 [14].\nNOTE 1:\tFurther description for how W-AGF obtain parameters required in AS and NAS message e.g. to build the SUCI is defined in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n4\tIf the AMF receives a SUCI, the AMF shall select an AUSF as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 6.3.4 based on SUCI. If 5G-GUTI is provided, there is no need to map SUCI to SUPI and steps 5-9 can be skipped.\n5.\tAMF sends an authentication request to the AUSF in the form of, Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate. It contains the SUCI of the FN-RG. It also contains an indication that the W-5GAN has authenticated the FN-RG.\n6.\tAUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request to the UDM. It contains the SUCI of the FN-RG and indication that the W-5GAN has authenticated the FN-RG.\n7.\tUDM invokes the SIDF to map the SUCI to a SUPI.\n8.\tUDM sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response to the AUSF. It contains the SUPI corresponding to the SUCI. It also contains an indication that authentication is not required for the FN-RG.\n9.\tAUSF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response to the AMF. This response from AUSF indicates that authentication is successful. The response contains the SUPI corresponding to the SUCI.\nThe procedure described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.3 may apply (the AMF decides if the Registration Request needs to be rerouted, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF).\n10a.\tAMF initiates a NAS security mode command procedure upon successful authentication as defined in TS 33.501 [11].\nThe NAS security mode command is sent from the AMF to the W-AGF in a N2 Downlink NAS transport message.\n10b.\tW-AGF responds to the AMF with a NAS Security Mode Complete message in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message. A NAS security context is created between W-AGF and AMF.\n11.\tThe AMF performs steps 11-16 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe AMF may be configured by local policies to issue EIR check:\n-\tOnly if the PEI is an IMEI; or\n-\tOnly if the PEI is an IMEI or a user device trusted MAC address.\nThese local policies may be defined on a per RAT Type basis.\nAt FN-RG registration to UDM, the Access Type non-3GPP access is used. The UDM, based on Access and Mobility Subscription information authorizes the FN-RG to access the 5GC. For FN-CRG, the AMF compares the list of serving area restrictions it receives from the UDM against the ULI from the W-AGF to check if the location information is allowed for the FN-CRG, as defined in clause 9.5.1. The AMF may also interact with the PCF for obtaining the Access and Mobility policy for the FN-RG.\n12a.\tUpon receiving NAS Security Mode Complete, the AMF shall send an N2 Initial Context Setup Request message as defined in TS 38.413 [23] and TS 29.413 [42] including possibly as additional W-AGF specific parameter the RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics to the W-AGF.\n12b\tW-AGF notifies to the AMF that the FN-RG context was created by sending a N2 Initial Context Setup Response.\n13.\tThe AMF sends the N2 Downlink NAS transport with NAS Registration Accept message (5GS registration result, 5G-GUTI, Equivalent PLMNs or SNPNs, Non-3GPP TAI, Allowed NSSAI, Rejected NSSAI, Configured NSSAI, 5GS network feature support, network slicing indication, Non-3GPP de-registration timer value, Emergency number lists, SOR transport container, NSSAI inclusion mode) to the W-AGF.\nThe following parameters are ignored by the W-AGF if received from the AMF: Emergency number lists, SOR transport container, NSSAI inclusion mode.\nNOTE 2:\tFurther description on how W-AGF handles the parameters received from 5GC is provided in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n14.\tThe W-AGF sends a N2 Uplink NAS transport message, including a NAS Registration Complete message, back to the AMF when the procedure is completed. The W-AGF shall store the 5G-GUTI to be able to send it in potential later NAS procedures.\n15.\tThe AMF performs step 23-24 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe W-AGF may continue by establishing PDU session(s) on behalf of the FN-RG.\nThe deregistration procedure for the FN-RG is similar to that of 5G-RG described in clause 7.2.1.2 but with the following differences:\n-\tThe 5G-RG is replaced with a FN-RG.\n-\tIn step 1a and 1b, the W-AGF sends and receives NAS deregistration request/accept messages on behalf of FN-RG.\n-\tUE-initiated deregistration procedure can be initiated by the W-AGF, when it has lost connectivity to the FN-RG.\n-\tFor both UE/Network-initiated deregistration procedures, the W-AGF may initiate the release of the signalling connection between the FN-RG and W-AGF based on legacy protocols.\nNOTE:\tAs described in clause 6.2.2, the message exchanges between the FN-RG and W-AGF are based on legacy protocols in the wireline access network.\n",

AUSF shall return the SUPI corresponding to the AUN3 device to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\n7.\tSame as step 8 to 12 of figure 7.2.1.1-1 with following modifications\n-\tThe 5G RG uses the MAC address of the AUN3 device as a PEI;\n8.\tThe AMF sends the Registration Accept message related to the AUN3 device to the 5G-RG. This step is executed over the NAS signalling connection and the N2 connection related to the AUN3 device.\n9.\tThe 5G-RG sends the Registration Complete message related to the AUN3 device to the AMF, when the procedure is completed. This step is executed over NAS signalling connection and N2 connection related to the AUN3 device. The 5G-RG shall store the 5G-GUTI of AUN3 device to be able to use it potential later NAS procedures related with the AUN3 device.\n10.\tThe 5G-RG receives the URSP corresponding to the AUN3 device and continues by requesting the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the AUN3 device as specified in clause 7.3.1.\nAUN3 device may get connected behind 5G-RG as defined in clause 4.10c. This clause specifies how an AUN3 device can be de-registered via 5G-RG.\nThe figure depicts a de-registration process for an AUN3 device, which is a type of radio frequency identification (RFID) tag used in various applications. The device is connected to a reader, and the de-registration process involves removing the device's ability to communicate with the reader. This is done by disabling the device's radio frequency (RF) signal, which is then transmitted to the reader. The figure shows the de-registration process in a step-by-step manner, with the device being disconnected from the reader and the reader being powered off. The de-registration process is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of the RFID system.\nFigure 7.2.8.2-1: De-registration of an AUN3 device\n1a.\tThe AUN3 device triggers a disconnection request to the 5G-RG.\nNOTE:\tDetail procedures how AUN3 device triggers the de-registration request is out of scope of 3GPP.\n1a.\tThe 5G-RG sends a De-registration request on behalf of the AUN3 device. This triggers step 1a of Figure 7.2.1.2-1 with the deregistration targeting the AUN3 device and not the 5G-RG. This step is executed over the AUN3 device's NAS signalling connection and AUN3 device's N2 connection.\n1b.\tThe network (AMF or UDM) may determine to de-register an AUN3. This triggers step 1b of Figure 7.2.1.2-1 with the deregistration targeting the AUN3 device and not the 5G-RG.\n2.\tAMF to W-AGF: The AMF sends a N2 UE Context Release Command message to the W-AGF as defined in step 2 of Figure 7.2.1.2-1 but for the N2 connection related with the AUN3 device. W-AGF removes W-CP AN context information for the AUN3 device.\n3.\tAs defined in step 3 of Figure 7.2.1.2-1 but for the signalling connection related with the AUN3 device.\n4.\tThe W-AGF sends a N2 UE Context Release Complete message to the AMF.\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RG Deregistration procedure via W-5GAN when serving AUN3 devices. It illustrates the steps involved in deregistering a 5G-RG (Rural Gigabit Network) from a 5G network, using a W-5GAN (Wireless-5G-to-5G) approach. The figure includes a step-by-step guide on how to deregister the 5G-RG, including the use of W-5GAN, which is a wireless-to-5G network deregistration technique. The figure also includes a visual representation of the steps involved in the deregistration process, such as the use of a W-5GAN algorithm and the steps to deregister the 5G-RG.\nFigure 7.2.8.3-1: 5G-RG Deregistration procedure via W-5GAN when serving AUN3 devices\n1-3.\tThe same as steps 1-3 for Figure 7.2.1-1 with the following modification:\nIn the case of 5G-RG initiated deregistration, 5G-RG shall first deregister each of the registered AUN3 devices connected to it (if any) before initiating the deregistration of itself.\n4.\tW-AGF controls if there exist any AUN3 devices connected to the 5G-RG that are registered to the 5GC through the W-AGF. If there are no AUN3 devices, then steps 5 and 6 shall be ignored.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the W-AGF temporarily maintains the mapping of AUN3 devices and 5G-RG to perform steps 5 and 6 when the 5G-RG's context is released is based on implementation.\n5.\t[conditional] For each AUN3 device identified in step 4, the W-AGF shall send AN Release request as specified in clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]. Here, the cause should indicate the disconnection of 5G-RG.\n6.\t[conditional] Upon receiving the AN Release request with the cause specified in step 5, the AMF shall initiate deregistration of the AUN3 device as specified in clause 4.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. The cause in the deregistration message should indicate the disconnection of 5G-RG.\n7.\tThe W-AGF may initiate the release of the signalling connection between 5G-RG and W-AGF.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether this step is needed, and if so, the details of this step are defined by BBF and/or CableLabs.\n8.\tThe RG disconnects the AUN3 device. How this is done is outside of 3GPP scope.\nWhen a W-AGF receives a N2 UE Context Release Command for a N2 connection related with a 5G -RG, the W-AGF identifies if there exist any AUN3 device connected to the 5G-RG through the W-AGF. For each identified AUN3 device, the W-AGF invokes step 5 and 6 of Figure 7.2.8.3-1.\n",

The procedure applies in non-roaming scenarios.\nThe PDU Session Establishment procedure specified in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 applies with the following changes.\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RG PDU Session establishment via W-5GAN, illustrating the process of establishing a session between a base station (gNB) and a radio resource group (RRG). The figure shows the various components involved, such as the base station, radio resource group, and the wireless access network (WAN). The W-5GAN algorithm is used to establish the session, ensuring reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 7.3.1.1-1: 5G-RG PDU Session establishment via W-5GAN\n1.\tThe 5G-RG shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request message to AMF as specified in step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]. This message shall be sent to W-AGF via the W-CP signalling connection and the W-AGF shall transparently forward it in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message (NAS message, User location information, W-AGF identities) to AMF in the 5GC.\nThe W-AGF identities parameter may be included by the W-AGF and contains a list of Identifiers (i.e. a FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations at W-AGF and can be used by SMF in step 8 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 as input to select an UPF.\nIf the 5G-RG needs Hybrid Access with Multi-Access PDU Session service, the 5G-RG requests a MA PDU Session as defined in clause 4.12. In that case, Steps of TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 apply as modified by clause 4.12.\n2a.\tSteps 2-11 specified in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 are executed according to the PDU Session Establishment procedure over 3GPP access with the deviation that in step 3 an additional parameter W-AGF identities received by the AMF from the W-AGF can be sent from AMF to SMF. SMF can use W-AGF identities in step 8 of TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 for UPF selection.\nFor the LADN service, if the AMF detects the requested DNN is corresponding to a LADN DNN or the default DNN of the requesting S-NSSAI is a LADN DNN, and the access type of 5G-RG equals to wireline access, the AMF will assign \"UE Presence in LADN service area\" indication to be \"OUT\", and provide this indication to SMF.\nNOTE:\tThis induces the SMF to reject the PDU Session establishment request\n2b.\tAs described in steps 11 and 12 of TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1, the AMF shall under request of the SMF send a N2 PDU Session Resource Setup Request message to W-AGF to establish the access resources for this PDU Session. The differences with steps 11 and 12 of TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 are:\n-\tThe W-AGF shall ignore RSN if received from 5GC.\n3.\tBased on its own policies and configuration and based on the QoS flows and QoS parameters received in the previous step, the W-AGF shall determine what W-UP resources are needed for the PDU session. For example, the W-AGF may decide to establish one W-UP resource and associate all QoS profiles with this W-UP resource. In this case, all QoS Flows of the PDU Session would be transferred over one W-UP resource.\n4a.\tThe W-AGF sets up the W-UP resources for the PDU session. This step is specified by BBF for W-5BGAN and by CableLabs for W-5GCAN. The access dependent W-UP resource setup procedure shall provide the identity of the PDU Session associated with the W-UP resource. The W-UP resource setup procedure should support to bind W-UP resources to individual QFI(s) as specified in clause 4.4. The W-UP resource request may also contain other access layer information (e.g., VLAN id) specific for the W5GAN.\n5.\tAfter all W-UP resources are established, the W-AGF shall forward to 5G-RG via the W-CP signalling connection the PDU Session Establishment Accept message received in step 2b.\n6.\tThe W-AGF shall send to AMF an N2 PDU Session Resource Setup Response (PDU Session ID, AN Tunnel Info, List of accepted/rejected QFI(s), User Plane Security Enforcement Policy Notification).\n7.\tAll steps specified in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 after step 14 are executed according to the PDU Session Establishment procedure over 3GPP access.\nThis clause specifies how a 5G-RG can establish a PDU Session with ACS Discovery. The ACS discovery mechanism is further specified in clause 9.6.2.\nWhen a 5G-RG performs ACS Discovery during PDU session establishment procedure, the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment via 3GPP Access as described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 is used, with the following differences:\n-\tUE is replaced by 5G-RG.\n-\tIn FWA scenario the (R)AN is replaced by NG RAN access network, in wireline scenario the (R)AN is replaced by W-5GAN and in HA scenario the (R)AN represents the selected access where the PDU session is being established.\n-\tStep 1. When the 5G-RG sends the PDU session establishment request it includes the DNN which is corresponding to the ACS (per local configuration or per URSP policies). The UE may send in PCO a request to provide ACS information. The UE may include the ACS information request in a DHCP request sent after PDU Session has been established.\n-\tStep 4. The UDM may send the ACS information to the SMF together with the subscription data based on the DNN.\n-\tStep 10. The SMF includes the ACS information in the N1 SM information (PCO) if it has been requested by the UE in step 1 and if it is available at the SMF (if received in Step4).\n-\tStep 19: The 5G-RG may request to receive ACS information via DHCP as described in clause 9.6.2.\n-\tThe 5G-RG uses the received ACS information to establish a connection with the ACS.\nNOTE:\tThe ACS discovery via PCO or via DHCP are mutually exclusive.\n",

This is based on IPTV deployment and 3GPP doesn't define the IPTV access control information that the SMF copies from subscription data to DHCP signalling.\nNOTE 2:\tThe interactions between STB and 5G-RG is specified in BBF TR-124 [5].\nNOTE 3:\tThe description of interactions among the elements part of the IPTV network is out of 3GPP scope.\n5GS can support Unicast Service from IPTV network directly.\nIn order to obtain the multicast service from IPTV network, the Multicast Packets transmission procedure should be performed. The procedure in figure 7.7.1.1-3 describes how the 5G-RG joins an IP multicast group.\nThe figure depicts the transmission procedure of 5G-RG join IP multicast packets, illustrating the steps involved in joining the IP multicast packets of the 5G-RG network. The figure shows the network's IP multicast routing table, which is essential for efficient network communication.\nFigure 7.7.1.1-3: 5G-RG join IP Multicast Packets transmission procedure\n1.\tThe 5G-RG sends an IGMP or MLD Join message via the IP PDU Session user plane.\n2.\tWhen UPF receives the IGMP or MLD Join, the UPF may identify IGMP and MLD packets based on PDR received over N4 as described in clause 4.6 and handle the IGMP and MLD Join accordingly based on FAR as described in clause 4.6. An example is given as below:\n-\tIf the IP Multicast Addressing information included in the IGMP or MLD Join message is allowed to be accessed via the PDU Session , the UPF shall add the PDU Session to the requested multicast group. If requested by an URR, the UPF notifies the SMF that the UE is joining to a multicast group, providing the associated IP Multicast Addressing information.\n-\tIf the IP Multicast Addressing information included in the IGMP or MLD Join message is not allowed to be accessed via the PDU Session, the UPF shall not add the PDU Session to the requested multicast group.\nThe UPF acts as a Multicast Router as defined in IETF RFC 2236 [33], IETF RFC 4604 [21] and IETF RFC 2710 [36]. This may include following actions:\n-\tif the IGMP or MLD Join message is the first IGMP or MLD request the UPF has received about the target IP multicast traffic: the UPF exchanges N6 signalling such as PIM (Protocol-Independent Multicast) in order to connect to the N6 multicast distribution tree related with this IP multicast traffic; This ensures that the UPF receives the DL multicast traffic.\n-\tThe IP multicast related signalling protocol used on N6 (e.g. Sparse Mode PIM-SM) to be supported over N6 is defined by local policies on the UPF.\n2b.\tif the SMF had set the corresponding URR Reporting trigger with a value \"IP multicast join/leave\" (as defined in clause 4.6.5), the UPF issues an UPF report to the SMF and the corresponding IP Multicast addressing information\n2c.\tif the PCF had set the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger set to \"UE join to a multicast group\" trigger\" (as defined in clause 9.7), the SMF issues a SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification (as defined in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.16.5) reporting to the PCF the corresponding IP Multicast addressing information.\n3-4.\tWhen the UPF receives IP multicast packets from multicast server in IPTV network, the UPF select the PDU Session(s) where to transmit the multicast packets based on the multicast group, constructed in step 2 and fulfilling the FAR and QER rules described in clause 7.7.1.1.1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe interactions between STB and 5G-RG are specified in BBF TR-124 [5] and are not shown in figure 7.7.1.1-3.\nThe 5G-RG may leave the IP Multicast Group as follows:\n-\tsending an unsolicited IGMP Leave or MLD Done message;\n-\tIGMPv2 Leave message or a IGMPv3 Membership Report with indication of State Change Record or MLD Done message to request to leave a specific IP Multicast Group. The Message may be solicited by UPF via an IGMP MLD Query message.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Membership Query is typically used in IPTV system to recover from error conditions such as when the Leave message has been dropped by intermediate node or when the STB has been powered off without being able to send a Leave Message.\nThe figure depicts the transmission procedure of 5G-RG leave IP Multicast Packets, illustrating the steps involved in sending multicast packets to the network. The figure includes various components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, which are essential for the successful transmission of multicast packets. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.7.1.1-4: 5G-RG leave IP Multicast Packets transmission procedure\n1a\tThe UPF acting as a Multicast Router as defined in IETF RFC 2236 [33] and IETF RFC 3376 [28] may send an IGMP Query or an MLD Query message.\n1b The 5G-RG may send a IGMP or MLD Membership Report message where the address of a IP Multicast Group is no more included in the list. This message may be the answer to the query in step 1a or it may be sent unsolicited.\n1c The 5G-RG may send an IGMPv2 Leave message or a IGMPv3 Membership Report with indication of State Change Record or MLD Done message to request to leave a specific IP Multicast Group.\n2\tWhen UPF receives the IGMP or MLD message in step 1b or 1c the UPF may identify the IGMP and MLD packets based on PDR received over N4 as described in clause 4.6.3 and handle the IGMP and MLD message accordingly as below:\n-\tIf the IP Multicast Addressing information included in the IGMP or MLD Report message does not include the IP address(es) of a multicast group the UPF stop forwarding the packet to the 5G-RG.\n-\tif the UPF receives an IGMP Leave or MLD Done message, the UPF stops forwarding multicast packets related to the IP multicast Group to the 5G-RG.\nThe UPF acts as a Multicast Router as defined in IETF RFC 2236 [33], IETF RFC 4604 [21] and IETF RFC 2010 [37]. This may include following actions:\n-\tthe UPF may exchange N6 signalling such as PIM (Protocol-Independent Multicast) in order to leave a IP multicast Group if no other 5G-RG are connected to the same IP multicast Group; This ensures that the UPF does no more receive the DL multicast traffic, if not needed.\n-\tThe IP multicast related signalling protocol used on N6 (e.g. Sparse Mode PIM-SM) to be supported over N6 is defined by local policies on the UPF.\n3.\tif the SMF had set the corresponding URR Reporting trigger with a value \"IP multicast join/leave\" (as defined in clause 4.6.5), the UPF issues an UPF report to the SMF the corresponding IP Multicast addressing information\n4.\tif the PCF had set the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger set to \"UE join to a multicast group\" trigger\", the SMF issues a SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification (as defined in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.16.5) reporting to the PCF the corresponding IP Multicast addressing information.\nThe figure depicts a network setup where an AF request is sent to the UDR to provision a Multicast Access Control List (MACL) information. This request is necessary for the network to establish a multicast connection, allowing for the transmission of data to multiple devices simultaneously. The figure illustrates the process of sending the request, the response from the UDR, and the subsequent steps in the network setup.\nFigure 7.7.1.1.4: AF request to provision Multicast Access Control List information into UDR\nNOTE 1:\tThe 5GC NFs used in this scenario are assumed to all belong to the same PLMN (HPLMN).\n1.\tTo create a new request, the AF invokes an Nnef_IPTV_configuration service operation. The request contains the Multicast Access Control List, a GPSI or an External Group Id, AF Transaction Id, application identifier and may contain a DNN and/or a S-NNSAI. To update or remove an existing request, the AF invokes Nnef_IPTV_configuration_Update or Nnef_IPTV_configuration_Delete service operation providing the corresponding AF Transaction Id.\n2.\tThe AF sends its request to the NEF. The NEF ensures the necessary authorization control, including throttling of AF requests and, as described in clause 4.3.6.1 of TS 23.502 [3], mapping from the information provided by the AF into information needed by the 5GC.\n3.\t(in the case of Nnef_IPTV_configuration_Create or Update): The NEF stores the AF request information in the UDR (Data Set = Application Data; Data Subset = IPTV_configuration, Data Key = AF Transaction Internal ID, S-NSSAI and DNN and/or SUPI/Internal-Group-Id).\n(in the case of Nnef_IPTV_configuration_Delete): The NEF deletes the AF requirements in the UDR (Data Set = Application Data; Data Subset = IPTV_configuration, Data Key = AF Transaction Internal ID).\nThe NEF responds to the AF.\n4.\tThe PCF(s) that have subscribed to modifications of AF requests (Data Set = Application Data; Data Subset = IPTV_configuration, Data Key = SUPI/Internal-Group-Id) receive a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of data change from the UDR.\n5.\tThe PCF determines if existing PDU Sessions are potentially impacted by the AF request. For each of these PDU Sessions, the PCF updates the SMF with corresponding new PCC rule(s) by invoking Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation as described in steps 5 and 6 in clause 4.16.5 of TS 23.502 [3].\nTable 7.7.1.1.4-1 shows an example of a Multicast Access Control list provided by the AF in the IPTV domain to the NEF. The Multicast Access Control List defines the access right status (i.e. fully allowed, preview allowed, not allowed) of each of the Multicast channels per subscriber identified by a GPSI.\nTable 7.7.1.1.4-1: Example of a Multicast Access Control list provided by the AF in the IPTV domain\n\nThe NEF maps the GPSI into the SUPI, assigned to a 5G-RG, as described in step 2 in Figure 7.7.1.1.4-1. and stores the Multicast Access Control List in the UDR as shown in Table 7.7.1.1.4-2.\nTable 7.7.1.1.4-2: Example of a Multicast Access Control list stored in UDR within the Application Data Set\n\nIf source Specific Multicast is to be used for a TV Channel, IP Multicast Addressing information corresponds to IP Multicast address and Source IP address.\nThe PCF is assumed to have subscribed to relevant modifications of that UDR data defined in the Table 7.7.1.1.4-2.\n",

The PCF should not provide ANDSP policies. The W-AGF shall ignore any NSWO indication or any ANDSP policies if received from the 5GC.\nThe W-AGF shall use the URSP policy as specified in TS 23.503 [4] with the following modifications:\n-\tTraffic descriptor;\n-\tthe Application Descriptor is not applicable;\n-\tthe DNN is not applicable;\n-\tThe Connection Capabilities Descriptor is not applicable.\nNOTE 1:\tThe FN-RG initiates the W-5GAN session with the W-AGF, for example PPPoE, and consequently the W-AGF does not receive any indication of the application used for that session (e.g. whether it used for web browsing or for any specific application) and any DNN indication from the application, hence the policy including the Application Descriptors and/or DNN will never match the traffic.\nIf the PCF sends UE policy (e.g. URSP), the W-AGF shall store it for the duration that FN-RG is registered. When the FN-RG is deregistered, the UE policy can be removed. Whether it is done immediately, or after a certain period (e.g. for quick recovery from disconnection or fault), or stored permanently it is left to implementation and is out of the scope of this TS.\nIf the URSP for the FN-RG are present in W-AGF (e.g. pre-configured or received from PCF) the W-AGF shall use them as defined for a UE with URSP.\nIf the URSP for the FN-RG are not present in W-AGF, the W-AGF acts based on local configuration, as defined for a UE without URSP.\nIt is assumed that the FN-RG configuration (provided via BBF TR-069 [18]/BBF TR-369 [19]), the URSP rules and the local configuration in the W-AGF are consistent with each other. If the W-AGF detects conflicting requirements based on URSP, local configuration, or requests from the FN-RG, then the URSP rules takes precedence since they are considered the most updated and aligned to the current 5G system conditions.\nUE Policy procedures defined in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.503 [4] are applicable with the following modification:\n-\tRoaming is not applicable to W-5GAN access in this release of specification.\n",

It is assumed that the same set of DSCP values and corresponding QoS are applicable independent of whether UE-requested or network-initiated QoS is used.\nTo support QoS differentiation for the UE's traffic, QoS mapping rules between the RG's 5GC and the UE's 5GC are governed by an SLA (or network configuration in case of single operator), which includes the mapping between the DSCP marking for the IPsec child SAs and the corresponding QoS parameters and also the N3IWF/TNGF IP address(es). The non-alteration of the DSCP field on NWu/NWt is also governed by the SLA and by transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The SLA also governs the RG PDU session IP addresses.\nThe RG's PCF and SMF may provide PCC rules and QoS rules for the available mappings as determined by the SLA. The packet detection filters in the RG's UPF can be based on the N3IWF/TNGF IP address and the DSCP markings on NWu/NWt.\nUE's SMF/PCF may use the UE's local IP address, which is the N6 address of the RG's PDU session, to enable differentiated QoS and charging when the UE is accessing N3IWF/TNGF via a W-5GAN.\nDifferentiated charging is enabled by the awareness of N3IWG/TNGF and RG PDU Session IP addresses and also the mapping between DSCP marking and QoS parameters included in the SLA.\n\n",
