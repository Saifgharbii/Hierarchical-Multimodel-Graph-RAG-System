Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for MR-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE.\nRRC PDUs generated by the SN can be transported via the MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via MCG SRB (SRB1), but subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via MN or SN. When transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration provided by the SN.\nIn E-UTRA connected to EPC, at initial connection establishment SRB1 uses E-UTRA PDCP. If the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-DC is configured or not, after initial connection establishment, MCG SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2) can be configured by the network to use either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP (either SRB1 and SRB2 are both configured with E-UTRA PDCP, or they are both configured with NR PDCP). Change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP (or vice-versa) is supported via a handover procedure (reconfiguration with mobility) or, for the initial change of SRB1 from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP, with a reconfiguration without mobility before the initial security activation.\nIf the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC), the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB3) to enable RRC PDUs for the SN to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. RRC PDUs for the SN can only be transported directly to the UE for SN RRC reconfiguration not requiring any coordination with the MN. Measurement reporting for mobility within the SN can be done directly from the UE to the SN if SRB3 is configured.\nIn NR-DC, the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB5) to enable RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. The application measurement report can be sent directly from the UE to the SN if SRB5 is configured and indicated by the network for the application measurement reporting.\nSplit SRB is supported for all MR-DC options, allowing duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the MN, via the direct path and via the SN. Split SRB uses NR PDCP. This version of the specification does not support the duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the SN via the MN and SN paths.\nIn EN-DC, the SCG configuration is kept in the UE during suspension. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with EN-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, the UE releases the SCG configuration (but not the radio bearer configuration) during resumption initiation.\nIn MR-DC with 5GC, the UE stores the PDCP/SDAP configuration and the SCG configuration when moving to RRC Inactive. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with MR-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, it releases the SCG configuration.\nThe figure depicts the control plane architecture for EN-DC (Energy-Efficient Networks with DC Power) and MR-DC (Multipath-Enabled DC Power) systems, highlighting the key components such as the control plane, energy management, and power distribution.

These three bearer types are depicted in Figure 4.2.2-1 for MR-DC with EPC (EN-DC) and in Figure 4.2.2-2 for MR-DC with 5GC (NGEN-DC, NE-DC and NR-DC).\nIn E-UTRA connected to EPC, if the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-DC is configured or not, the network can configure either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP for MN terminated MCG bearers while NR PDCP is always used for all other bearers. Change from E-UTRA to NR PDCP or vice-versa can be performed via a reconfiguration procedure (with or without handover), either using release and add of the DRBs or using the full configuration option.\nIn MR-DC with 5GC, NR PDCP is always used for all bearer types. In NGEN-DC, E-UTRA RLC/MAC is used in the MN while NR RLC/MAC is used in the SN. In NE-DC, NR RLC/MAC is used in the MN while E-UTRA RLC/MAC is used in the SN. In NR-DC, NR RLC/MAC is used in both MN and SN.\nThe figure depicts the radio protocol architecture for MCG, SCG, and split bearers in a multi-radio-domain (MR-DC) environment, with an emphasis on the EPC (Enhanced Packet Classification) system. The architecture is designed to support multiple radio protocols, including MCG, SCG, and split bearers, while ensuring efficient communication and data transmission. The figure also highlights the importance of EPC in managing the radio protocol hierarchy and ensuring seamless communication between different radio protocols.\nFigure 4.2.2-1: Radio Protocol Architecture for MCG, SCG and split bearers from a UE perspective in MR-DC with EPC (EN-DC)\nThe figure depicts the radio protocol architecture for M C G, SCG, and split bearers from a UE perspective in MR-DC with 5GC (NGEN-DC, NE-DC, and NR-DC) scenarios. It illustrates the use of radio frequency (RF) signals, including the 5G core network (5GC), radio access network (RAN), and the user equipment (UE) in a multi-radio environment. The figure highlights the importance of radio frequency (RF) diversity and beamforming techniques to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4.2.2-2: Radio Protocol Architecture for MCG, SCG and split bearers from a UE perspective in MR-DC with 5GC (NGEN-DC, NE-DC and NR-DC).\nFrom a network perspective, each bearer (MCG, SCG and split bearer) can be terminated either in MN or in SN.

            "description": "In MR-DC, two or more Component Carriers (CCs) may be aggregated over two cell groups. A UE may simultaneously receive or transmit on multiple CCs depending on its capabilities. The maximum number of configured CCs for a UE is 32 for DL and UL. Depending on UE's capabilities, up to 31 CCs can be configured for an E-UTRA cell group when the NR cell group is configured. For the NR cell group, the maximum number of configured CCs for a UE is 16 for DL and 16 for UL.\nA gNB may configure the same Physical Cell ID (PCI) to more than one NR cell it serves. To avoid PCI confusion for MR-DC, NR PCIs should be allocated in a way that an NR cell is uniquely identifiable by a PCell identifier. This PCell is in the coverage area of an NR cell included in the MR-DC operation. In addition, NR PCIs should only be re-used in NR cells on the same SSB frequency sufficiently distant from each other. X2-C/Xn-C signalling supports disambiguation of NR PCIs by including the CGI of the PCell in respective X2AP/XnAP messages (e.g. SGNB ADDITION REQUEST/S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST) and by providing neighbour cell relationship via non-UE associated signaling (e.g. via the Xn Setup procedure or the NG-RAN node Configuration Update procedure).\nNR-DC supports the case of no synchronization between PCell and PSCell. However, some UEs may support NR-DC only if slot-level synchronization between PCell and PSCell is ensured.\nIn MR-DC, power sharing can be performed within a frequency range with either semi-static or dynamic power sharing. With semi-static power sharing, the maximum UE transmission power is semi-statically split between MCG and SCG by RRC configuration. With dynamic power sharing:\n-\twhen determining the UL transmission power of an SCG transmission in (NG)EN-DC or in NR-DC, the UE takes into account transmission(s) on MCG overlapping with any part of the SCG transmission;\n-\twhen determining the UL transmission power of an MCG transmission in NE-DC, the UE takes into account transmission(s) on SCG overlapping with any part of the MCG transmission.\nDetails are specified in TS38.213[21].\nIn EN-DC, a UE configured with uplink Tx switching can have Tx dynamically switched between E-UTRA uplink carrier and NR uplink carrier for enabling 2Tx UL transmission on NR carrier.\n",

The serving cells other than the PCell can be activated/deactivated by RRC or MAC Control Element. For activation/deactivation by MAC Control Element, the serving cells of the MCG other than the PCell can only be activated/deactivated by the MAC Control Element received on MCG, and the serving cells of the SCG other than PSCell can only be activated/ deactivated by the MAC Control Element received on SCG. The MAC entity applies the bitmap for the associated cells of either MCG or SCG. When the SCG is not deactivated, the PSCell is always activated like the PCell (i.e. deactivation timer is not applied to PSCell). With the exception of PUCCH SCell, one deactivation timer is configured per SCell by RRC.\nIn MR-DC, semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) resources and configured grant (CG) resources can be configured on serving cells in both MCG and SCG.\nIn MR-DC, for 4-step RA type, contention based random access (CBRA) procedure is supported on both PCell and PSCell while contention free random access (CFRA) procedure is supported on all serving cells in both MCG and SCG. For 2-step RA type, CBRA can be supported on the PCell, if the MN is a gNB (i.e. for NE-DC and NR-DC) and on the PSCell, if the SN is a gNB (i.e, for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC) while CFRA is only supported on the PCell, if the MN is a gNB (i.e. for NE-DC and NR-DC).\nIn (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, when SCG is deactivated as described in clause 7.13, the TA timer associated with SCG continues running, the UE considers the TA is valid as long as TA timer is running. In case of SCG activation, the UE can be instructed by the network to perform random access towards PSCell even if the TA timer associated with PSCell is running and RLF and beam failure are not declared. Besides, the UE can be instructed by the network to perform SCG activation without performing random access, if the TA timer associated with PSCell is running and RLM and beam failure detection are configured but RLF or beam failure is not declared. In case of network-initiated SCG activation, both CBRA and CFRA on PSCell are supported. For CFRA, the dedicated RACH resources can be provided in the RRC message used to activate SCG.\nIn MR-DC, the BSR configuration, triggering and reporting are independently performed per cell group. For split bearers, the PDCP data is considered in BSR in the cell group(s) configured by RRC.\nIn MR-DC, separate DRX configurations are provided for MCG and SCG. A secondary DRX group can be configured in MR-DC for a cell group that includes cells in different Frequency Ranges as specified in TS 38.331 [4].\nIn MR-DC, PHR is independently configured per cell group. Events in one cell group can trigger power headroom reporting in both MCG and SCG. Power headroom information for one cell group is also included in a PHR transmitted in the other cell group. While the SCG is deactivated, PHR for SCG is not reported.\nIn MR-DC, consistent LBT failure recovery procedure as described in clause 5.6.1 in TS 38.300 [3] can be configured for both MAC entities of MCG and/or SCG when operating with shared spectrum channel access.\nIn MR-DC, for power saving purpose, the UE can be configured with DCP to be monitored on the PCell, if the MN is a gNB (i.e. for NE-DC and NR-DC) and/or with DCP to be monitored on the PSCell, if the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC).\nIn MR-DC, the UE may be configured with enhanced intra-UE overlapping resources prioritization on MN, if the MN is a gNB (i.e. for NE-DC and NR-DC) and on SN, if the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC).\n",

For secondary node changes triggered by the SN, the RRM measurement configuration is maintained by the SN which also processes the measurement reporting, without providing the measurement results to the MN.\nMeasurements can be configured independently by the MN and by the SN (intra-RAT measurements on serving and non-serving frequencies). The MN indicates the maximum number of frequency layers and measurement identities of intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurement that can be used in the SN to ensure that UE capabilities are not exceeded. In MR-DC, to assist MN to identify the measurement type, the SN indicates to the MN the list of SCG serving frequencies. In NR-DC, to assist SN to identify the measurement type, the MN indicates also to SN the list of MCG serving frequencies. The SN can also request the MN for new maximum values of the number of measurement identities that it can configure, and it is up to the MN whether to accommodate the SN request, based on the capability coordination principles as described in 7.3. If the SN receives from the MN a new value for the maximum number of measurement identities, is SN responsibility to ensure that its configured measurement identities to comply with the new limit.\nIf MN and SN both configure measurements on the same carrier frequency then the configurations need to be consistent (if the network wants to ensure these are considered as a single measurement layer). Each node (MN and SN) can configure independently a threshold for the SpCell quality. In (NG)EN-DC scenario, when the PCell quality is above the threshold configured by the MN, the UE is still required to perform inter-RAT measurements configured by the MN on the SN RAT (while it's not required to perform intra-RAT measurements); when the PSCell quality is above the threshold configured by the SN, the UE is not required to perform measurements configured by the SN. In NR-DC or NE-DC scenario, when the PCell quality is above the threshold configured by the MN, the UE is not required to perform measurements configured by the MN; when the PSCell quality is above the threshold configured by the SN, the UE is not required to perform measurements configured by the SN.\nNOTE:\tThe SN cannot renegotiate the number of frequency layers allocated by the MN in this version of the protocol.\nIn MR-DC, both the MN and the SN can configure CGI reporting. The MN can configure CGI reporting for intra-RAT and inter-RAT cells but the SN can only configure CGI reporting of intra-RAT cells. At any point in time, the UE can be configured with at most one CGI reporting configuration. For CGI reporting coordination, the SN sends the CGI measurement request and the embedded CGI reporting configuration to the MN. Optionally, the SN sends the unknown cell information to the MN. If there is no ongoing CGI reporting measurement on UE side, the MN forwards the SN CGI measurement configuration to UE. Otherwise the MN rejects the request by sending X2/Xn reject message. In case the SN indicates the unknown cell information, and the CGI information of the requested cell is already available in the MN, the MN can also reject the request, and sends the CGI information of the requested cell to the SN. The SN cannot configure the CGI measurement using the SRB3.\nBoth MN-configured and SN-configured RRM measurements are supported while the SCG is deactivated. The PSCell measurement cycle when in deactivated SCG state is configured by RRC.\nWhen SRB3 is not configured or the SCG is deactivated, reports for measurements configured by the SN are sent on SRB1. When SRB3 is configured and SCG transmission of radio bearers is not suspended and the SCG is not deactivated, reports for measurements configured by the SN are sent on SRB3.\nMeasurement results related to the target SN can be provided by MN to target SN at MN initiated SN change procedure. Measurement results of target SN can be forwarded from source SN to target SN via MN at SN initiated SN change procedure. Measurement results related to the target SN can be provided by source MN to target MN at Inter-MN handover with/without SN change procedure.\nMeasurement results according to measurement configuration from the MN are encoded according to SN RRC when they are provided by MN to SN in SgNB Addition Request message / SN Addition Request message. During SN initiated SN change procedure, measurement results according to measurement configuration from SN are encoded according to SN RRC when they are provided by MN to SN in SgNB Addition Request message / SN Addition Request message.\nPer-UE or per-FR measurement gaps can be configured, depending on UE capability to support independent FR measurement and network preference. Per-UE gap applies to both FR1 (E-UTRA, UTRA-FDD and NR) and FR2 (NR) frequencies. For per-FR gap, two independent gap patterns (i.e. FR1 gap and FR2 gap) are configured for FR1 and FR2 respectively. The UE may also be configured with a per-UE gap sharing configuration (applying to per-UE gap) or with two separate gap sharing configurations (applying to FR1 and FR2 measurement gaps respectively) [8].\nA measurement gap configuration is always provided:\n-\tIn EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NE-DC, for UEs configured with E-UTRA inter-frequency measurements as described in table 9.1.2-2 in TS 38.133 [8];\n-\tIn EN-DC and NGEN-DC, for UEs configured with UTRAN and GERAN measurements as described in table 9.1.2-2 in TS 38.133 [8];\n-\tIn NR-DC, for UEs configured with E-UTRAN measurements as described in table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [8];\n-\tIn NR-DC, NE-DC, for UEs configured with UTRAN measurements as described in table 9.4.6.3-1 and 9.4.6.3-2 in TS 38.133 [8];\n-\tIn MR-DC, for UEs that support either per-UE or per-FR gaps, when the conditions to measure SSB based inter-frequency measurement or SSB based intra-frequency measurement as described in clause 9.2.4 in TS 38.300 [3] are met;\nIf per-UE gap is used, the MN decides the gap pattern and the related gap sharing configuration. If per-FR gap is used, in EN-DC and NGEN-DC, the MN decides the FR1 gap pattern and the related gap sharing configuration for FR1, while the SN decides the FR2 gap pattern and the related gap sharing configuration for FR2; in NE-DC and NR-DC, the MN decides both the FR1 and FR2 gap patterns and the related gap sharing configurations.\nIn EN-DC and NGEN-DC, the measurement gap configuration from the MN to the UE indicates if the configuration from the MN is a per-UE gap or an FR1 gap configuration. The MN also indicates the configured per-UE or FR1 measurement gap pattern and the gap purpose (per-UE or per-FR1) to the SN. Measurement gap configuration assistance information can be exchanged between the MN and the SN. For the case of per-UE gap, the SN indicates to the MN the list of SN configured frequencies in FR1 and FR2 measured by the UE. For the per-FR gap case, the SN indicates to the MN the list of SN configured frequencies in FR1 measured by the UE and the MN indicates to the SN the list of MN configured frequencies in FR2 measured by the UE.\nIn NE-DC, the MN indicates the configured per-UE or FR1 measurement gap pattern to the SN. The SN can provide a gap request to the MN, without indicating any list of frequencies.\nIn NR-DC, the MN indicates the configured per-UE, FR1 or FR2 measurement gap pattern and the gap purpose to the SN. The SN can indicate to the MN the list of SN configured frequencies in FR1 and FR2 measured by the UE.\nIn (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SMTC can be used for PSCell addition/PSCell change to assist the UE in finding the SSB in the target PSCell. In case the SMTC of the target PSCell is provided by both MN and SN it is up to UE implementation which one to use.\nCLI measurements can be configured for NR cells in all MR-DC options. In EN-DC and NGEN-DC, only the SN can configure CLI measurements. In NE-DC, only the MN can configure CLI measurements. In NR-DC, both the MN and the SN can configure CLI measurements, and the MN informs the SN about the maximum number of CLI measurement resources that can be configured by the SN to ensure that the total number of CLI measurement resources does not exceed the UE capabilities.\nFor MUSIM operation, when the UE is configured to operate in NR-DC in Network A (as described in TS 38.300 [3]), the MN indicates the per-UE MUSIM gap configuration to the SN.\n",

Some MR-DC related capabilities are in the MR-DC container e.g. MR-DC band combinations, while other MR-DC related capabilities are contained in the E-UTRA and NR capability containers e.g. feature sets as described in TS 38.300 [3]. The MR-DC capabilities in the MR-DC container need to be visible to both MN and SN, while the capabilities in the E-UTRA and NR containers only need to be visible to the node of the concerned RAT.\nIn NR-DC, all NR-DC related capabilities are in the NR capability container and are visible to both MN and SN.\nWhen retrieving MR-DC related capabilities, the MN shall provide an MR-DC filter that affects the MR-DC related capabilities in MR-DC, E-UTRA and NR capability containers. When using different UE capability enquiry messages to retrieve the different containers, the MN shall employ the same MR-DC filter in all enquiry messages. In the E-UTRA RRC UE capability enquiry, the MR-DC filter is also used for retrieval of NR capabilities i.e. there is in fact one MR-DC/NR filter (while there is a separate filter for E-UTRA capabilities). Furthermore, the MN stores the retrieved capabilities and the corresponding filter, used to retrieve those capabilities, in the core network for later use.\nFor the UE capabilities requiring coordination between E-UTRA and NR (i.e. band combinations, feature sets and the maximum power for FR1 the UE can use in SCG) or between NR MN and NR SN (i.e. band combinations, feature sets and the maximum power for FR1 and FR2), it is up to the MN to decide on how to resolve the dependency between MN and SN configurations. The MN then provides the resulting UE capabilities usable for SCG configuration to the SN, including the list of allowed MR-DC band combinations and feature sets, and the SN indicates the selected band combination and feature set to the MN. When subsequently reconfiguring the SCG, the SN should inform the MN whenever the band combination and/or feature set it selected for the SCG changes (i.e. even if the selection concerns a band combination and feature set that is allowed). As part of an SN initiated SN modification, the SN may also indicate the desired UE capabilities usable for SCG configuration (e.g. a band combination and a feature set) outside those allowed by the MN (i.e. it may re-negotiate the UE capabilities for SCG configuration), and it is up to the MN to make the final decision whether to accept or reject the request. If the MN accepts the request, the MN may provide the resulting UE capabilities e.g. by indicating the allowed band combinations and feature sets. If MN accepts but does not provide resulting UE capabilities, SN assumes the UE capabilities usable for SCG configuration are updated in accordance with the modification it requested. Otherwise, the MN rejects the request by sending X2/Xn refuse message.\nIn EN-DC and MR-DC with 5GC, the MN may provide the UE radio capability ID to the SN. For EN-DC, the SN may retrieve the UE Radio Capability information associated to a UE radio capability ID from the MN. For MR-DC with 5GC, the SN may retrieve the UE radio capability information associated to a UE radio capability ID from the 5GC.\nFor MUSIM operation, when the UE is configured to operate in NR-DC in Network A (as described in TS 38.300 [3]), the MN may indicate the temporary capability restriction to the SN based on the temporary capability restrictions indicated by the UE.\n",

Two scenarios are supported, as shown in Figure 7.12-1.\nIn this figure, we can observe the transmission in a 5G network, specifically in the F1-C mode, which is a key feature of the NR-DC (Non-Line-of-Sight) transmission. The figure illustrates the various scenarios where the transmission takes place, including Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. The transmission is depicted in two different modes: F1-C and F1-C-D, which represent different transmission modes. The figure also shows the use of various components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.12-1: F1-C transfer in NR-DC; a) Scenario 1; b) Scenario 2\nScenario 1: IAB-node exchanges F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet with the SN (F1-terminating IAB-donor as specified in TS 38.401 [7]) using NR access link via MN (non-F1-terminating IAB-donor), and exchanges F1-U traffic using backhaul link(s) with SN. SRB2 is used for transporting the F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet between IAB-MT and MN (see TS 38.331 [4]), and the F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet is transferred in a container via XnAP between MN and SN, see TS 38.423 [5].\nScenario 2: IAB-node exchanges F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet with the MN (F1-terminating IAB-donor) using NR access link via SN (non-F1-terminating IAB-donor), and exchanges F1-U traffic using backhaul link(s) with MN. Split SRB2 is used for transporting the F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet between IAB-MT and SN (see TS 38.331 [4]), and the F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet is transferred in a container via XnAP between SN and MN, see TS 38.423 [5].\nThe F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or the F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet can be transferred either over BAP sublayer or over SRB, but the two mechanisms cannot be supported simultaneously on the same parent link. The F1-AP message encapsulated in SCTP/IP or the F1-C related (SCTP/)IP packet is transferred over BAP sublayer, if the BH RLC channel used for transferring the F1-C traffic is configured on the cell group indicated for F1-C traffic transfer according to TS 38.331 [4].\n7.13\tActivation and Deactivation of SCG\nTo enable reasonable UE battery consumption while having fast usage of SCG when (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC is configured, an activation/deactivation mechanism of SCG is supported. While the SCG is deactivated, there is no transmission via SCG RLC bearers. Only the NR SCG can be deactivated, and all SCG SCell(s) are in deactivated state while the SCG is deactivated.\nUpon SCG deactivation and while the SCG is deactivated, the network ensures that there is no uplink control PDU transmission to the deactivated SCG (e.g. the network releases statusReportRequired from PDCP entities of SCG bearers if configured, the network does not perform QoS flow remapping from a DRB associated to the deactivated SCG to another DRB). The network ensures the SCG is activated while PDCP duplication is activated for SCG RLC entities associated with a PDCP entity.\nNOTE:\tUpon SCG (de)activation, it is up to the network to ensure there is no pending SDUs or PDUs in SCG RLC entity (e.g. instructs the UE to perform PDCP data recovery and RLC re-establishment/release, if needed).\nWhile the SCG is deactivated, the UE will not transmit PUSCH, SRS and CSI report on SCG, and the UE is not required to monitor PDCCH or receive DL-SCH on SCG. If configured by the network, the UE performs radio link monitoring on the SCG and beam failure detection on the SCG while SCG is deactivated. In case of SCG activation without performing random access, the network can indicate TCI states to UE for PDCCH/PDSCH reception on PSCell, if not provided, the UE uses the previously activated TCI states.\nThe MN can configure the SCG as activated or deactivated upon e.g. PSCell addition, PSCell change, RRC Resume or handover. In case the SCG is configured as deactivated, the UE does not perform random access towards the PSCell. The network can trigger SCG RRC reconfiguration (e.g. PSCell change, configuration update) when deactivating the SCG and while the SCG is in deactivated state.\nSCG activation can be requested by the MN, by the SN and by the UE. SCG deactivation can be requested by the MN and by the SN. For UL data arrival on SCG bearer(s) while the SCG is deactivated, the UE indicates to the MN that it has UL data to transmit over SCG bearer. During handover procedure, the target MN can indicate the SCG state in the RRC reconfiguration message sent to the UE by the source MN.\nNetwork can configure whether the UE is allowed to indicate a preference for SCG deactivation to the MN.\n",

The figure is a visual representation of the process, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 10.2.1-1: Secondary Node Addition procedure\n1.\tThe MN decides to request the SN to allocate resources for a specific E-RAB, indicating E-RAB characteristics (E-RAB parameters, TNL address information corresponding to bearer type). In addition, for bearers requiring SCG radio resources, MN indicates the requested SCG configuration information, including the entire UE capabilities and the UE capability coordination result. In this case, the MN also provides the latest measurement results for SN to choose and configure the SCG cell(s). The MN may request the SN to allocate radio resources for split SRB operation. The MN always provides all the needed security information to the SN (even if no SN terminated bearers are setup) to enable SRB3 to be setup based on SN decision. In case of bearer options that require X2-U resources between the MN and the SN, the MN provides X2-U TNL address information for the respective E-RAB, X2-U DL TNL address information for SN terminated bearers, X2-U UL TNL address information for MN terminated bearers. In case of SN terminated split bearers the MN provides the maximum QoS level that it can support. The MN may request the SCG to be activated or deactivated. The SN may reject the addition request.\nNOTE 1:\tFor split bearers, MCG and SCG resources may be requested of such an amount, that the QoS for the respective E-RAB is guaranteed by the exact sum of resources provided by the MCG and the SCG together, or even more.

It is also allowed that all E-RABs can be configured as SN terminated bearers, i.e. there is no E-RAB established as an MN terminated bearer.\n2.\tIf the RRM entity in the SN is able to admit the resource request, it allocates respective radio resources and, dependent on the bearer option, respective transport network resources. For bearers requiring SCG radio resources, the SN triggers Random Access so that synchronisation of the SN radio resource configuration can be performed. The SN decides the PSCell and other SCG SCells and provides the new SCG radio resource configuration to the MN in a NR RRC configuration message contained in the SgNB Addition Request Acknowledge message. In case of bearer options that require X2-U resources between the MN and the SN, the SN provides X2-U TNL address information for the respective E-RAB, X2-U UL TNL address information for SN terminated bearers, X2-U DL TNL address information for MN terminated bearers. For SN terminated bearers, the SN provides the S1-U DL TNL address information for the respective E-RAB and security algorithm.

The figure shows a series of nodes, each labeled with a number, and a conditional node is added to the network. This addition is performed based on the network's configuration, ensuring that the network remains stable and efficient. The figure is essential for understanding the network's configuration and for maintaining its performance.\nFigure 10.2.1-2: Conditional Secondary Node Addition procedure\n1.\tThe MN decides to configure CPA for the UE and requests the candidate SN(s) to allocate resources for a specific E-RAB, indicating E-RAB characteristics (E-RAB parameters, TNL address information corresponding to bearer type), indicating that the request is for CPAC and providing the upper limit for the number of PSCells that can be prepared by the candidate SN. In addition, for the bearers requiring SCG radio resources, the MN indicates the requested SCG configuration information, including the entire UE capabilities and the UE capability coordination result. In this case, the MN also provides the candidate cells recommended by MN via the latest measurement results for the candidate SN to choose from and configure the SCG cell(s). The MN may request the candidate SN to allocate radio resources for split SRB operation. The MN always provides all the needed security information to the candidate SN (even if no SN terminated bearers are setup) to enable SRB3 to be setup based on SN decision. In case of bearer options that require X2-U resources between the MN and the candidate SN, the MN provides X2-U TNL address information for the respective E-RAB, X2-U DL TNL address information for SN terminated bearers, X2-U UL TNL address information for MN terminated bearers. In case of SN terminated split bearers the MN provides the maximum QoS level that it can support. The candidate SN may reject the addition request.\nNOTE 6:\tFor split bearers, MCG and SCG resources may be requested of such an amount, that the QoS for the respective E-RAB is guaranteed by the exact sum of resources provided by the MCG and the SCG together, or even more.

It is also allowed that all E-RABs can be configured as SN terminated bearers, i.e. there is no E-RAB established as an MN terminated bearer.\n2.\tIf the RRM entity in the candidate SN is able to admit the resource request, it allocates respective radio resources and, dependent on the bearer option, respective transport network resources, and provides the prepared PSCell ID(s) to the MN. For bearers requiring SCG radio resources, the candidate SN configures Random Access so that synchronisation of the SN radio resource configuration can be performed at the CPA execution. From the list of cells indicated within the measurement results provided by the MN, the candidate SN decides the list of PSCell(s) to prepare (considering the maximum number indicated by the MN) and, for each prepared PSCell, the candidate SN decides SCG SCells and provides the corresponding SCG radio resource configuration to the MN in an NR RRCReconfiguration** message contained in the SgNB Addition Request Acknowledge message. The candidate SN can either accept or reject each of the candidate cells listed within the measurement results indicated by the MN, i.e. it cannot configure any alternative candidates. In case of bearer options that require X2-U resources between the MN and the candidate SN, the candidate SN provides X2-U TNL address information for the respective E-RAB, X2-U UL TNL address information for SN terminated bearers, X2-U DL TNL address information for MN terminated bearers. For SN terminated bearers, the candidate SN provides the S1-U DL TNL address information for the respective E-RAB and security algorithm. If SCG radio resources have been requested, the SCG radio resource configuration is provided.\nNOTE 8:\tFor the SN terminated split bearer option, the candidate SN may either decide to request resources from the MN of such an amount, that the QoS for the respective E-RAB is guaranteed by the exact sum of resources provided by the MN and the candidate SN together, or even more. The candidate SN decision is reflected in step 2 by the E-RAB parameters signalled to the MN, which may differ from E-RAB parameters received in step 1. The QoS level requested from the MN shall not exceed the level that the MN offered when setting up the split bearer in step 1.\nNOTE 9:\tIn case of SN terminated bearers, early data forwarding may take place after step 2. For the early data forwarding of SN terminated bearers, the MN forwards the PDCP SDU to the candidate SN and also sends the Early Status Transfer message. For the early transmission of MN terminated split/SCG bearers, the MN forwards the PDCP PDU to the candidate SN.\n3.\tThe MN sends to the UE an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the CPA configuration, i.e. a list of RRCConnectionReconfiguration* messages and associated execution conditions. Each RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message contains the SCG configuration in the RRCReconfiguration** message received from the candidate SN in step 2 and possibly an MCG configuration. Besides, the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message can also include an updated MCG configuration, e.g., to configure the required conditional measurements.\n4.\tThe UE applies the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message received in step 3, stores the CPA configuration and replies to the MN with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n4a.\tThe UE starts evaluating the execution conditions.

Bearer termination point change is realized by adding the new bearer configuration and releasing the old bearer configuration within a single MN initiated SN Modification procedure for the respective E-RAB. The MN uses this procedure to perform handover within the same MN while keeping the SN. The MN also uses the procedure to query the current SCG configuration, e.g. when delta configuration is applied in an MN initiated SN change.

The UE applies the new configuration, synchronizes to the MN (if instructed, in case of intra-MN handover) and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete, including a NR RRC response message, if needed. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n6.\tUpon successful completion of the reconfiguration, the success of the procedure is indicated in the SgNB Reconfiguration Complete message.\n7.\tIf instructed, the UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell of the SN as described in SgNB addition procedure.

The SN may send the report when the transmission of the related bearer is stopped.\n11.\tIf applicable, a path update is performed.\nSN initiated SN Modification with MN involvement\nThe figure depicts a SN modification procedure, showing the steps involved in initiating a SN with MN involvement. It includes the MN's involvement in the SN initiation process, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of the network.\nFigure 10.3.1-2: SN Modification procedure - SN initiated with MN involvement\nThe SN uses the procedure to perform configuration changes of the SCG within the same SN, e.g. to trigger the release of SCG bearer(s) and the SCG RLC bearer of split bearer(s) (upon which the MN may release the bearer or maintain current bearer type or reconfigure it to an MCG bearer, either MN terminated or SN terminated), to trigger the release of SCG resources (e.g., release SCG lower layer resources but keep SN), and to trigger PSCell change (e.g. when a new security key is required or when the MN needs to perform PDCP data recovery). The MN cannot reject the release request of SCG bearer and the SCG RLC bearer of a split bearer and the release request of SCG resources. The SN also uses this procedure to activate or deactivate the SCG. The MN shall either accept modification of all of the requested SCG bearer(s) and the SCG RLC bearer of split bearer(s) and the request of activation or deactivation of the SCG, or fail the procedure. Figure 10.3.1-2 shows an example signalling flow for an SN initiated SgNB Modification procedure, with MN involvement.\n1.\tThe SN sends the SgNB Modification Required message including a NR RRC configuration message, which may contain bearer context related, other UE context related information and the new SCG radio resource configuration. The SN may request the SCG to be activated or deactivated. For bearer release or modification, a corresponding E-RAB list is included in the SgNB Modification Required message. In case of change of security key, the PDCP Change Indication indicates that a S-KgNB update is required. In case the MN needs to perform PDCP data recovery, the PDCP Change Indication indicates that PDCP data recovery is required. In case SN decides to trigger SCG release, the E-RABs to be modified list includes all the E-RABs of the UE with SCG resource indicated as not present for each E-RAB.\nThe SN can decide whether the change of security key is required.\nNOTE 1a:\tIn case SN includes the indication of full RRC configuration in SgNB Modification Required message to MN e.g. comprehension failure upon intra-CU inter-DU change, MN performs release and add of the NR SCG part of the configuration but does not release SN terminated radio bearers towards the UE.\nNOTE 1b:\tIn case that a MN initiated conditional reconfiguration (e.g. CHO or MN initiated inter-SN CPC) is prepared, and if any execution of a prepared SN initiated intra-SN CPC procedure or reconfiguration of the SCG, the SN notifies to the MN via the SgNB Modification Required message. In this case, the steps 2 and 3 are skipped.\nNOTE 1c:\tIn case of SN initiated inter-SN CPC and in case that a candidate SN triggered the SN Initiated SN Modification procedure to include some more prepared PSCells (within the candidate cells suggested by the source SN in SN initiated inter-SN CPC) or to remove some prepared PSCells, the MN may decide to trigger the step 2 towards the source SN.\n2/3.\tThe MN initiated SN Modification procedure may be triggered by the SN Modification Required message (e.g. to provide information such as data forwarding addresses, new SN security key, measurement gap, etc...)\nNOTE 2:\tIf only SN security key is provided in step 2, the MN does not need to wait for the reception of step 3 to initiate the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure.\n4.\tThe MN sends the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including a NR RRC configuration message to the UE including the new SCG radio resource configuration.\n5.\tThe UE applies the new configuration and sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message, including an encoded NR RRC response message, if needed.

The SN may initiate the procedure to configure, modify or release intra-SN CPC configuration within the same SN. Figure 10.3.1-3 shows an example signalling flow for SN initiated SN modification procedure, without MN involvement. The SN can decide whether the Random Access procedure is required.\n1.\tThe SN sends the RRCReconfiguration message to the UE through SRB3. The UE applies the new configuration.

The message is transmitted over a wireless channel, with the BSC acting as the source and the UE as the destination. The figure illustrates the use of various techniques to ensure reliable communication, such as error correction and retransmission.\nFigure 10.3.1-4: Transfer of an NR RRC message to/from the UE\nThe SN initiates the procedure when it needs to transfer an NR RRC message to the UE and SRB3 is not used.\n1.\tThe SN initiates the procedure by sending the SgNB Modification Required to the MN.\n2.\tThe MN forwards the NR RRC message to the UE in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.\n3.\tThe UE applies the new configuration and replies with the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.

It may also be used to transfer an RRC message from the SN to the UE via the MN and the response from the UE via MN to the SN (e.g. when SRB3 is not used). In NGEN-DC and NR-DC, the RRC message is an NR message (i.e., RRCReconfiguration) whereas in NE-DC it is an E-UTRA message (i.e., RRCConnectionReconfiguration). In case of CPA, inter-SN CPC or inter-SN subsequent CPAC, this procedure is used to modify CPA, inter-SN CPC or inter-SN subsequent CPAC configuration within the same candidate SN. In case of CPA, inter-SN CPC or inter-SN subsequent CPAC, this procedure may also be triggered by the candidate SN to add some prepared PSCells from the suggested list or cancel part of the prepared PSCells. In case of intra-SN CPC or intra-SN subsequent CPAC, this procedure is used to configure, modify or release intra-SN CPC or intra-SN subsequent CPAC configuration. In case of intra-SN SCG LTM, this procedure is used to configure, modify or release intra-SN SCG LTM configuration. This procedure may be initiated by the MN or SN to request the SN or MN to activate or deactivate the SCG. This procedure can also be used to support coordination between the MN and the SN for managing the configuration and reporting of QoE measurements and/or RAN visible QoE measurements in NR-DC.\nEditor's note: FFS. It's up to RAN3 on how to configure intra-SN subsequent CPAC in MN format and which procedure is to be used, e.g. MN initiated SN modification procedure, SN initiated SN modification with MN involvement procedure, or SN initiated SN change procedure.\n\nThe SN modification procedure does not necessarily need to involve signalling towards the UE.\nMN initiated SN Modification\nThe figure depicts a SN modification procedure for a MN initiated by a SN. The figure shows the steps involved in modifying the SN, including the initiation of the SN modification, the selection of the SN, and the execution of the SN modification. The figure is a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 10.3.2-1: SN Modification procedure - MN initiated\nThe MN uses the procedure to initiate configuration changes of the SCG within the same SN, including addition, modification or release of the user plane resource configuration. The MN uses this procedure to perform handover within the same MN while keeping the SN, when the SN needs to be involved (i.e. in NGEN-DC). The MN also uses the procedure to query the current SCG configuration, e.g. when delta configuration is applied in an MN initiated SN change. The MN also uses the procedure to provide the S-RLF related information to the SN or to provide additional available DRB IDs to be used for SN terminated bearers. The MN also uses this procedure to activate or deactivate the SCG. The MN may not use the procedure to initiate the addition, modification or release of SCG SCells. The SN may reject the request, except if it concerns the release of the user plane resource configuration, or if it is used to perform handover within the same MN while keeping the SN. Figure 10.3.2-1 shows an example signalling flow for an MN initiated SN Modification procedure.\n1.\tThe MN sends the SN Modification Request message, which may contain user plane resource configuration related or other UE context related information, PDU session level Network Slice info and the requested SCG configuration information, including the UE capabilities coordination result to be used as basis for the reconfiguration by the SN. In case a security key update in the SN is required, a new SN Security Key is included. In case the PDCP data recovery in the SN is required, the PDCP Change Indication is included which indicates that PDCP data recovery is required in SN. In case of coordination between the MN and the SN on QoE and RAN visible QoE measurement configuration and reporting, the SN Modification Request message may contain the QMC Coordination Request IE.\n2.\tThe SN responds with the SN Modification Request Acknowledge message, which may contain new SCG radio configuration information within an SN RRC reconfiguration message, and data forwarding address information (if applicable). If the MN requested the SCG to be activated or deactivated, the SN indicates whether the SCG is activated or deactivated. In case of coordination between the MN and the SN on QoE and RAN visible QoE measurement configuration and reporting, the SN Modification Request Acknowledge message may contain the QMC Coordination Response IE.\nNOTE 1:\tFor MN terminated bearers to be setup for which PDCP duplication with CA is configured in NR SCG side, the MN allocates up to 4 separate Xn-U bearers and the SN provides a logical channel ID for primary or split secondary path to the MN.\nFor SN terminated bearers to be setup for which PDCP duplication with CA is configured in NR MCG side, the SN allocates up to 4 separate Xn-U bearers and the MN provides a logical channel ID for primary or split secondary path to the SN via an additional MN-initiated SN modification procedure.\n2a.\tWhen applicable, the MN provides data forwarding address information to the SN.

The UE applies the new configuration, synchronizes to the MN (if instructed, in case of intra-MN handover) and replies with MN RRC reconfiguration complete message, including an SN RRC response message, if needed. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the MN RRC reconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n5.\tUpon successful completion of the reconfiguration, the success of the procedure is indicated in the SN Reconfiguration Complete message.\n6.\tIf instructed, the UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell of the SN as described in SN addition procedure.

The MN cannot reject the release request of PDU session/QoS flows and the release request of SCG resources.

The message is transmitted over a wireless communication channel, with the BSC acting as the sender and the UE as the receiver. The figure illustrates the use of radio frequency (RF) signals, which are used to transmit the R R R RRC message. The figure also shows the presence of a relay node (RNC) in the network, which is responsible for relaying the message to the UE. The figure is a crucial component of the 5G network architecture, as it enables the efficient and reliable transmission of data between the BSC and the UE.\nFigure 10.3.2-4: Transfer of an NR RRC message to/from the UE\nThe SN initiates the procedure when it needs to transfer an NR RRC message to the UE and SRB3 is not used.\n1.\tThe SN initiates the procedure by sending the SN Modification Required to the MN including the SN RRC reconfiguration message.\n2.\tThe MN forwards the SN RRC reconfiguration message to the UE including it in the RRC reconfiguration message.\n3.\tThe UE applies the new configuration and replies with the RRC reconfiguration complete message by including the SN RRC reconfiguration complete message.

Otherwise the UE may perform UL transmission after having applied the new configuration.\nSN initiated Conditional SN Modification without MN involvement (SRB3 is not used)\nThis procedure is not supported for NE-DC and NGEN-DC.\nThe figure depicts a SN modification scenario where SN-init is initiated without MN involvement and SRB3 is not used to configure intra-SN CPC or intra-SN subsequent CPAC.\nFigure 10.3.2-5: SN Modification – SN-initiated without MN involvement and SRB3 is not used to configure intra-SN CPC or intra-SN subsequent CPAC\nThe SN initiates the procedure when it needs to transfer an NR RRC message to the UE and SRB3 is not used to configure intra-SN CPC or intra-SN subsequent CPAC.\n1.\tThe SN initiates the procedure by sending the SN Modification Required to the MN including the SN RRC reconfiguration message with CPC configuration or subsequent CPAC configuration.\n2.\tThe MN forwards the SN RRC reconfiguration message to the UE including it in the RRCReconfiguration message.\n3.\tThe UE replies with the RRCReconfigurationComplete message by including the SN RRC reconfiguration complete message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the SN RRC reconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure. The UE maintains connection with source PSCell after receiving CPC configuration or subsequent CPAC configuration, and starts evaluating the execution conditions for the candidate PSCell(s).\n4.\tThe MN forwards the SN RRC response message, if received from the UE, to the SN by including it in the SN Modification Confirm message.\n5.\tIf at least one candidate PSCell satisfies the corresponding execution condition, the UE completes the CPC execution procedure by an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN which includes an embedded RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the selected target PSCell. In subsequent CPAC, the UE keeps the configured subsequent CPAC configuration and evaluates the execution conditions of other candidate PSCells after completion of the subsequent CPAC execution.\n6.\tThe RRCReconfigurationComplete message is forwarded to the SN embedded in RRC Transfer message.\n7.\tThe UE detaches from the source PSCell, applies the stored corresponding configuration and synchronises to the selected candidate PSCell.\nNOTE 7:\tFor a subsequent CPAC configuration, after a PSCell change, if the execution condition of one candidate PSCell is satisfied, the UE executes steps 5-7, e.g. based on the configuration provided in step 2.\nSN initiated SCG LTM without MN involvement (SRB3 is not used)\nThis procedure is not supported for NE-DC and NGEN-DC.\nThe figure depicts a SN modification scenario where SN-initiated without MN involvement and SRB3 is not used to configure intra-SN SCG LTM. The figure shows the SN-initiated configuration, which involves the use of SN-initiated without MN involvement and SRB3 to configure intra-SN SCG LTM.\nFigure 10.3.2-6: SN Modification – SN-initiated without MN involvement and SRB3 is not used to configure intra-SN SCG LTM\nThe SN initiates the procedure when it needs to transfer an NR RRC message to the UE and SRB3 is not used to configure intra-SN SCG LTM.\n1.\tThe SN initiates the procedure by sending the SN Modification Required to the MN including the SN RRCReconfiguration message with SCG LTM configuration.\n2.\tThe MN forwards the SN RRCReconfiguration message to the UE including it in the RRCReconfiguration message.\n3.\tThe UE replies with the RRCReconfigurationComplete message by including the SN RRCReconfigurationComplete message.\n4.\tThe MN forwards the SN RRC response message, if received from the UE, to the SN by including it in the SN Modification Confirm message.\n5a.\tIf indicated by the SN, the UE performs DL synchronization with candidate cell(s) before receiving the cell switch command.\n5b.\tIf indicated by the SN, the UE performs early TA acquisition with candidate cell(s) before receiving the cell switch command as specified in clause in 9.2.3.5.2 in TS 38.300 [3].\n6.\tThe UE performs L1 measurements on the configured candidate cell(s) and transmits L1 measurement reports to the SN, according to the L1 measurement configuration in RRCReconfiguration received in step 2. The UE starts to perform L1 measurements once the L1 measurement configuration is applicable.\n7.\tThe SN decides to execute cell switch to a target cell and transmits a MAC CE triggering cell switch by including the candidate configuration index of the target cell. The UE switches to the target cell and applies the configuration indicated by candidate configuration index.\n8.\tThe UE sends an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN which includes an embedded RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the target cell.\n9.\tThe RRCReconfigurationComplete message is forwarded to the SN embedded in RRC Transfer message.\n10.\tThe UE performs the random access procedure towards the target cell, if the UE does not have valid TA of the target cell.\n11.\tThe UE completes the SCG LTM cell switch procedure by sending an UL transmission to target cell. If the UE has performed a RA procedure in step 10 the UE considers that LTM execution is successfully completed when the random access procedure is successfully completed. For RACH-less LTM, the UE considers that LTM execution is successfully completed when the UE determines that the SN has successfully received its first UL transmission, as specified in clause in 9.2.3.5.2 in TS 38.300 [3].\nNOTE 8:\tThe steps 5-11 can be performed multiple times for subsequent SCG LTM using the SCG LTM candidate configuration(s) provided in step 2.\n",

In this case, it is up to the MN and the source SN implementations to make sure that the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message(s) from the source SN, if any, is forwarded to the right target destination. The Data Forwarding Address Indication procedure may further be invoked to indicate to the source SN to stop already initiated early data forwarding for some SN-terminated bearers if they are no longer subject to data forwarding due to the modification or cancellation of the prepared conditional SN change procedures.\nNOTE 5c:\tFor the early transmission of MN terminated split/SCG bearers, the MN forwards the PDCP PDU to the candidate SN(s).\n5.\tThe UE starts evaluating the execution conditions.

Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.\n\nSN initiated conditional SN Change\nThe SN initiated conditional SN change procedure is used for inter-SN CPC configuration and inter-SN CPC execution.\nThe SN initiated conditional SN change procedure may also be initiated by the source SN, to modify the existing SN initiated inter-SN CPC configuration, or to trigger the release of the candidate SN by cancellation of all the prepared PSCells at the candidate SN and releasing the CPC related UE context at the candidate SN.\nNOTE 6a0:\tTo modify or release an existing intra-SN CPC configuration, the source SN triggers an SN initiated Conditional SN Modification (with or without SRB3) without MN involvement, as specified in 10.3.\nThe figure depicts a conditional SN change in a 4G network, where the SN initiates a conditional SN change. This change is initiated based on the presence of a 4G signal, which is represented by the red line. The figure illustrates the process of conditional SN changes, which are used to improve network performance by adjusting the SN rate based on the signal strength.\nFigure 10.5.1-4: Conditional SN Change – SN initiated\nFigure 10.5.1-4 shows an example signalling flow for the Conditional Secondary Node Change initiated by the SN:\n1.\tThe source SN initiates the conditional SN change procedure by sending SgNB Change Required message which contains a CPC initiation indication. The message also contains candidate SN ID(s) information and may include the SCG configuration (to support delta configuration), and contains the measurement results related to the candidate SN(s). The message also includes a list of proposed PSCell candidates recommended by the source SN, including execution conditions, the upper limit for the number of PSCells that can be prepared by each candidate SN, and may also include the SCG measurement configurations for CPC (e.g. measurement ID(s) to be used for CPC).\n2/3.\tThe MN requests each candidate SN to allocate resources for the UE by means of the SgNB Addition procedure(s) , indicating the request is for CPAC, and the measurements results related to the candidate SN and indicating a list of proposed PSCell candidates received from the source SN, but not including execution conditions. Within the list of PSCells suggested by the source SN, the candidate SN decides the list of PSCell(s) to prepare (considering the maximum number indicated by the MN) and, for each prepared PSCell, the candidate SN decides SCG SCells and provides the new corresponding SCG radio resource configuration to the MN in an NR RRCReconfiguration** message contained in the SgNB Addition Request Acknowledge message. If data forwarding is needed, the candidate SN provides data forwarding addresses to the MN. The candidate SN includes the indication of full or delta RRC configuration, and the list of prepared PSCell IDs to the MN.

Besides, the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message can also include an updated MCG configuration, as well as the NR RRCReconfiguration*** message generated by the source SN, e.g., to configure the required conditional measurements.\n7.\tThe UE applies the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message received in step 6, stores the CPC configuration and replies to the MN with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message, which can include an NR RRCReconfigurationComplete*** message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n8.\tIf an NR RRC response message is included, the MN informs the source SN with the NR RRCReconfigurationComplete*** message via SgNB Change Confirm message. If step 4 and 5 are skipped, the MN will indicate the candidate PSCells accepted by each candidate SN to the source SN in the SgNB Change Confirm message.\nThe MN sends the SgNB Change Confirm message towards the source SN to indicate that CPC is prepared, and in such case the source SN continues providing user data to the UE. If early data forwarding is applied, the MN informs the source SN the data forwarding addresses as received from the candidate SN(s), the source SN, if applicable, together with the Early Status Transfer procedure, starts early data forwarding. The PDCP SDU forwarding may take place during early data forwarding. In case multiple candidate SNs are prepared, the MN includes a list of Target SgNB ID and list of data forwarding addresses to the source SN.\nNOTE 6b:\tThe Data Forwarding Address Indication procedure may further be invoked to indicate to the source SN to stop already initiated early data forwarding for some PDCP SDUs if they are no longer subject to data forwarding due to the modification or cancellation of the prepared conditional PSCell change.\nNOTE 6c:\tFor the early transmission of MN terminated split/SCG bearers, the MN forwards the PDCP PDU to the candidate SN(s).\n9a-9d.\tThe source SN may send the SgNB Modification Required message to trigger an update of CPC execution condition and/or corresponding SCG measurement configuration for CPC.

In all MR-DC options, to perform this procedure within the same SN, the SN Modification procedure as described in clause 10.3 is used, setting the PDCP Change Indication to indicate that a S-KgNB (for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC) or S-KeNB (for NE-DC) update is required when the procedure is initiated by the SN or including the SgNB Security Key / SN Security Key when the procedure is initiated by the MN. In all MR-DC options, to perform a PSCell change between different SN nodes, the SN Change procedure as described in clause 10.5 is used.\nIf a security key change is not required (only possible in EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC), this is performed through a synchronous SCG reconfiguration procedure without security key change towards the UE involving random access on PSCell, during which the MAC entity configured for SCG is reset and RLC configured for SCG is re-established regardless of the bearer type(s) established on SCG. For DRBs using RLC AM mode PDCP data recovery applies, and for DRBs using RLC UM no action is performed in PDCP. For SRB3 PDCP may discard all stored SDUs and PDUs. Unless MN terminated SCG or split bearers are configured, this does not require MN involvement. In this case, if location information was requested for the UE, the SN informs the MN about the PSCell change (as part of location information) using the SN initiated SN modification procedure independently from the reconfiguration of the UE. In case of MN terminated SCG or split bearers, the SN initiated SN Modification procedure as described in clause 10.3 is used, setting the PDCP Change Indication to indicate that a PDCP data recovery is required. If the MN subscribes to PSCell changes to retrieve the SCG UE history information, the SN informs the MN about the SCG UE history information using the SN initiated SN modification procedure when the SCG UE history information changes.\nA Conditional PSCell Change (CPC) is defined as a PSCell change that is executed by the UE when execution condition(s) is met. The UE starts evaluating the execution condition(s) upon receiving the CPC configuration, and stops evaluating the execution condition(s) once PSCell change or PCell change is triggered. Intra-SN CPC without MN involvement, inter-SN CPC initiated either by MN or SN are supported.\nThe following principles apply to CPC:\n-\tThe CPC configuration contains the configuration of CPC candidate PSCell(s) and execution condition(s) and may contain the MCG configuration for inter-SN CPC, to be applied when CPC execution is triggered.\n-\tAn execution condition may consist of one or two trigger condition(s) (see CondEvent, as defined in TS 38.331 [4] or TS 36.331 [10]). Only single RS type and at most two different trigger quantities (e.g. RSRP and RSRQ, RSRP and SINR, etc.) can be used for the evaluation of CPC execution condition of a single candidate PSCell.\n-\tBefore any CPC execution condition is satisfied, upon reception of PSCell change command or PCell change command, the UE executes the PSCell change procedure as described in clause 10.3 and 10.5 or the PCell change procedure as described in clause 9.2.3.2 in TS 38.300[3] or clause 10.1.2.1 in TS 36.300 [2], regardless of any previously received CPC configuration. Upon the successful completion of PSCell change procedure or PCell change procedure, the UE releases all stored CPC configurations.\n-\tWhile executing CPC, the UE is not required to continue evaluating the execution condition of other candidate PSCell(s) or PCell(s).\n-\tOnce the CPC procedure is executed successfully, the UE releases all stored conditional reconfigurations (i.e. for CPC and for CHO, as specified in TS 38.300 [3] or TS 36.300 [2]).\n-\tUpon the release of SCG, the UE releases the stored CPC configurations.\n-\tMN can inform SN of the maximum number of conditional reconfigurations the SN is allowed to configure for SN initiated CPC including both intra-SN and inter-SN CPC.\nCPC configuration in HO command, in PSCell addition/change command or within any conditional reconfiguration (i.e CPA, CPC or CHO configuration) is not supported.\nAn SCG LTM is defined as a PSCell cell switch procedure that the network triggers via MAC CE based on L1 measurements. Only intra-SN SCG LTM without MN involvement is supported.\n",

The UE maintains connection with the source MN and, if the UE is configured with a PSCell, with the source PSCell, after receiving CHO configuration, and starts evaluating the CHO execution condition for the candidate cell(s). If at least one CHO candidate cell satisfies the corresponding CHO execution condition, the UE detaches from the source MN, applies the stored corresponding configuration for that selected candidate cell, synchronises to that candidate cell and completes the RRC handover procedure by sending RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete* message to the target MN.

                    "text_content": "A Subsequent Conditional PSCell Addition or Change (subsequent CPAC) is defined as a conditional PSCell addition or change procedure that is executed after a PSCell addition, a PSCell change, a PCell change or an SCG release based on pre-configured subsequent CPAC configuration of candidate PSCell(s) without reconfiguration and re-initiation of CPC/CPA. The UE keeps the configured subsequent CPAC configuration (unless the network indicates to release it) and evaluates the execution conditions of candidate PSCells after completion of a PSCell addition, a PSCell change, a PCell change or an SCG release. Intra-SN subsequent CPAC initiated by the SN, inter-SN subsequent CPAC initiated by either MN or SN are supported.\nThe following principles apply to subsequent CPAC:\n-\tFor MN initiated subsequent CPAC, the MN initially triggers the candidate cell preparation of subsequent CPAC procedure and generates the execution conditions for the initial execution of subsequent CPAC (e.g. CPA or CPC).\n-\tFor SN initiated subsequent CPAC, the source SN initially triggers the candidate cell preparation of subsequent CPAC procedure and generates the execution conditions for the initial execution of subsequent CPAC.\n-\tFor both MN and SN initiated inter-SN subsequent CPAC, the candidate SN generates the execution conditions for the following execution of subsequent CPAC when the candidate SN prepares the candidate SCG configuration(s) for candidate PSCell(s). For SN initiated intra-SN subsequent CPAC, the source SN generates the execution conditions for the following execution of subsequent CPAC when the source SN prepares the candidate SCG configuration(s) for candidate PSCell(s).\n-\tThe subsequent CPAC configuration contains candidate SCG configuration(s) of candidate PSCell(s), execution conditions, and may contain the MCG configuration (to be applied when subsequent CPAC execution is triggered), the reference configuration and the security update configuration.\n-\tThe subsequent CPAC configuration for CPA or inter-SN CPC candidate PSCell(s) is provided in MN format. The subsequent CPAC configuration for intra-SN CPC candidate PSCell(s) is provided in MN format or SN format. It's up to the source SN to decide which format to be used for intra-SN subsequent CPAC.\n-\tFor one UE, the subsequent CPAC configuration for all candidate PSCells (including inter-SN and/or intra-SN) is provided in the same format, i.e., either MN format, or SN format. If the configured candidate PSCell(s) includes at least one inter-SN CPC candidate PSCell, the subsequent CPAC configuration can only be provided in MN format. If only intra-SN CPC candidate PSCell(s) is configured, the subsequent CPAC configuration can be provided in either MN format or SN format.\n-\tEach candidate PSCell configuration is provided as a delta configuration on top of a reference configuration or a complete configuration. Only one reference configuration is supported.\n-\tThe MN generates the MCG part of the reference configuration (if any), while the SN generates the SCG part of the reference configuration. The MN can request an SCG reference configuration from any one of the involved SNs.\n-\tThe network explicitly configures a subsequent CPAC configuration for the current serving PSCell if the network wants to use that PSCell as a candidate PSCell for subsequent CPAC.\n-\tThe network always explicitly releases the subsequent CPAC configuration for candidate PSCells after an inter-MN PCell change.\n-\tUpon the release of SCG, the UE releases the stored subsequent CPAC configuration in SN format. Upon the release of SCG, the UE releases or maintains the stored subsequent CPAC configuration in MN format according to the network indication.\n-\tThe same candidate PSCell configuration can be used for CPA execution and CPC execution, but with different execution conditions of the candidate PSCell.\n-\tThe subsequent CPAC configuration with CPA execution condition(s) maintained after SCG release can be used for the subsequent CPA execution.\n-\tUpon inter-SN subsequent CPAC execution, the UE uses the first unused sk-Counter value for S-KgNB generation, based on the per-SN pre-configured sk-Counter value list.\n-\tUpon PCell change, PSCell change or SCG release, if the subsequent CPAC configuration is maintained, the UE also maintains the unused sk-Counter values.\nMN initiated subsequent CPAC\nThe subsequent CPAC procedure is initiated by the MN for inter-SN subsequent CPAC configuration and inter-SN subsequent CPAC execution.\n\nFigure 10.20-1: Inter-SN subsequent CPAC - MN initiated\nFigure 10.20-1 shows an example signalling flow for the inter-SN subsequent CPAC initiated by the MN:\n1/2/3/4.\tThe MN initiates the inter-SN subsequent CPAC by requesting the candidate SN(s) to allocate resources for the UE by means of the SN Addition procedure, indicating that the request is for subsequent CPAC. The MN also provides the candidate cells recommended by MN via the latest measurement results for the candidate SN(s) to choose and configure the SCG cell(s), provides the upper limit for the number of PSCells that can be prepared by each candidate SN, and provides a list of KSN and associated sk-Counter values for each candidate SN. In the SN Addition procedure, the MN also includes information of other candidate SN(s), and for each candidate SN, a list of cells recommended by the MN via the latest measurement results for the candidate SN to select the PSCell(s) for the following execution of subsequent CPAC. Within the list of cells as indicated within the measurement results indicated by the MN, the candidate SN decides the list of PSCell(s) to prepare (considering the maximum number indicated by the MN) and, for each prepared PSCell, the candidate SN decides other SCG SCells and provides the new corresponding SCG radio resource configuration to the MN in an NR RRCReconfiguration** message contained in the SN Addition Request Acknowledge message with the prepared PSCell ID(s). For each prepared PSCell, the candidate SN also decides the list of PSCell(s) and associated execution conditions proposed for the following execution of subsequent CPAC. If data forwarding is needed, the candidate SN provides data forwarding addresses to the MN. The candidate SN may also propose data forwarding to the MN or other candidate SN(s) for subsequent CPAC. The candidate SN includes the indication of the complete or delta RRC configuration with respect to the SCG reference configuration. For the prepared PSCell(s) and the proposed PSCell(s) for the following execution of subsequent CPAC, the candidate SN can either accept or reject each of the candidate cells listed within the measurement results indicated by the MN, i.e. it cannot configure any alternative candidates.\nThe MN may select one of the candidate SN(s) and requests providing the SCG reference configuration as part of the SN Addition procedure. Once obtained, the MN provides the SCG reference configuration to other candidate SN(s).\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE was configured with SN-1 in Dual Connectivity operation (i.e. SN-1 is the source SN), then the MN starts the subsequent CPAC operation with SN-1 via the MN-initiated SN Modification procedure instead of the SN Addition procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the UE was configured with SN-1 in Dual Connectivity operation (i.e. SN-1 is the source SN), then the MN may trigger the MN-initiated SN Modification procedure to SN-1 to retrieve the current SCG configuration or request a SCG reference configuration for the subsequent CPAC, and to allow provision of data forwarding related information before step 1.\nNOTE 3:\tIf applicable, the MN stores the data forwarding addresses and data forwarding proposals provided from all the candidate SN(s).\n5.\tFor SN terminated bearers using MCG resources, the MN provides Xn-U DL TNL address information in the Xn-U Address Indication message to the candidate SN(s).\n6/7.\tIf the lists of prepared PSCells received from the candidate SN(s) in steps 2 and 4 are different than the lists of proposed PSCells, e.g., when not all proposed PSCells were accepted by the candidate SN(s), the MN may initiate the SN Modification procedures towards all the candidate SN(s) to inform them about the updated lists of prepared PSCells in other candidate SN(s). If requested, the candidate SN(s) sends an SN Modification Request Acknowledge message and if needed, provides the updated candidate SCG configurations and/or the execution conditions for the following execution of subsequent CPAC to the MN.\n8.\tThe MN sends to the UE an RRCReconfiguration message including the subsequent CPAC configuration, i.e. a list of RRCReconfiguration* messages and associated execution conditions for the subsequent CPAC, in which each RRCReconfiguration* message contains the SCG configuration in the RRCReconfiguration** message received from one of the candidate SN(s) in steps 2 and 4, and possibly an MCG configuration. Besides, the RRCReconfiguration message can also include an updated source MCG configuration, e.g., to configure the required conditional measurements. The RRCReconfiguration message also includes a security update configuration and may also include a reference configuration.\n9.\tThe UE applies the RRCReconfiguration message received in step 8, stores the subsequent CPAC configuration and replies to the MN with an RRCReconfigurationComplete message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n11.\tThe UE starts evaluating the execution conditions. If the execution condition of one candidate PSCell is satisfied, the UE applies RRCReconfiguration* message corresponding to the selected candidate PSCell, and sends an MN RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, including an RRCReconfigurationComplete** message for the selected candidate PSCell, and information enabling the MN to identify the SN of the selected candidate PSCell. The RRCReconfigurationComplete* message may also include the sk-Counter value associated with the selected candidate PSCell if a new sk-Counter value is selected.\n12.\tThe MN informs the SN of the selected candidate PSCell that the UE has completed the reconfiguration procedure successfully via SN Reconfiguration Complete message, including the RRCReconfigurationComplete** message. If the sk-Counter value is received by the RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, the MN also indicates the received sk-Counter value to the SN.\n13.\tThe UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell indicated in the RRCReconfiguration* message applied in step 11. The order the UE sends the MN RRCReconfigurationComplete* message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is not defined. The successful RA procedure towards the SCG is not required for a successful completion of the RRC Reconfiguration procedure.\n14.\tIf PDCP termination point is changed to the SN for bearers using RLC AM, and when RRC full configuration is not used, the MN sends the SN Status Transfer message.\n15.\tFor SN terminated bearers or QoS flows moved from the MN, dependent on the characteristics of the respective bearer or QoS flow, the MN may take actions to minimise service interruption due to activation of MR-DC (Data forwarding).\n16.\tIf data forwarding is needed, the MN may send the Xn-U Address Indication message to the selected candidate SN. The SN may decide to perform, if applicable, early data forwarding for SN-terminated bearers, together with the sending of an Early Status Transfer message to the source MN.\nNOTE 4:\tSeparate Xn-U Address Indication procedures may be initiated to provide different forwarding addresses of the prepared subsequent CPAC. In this case, it is up to the MN and the candidate SN implementations to make sure that the Early Status Transfer message(s) from the selected SN, if any, is forwarded to the right other candidate SN.\n18.\tThe UE starts evaluating the execution conditions. If the execution condition of one candidate PSCell is satisfied, the UE applies RRCReconfiguration* message corresponding to the selected candidate PSCell, and sends an MN RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, including an RRCReconfigurationComplete** message for the selected candidate PSCell, and information enabling the MN to identify the SN of the selected candidate PSCell. The RRCReconfigurationComplete* message may also include a sk-Counter value associated with the selected candidate PSCell if a new sk-Counter value is selected.\n19.\tThe MN informs the SN of the selected candidate PSCell that the UE has completed the reconfiguration procedure successfully via SN Reconfiguration Complete message, including the RRCReconfigurationComplete** message. If the sk-Counter value is received by the RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, the MN also indicates the received sk-Counter value to the SN.\n20.\tThe UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell indicated in the RRCReconfiguration* message applied in step 18. The order the UE sends the MN RRCReconfigurationComplete* message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is not defined. The successful RA procedure towards the SCG is not required for a successful completion of the RRC Reconfiguration procedure.\n21/22/23.\tThe MN triggers the MN initiated SN Modification procedure to inform the last serving SN to stop providing user data to the UE, to switch to the prepared state, and if applicable, to allow provisioning of new data forwarding addresses. If applicable, the MN triggers the Xn-U Address Indication procedure to inform the last serving SN the address of the SN of the selected candidate PSCell, to start late data forwarding.\n24/25.\tIf PDCP termination point is changed for bearers using RLC AM, and when RRC full configuration is not used, the SN sends the SN Status Transfer message to MN, which the MN sends then to the SN of the selected candidate PSCell, if needed.\n26.\tIf applicable, data forwarding from the last serving SN takes place. It may be initiated as early as the the last serving SN receives the early data forwarding address in step 17.\n27.\tIf data forwarding is needed, the MN may send the Xn-U Address Indication message to the selected candidate SN. The SN may decide to perform, if applicable, early data forwarding for SN-terminated bearers, together with the sending of an Early Status Transfer message to the source MN.\nNOTE 5:\tSeparate Xn-U Address Indication procedures may be initiated to provide different forwarding addresses of the prepared subsequent CPAC. In this case, it is up to the MN and candidate SN implementations to make sure that the Early Status Transfer message(s) from the selected SN, if any, is forwarded to the right other candidate SN.\nSN initiated subsequent CPAC\nThe subsequent CPAC procedure is initiated by the SN for inter-SN subsequent CPAC configuration and inter-SN subsequent CPAC execution.\n\nFigure 10.20-2: Inter-SN subsequent CPAC - SN initiated\nFigure 10.20-2 shows an example signalling flow for the inter-SN subsequent CPAC initiated by the source SN:\n1.\tThe source SN (i.e. SN-1) initiates the inter-SN subsequent CPAC procedure by sending the SN Change Required message, which contains a subsequent CPAC initiation indication. The message also contains candidate node ID(s) and may include an SCG reference configuration (to support delta configuration), and contains the measurements results which may include cells that are not subsequent CPAC candidates. The message also includes a list of proposed PSCell candidates recommended by the source SN, including execution conditions for the initial evaluation, the upper limit for the number of PSCells that can be prepared by each candidate SN, and may also include the SCG measurement configurations for subsequent CPAC (e.g. measurement ID(s) to be used for subsequent CPAC).\n2/3/4/5.\tThe MN requests each candidate SN(s) to allocate resources for the UE by means of the SN Addition procedure(s), indicating the request is for subsequent CPAC, and the measurements results which may include cells that are not subsequent CPAC candidates received from the source SN to the candidate SN, and indicating a list of proposed PSCell candidates to the candidate SN(s) received from the source SN, but not including execution conditions. The MN also includes information of other candidate SN(s), and for each candidate SN, a list of proposed PSCell candidates recommended by the source SN for the candidate SN to select the PSCell(s) for the following execution of subsequent CPAC. The MN also provides the upper limit for the number of PSCells that can be prepared by each candidate SN and provides a list of KSN and associated sk-Counter values for each candidate SN. Within the list of PSCells suggested by the source SN, the candidate SN decides the list of PSCell(s) to prepare (considering the maximum number indicated by the MN) and, for each prepared PSCell, the candidate SN decides other SCG SCells and provides the new corresponding SCG radio resource configuration to the MN in an NR RRCReconfiguration** message contained in the SN Addition Request Acknowledge message with the prepared PSCell ID(s). For each prepared PSCell, the candidate SN also decides the list of PSCell(s) and associated execution conditions proposed for the following execution of subsequent CPAC. If data forwarding is needed, the candidate SN provides data forwarding addresses to the MN. The candidate SN may also propose data forwarding to the MN or other candidate SN(s) for subsequent CPAC. The candidate SN includes the indication of the complete or delta RRC configuration with respect to the SCG reference configuration. For the prepared PSCell(s) and the proposed PSCell(s) for the following execution of subsequent CPAC, the candidate SN can either accept or reject each of the candidate cells suggested by the source SN, i.e. it cannot configure any alternative candidates.\nThe MN may select one of the candidate SN(s) and requests providing the reference SCG configuration as part of the SN Addition procedure. Once obtained, the MN provides the reference configuration to other candidate SN(s).\nNOTE 6:\tThe MN may trigger the MN-initiated SN Modification procedure (to the source SN) to request a reference configuration for the subsequent CPAC before step 2.\nNOTE 7:\tIf applicable, the MN stores the data forwarding addresses and data forwarding proposals provided from all the candidate SN(s) and the source SN.\n6.\tFor SN terminated bearers using MCG resources, the MN provides Xn-U DL TNL address information in the Xn-U Address Indication message to the candidate SN(s).\n7/8.\tIf the lists of prepared PSCells received from the candidate SN(s) in steps 3 and 5 are different than the lists of proposed PSCells, e.g., when not all proposed PSCells were accepted by the candidate SN(s), the MN may initiate the SN Modification procedures towards the source SN and all the candidate SN(s) to inform them about the updated lists of prepared PSCells in other candidate SN(s). If requested, the source SN or the candidate SN(s) sends an SN Modification Request Acknowledge message and if needed, provides the updated candidate SCG configurations and/or the execution conditions for the following execution of subsequent CPAC for the prepared PSCell to the MN.\n9.\tThe MN sends to the UE an RRCReconfiguration message including the subsequent CPAC configuration, i.e. a list of RRCReconfiguration* messages and associated execution conditions for the subsequent CPAC, in which each RRCReconfiguration* message contains the SCG configuration in the RRCReconfiguration** message received from one of the candidate SN(s) in steps 3 and 5, and possibly an MCG configuration. Besides, the RRCReconfiguration message can also include an updated MCG configuration, as well as the NR RRCReconfiguration*** message generated by the source SN, e.g., to configure the required conditional measurements. The RRCReconfiguration message also includes a security update configuration and may also include a reference configuration.\n10.\tThe UE applies the RRCReconfiguration message received in step 9, stores the subsequent CPAC configuration and replies to the MN with an RRCReconfigurationComplete message, which can include an NR RRCReconfigurationComplete*** message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n11/12.\tIf an SN RRC response message is included, the MN informs the source SN with the SN RRCReconfigurationComplete*** message via SN Change Confirm message. If step 7 and 8 towards the source SN are skipped, the MN will indicate the candidate PSCells accepted by each candidate SN to the source SN in the SN Change Confirm message.\nThe MN sends the SN Change Confirm message towards the source SN to indicate that subsequent CPAC is prepared, and in such case the source SN continues providing user data to the UE. If early data forwarding is applied, the MN informs the source SN the data forwarding addresses as received from the candidate SN(s), the source SN, if applicable, together with the Early Status Transfer procedure, starts early data forwarding. The PDCP SDU forwarding may take place during early data forwarding. In case multiple candidate SNs are prepared, the MN includes a list of Target SN ID and list of data forwarding addresses to the source SN.\nNOTE 8:\tThe Xn-U Address Indication procedure may further be invoked to indicate to the source SN to stop already initiated early data forwarding for some PDCP SDUs if they are no longer subject to data forwarding due to the modification or cancellation of the prepared conditional PSCell change.\nNOTE 9:\tFor the early transmission of MN terminated split/SCG bearers, the MN forwads the PDCP PDU to the candidate SN(s).\n13.\tThe UE starts evaluating the execution conditions. If the execution condition of one candidate PSCell is satisfied, the UE applies RRCReconfiguration* message corresponding to the selected candidate PSCell, and sends an MN RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, including an RRCReconfigurationComplete** message for the selected candidate PSCell, and information enabling the MN to identify the SN of the selected candidate PSCell. The RRCReconfigurationComplete* message may also include the sk-Counter value associated with the selected candidate PSCell if a new sk-Counter value is selected.\n14.\tThe MN informs the SN of the selected candidate PSCell that the UE has completed the reconfiguration procedure successfully via SN Reconfiguration Complete message, including the RRCReconfigurationComplete** message. If the sk-Counter value is received by the RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, the MN also indicates the received sk-Counter value to the SN.\n15.\tThe UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell indicated in the RRCReconfiguration* message applied in step 13. The order the UE sends the MN RRCReconfigurationComplete* message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is not defined. The successful RA procedure towards the SCG is not required for a successful completion of the RRC Reconfiguration procedure.\n16/17/18.\tIf the source SN is configured as a candidate SN, the MN triggers the MN initiated SN Modification procedure to inform the source SN to stop providing user data to the UE, to switch to the prepared state, and if applicable, to allow provisioning of new data forwarding addresses. If applicable, the MN triggers the Xn-U Address Indication procedure to inform the source SN the address of the SN of the selected candidate PSCell, to start late data forwarding. If the source SN is not configured as a candidate SN, the MN triggers the MN initiated SN Release procedure to inform the source SN to stop providing user data to the UE, and triggers the Xn-U Address Indication procedure to inform the source SN the address of the SN of the selected candidate PSCell and if applicable, starts late data forwarding.\n19/20.\tIf PDCP termination point is changed for bearers using RLC AM, and when RRC full configuration is not used, the SN sends the SN Status Transfer message to MN, which the MN sends then to the SN of the selected candidate PSCell, if needed.\n21.\tIf applicable, data forwarding from the source SN takes place. It may be initiated as early as the the source SN receives the early data forwarding address in step 12.\n22.\tIf data forwarding is needed, the MN may send the Xn-U Address Indication message to the selected candidate SN. The SN may decide to perform, if applicable, early data forwarding for SN-terminated bearers, together with the sending of an Early Status Transfer message to the source MN.\nNOTE 10:\tSeparate Xn-U Address Indication procedures may be initiated to provide different forwarding addresses of the prepared subsequent CPAC. In this case, it is up to the MN and the candidate SN implementations to make sure that the Early Status Transfer message(s) from the selected SN, if any, is forwarded to the right other candidate SN.\n24.\tIn subsequent evaluation and execution phase, i.e., for the following execution of subsequent CPAC, the similar steps as steps 13~23 are performed.\n",

For a selected UE, the SN indicates to the MN the QoE reference of the management-based QoE session and, separately for the QoE reports and RAN visible QoE reports, the SN indicates whether it is going to receive the corresponding reports via the MN (using SRB4) or using SRB5. Upon receiving the request, the MN can decide and notify the SN whether the MN sends the QoE and RAN Visible QoE configuration to the UE, or whether the SN should send the configuration(s) to the UE. The SN can send a QoE and a RAN Visible QoE measurement configuration directly to the UE via SRB3, or in a transparent container to the MN, which then sends the configuration to the UE via SRB1.\nFor management-based QoE configurations received from OAM and for signalling-based QoE configurations, the MN can only send the configuration to the UE via SRB1, and the UE can send the QoE reports via SRB4 or SRB5.\nFor a UE in NR-DC, both SRB4 and SRB5 can be configured simultaneously for QoE reporting. The network explicitly indicates to the UE whether to send QoE reports via SRB4 or SRB5, per QoE reference, separately for QoE reports and RAN visible QoE reports. The SRB for QoE reporting can be changed during the application session. The command for changing the SRB used for reporting may be sent to the UE by the node that configured that specific QoE configuration.

If RAN visible QoE reports cannot be sent because the SRB configured for RAN visible QoE measurement reporting is not available, the UE discards the RAN visible QoE report.\nThe MN should inform the SN that a UE is configured with a management-based QoE/RAN visible QoE measurement configuration.\nIf the MN has configured the UE with QoE measurements, and if the UE is configured to send the QoE reports to the SN, then, if the MN decides that the SN forwards the reports directly to the MCE, the MN should indicate to the SN the QoE reference, the MCE IP address and the application layer measurement configuration ID.\nIf the SN has configured the UE with QoE measurements, and if the UE is configured to send the QoE reports to the MN, then, if the SN decides that the MN forwards the reports directly to the MCE, the SN should indicate to the MN the QoE reference and the MCE IP address.\nIf the SN has released a QoE configuration towards a UE, the SN should inform the MN.\nWhen SCG is deactivated, for QoE configurations configured to use SRB5 for QoE reporting, it is up to network implementation to reconfigure the reporting leg to SRB4, release the QoE configuration or pause the QoE reporting. For UL data arrival on SRB5 while the SCG is deactivated, the UE does not indicate to the MN that it has QoE report to transmit over SRB5 for the purpose of SCG activation.\nWhen the SCG is released, the UE releases all the QoE measurements configured by the SCG and discards the unsent QoE reports configured to be reported via SRB5.\nIn order to allow the transmission of application layer measurement reports which exceed the maximum PDCP SDU size, the network can inform the UE whether the MN allows RRC segmentation of MeasurementReportAppLayer message via SRB4 and whether the SN allows RRC segmentation of MeasurementReportAppLayer message via SRB5.\nIn NR-DC, when RAN overload happens in the node which receives the QoE reports from the UE, the node may coordinate with its peer node to reconfigure the QoE reporting path, by sending the QoE Reporting Path Request in the QMC Coordination Request IE, via the SN modification procedure.\nWhen neither the MN nor the SN is able to receive the QoE reports due to RAN overload, the network can indicate to the UE to pause QoE reporting, as specified in TS 38.300 [3].\n",

The MN can then transfer this information to the new SN during the SN Addition procedure.\nTo ensure QoE measurement continuity during inter-MN handover with SN change, the source SN should provide the information about the SN-associated QMC configurations to the source MN. During the handover procedure, the target MN is provided with all the information that the source MN has about the SN-associated QMC configuration.\nIf the MN configured the UE with QoE measurements, every subsequent MN serving the UE can configure and release the RAN visible QoE measurements.\nThis clause provides for information an overview on L2 handling for bearer type change in MR-DC, with and without a security key change due to a change of the termination point.\nTable A-1: L2 handling for bearer type change with and without a security key change due to a change of the termination point.\n\nNOTE 1:\tFor EN-DC and NGEN-DC MCG, NE-DC SCG: the MAC/RLC behaviour depends on the solution selected by the network. It can be PCell handover (for EN-DC and NGEN-DC) or PSCell change (for NE-DC), which triggers MAC reset and RLC re-establishment. Alternatively, the logical channel identity can be changed, either via RLC bearer release and add for the same DRB (including RLC re-establishment), or via reconfiguration of the RLC bearer with RLC-re-establishment.\nFor EN-DC and NGEN-DC SCG, NE-DC MCG, NR-DC MCG and SCG: the MAC/RLC behaviour depends on the solution selected by the network. It can be reconfiguration with sync, with MAC reset and RLC re-establishment. Alternatively, the logical channel identity can be changed via RLC bearer release and add.\nNOTE 2:\tVoid\nNOTE 3:\tFor EN-DC and NGEN-DC: Re-establishment and release. For NE-DC and NR-DC: Release.\nNOTE 4:\tFor NE-DC: Re-establishment and release. For EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC: Release.\n\nTable B-1 summarizes the supported handover scenarios involving MR-DC configurations.\nTable B-1: Supported MR-DC handover scenarios.\n\nNOTE 1:\tOnly SRVCC handover of IMS voice bearer to UTRAN is supported.\nNOTE 2:\tAll handover scenarios according to Table B-1 that have a DC option in the column \"from\" are supported during fast MCG failure recovery.\nNOTE 3:\tOnly intra-RAT conditional handover is supported except for E-UTRA with 5GC scenario.\nNOTE 4:\tDAPS handover is only supported from E-UTRA with EPC to E-UTRA with EPC and from NR to NR.\n\n\n",
