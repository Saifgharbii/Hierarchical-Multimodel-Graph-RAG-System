The motivation of this study is to provide potential security handling for the procedures of the NG-RAN AI/ML framework [2]. The NG-RAN AI/ML framework includes functional entities and information flows between functions in order to realize an AI/ML architecture for data collection, model training, data inference and actions/feedback for the NG-RAN and UEs. The NG-RAN AI/ML framework is also accompanied by three RAN-related use cases.\nThe study aims at studying the following aspects:\n-\tThe applicability of existing security mechanisms for the NG-RAN AI/ML framework.\n-\tWhether user privacy issues exist for the selected use cases in the related RAN group studies, not disrupting the current system designs. Use cases not selected in AI/ML for NG RAN by RAN groups are out of scope of this study. The need for alignment with the study of privacy of identifiers over radio access would also be assessed.\n-\tSecurity aspects of the RAN use cases from the point of view of AI/ML robustness in the face of AI/ML adversaries in AI/ML for NG-RAN.\n",

                    "text_content": "Clause 5 of TR 37.817 [2] includes the following use cases:\n-\tNetwork Energy Saving: This use case is about cell activation/deactivation which is an energy saving scheme in the spatial domain that exploits traffic offloading in a layered structure to reduce the energy consumption of the whole radio access network (RAN). When the expected traffic volume is lower than a fixed threshold, the cells may be switched off, and the served UEs may be offloaded to a new target cell.\n-\tLoad Balancing: The use case is to distribute the load evenly among cells and among areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic from congested cells or from congested areas of cells, or to offload users from one cell, cell area, carrier or RAT to improve network performance. This can be done by means of optimization of handover parameters and handover actions.\n-\tMobility Optimization: The use case is to minimize performance loss due to unsuccessful or erroneous mobility management events. Mobility management is expected to guarantee the service-continuity during the mobility by minimizing the call drops, Radio Link Failures (RLFs), unnecessary handovers, and ping-pong. In the future, it is expected that handovers will be increasing in numbers as the coverage of a single node decreases and UE mobility gets higher and higher. In addition, for the applications characterized with the stringent QoS requirements such as reliability, latency etc., the Quality of Experience (QoE) is sensitive to the handover performance, so that mobility management should avoid unsuccessful handovers and reduce the latency during the handover procedures.\n",
