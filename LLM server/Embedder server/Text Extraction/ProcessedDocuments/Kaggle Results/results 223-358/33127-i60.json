This includes overall responsibility for the provisioning/activating, modifying, and de-activating/de-provisioning the Point(s) Of Interception (POI), Triggering Functions (TF), and the Mediation and Delivery Functions (MDF). The ADMF is also responsible for managing the Identifier Event Functions (IEF) and Identifier Caching Function (ICF). The ADMF is also responsible for controlling and managing the Location Acquisition Requesting Function (LARF).\nThe ADMF includes the following logical sub-functions:\n-\tLawful Interception Control Function (LICF).\n-\tLawful Interception Provisioning Function (LIPF).\n-\tIdentifier Query Function (IQF).\n-\tCertificate Authority (CA).\n-\tLocation Acquisition Function (LAF).\nWithin one ADMF there is one LICF, one IQF, one LAF, and at least one, but possibly multiple LIPFs.\nThe LICF and LIPF communicate via the internal LI_ADMF interface, the details of which are outside the scope of the present document.\nThe LICF and LAF communicate via the internal LI_LAFC interface, the details of which are outside the scope of the present document.\nThe LIPF and LAF communicate via the internal LI_LAFP interface, the details of which are outside the scope of the present document.\nThe ADMF contains the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) for all LI components (POIs, MDFs etc.). Further details are defined in clause 8.3.\nThe IQF is used for handling identifier association requests. Further details are defined in clause 5.7.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that the LICF and IQF are always implemented on dedicated LI infrastructure which is only accessible to CSP personnel explicitly authorised to handle LI. However, the LIPF is assumed in some scenarios (e.g. virtualisation) to be implemented within the main CSP network infrastructure environment, although still only accessible to LI authorised CSP personnel.\nThe LAF is used for handling location acquisition requests. Further details are defined in clause 7.3.5.\nFor further details on the roles and responsibilities of the ADMF refer to Annex B.\nThe LICF controls the management of the end-to-end life cycle of a warrant. The LICF contains the master record of all sensitive information and LI configuration data. The LICF is ultimately responsible for all decisions within the overall LI system. The LICF, via the LIPF acting as its proxy is responsible for auditing other LI components (POIs, MDFs etc.). The LICF is responsible for communication with administrative LEA systems (LI_HI1).\nThe LICF provides the intercept information derived from the warrant for provisioning at the POI, TF, MDF2, and MDF3. With the exception of the communication with the LEA, all other communication between the LICF and any other entities shall be proxied by the LIPF.\nThe LICF also maintains and authorises the master list of POIs, IEFs, ICF, TFs, MDFs, and LARFs. In dynamic networks the LIPF is responsible for providing the LICF with any necessary updates to the POI, TF, IEF, ICF,  MDF, and LARF list.\nThe LICF is responsible for management and audit of the IEF(s) and ICF proxied by the LIPF.\nThe LICF shall support activating and deactivating of IEF identifier association reporting capabilities on a per IEF basis proxied by the LIPF.\nThe LICF shall provide the IQF with information relating to IEFs and ICF necessary for the IQF to handle queries from the LEA and obtain answers to such queries.\nIf the LICF deactivates event record reporting to an IEF, the LICF shall also instruct the ICF to immediately delete all cached identifier associations which the ICF had received from that IEF.\nThe LICF shall ensure that the ICF is always activated before IEFs and de-activated after IEFs to ensure that data loss does not occur due to an IEF sending events before an ICF is configured to receive them.\nThe LICF shall provide the LAF with information necessary for the LAF to handle location acquisition queries from the LEA and obtain answers to such queries.\nThe LIPF provisions all the applicable POIs, TFs and MDFs.\nThe role of the LIPF varies depending on implementation of network functions and of the ADMF itself (e.g. virtual or non-virtual).\nIn its simplest form, the LIPF is the secure proxy used by the LICF to communicate with POIs, TFs, MDFs or other infrastructure required to operate LI within the CSP network. In this scenario the LIPF does not store target information and simply routes LI_X1 messages from and to the LICF.\nIn scenarios where the ADMF is required to take an active role in POI triggering, the LIPF is responsible for receiving triggering information (e.g. from an IRI-TF) and forwarding the trigger to the appropriate POI.\nFor directly provisioned POIs, TFs and MDFs, the LIPF will forward all LI administration instructions from the LICF to the intended destination POI, TF or MDF.\nIn SBA as defined in TS 23.501 [2] or virtualised deployments, the LIPF is responsible for identifying changes to NFs, POIs, and TFs and MDFs through interaction with the SIRF or underlying virtualisation infrastructure. The LIPF shall notify the LICF of changes affecting the number of active NFs/POIs and TFs or other information which the LICF requires to maintain the master POI/TF and MDF list.\nWhile the LIPF is assumed to be stateful with respect to dynamic interceptions it is managing, it shall not hold the full static target or other historic LI data. If the LIPF is deployed in a virtualised environment, the LIPF shall not store LI information in persistent storage and shall rely on the LICF to manage re-synchronisation in the case of LIPF restart.\nThe IQF is the function responsible for receiving and responding to dedicated LEA real-time queries for identifier associations. Further details of the IQF are defined in clause 5.7.2.1.\nThe LICF and LIPF shall support selective management and provisioning of groups of POIs, TFs and IEFs, based on the warrant parameters (e.g., service scope, target identities), the target UE type and profile (e.g. a smartphone, a CIoT device) and the CSP's network deployment architecture and services implementation (e.g. Slicing, MEC and URLLC enablers, etc.), with the purpose of optimizing the LI system operation and avoiding its over-provisioning. This selective management and provisioning shall apply independently of architectural alternatives in clause 8.2.\nThe selective management and provisioning of LI functions may be supported by ADMF’s GUI configuration capabilities, as well as by ADMF's ability to obtain and use the CSP network data to drive its provisioning decisions.\nThe following are examples of the ADMF’s configuration capabilities:\n-\tSingle or multiple POIs or TFs or IEFs.\n-\tGroups of one or more POIs, TFs, and IEFs of a specific parent NF type.\n-\tPOIs, TFs, and IEFs associated with NFs in a specific slice.\n-\tPOIs, TFs, and IEFs independently where they are contained in the same parent NF.\n-\tEnabling only specific services or features of POIs (individually and in groups).\nSelective provisioning shall be supported on a per warrant basis.\nNOTE:\tThe criteria by which the CSP decides which POIs, IEFs and TFs to select is outside the scope of the present document except where the ADMF is able to make selections using information provided by the SIRF (e.g. all POIs and TFs in a slice).\nThe Location Acquisition Function (LAF) is responsible for processing the location requests received from the LEA during the location acquisition procedure. Further details of the LAF are defined in clause 7.3.5.\n",

The information provided shall allow the LIPF/LICF to perform the necessary operations to establish and maintain interception of the target service (e.g. provisioning POIs, TFs and MDFs over LI_X1). LIPF/LICF knowledge of POI, TF and MDF existence is provided directly by interactions between the LIPF/LICF and the underlying CSP management systems that instantiate NFs (as defined in clause 5.5). The NRF/SIRF are not involved in this step of NF/POI or MDF instantiation.\nWhile the LIPF is responsible for interactions with the SIRF, the LIPF will forward applicable information to the LICF. Details of LIPF vs LICF responsibilities in managing and maintaining interception are defined in clause 5.3.2.\nAs described in clause 5.6 of the present document, the OSS/BSS is responsible for managing the number of NFs within the network including the NF within which the SIRF is implemented. Therefore, the SIRF is not responsible for notifying the LIPF that a new NF, POI, TF or MDF has been instantiated (in virtualised networks) or connected to the network using manual processes (legacy networks). The LIPF is notified of these events directly by the relevant CSP management system as described in clause 5.6, prior to any interaction with the SIRF. When the SIRF subsequently notifies the LIPF that, for example an NF associated with a POI has now been registered with the SIRF, the LIPF knows that an NF and POI which it has already configured for LI usage is ready for live user traffic service.\nNOTE:\tThe SIRF will only become aware of the existence of NFs after they are commissioned for use within the network and are ready for service usage (NFs are authorised, instantiated and configured for network connectivity before the SIRF will become aware of them). By this stage the NF may be only several milli-seconds away from live user traffic handling. This is too late to check whether the LI components are functional and therefore the SIRF is not involved in NF instantiation reporting to the LIPF.\nIn virtualised networks where selective per POI provisioning of target identifiers is not required, or only limited network static network slicing is in use, implementation of the SIRF is not required to allow the LIPF and LICF to meet LI requirements.\n",

Figure 5.6-1 is a simplified version of the virtual LI function deployment procedures.\nThe figure depicts a simplified virtualized LI system with provisioning infrastructure for a direct provisioned POI. It illustrates the process of provisioning infrastructure for a direct provisioned POI, including the use of virtualized resources and the provisioned infrastructure.\nFigure 5.6-1: Simplified virtualised LI system with provisioning infrastructure for a direct provisioned POI\nFigure 5.6-1 shows the LI NFV controller and NFV Management and Orchestration functions (MANO), together with two logical interfaces:\n-\tLI_NO: This interface allows to exchange correlation and notification information between the LI application/service and NFV layer about related VNF and VNFC lifecycle management; it also allows to configure optional virtual deployment parameters. In addition, in case of LI functions not instantiated by OSS/BSS (see clause 5.6.3.1.6 of the present document) this interface shall support LI function instantiation requests from the ADMF.\n-\tLI_MANO: This interface allows to notify the LI NFV controller about VNF/VNFC lifecycle management and enforce virtual deployment LI security policy.\nThese two interfaces are assumed to be already setup between the involved functional entities via a mutual authenticated and encrypted dedicated connection.\nThe procedures in clause 5.6.3 assume that the LIPF, LICF and NFV LI Controller already exist before creation of any other LI functions.\nThe OSS/BSS is responsible for controlling the number of 3GPP VNFs and service chains within the network. The OSS/BSS instructs NFV MANO to instantiate, scale or terminate one or more VNFs. NFV MANO is also able to instantiate and terminate VNF sub-components (VNFCs) dynamically without input from the OSS/BSS in order to maintain performance and resilience requirements. This is especially likely in container-based implementations.\nTo ensure that all LI related aspects, if applicable, are considered within that VNF, NFV MANO notifies the LI NFV Controller about the VNF and VNFC instantiation, scaling and termination. In case where a VNF, about to be instantiated, is expected to have LI specific functionalities such as POI, TF or MDF, the LI NFV controller notifies the LIPF about those LI specific functionalities within the VNF. The LIPF would forward that notification to the LICF, which in turn, validate/verify/authorize (via LIPF, of course) that POI/TF/MDF for LI over LI_X0. If the VNF does not contain an LI function then the LI NFV Controller may still notify the LIPF/LICF.\nLI NFV Controller shall be configurable to apply default LI policy and configuration to LI VNFCs without explicit authorisation from the LIPF/LICF, depending on network performance and LI security requirements. The LI NFV Controller shall be able to apply policy on a per instantiation basis or apply a static configuration policy to NFV MANO, which NFV MANO is able to use to automatically instantiate LI components using this default configuration.\nIn most deployments some default LI configuration information will need to be provided as part of the VNF image packages and package descriptor files. Such LI information needs to be adequately protected within NFV MANO and software catalogues.\nWhere explicit authorisation of LI components is required, the LIPF would notifies the LI NFV Controller that the LI specific functions are authorized/verified and the LI NFV Controller notifies NFV MANO.\nNOTE:\tIn figure 5.6.1, LI_MANO is shown as a combined representation of the up to three separate NFV MANO interfaces provided by ETSI GS NFV IFA 026 [20]. Since the exact number of interfaces required depends on the vendor implementation of the NFVI / NFV MANO and whether a combined single NFVO interface is supported by NFV MANO, the present document treats this a single logical interface labelled as LI_MANO for 3GPP LI purposes.\n",

The process by which the NRF / SIRF is notified by the OSS/BSS/MANO is out of scope of the present document.\nWhen the 3GPP network OSS/BSS makes a request to NFV MANO to instantiate, modify or terminate a 3GPP NF, NFV MANO shall notify the LI NFV Controller of the request over LI_MANO using procedures as described in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 026 [20] or equivalent. The NFV LI Controller shall be able to send all applicable NF changes to the LIPF over LI_NO, so that the LICF is able to maintain an understanding of network topology. In 5G, the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF) also maintains understanding of active use of NF via the NRF / SIRF.\nIn addition, NFV MANO is required to send notifications of non-OSS/BSS triggered (e.g. NFV MANO automated VNF relocation, or software image update) as described in ETSI GS NFV IFA 026 [20]. The LI NFV Controller shall also be able to provide applicable notifications to the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF) of such changes.\nNOTE:\tThe precise list of information required for the ADMF to maintain understanding of network topology is implementation specific and therefore outside the scope of the present document.\nIn deployments where the implementation supports data centre / location verification for NFs being instantiated or modified, subject to operator policy the LI NFV Controller shall not allow instantiation or modification of LI functions or associated NFs which do not comply with LI location constraints set by the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF).\nWhere an NF being instantiated contains one or more LI functions (e.g. POI, TF, MDF) the LI NFV Controller shall handle any necessary steps to allow the LI functions to be instantiated by NFV MANO and the LI functions to be added to the LI environment, so that initial contact between the LI functions and the LIPF in the ADMF can be established. The LI NFV Controller shall provide details of the new LI functions to the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF), including the identity of the new LI functions, so that the LICF is aware of the existence of the LI functions.\nIn deployments where ADMF (LICF) signing of LI function software images has been implemented, the LI NFV Controller shall provide the signatures to the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF) for verification and shall only authorise NFV MANO to continue instantiation of the LI function if the LICF has successfully verified the signatures.\nNOTE:\tOnce this instantiation step is completed an LI function is considered ready for configuration by the ADMF (LIPF) but is not ready to become a live LI function.\nWhen an NF containing LI functions is being modified (e.g. scaled or relocated) the LI NFV Controller shall manage the necessary interactions with NFV MANO (using the procedures in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 026 [20] or equivalent) to allow the LI functions to also be modified in alignment with changes to their parent NF. The LI NFV Controller shall notify the LICF in the ADMF via the LIPF over LI_NO, of the subsequent modifications. Where the modifications result in a new LI function being instantiated (e.g. where a scale up exceeds the existing capabilities of the existing LI functions and a new VNFC is instantiated), the LI NFV Controller shall notify the LICF about the existence of the new LI function and indicate to which existing NF the new LI function is associated.\nWhen an NF containing LI functions is terminated, the LI NFV Controller shall manage the necessary interactions with NFV MANO (using the procedures in ETSI GS NFV IFA 026 [20] or equivalent) and notify the LICF via the LIPF that the LI functions have been removed from the system. The LICF in the ADMF shall ensure that certificates associated with those LI functions are appropriately revoked.\nProcedures in clauses 5.6.3.1.3, 5.6.3.1.4 and 5.6.3.1.5 are based on the OSS/BSS being responsible for creating all LI functions as part of normal network operations (e.g. LI functions are embedded VNFC within a VNFs or are instantiated as part of network service descriptors where a whole slice or large set of VNFs are instantiated together as part of a complete network service).\nIn some scenarios, the ADMF needs to create specific virtualised LI functions (e.g. MDF) within the NFVI used to host other operator NFs but for security reasons requires that the OSS/BSS does not manage or have knowledge of these. In this scenario, the LICF, instructs the LI NFV Controller via LIPF over LI_NO to request NFV MANO via LI_MANO to instantiate an LI specific image. This LI VNF may either be inserted as part of an existing network service chain or create a new LI specific service chain.\nIn such scenarios, the ADMF shall play the role of the OSS/BSS and the LI_NO interface shall support the related operations; the LIPF should implement the equivalent logic of OSS/BSS for these operations.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that any required LI VNF or VNFC images are available within NFV MANO image software catalogue and the images are not sent over the LI_NO or LI_MANO interfaces.\nOnly once an LI function has been instantiated and the LIPF in the ADMF informed of that NF's existence, can that NF be managed by the LIPF in the ADMF over LI_X0. Such notification is achieved as described in clause 5.6.3.1 over LI_NO and LI_MANO and occurs prior to any SIRF/NRF (or equivalent) NF discovery processes.\nThe LI_X0 interface is used to manage LI functions after instantiation such they are made ready for LI use and subsequent provisioning over LI_X1.\nAfter a VNF is instantiated (e.g. using the procedures in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 011 [10] and ETSI NFV-IFA 026 [20] or equivalent), it is necessary to automatically configure the LI functions (e.g. POI, TF, MDF) before use (i.e. to initialise it to a state where it can accept LI_X1 messages). To achieve this the LI Function shall after instantiation and initial network configuration by NFV MANO (e.g. allocation of network IP address and FQDN) contact the LIPF over the LI_X0 interface and LIPF will notify the LICF that a new potential LI function has contacted the LIPF. The LIPF shall only accept incoming connections from new LI functions that have previously been notified to the LIPF/LICF by the LI NFV controller over LI_NO. The LI_NO interface shall carry information to allow the LIPF to associate a VNF instance with the LI application instance running in it.\nThe LICF in the ADMF, through the LIPF, shall verify the authenticity of the LI function over LI_X0 in order to verify that the new LI function has been instantiated from a valid software image. If the LI function software image has been partly encrypted as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 011 [10], then once the LICF has verified the integrity of the LI function it shall provide any necessary keys to the LIPF to decrypt the LI function to complete instantiation of that LI function.\nOnce a trust relationship has been established between the LICF and new LI function, the LIPF shall issue the LI function with an LI identity (e.g. POI CSCF number 42 or LI System FQDN) and provide the other necessary certificates and configuration information to allow the new LI function to be configured for LI use on LI_X1. The LICF is responsible for providing necessary information and policy rules necessary for the LIPF to perform configuration of LI functions over LI_X0. For the purposes of instantiation IEFs and ICF follow the same instantiation flow as POIs except that the LIPF has a more limited role in managing these functions after instantiation over LI_XEM1 compared to POIs as neither of these types of LI functions are subject to LI provisioning.\nIn the case of triggered POIs which are not directly provisioned by the LIPF in the ADMF over LI_X1, the LIPF is still responsible for LI_X0 configuration of the POI including identity manage and all necessary identity / communication certificates in order to allow the POIs and TF to communicate over LI_X1, LI_T2 and LI_T3. The same applies to virtualised MDFs or CC-PAG.\nOnce an LI function directly associated with or embedded in an NF has been made fully ready for provisioning over LI_X1 using LI_X0, the LICF in the ADMF via the LIPF shall notify the LI NFV Controller that the LI function is ready for service and NFV MANO may advise the OSS/BSS that the NF associated with the LI functions is ready for service and discovery by the NRF. For MDFs, CC-PAGs, or non-embedded POIs the LICF may still need to provide a ready for service indication to NFV MANO / OSS / BSS depending on the implementation scenario.\nNOTE:\tThe full procedure for notifying the OSS/BSS that LI is ready and that the NF can be notified to the NRF (in the case of 5G SBA) is out of scope of the present document and is left to operator deployment choice.\nDuring normal system operation LI_X0 shall be used by the LIPF in the ADMF to maintain the LI function throughout the LI function’s lifecycle, except as a result of scaling or other changes applied by NFV MANO (such changes are first managed by the NFV LI Controller through LI_NO and LI_MANO and any necessary LI_X1/LI_X2/LI_X3 level re-configuration then applied over LI_X0). In-life certificate updates, identity changes, LI_X1/2/3 credential changes and other similar configuration changes shall be supported by both the LIPF in the ADMF and LI functions over LI_X0.\nFigure 5.6-2 shows an example of what the procedures described in this clause look like when instantiating a new NF and associated LI functions.\nThe figure depicts a simplified flow-diagram for OSS/BSS originated LI instantiation procedures, illustrating the steps involved in initiating a Local Interference Suppression (LI) service. The diagram includes key components such as the OSS/BSS, the LI service, and the network elements involved in the process. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 5.6-2: Example simplified flow-diagram for OSS / BSS originated LI instantiation procedures\n",

For LI purposes, CSPs are required to be able to provide real-time association between temporary and permanent identifiers where the use of such identifier associations impact the ability of the LEA to uniquely identify the UE, subscriber or true permanent identifiers associated with a service.\nThe present document defines two sets of capabilities which allow CSPs to report such association to LEAs:\n-\tReal-time reporting of associations as observed by POIs as part of network access, target communications and service usage.\n-\tDedicated real-time query, lookup and reporting of identifier associations.\nFor real-time reporting based on POI observation, associations are reported through a combination of dedicated event records sent from the POI to the MDF over LI_X2 and through inclusion of specific parameters in other communications service records reported over LI_X2.\nFor dedicated query, lookup and reporting, figure 5.7-1 shows the high-level architecture used to support identifier association query and response requirements. The Identifier Event Function (IEF) provides the Identifier Caching Function (ICF) with the events necessary to answer the identifier association queries from the IQF. LEAs are able to issue real-time queries to the Identifier Query Function (IQF), which in turn queries the ICF.\nThe figure depicts a high-level identifier retrieval system, illustrating the process of retrieving identifiers from a database. The system uses a query and response mechanism, with the query being a high-level identifier and the response being a detailed description of the identifier. The system is designed to be efficient and scalable, with a focus on performance and ease of use.\nFigure 5.7-1 High-level identifier retrieval via Query and Response.\nThe IQF and ICF shall support the following query types:\n-\tSingle query and response.\n-\tSingle query and response followed by triggered real-time reporting of any subsequent changes reported to the ICF (see NOTE 2).\nWithin the present document, only a single ICF for all IEFs is supported.\nWithin the present document, interfaces and generic functionality for dedicated identifier query and response are defined in this clause, while specific instances of the IEFs are defined within clause 6 and the ICF in clause 7.\nFor each request over LI_HIQR, the LEA shall provide a legal warrant/authorisation unique identifier. In addition, depending on the scenario, the LEA needs to provide, the observed identity (temporary or permanent), along with the serving cell identity, tracking area identifier, and time of observation by LEA.\nThe IQF shall obtain in real-time the identifier associations which match the LEA query from the ICF and provide a response to the LEA over LI_HIQR.\nIn some cases, it may not be possible to establish a single unique identifier association given the information provided by the LEA. IQF handling in such a scenario is subject to the authorisation in the warrant and is outside the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the LEA is unable to provide the tracking area associated with an observed temporary identifier this may prevent the CSP from uniquely associating the identifier to the correct UE.\nNOTE 2: \tSingle query and response followed by triggered real-time reporting of any subsequent changes detected by the IEF is only applicable to queries based on a permanent identifier where the changes reported are new temporary identifiers to which that permanent identifier has been associated.\nNOTE 3:\tThe terms identifier and identity are used interchangeably in clause 5.7. This also applies to the naming of functions like IQF.\n",

The IQF is a sub-function of the ADMF.\nOn receiving a valid query, the IQF shall query the ICF in order to obtain the required mapped identities. The IQF shall be able to support both association from permanent identifiers to temporary identifiers and from temporary identifiers to permanent identifiers.\nNOTE 1:\tOnly queries based on applicable subscription permanent identifiers or associated temporary identifiers are supported by the present document. Queries based on ME hardware identifiers or communications services identifiers (e.g. E.164 numbers) are not supported by the IQF.\nNOTE 2:\tA specific query response to the LEA may require both permanent and temporary identifiers to be returned in a single response for a given query. For example, if an LEA queries using a temporary identifier, then it may be necessary to respond with a permanent identifier, plus other associated temporary identifiers in order to fulfil the query.\nThe IQF shall only support queries that are received from the LEA within the caching duration and shall reject any queries from the LEA which fall outside those time limits.\nNOTE 3:\tIt may not always be possible for the CSP to provide an answer due to association information no longer being available in the network. The IQF shall provide support for multiple LEA scenarios. The IQF shall be able to support different query constraints for different LEAs.\nNOTE 4:\tSince IEF event generation and ICF temporary caching applies to all UEs served by the parent NF, any multiple LEA scenarios or differences in requirements are handled by the IQF only and no specific support is provided by IEF or ICF.\nThe IQF shall support both query and response types as defined in clause 5.7.1.\nThe IEF is the function responsible for observing and detecting identifier association changes within its parent NF and providing those changes in the form of event records to the ICF over LI_XER.\nIEFs may be co-located with POIs but may also be placed in other NFs where the NFs handling identifier association do not otherwise support POI functionality.\nThe IEF shall be able to provide event records to the ICF when associations are updated. Association events include both allocation or deallocation events for temporary identifiers managed by the IEF’s parent NF and for identifier associations which are registered or deregistered in the IEF's parent NF but the identifier allocation is not controlled by that NF.\nThe IEF shall support activation and deactivation of IEF association reporting capabilities, as controlled by the LICF (proxied by the LIPF) over the LI_XEM1 interface.\nWhen IEF reporting capabilities are activated, the IEF shall obtain the current allocation and registration state of all UEs known to the parent NF, (where that information has been retained in the NF as part of normal network operations) and send this as a series of allocation/registration events to the ICF.\nNOTE:\tThe IEF can only report on associations that occurred before activation of the IEF if those associations remain valid for UEs which are still served by the parent NF (some allocations may not be retained by the parent NF). Therefore, not all UE identifier associations may be available at IEF activation (e.g. due to NF or UE mobility) and therefore ICF caching may be incomplete until network reauthentication timers or similar reallocation timers have refreshed all served UEs as part of normal network operation. Such incomplete data will result in no matching identifier responses from the ICF.\nWhen IEF reporting capabilities are deactivated, the IEF shall immediately stop sending event records to the ICF.\nThe ICF is the LI function responsible for caching of identifier associations provided by the IEF in event records received over the LI_XER and answering queries from the IQF received over LI_XQR. The ICF shall support association queries from both temporary identities to permanent identities and from permanent identities to temporary identities.\nThe ICF shall store identifier associations received from the IEF and hold them indefinitely as active associations until:\n-\tA new association event is received which updates a previous association.\n-\tA disassociation event is received for a stored association.\n-\tA CSP defined maximum age is reached.\nUpon receiving a disassociation event or a new association event from the IEF, the ICF shall match any corresponding identifier associations, mark them for deletion and begin the cache time for that association. After being marked for deletion, associations shall be deleted and purged irrecoverably from the ICF once their cache time limit is reached.\nNOTE:\tThe cache time limit after which automatic deletion should occur is outside the scope of the present document. However, this CSP determined value needs to be no shorter than the maximum allowed query delay (i.e., the time from the identity observation by the LEA to the query reception by the CSP). Otherwise, this value needs to be as short as possible.\nThe ICF shall support both query and response types as defined in clause 5.7.1. For the on-going triggered response query type, after sending the initial response, the ICF shall send a further response each time the permanent identifier provided in the initial query is associated or de-associated with a temporary identifier until the IQF deprovisions the query in the ICF.\nThe ICF shall support immediate deletion of identifier associations received in events for one or more IEF(s) when requested to do so by the LICF (proxied by the LIPF) over LI_XEM1.\n",

Extending the generic LI architecture presented in clause 5, figure 6.2-3 below gives a reference point representation of the LI architecture with AMF as a CP NF providing the IRI-POI functions.\nThe figure depicts a layered architecture for Link Aggregation at AMF (LIA), illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The architecture includes a central core, which serves as the main processing unit, and multiple distributed processing units (DPUs) for processing and forwarding data. The figure also shows the use of optical fibers for data transmission, with a focus on the use of redundant paths to ensure reliability and failover capabilities.\nFigure 6.2-3: LI architecture for LI at AMF\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI (over LI_X1) present in the AMF and the MDF2. The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over LI_SI) present in the NRF to discover the AMFs in the network.\nThe IRI-POI present in the AMF detects the target UE's access and mobility related functions (network access, registration and connection management), generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages as part of the Interception Product to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the AMF:\n-\tSUPI.\n-\tPEI.\n-\tGPSI.\nThe interception performed on the above three identities are mutually independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities when available.\nTS 33.501 [9] defines the ability to prevent the SUPI being exposed over the 5G RAN through the use of SUCI. Where SUPI privacy is implemented by both the UDM and UE, the SUPI is not sent in the clear over the RAN. Therefore, AMF has to rely on the UDM to provide the SUPI as part of the registration procedure as defined in TS 33.501 [9].\nIf the AMF receives a SUCI from the UE then the AMF shall ensure for every registration (including re-registration) that SUPI has been provided by the UDM to the AMF and that the SUCI to SUPI mapping has been verified as defined in TS 33.501 [9]. This shall be performed regardless of whether the SUPI is a target of interception.\nThe AMF IRI-POI shall provide both the SUPI and the current SUCI in all applicable events defined in clause 6.2.2.4.\nThe IRI-POI present in the AMF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the following specific events or information:\n-\tRegistration.\n-\tDeregistration.\n-\tLocation update.\n-\tIdentifier association.\n-\tStart of interception with already registered UE.\n-\tUnsuccessful communication related attempt.\n-\tPositioning info transfer.\n-\tHandover.\n-\tTrace.\n-\tUE policy transfer.\n-\tService accept.\nNOTE:\tAMF reporting of UE state changes other than registration, deregistration, or service accept is not supported in the present document.\nThe registration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that a target UE has successfully registered to the 5GS via 3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP access. The registration xIRI describes the type of registration performed (e.g. initial registration, periodic registration, registration mobility update) and the access type (e.g. 3GPP, non-3GPP). Unsuccessful registration shall be reported only if the target UE has been successfully authenticated.\nThe deregistration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that a target UE has deregistered from the 5GS. The deregistration xIRI shall indicate whether it was a UE-initiated or a network-initiated deregistration.\nThe location update xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that the target's UE location is updated due to target UE mobility (e.g. in case of Xn based inter NG-RAN handover) or when the AMF observes target UE location information during some service operation (e.g., LCS, Location Reporting, or emergency services). The generation of such xIRI may be omitted if the updated UE location information is already included in other xIRIs (e.g. mobility registration) provided by the IRI-POI present in the same AMF. If the information in the AMF received over N2 (TS 38.413 [14]) includes one or more cell IDs, then all cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever location reporting is triggered at the AMF.\nThe identifier association xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI in the AMF detects a SUCI or 5G-GUTI allocation change for a SUPI associated with the target UE.\nThe start of interception with already registered UE xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that interception is activated on the target UE that has already been registered in the 5GS.\nWhen additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to generate and deliver the start of interception with already registered UE related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without receiving the corresponding start of interception with already registered UE xIRI.\nThe unsuccessful communication related attempt xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that a target UE initiated communication procedure (e.g. session establishment, SMS) is rejected or not accepted by the AMF before the proper NF handling the communication attempt itself is involved. The unsuccessful communications related attempt xIRI is also generated when the IRI-POI present in the AMF detects that a PDU session modification request to convert a single access PDU session to a Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) session is not accepted by the AMF and therefore not forwarded to the SMF.\nThe IRI-POI in the AMF shall support per target selective activation or deactivation of reporting of identifier association xIRI independently of activation of LI for all other events. When identifier association xIRI only reporting is activated, the IRI-POI in the AMF shall also generate location update xIRI.\nThe positioning info transfer xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the AMF detects one the following events:\n-\tnetwork-based or network-assisted positioning requests, responses or reports related to a target UE are being exchanged between LMF and NG-RAN via the AMF.\n-\tUE-based or UE-assisted positioning requests, responses or reports related to a target UE are being exchanged between LMF and the target UE via the AMF.\nNOTE:\tThe activation and invocation of the positioning info transfer capability exclusively for LALS is not supported in the current version of the specification. Instead, the capability is invoked whenever any LCS operation (including LALS) is performed on the target.\nThe handover xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the AMF detects that a target UE is the subject of a handover between radio access nodes in 5GS to EPS, Intra 5GS, 5GS to UTRA, or EPS to 5GS scenarios.\nThe trace xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the AMF detects that a trace session has been initiated for a target.\nThe UE policy transfer xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the AMF detects that UE policies related to a target UE are being sent by the PCF to the target UE via the AMF and confirmed by the target UE.\nThe service accept xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the AMF detects that the target UE service request has been accepted, changing the service state of the target.\nThe list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15].

                            "text_content": "In the 5GC network, user plane functions are separated from the control plane functions. The SMF that handles control plane actions (e.g. establishing, modifying, deleting) for the PDU sessions shall include an IRI-POI that has the LI capability to generate the related xIRI. The UPF that handles the user plane data shall include a CC-POI that has the capability to duplicate the user plane packets from the PDU sessions based on the interception rules received from the SMF. Figure 6.2-4 shows the LI architecture for SMF/UPF based interception.\nThe figure depicts a layered architecture of a 2-4 fiber-optic network, with a focus on the Local Interference Reduction (LI) mechanism. The LI mechanism is crucial for maintaining network performance and reliability, as it reduces the impact of interference from other networks. The figure shows the various components of the network, including the Local Termination Points (LTPs) and the Upstream Termination Points (UTPs), which are essential for the network's functionality. The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy in the network, as it ensures that the network can continue to function even if a single link fails. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the 2-4 fiber-optic network's architecture and the LI mechanism.\nFigure 6.2-4: LI architecture showing LI at SMF/UPF\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI (present in the SMF), MDF2 and MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces. To enable the interception of the target's user plane packets (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception of communication contents), the CC-TF present in the SMF is also provisioned with the intercept data.\nNOTE 1:\tThe IRI-POI and CC-TF represented in figure 6.2-4 are logical functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be handled by the same process within the SMF.\nThe LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over LI_SI) present in the NRF to discover the SMFs and UPFs in the network. The IRI-POI present in the SMF detects the PDU session establishment, modification, and deletion related events, generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nWhen interception of communication contents is required, the CC-TF present in the SMF sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface. The CC-POI in the UPF shall present itself as the same CC-POI to all the CC-TFs in the same SMF set, such that a CC-TF is capable of modifying or deactivating a task activated/modified in the CC-POI by a different CC-TF in the same SMF set.\nThe trigger sent from the CC-TF to CC-POI includes the following information:\n-\tUser plane packet detection rules.\n-\tTarget identity.\n-\tCorrelation information.\n-\tMDF3 address.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen LI_T3 is used, the LI_X1 between LIPF and CC-POI present in the UPF is used to monitor the user plane data.\nThe CC-POI present in the UPF generates the xCC from the user plane packets and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.\nA warrant that does not require the interception of communication contents, may require IRI messages that have to be derived from the user plane packets. To support the generation of related xIRI (i.e. that requires access to the user plane packets), the present document supports two implementation approaches as described in clause 7.12.2. When approach 1 from clause 7.12.2 is used, the IRI-POI in the UPF shall present itself as the same IRI-POI to all the IRI-TFs in the same SMF set, such that an IRI-TF is capable of modifying or deactivating a task activated/modified in the IRI-POI by a different IRI-TF in the same SMF set.\nClause 8.6.2 defines a CC-PAG (CC-POI Aggregator) as an architectural extension option that is located between the MDF3 and CC-POI and performs the function of aggregating the xCC from different CC-POIs towards the MDF3.\nThe LIPF provisions the intercept related information associated with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the SMF:\n-\tSUPI.\n-\tPEI.\n-\tGPSI.\nThe interception performed on the above three identities are mutually independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities when available.\nThe IRI-POI present in the SMF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the following specific events or information:\n-\tPDU session establishment.\n-\tPDU session modification.\n-\tPDU session release.\n-\tStart of interception with an established PDU session.\nThe PDU session establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects that a PDU session has been established for the target UE.\nThe PDU session modification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects that a PDU session is modified for the target UE.\nThe PDU session release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects that a PDU session is released for the target UE.\nThe start of interception with an established PDU session xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in a SMF detects that interception is activated on the target UE that has an already established PDU session in the 5GS. When a target UE has multiple PDU sessions, this xIRI shall be sent for each PDU session with a different value of correlation information.\nWhen additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to generate and deliver the start of interception with an established PDU session related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without receiving the corresponding start of interception with an established PDU session xIRI.\nWhen the warrant requires the packet header information reporting, the following xIRI shall be generated:\n-\tPacket header information report (see clause 7.12.2).\nThe generation of packet header information reporting can be done by either the IRI-POI present in the UPF or the MDF2.\nThe list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each xIRI shall include at the minimum the following information:\n-\tTarget identity.\n-\tTime stamp.\n-\tCorrelation information.\n-\tLocation information.\n-\tSession related information.\nThe parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].\nThe SMF shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology cases:\n-\tNon-roaming case.\n-\tRoaming case, in VPLMN.\n-\tRoaming case, in HPLMN.\n-\tNon-3GPP access case, in the PLMN where N3A Entity resides.\nWhen the target UE has multiple PDU sessions active, the generation and delivery of xCC for each PDU session shall be done independently, each with separate correlation information.\nWhen a target UE's PDU session involves multiple Data Network (DN) connections (i.e. multiple connections to the same DN as described in clause A.3 of the present document), the generation and delivery of xCC shall be done in such a way that:\n-\tAll applicable user plane packets are captured and delivered.\n-\tDuplicate delivery of CC is suppressed to the extent possible.\n-\tEach user plane packet is delivered with the associated DN Access Identifier (DNAI).\nA PDU session may involve more than one UPFs. In that case, the CC-TF present in the SMF shall determine which UPF(s) is (are) more suitable to provide the CC-POI functions adhering to the above requirements. Furthermore, independent of which UPF is used to generate the xCC, the CC delivered from the MDF3 shall be correlated to the IRI messages related to the PDU session.\nThe IRI-POI present in the SMF shall generate xIRI, for MA PDU sessions when it detects events or information as in clause 6.2.3.3, with the following clarifications.\nThe PDU session establishment xIRI:\n-\tWhen a UE request for an MA PDU session is received at the SMF (for one or more access types).\n-\tWhen a UE request for a single access PDU session is received at the SMF with an upgrade indicator to an MA PDU and the SMF chooses to establish an MA PDU session.\nThe PDU session modification xIRI:\n-\tWhen an MA PDU Session is modified by releasing or adding an access type.\n-\tWhen a UE request for a mid-session upgrade to MA PDU session is received at the SMF.\nThe PDU session release xIRI:\n-\tWhen the entire PDU session is released.\nEach user plane packet of the MA PDU session should be able to be associated to the access type.\nThe figure depicts a simplified architecture diagram for the SMF/UPF interception system, illustrating the interception of signals by SMF sets and LISSF. The diagram includes key components such as SMF sets, LISSF, and optical line terminals (OLTs). The layered design of the architecture ensures redundancy and failover reliability.\nFigure 6.2-4A: LI architecture diagram for SMF/UPF interception when using SMF sets and LISSF\nIf an SMF belongs to an SMF set, then the TF present in the SMF shall have the ability to modify or stop the interceptions in the POIs present in the UPF irrespective of which TF present in an SMF from that SMF set had previously initiated the interception. A TF in one SMF of an SMF set may initiate the interception at a POI present in the UPF, the TF present in another SMF of the SMF set may make changes to the interception in that POI, and a TF in a different SMF of the SMF set may stop the interception in that POI.\nIn order to allow the TFs present in different SMFs of an SMF set to manage the interceptions at the POI present in an UPF, a new LI function referred to as LI State Storage Function (LISSF) is introduced. The TF that initiates the interception at a POI present in the UPF stores the related necessary information (e.g. correlation information) in case a different TF has to manage the interception at that POI. This necessary related information is referred to as LI state information (see TS 33.128 [15] for the details).\nIf an SMF belongs to an SMF set, then the POI present in the SMF shall have the ability to continue the interception using the same correlation information or stop the interception even when the SMF that manages the PDU session changes.\nIn order to allow the POIs present in different SMFs of an SMF set to continue the interception by maintaining a continuity, the LISSF mentioned above is used by storing the LI state information. When required, the POI present in the SMF of an SMF set stores the LI state information in the LISSF. The POI present in another SMF of the same SMF can retrieve the LI state information from that LISSF to provide a continued interception.\nWhen an SMF in an SMF set requests SM context information related to a target from a UDSF or receives SM context information from another SMF, the TF and POI within the SMF shall retrieve also the relevant LI state information from the shared LISSF.\nIf the implementation of the SMF set does not ensure that active SM contexts are always present in some SMF of the SMF set, the TF shall also retrieve the relevant LI state information when an existing task is deactivated by the LIPF.\nNOTE:\tThe race conditions between the LI_X1, LI_ST operations, and network events are possible and need to be accounted for in the implementation.\nLI_ST is an interface between the LISSF and the LIPF and between the LISSF and other LI functions. It is used for transferring LI state information. The LI functions may request, store or erase LI state information from the LISSF using this interface. LI functions need to be authorized by the LIPF to have access to a specific instance of the LISSF before using the LI_ST interface.\nThe figure depicts a LI_ST interface in the LI architecture, illustrating the use of this interface for communication between the Li nodes. The interface is crucial for managing the communication between Li nodes, ensuring efficient data transmission and coordination.\nFigure 6.2-4B: Use of the LI_ST interface in the LI architecture.\n",

Extending the generic LI architecture presented in clause 5, figure 6.3-1 below gives a reference point representation of the LI architecture with MME as a CP Network Element providing the IRI-POI functions.\nThe LI architecture for LI at MME is depicted in Figure 6.3-1, illustrating the network's layered structure. The LI architecture consists of a central core, which is connected to the MME through a network of optical fibers. The core is equipped with a set of optical line terminals (OLTs) and distributed nodes, which are responsible for transmitting and receiving signals. The architecture is designed to ensure high reliability and failover capabilities, with redundant paths to ensure uninterrupted communication.\nFigure 6.3-1: LI architecture for LI at MME\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI (over LI_X1) present in the MME and the MDF2.\nThe IRI-POI present in the MME detects the target UE's access and mobility related functions (network access, registration and connection management), generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages as part of the Interception Product to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nThe LIPF provisions the IRI-POI present in the MME with the following target identities:\n-\tIMSI.\n-\tMSISDN.\n-\tIMEI.\nThe interception performed on the above three identities are mutually independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities when available.\nThe IRI-POI present in the MME shall generate xIRI, when it detects the following specific events or information:\n-\tAttach.\n-\tDetach.\n-\tTracking Area/EPS Location Update.\n-\tStart of interception with EPS attached UE.\n-\tUnsuccessful communication related attempt.\n-\tIdentifier association.\n-\tPositioning info transfer.\n-\tHandover.\n-\tTrace.\n-\tService accept.\nThe attach xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that a target UE has performed an E-UTRAN attach procedure including via a HeNB. The attach xIRI describes the type of attach performed. Unsuccessful registration shall be reported only if the target UE has been successfully authenticated.\nThe detach xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that a target UE has detached from the EPS including via a HeNB. The detach xIRI shall indicate whether it was a UE-initiated or a network-initiated detach.\nThe tracking area/EPS location update xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that the target UE location is updated due to target UE mobility (e.g. in case of X2 based handover, S1 based handover) or when the MME observes target UE location information during some service operation (e.g., periodic Tracking Area Update, UE triggered Service Request). If the information in the MME received over S1 (TS 36.413 [14]) includes one or more cell IDs, then all cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever location reporting is triggered at the MME.\nThe start of interception with EPS attached UE xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that interception is activated on a target UE that is already attached to the EPS. If there are multiple PDN connections active for the target, then a start of interception with EPS attached UE xIRI is generated for each of them.\nWhen additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to generate and deliver the start of interception with E-UTRAN attached UE related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without receiving the corresponding start of interception with already registered UE xIRI.\nThe unsuccessful communication related attempt xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that a target UE initiated communication procedure (e.g. service request, SMS) is rejected or not accepted by the MME before the proper NF handling the communication attempt itself is involved.\nThe identifier association xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI in the MME detects a GUTI allocation change for an IMSI associated with the target UE.\nThe IRI-POI in the MME shall support per target selective activation or deactivation of reporting of only identifier association xIRI independently of activation of LI for all other events. When identifier association xIRI only reporting is activated, the IRI-POI in the MME shall also generate Tracking Area/EPS Location Update xIRI.\nThe positioning info transfer xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the MME detects one the following events:\n-\tnetwork-based or network-assisted positioning requests, responses or reports related to a target UE are being exchanged between E-SMSC and eNB via the MME.\n-\tUE-based or UE-assisted positioning requests, responses or reports related to a target UE are being exchanged between E-SMLC and the target UE via the MME.\nNOTE:\tThe activation and invocation of the positioning info transfer capability exclusively for LALS is not supported in the current version of the specification. Instead, the capability is invoked whenever any LCS operation (including LALS) is performed on the target.\nThe handover xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the MME detects that a target UE is the subject of a handover between radio access nodes in Intra EPS scenarios or scenarios when the target UE is the subject of a handover between EPS and any other RAT.\nThe trace xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the MME detects that a trace session has been initiated for a target.\nThe service accept xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the MME detects that the target UE service request has been accepted.\nThe IRI-POI present in the MME shall generate xIRI, when it detects the applicable events specified in TS 33.107 [11].\nIn addition to the events specified in TS 33.107 [11] the MME shall generate xIRI, when it detects the following additional event:\n-\tIdentifier association.\n-\tHandover.\n-\tTrace.\n-\tService accept.\nThe identifier association xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI in the MME detects a GUTI allocation change for an IMSI associated with the target UE.\nThe IRI-POI in the MME shall support per target selective activation or deactivation of reporting of only identifier association xIRI independently of activation of LI for all other events. When identifier association xIRI only reporting is activated, the IRI-POI in the MME shall also generate Tracking Area/EPS Location Update xIRI.\nThe handover xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the MME detects that a target UE is the subject of a handover between radio access nodes in Intra EPS scenarios or scenarios when the target UE is the subject of a handover between EPS and any other RAT.\nThe trace xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the MME detects that a trace session has been initiated for a target.\nThe service accept xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the MME detects that the target UE service request has been accepted.\nThe list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. All xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tTarget identity.\n-\tTime stamp.\n-\tLocation information.\n-\tCorrelation information.\nThe list of parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15]. The following give a summary.\nThe attach xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tAttach type information.\n-\tAccess type information.\n-\tHeNB information.\nThe detach xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tDetach Direction.\n-\tDetach type information.\n-\tHeNB information.\nThe tracking area/EPS location update xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tLocation of the target (see clause 7.3).\n-\tHeNB information.\nThe start of interception with EPS attached UE xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tAttach type information.\n-\tAccess type information.\n-\tPDN connection information.\nThe unsuccessful communication attempt xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tRejected type of communication attempt.\n-\tAccess type information.\n-\tFailure reason.\nThe identifier association xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tIMSI.\n-\tIMEI.\n-\tTemporary identifier association (i.e. GUTI).\n-\tAssociation change type indication.\nThe handover xIRI shall include the following:\n-\tHandover type and reason.\n-\tRadio related information.\n-\tUE capability information.\nWhen the access type is non-3GPP, the IP address used by the UE to reach the N3A Entity shall be reported.

The PGW is the gateway which terminates the SGi interface towards the PDN as specified in TS 23.401 [22]. Additionally, the PGW is the user plane anchor for mobility between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access as specified in TS 23.402 [23].\nNOTE :\tThe present document supports LI for non-3GPP accesses connected to EPC using GTP-based S2a or GTP-based S2b as specified by TS 23.402 [23].

The control plane (CP) functions (SGW-C and PGW-C) provide the traffic forwarding rules (referred to as Forward Action Rules in TS 23.214 [75]) to the user plane (UP) functions (SGW-U and PGW-U). The UP functions forward the user plane traffic as per the Forward Action Rules.\nIn the following clauses, EPS architecture that does not separate the control plane and user plane functions of the SGW/PGW is referred to as non-CUPS EPS.\nThe LI architecture for non-CUPS EPS is defined in clause 6.3.3.1.2. For non-CUPS EPS architecture, the SGW and PGW function as both CP Entities and the UP Entities.\nThe LI architecture for CUPS EPS is defined in clause 6.3.3.1.3.

The LI architecture is designed to support the transmission of data over the non-CUPS SGW/PGW, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. Key components include the SGW/PGW, which serves as the primary data transmission point, and the LI, which is responsible for the data routing and management. The architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy expansion and modification as needed.\nFigure 6.3-2: LI architecture for LI at non-CUPS SGW/PGW\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW, MDF2 and MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces. To enable the interception of the target's user plane packets (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception of communication contents), the CC-POI present in the SGW/PGW is also provisioned with the intercept data.\nNOTE:\tThe IRI-POI and CC-POI represented in figure 6.3-2 are logical functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be handled by the same process within the SGW/PGW.\nThe IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW detects the target UE's bearer activation, modification and deactivation, generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nThe CC-POI present in the SGW/PGW generates the xCC from the user plane packets and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.\nA warrant that does not require the interception of communication contents, may require IRI messages that have to be derived from the user plane packets. To support the generation of related xIRI (i.e. that requires access to the user plane packets), the present document supports two implementation approaches described in clause 7.12.2\nFigure 6.3-3 shows the LI architecture for EPS CUPS SGW/PGW based interception.\nThe LI architecture for LI at EPS CUPS SGW/PGW is depicted in Figure 6.3-3, illustrating the network's layered design. This architecture is based on the principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and is designed to provide high-speed data transmission and efficient network management. The architecture consists of three main components: the Core Switch (CS), the Optical Line Terminal (OLT), and the Distributed Node (DN). The CS is responsible for routing and switching traffic, while the OLT provides optical connectivity to the network. The DN is responsible for processing and forwarding data packets. The architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy expansion and modification as the network grows.\nFigure 6.3-3: LI architecture for LI at EPS CUPS SGW/PGW\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI present in the SGW-C/PGW-C and the MDF2 over the LI_X1 interfaces.

When a target UE has multiple 5GC PDU sessions mapped to multiple PDN connections in EPC or when a target UE has multiple PDN connections in EPC, this xIRI shall be sent for each PDU session and each PDN connection with different  correlation information values.\nWhen xIRIs are generated due to the detection of a PDU session with mapped EBIs, no separate xIRIs shall be generated for the same events for the corresponding PDN connection.\nWhen additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to generate and deliver the start of interception with an established PDU session related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without receiving the corresponding start of interception with an established PDU session xIRI.\nWhen the warrant requires the packet header information reporting, the following xIRI shall be generated:\n-\tPacket header information report (see clause 7.12.2).\nThe generation of packet header information reporting can be done by either the IRI-POI present in the UPF+PGW-U or the MDF2.\nThe IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW shall generate xIRI, when it detects the applicable events specified in TS 33.107 [11].\nThe list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15].

LALS is based on the Location Services (LCS) capabilities defined in TS 23.271 [5], TS 23.273 [30] and inOMA MLP [6]. The 5G Core Network support of LCS is described in TS 23.501 [2] clause 4.4.4 and TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.13.5.\nLALS shall adhere to the requirements in TS 33.126 [3] clauses 6.6 (Security) and 6.3 (Detect and Capture). The LCS supporting LALS shall be able to provide priority to LALS requests. The subscriber location privacy settings shall be overridden for LALS by setting the privacy override indicator to \"override\" in the LI LCS client profile in the GMLC (see TS 23.273 [30] clause 5.4.4).\nFor inbound roaming targets, the VPLMN LCS functional entities fulfilling LALS requests, by default, shall not communicate with the target's HPLMN, as it may cause detectability issues, but rather the GMLC shall be able to determine the serving AMF/MME from which it can acquire the inbound roaming target's location. Detectability issues may also exist when LALS is invoked for outbound roaming targets. This means by default, the GMLC shall refrain from performing the positioning of an outbound roaming target.\nNOTE 0:\tThe visited GMLC may send the location request to all the AMF/MME of the VPLMN. If the visited GMLC has knowledge of the last AMF/MME serving the target UE, it may use that one in the first attempt.\nDepending on national requirements and LCS capabilities of the CSP, the location information provided by LALS may vary in location information types (mobile network cell ID, location shape and geo-coordinates, civic address, or a combination of those), in the set of additional location parameters (map data, motion state, speed, etc.), as well as in the accuracy of provided location information.\nNOTE 1:\tThe accuracy of positioning is, usually, a trade-off for the location acquisition delay. It also depends on other positioning technology specific factors.\nThe parameters controlling the LALS output are either delivered per warrant over the LI_X1 interface from the ADMF to the LI-LCS Client, or to the Location Triggering Function (LTF, see clause 7.3.3.3), or are pre-configured in the LI-LCS Client. The LI-LCS Client is a special type of IRI-POI in the CSP network fulfilling the role of the LCS client for LALS purposes. As such, the LI-LCS client shall support all the requirements and interfaces in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.273 [30] for an LCS client.\nNOTE 2:\tThe LI-LCS Client profile at GMLC is to be provisioned and accessed by authorized personnel only. The mechanism of this functionality is outside the scope of the present document.\nThere are two types of the location interception defined in the present document: target positioning and triggered location.\nTarget positioning determines the target's location independently of the services used by the target.\nTriggered location determines the LALS based location of the target when specific network or service events related to the target occur.\nThe warrant for target positioning and for triggered location of the same target may be independent of each other and may be overlapping in time or combined in a single intercept warrant by the LEA.\nThere may be multiple active LALS warrants from different LEAs at any given time.\nAs required by TS 33.126 [3] R6.3 – 370, the location provision variants supported in the current document are immediate location and periodic location.\nThe LI-LCS client shall include an IRI-POI that has the LI capabilities to generate the target UE’s location related xIRI.\nFigure 7.3-1 shows the architecture for LALS where the LI-LCS client provides the target's location and associated information towards the MDF2 over the LI_X2 interface as per the ADMF request for target positioning delivered over LI_X1 interface.\nThe LALS model for target positioning is depicted in Figure 7.3-1, illustrating the process of calculating the target's position using a combination of laser range and angular range measurements. The model is based on the principles of laser range and angular range, with the laser range being the distance between the laser transmitter and the target, and the angular range being the angle between the laser transmitter and the target. The model is used to determine the target's position by calculating the difference between the laser range and angular range measurements, and then using the target's position and the laser range measurements to calculate the angular range. The model is used in various applications, such as target tracking, navigation, and surveillance, to improve the accuracy and reliability of target positioning.\nFigure 7.3-1: LALS model for target positioning\nNOTE:\tThe Le interface is specified in OMA MLP [6].\nThe request for immediate location provision is delivered to the LI-LCS client over the LI_X1 interface. Upon receiving the request, the LI-LCS client initiates a Location Immediate Request (LIR, see TS 23.271 [5]) to the LCS Server/GMLC supporting LALS over the Le interface and reports the acquired location to the MDF2 over LI_X2.\nWhile waiting for a response to an LIR from the LCS Server/GMLC, the LI-LCS client may receive and process additional LIRs from the ADMF over the LI_X1.\nNOTE:\tThe LCS Server/GMLC supporting LALS can be optimized to provide the same single location estimation in response to multiple positioning requests arriving in temporal proximity of each other.\nThe resulting immediate location information shall be delivered by the LI-LCS client as xIRI over LI_X2 to the MDF2. The MDF2 generates and delivers the IRI messages based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.\nThe request for periodic location provision is delivered to the LI-LCS client over the LI_X1 interface.\nThe request for periodic location from the ADMF to the LI-LCS client may include a set of parameters defining the duration of reporting, report periodicity, etc. The description of the service response parameters is provided in clause 7.3.3.4. The periodic location result shall be delivered by the LI-LCS client as xIRI over LI_X2 to the MDF2. The MDF2 generates and delivers the IRI messages based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.\nThe periodicity of the LALS reports shall be controlled by the LI-LCS client. The LI-LCS client shall issue a series of Location Immediate Requests (LIR, see TS 23.271 [5]) at required time intervals.\nA request for immediate or periodic location provision from the ADMF to the LI-LCS Client may carry parameters enabling multiple intermediate responses from the LCS Server/GMLC to a single LIR issued by the LI-LCS Client (as defined in TS 23.273 [30] clauses 6.10.4 and 6.1.3). These parameters include the flag for acceptance of intermediate location estimates and the maximum response time for final location result (see OMA MLP [6], clauses 5.3.60.1 and 5.3.107).\nSimilar to a single service response, the intermediate location estimates shall include the response parameters defined in clause 7.3.3.4 and shall be delivered by the LI-LCS Client as xIRI over LI_X2 to the MDF2. The MDF2 generates and delivers the IRI messages based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.\nThe Triggered location is the capability of providing LALS based location information when specific network or service events related to the target occur. While IRI generated by the event that also triggers the LALS may have the location information included (in the form of cell ID), LALS may provide additional location parameters, such as the target geo-location, velocity, etc. (see TS 33.126 [3] R6.3 – 270). The triggered location reporting utilizes the immediate location variant.\nThe LALS triggered location architecture in figures 7.3-2 and 7.3-3 depicts the Location Triggering Function (LTF). The LTF is an IRI-TF and resides in the same NF (e.g. AMF) that has the IRI-POI or in an MDF2. The LTF is responsible for triggering the IRI-POI in the LI-LCS Client when a specific event related to the target is observed at the co-located IRI-POI or received at the MDF2 in which the LTF is residing.\nFigure 7.3-2 depicts the architecture of Triggered Location for IRI acquisition and delivery for the case when the LTF is residing in the same NF that has the IRI-POI reporting IRI events for the target.\nThe LALS model for triggered location (POI/LTF option) is depicted in Figure 7.3-2, illustrating the LALS (Local Area Linking Scheme) model for triggering location (POI/LTF) in a 5G network. The figure shows the LALS model with a focus on the POI/LTF option, which is a crucial component in 5G networks. The model includes key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.3-2: LALS model for triggered location (POI/LTF option)\nNOTE 1:\tThe IRI-POI and LTF represented in figure 7.3-2 are logical functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be handled by the same process within the NF.\nFigure 7.3-3 depicts the architecture of triggered location acquisition and delivery for the case when the LTF is embedded into an MDF2.\nThe figure depicts a 3-3 LALS model for triggered location (MDF/LTF option), illustrating the process of location determination in a 3-3 network. The model includes three layers: the MDF layer, the LTF layer, and the LAL layer. The MDF layer determines the location of the user equipment (UE), while the LTF layer determines the location of the base station (gNB). The LAL layer determines the location of the scatterers. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network topology, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.\nFigure 7.3-3: LALS Model for triggered location (MDF/LTF option)\nIn case of triggered location, the LTF (present in either an NF hosting an IRI-POI or in a MDF2) is provisioned by the ADMF over LI_X1 interface.\nAs part of this request, the ADMF provides the address for the LTF to reach the LI-LCS client for use on the LI_T2 interface.

The outcome of this procedure is the target’s TAI, ECGI/NCGI and optionally the timestamp when the target’s location was acquired. In case of EPC, it is emulating the Insert Subscriber Data request containing the IDR-Flags with the \"EPS Location Information Request\" bits set at the MME and consumes the response as defined in TS 29.272 [54] clause 5.2.2.1.2. In case of 5GC, it is emulating the AMF location services request and consumes the response as defined in TS 29.518 [52] clause 5.5.2.4. The MME/AMF shall override any user consent, privacy and paging restrictions concerned with location acquisition that may apply to the target UE.\nThe LEA shall be able to indicate in the request to the LAF whether the MME/AMF location services shall be invoked or whether the current stored value of the location as known by the MME/AMF is returned.\nPrior to issuing of location acquisition requests, the LEA shall provide an authorization for these requests. This is done by issuing a warrant over the LI_HI1 interface prior to issuing the location acquisition requests. Subsequently, the LIPF will provision the MDF2 if needed.\nNOTE:\tThe use of the location acquisition procedure may cause detectability issues due to the possibility of triggering a Network Triggered Service Request procedure for a UE. Detectibility issues may also include the visibility between different LEAs using location acquisition with warrants for the same target. It is up to the LEA to decide if location acquitison is to be used.\nThis clause describes the architecture for location acquisition. The architecture is based on the use of a LAF, which communicates with the LARF associated with an MME/AMF over the LI_XLA interface.\nTo use the location acquisition procedure, the LAF needs to determine the serving MME/AMF for the target UE.\nNOTE:\tThe method for determining the serving MME/AMF is not defined in the present document.\nThe LAF is requested to perform location acquisition via the LI_HILA interface between LEA and LAF. Upon receiving the request, the LAF initiates location acquisition to the LARF via the LI_XLA interface.\nThe networks shall support the delivery of location information via the following methods:\n-\tLocation information is delivered back as a response to the location acquisition request via the LAF over the LI_XLA and the LI_HILA interfaces.\n-\tLocation information is delivered via the MDF2 over the LI_X2_LA and the LI_HI2 interfaces.\nThe two delivery options may be used simultaneously.\nThe LARF and the IRI-POI will exchange the necessary information to ensure that IRI-POI will not generate the xIRI for location requests initiated by the LARF.\nThe ADMF shall be able to audit the LARF over the LI_XLA interface.\nThe architecture for delivering location information via the LI_HILA is depicted in figure 7.3.5.2.1-1.\nThe figure depicts the delivery of the retrieved location information via the LI_HILA protocol, which is a key component in the delivery of location information in a wireless network. The LI_HILA protocol is used to deliver location information to the receiver, ensuring that the location information is accurate and reliable. The figure shows the communication between the sender and the receiver, as well as the steps involved in the delivery process.\nFigure 7.3.5.2.1-1: Delivery of the retrieved location information via the LI_HILA\nUpon determining the location, the LARF will forward the location information to the LAF via the LI_XLA interface. The retrieved information is further provided in the response to the LEA over the interface LI_HILA. The LARF and the IRI-POI will exchange the necessary information to ensure that IRI-POI will not generate the xIRI for location requests initiated by the LARF.\nThe architecture for delivering location information via LI_HI2 is depicted in figure 7.3.5.2.2-1.\nThe figure depicts the delivery of the retrieved location information via the LI_HI2 protocol, illustrating the steps involved in the location information retrieval process.\nFigure 7.3.5.2.2-1: Delivery of the retrieved location information via the LI_HI2\nUpon determining the location, the LARF shall forward the location information to the MDF2 over the LI_X2_LA interface using the information provided by the LAF in the LI_XLA request (e.g. internal intercept identifier).

The target of interception can be a subscriber of the CSP, an inbound roamer or a non-local ID.\nThe network function involved in providing the interception of IMS-based services are determined based on the deployment option, the network configuration, LI service scope and the IMS session including the roaming scenarios. The IRI-POI functions are provided by the network functions that handle the SIP messages (those network functions are referred to as IMS Signalling Functions) and the triggered CC-POI functions are provided by the network functions that handle the media (these network functions are referred to as IMS Media Functions). The CC-TF functions are also provided by the network functions that handle the SIP messages (referred to as IMS Signalling Functions) and manage the IMS Media Functions. The network functions that provide the CC-TF functions can be different from the network functions that provide the IRI-POI functions.\nAn architecture depicting the LI for IMS is depicted in figure 7.4-2 below.\nThe IMS LI architecture, depicted in Figure 7.4-2, is a key component of the 5G network, enabling efficient signal transmission and reception. It consists of a set of interconnected base stations (BSs) and a network of optical line terminals (OLTs) that facilitate the transmission of signals. The architecture is designed to minimize latency and ensure reliable communication, with redundant paths and failover mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted service.\nFigure 7.4-2: IMS LI architecture\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF. The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI, CC-TF, MDF2 and MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces.\nThe CC-TF sends the CC intercept trigger to the CC-POI over LI_T3 interface. The IRI-POI generates the xIRI and delivers the same to the MDF2 over LI_X2 interface. The CC-POI generates the xCC and delivers the same to the MDF3 over LI_X3 interface.\nThe MDF2 generates IRI messages from the received xIRI and delivers those IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2 interface. The MDF3 generates the CC from the received xCC and delivers that CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3 interface.\nThe network configuration and IMS service scenarios including the roaming scenarios determine the network functions that provide the IRI-POI, CC-TF and CC-POI functions. The network function that provides the IRI-POI or CC-TF is referred to as IMS Signalling Function in figure 7.4-2 and the network function that provides the CC-POI functions is referred to as IMS Media Function in figure 7.4-1.\nNOTE:\tThe details of correlation between the xIRI and the xCC when IRI-POI and CC-TF are not co-located is not defined in the present document. The IRI-POI and CC-TF are logical functions and they may be handled by the same process when they are co-located in the same IMS Signalling Function.\nThe LIPF provisions the intercept related information associated with the following target identities to the IRI-POI and CC-TF present in the IMS Signalling Functions:\n-\tIMPU.\n-\tIMPI.\n-\tPEI (IMEI only).\n-\tIMEI.\nThe IRI-POI and CC-TF shall also support interception of non-local identities in any of the IMPU formats (SIP URI, TEL URI as well as the E.164 number in a SIP URI or TEL URI). In case a PBX is connected to a PLMN, the interception of targets that are served by PBX may be treated as non-local identities in the connected PLMN.\nNOTE\tIt is assumed that GPSI/MSISDN is mapped to IMPU, and SUPI/IMSI is mapped to IMPI.\nDepending on the session direction, different SIP parameters are used to identify the target subscriber.\nFurther details on the use of SIP parameters in identifying a target is described in TS 33.128 [15].\n",

                            "text_content": "For roaming targets, depending on the roaming architecture deployed, media of the target may not enter the HPLMN for certain session scenarios. In such situations, the HPLMN served with the warrant shall be able to do the following:\n-\tPerform the interception without the CC and report to the LEMF that the CC is unavailable due to target's roaming situation. Note that the Serving System message (reported by the UDM/HSS) also indicates to the LEMF that the target is roaming.\n-\tWhen a new warrant is activated on a target with an ongoing IMS session with the CC not available, the HPLMN serving the new warrant shall report the CC unavailability indication to the LEMF associated with the new warrant.\nSee TS 33.128 [15] for the method used to report the CC unavailability indication.\nThe term S8HR is used to denote the home-routed roaming architecture for VoEPS UEs. Within the VPLMN with S8HR, the IMS signalling messages are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the IMS signalling bearer and the media packets are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the media bearer. (i.e. a dedicated EPS Bearer is used to carry the media packets). The EPS Bearer ID of the IMS signalling bearer is always linked to the dedicated EPS Bearer used as a media bearer.\nThe SGW/PGW within the EPC may implement control plane and user plane functions in a combined form or in a separated form. In a separated form, the SGW-C/PGW-C provides the control plane functions and SGW-U/PGW-U provides the user plane functions.\nNOTE:\tWith S8HR, the PGW (or PGW-C/PGW-U) resides in the HPLMN.\nThe present document specifies two options for implementing the LI functions for voice services with S8HR as the roaming architecture:\n1. \tUse the capabilities specified below in the present document for stage 2 and in TS 33.128 [15] for stage 3.\n2. \tUse the capabilities defined in TS 33.107 [11] and TS 33.108 [21] natively as defined in those documents.\nAccording to the present document, to provide the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN with S8HR, the architecture presented in figure 7.4.7.4-1 is used with SGW-C providing the BBIFF-C and SGW-U providing the BBIFF-U functions.\nNOTE 1:\tThe overall architecture and functions related to the lawful interception of voice services of inbound roaming targets with S8HR as the roaming architecture is also referred in the present document as S8HR LI.\nNOTE 2:\tThe LI functions for SGW in a combined form can be visualized presuming that SGW-C and SGW-U are provided by the same network function. In this mode, the BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U functions are provided by BBIFF.\nS8HR LI solution requires that Access Point Name (APN) can be identified as being used for S8HR and therefore can be used to identify that the EPS Bearers are used for inbound roamers with S8HR.\nFor the describing the S8HR LI process, the following terms apply:\n-\tThe packet data connection representing the IMS signalling channel referenced in clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as IMS signalling bearer. This is also referred to as the default bearer and uses the QCI value of 5, GSMA IR.92 [26].\n-\tThe packet data connection representing the IMS media channel referenced in clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as IMS media bearer. This is a dedicated bearer and uses the QCI value of 1 for voice media, GSMA IR.92 [26].\n-\tThe IMS signalling bearer and IMS media bearers are on separate GTP tunnels but are linked.\nThe S8HR LI process follows the steps described in clause 7.4.7.4.11 with the following specific aspects that apply to S8HR:\n-\tThe LIPF configures the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C to notify the LMISF-IRI whenever an IMS signalling bearer or an IMS media bearer is created, modified, or deleted for S8HR inbound roaming UEs (i.e. the UEs that use S8HR APN).\n-\tThe BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C notifies the LMISF-IRI whenever it detects that such an IMS signalling bearer or an IMS media bearer is created, modified, or deleted.\n-\tWhen the LMISF-IRI detects that IMS voice media interception is required, the LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C to deliver the user plane packets from the related IMS voice media bearer to the LMISF-CC.\nNOTE 1:\tThe LMISF-IRI includes the target UE location (when required) in the xIRI based on the UE location that it receives within the messages that denote the creation, modification, or deletion of IMS signalling or media bearers.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen a target UE is involved in more than one IMS session, the release of an IMS session will not result in the BBIFF-U stopping the delivery of the user plane packets from the IMS media bearer since the IMS media bearer may still be active for that target UE.\nThe CC-POI and IRI-POI functions are provided by the embedded functions LMISF-CC and LMISF-IRI within the LMISF. As such the only interaction required between the two is to establish the correlation between the xCC and xIRI at an IMS session-leg level.\nThe LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C to deliver the user plane packets (to LMISF-CC) from the IMS media bearer linked to the IMS signalling bearer when it determines that an IMS session is associated with a target and requires CC interception. The BBIFF-C forwards the instruction along with the linked IMS signalling bearer information to BBIFF-U present in the SGW-U.\nDuring a session that involves the target UE, the SGW-C/SGW-U associated with the BBIFF-C/BBIFF U can change.\nTo support the continued interception of IMS sessions, the BBIFF-C in the new SGW-C notifies the LMISF-IRI that a BBIFF relocation has occurred.\nThe LMISF-IRI provides the functions described in clause 7.4.7.4.12 to support the continued and correlated interception for the CC.\nNOTE: \tThe LMISF should not disrupt the ongoing interception, if an IMS signalling bearer deletion notification is received from the BBIFF-C present in the old SGW-C.\nThe term N9HR is used to denote the home-routed roaming architecture for Vo5GS UEs. Within the VPLMN with N9HR, the IMS signalling messages and media packets are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the PDU session established for the UE for IMS based services.\nThe IMS signalling packets and the media packets are on separate Quality of Service (QoS) Flows with specific 5QI values (5QI = 5 for IMS signalling and 5QI = 1 for voice, GSMA NG.114 [27]). The H-SMF in the HPLMN assigns a separate QoS Flow Index (QFI) for IMS signalling related packets and IMS voice related packets. The UPF in the VPLMN can isolate the IMS signalling and media related packets from user plane packets based on the QFI value.\nTo provide the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN with N9HR, the architecture presented in figure 7.4.7.4-1 is used with SMF providing the BBIFF-C and UPF providing the BBIFF-U functions.\nNOTE:\tThe overall architecture and functions related to the lawful interception of voice services of inbound roaming targets with N9HR as the roaming architecture is also referred in the present document as N9HR LI.\nN9HR LI requires that a Data Network Name (DNN) can be identified as being used for N9HR and therefore can be used to identify that PDU sessions are used for inbound roamers with N9HR.\nThe BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U functions are provided by adopting a subset of LI functions defined for LI at SMF/UPF as defined in clause 6.2.3 and TS 33.128 [15].\nFor the purposes of describing the N9HR LI process, the following terms apply:\n-\tThe packet data connection representing the IMS signalling channel referenced in clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as PDU session with IMS signalling related QoS flow.\n-\tThe packet data connection representing the IMS media channel referenced in clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as PDU session with IMS media related QoS flow.\nThe IMS signalling and the IMS voice media are on the same PDU session.\nNOTE 1:\tThe QoS flow associated with the IMS signalling related user plane packets have the 5QI value 5, GSMA NG.114 [27] and such user plane packets can be identified at the BBIFF-U in UPF with the assigned QFI value.\nNOTE 2:\tThe QoS flow associated with the IMS voice media related user plane packets have the 5QI value 1, GSMA NG.114 [27] and such user plane packets can be identified at the BBIFF-U in UPF with the assigned QFI value.\nThe N9HR LI process follows the steps described in clause 7.4.7.4.11 with the following specific aspects that apply to N9HR:\n-\tThe LIPF configures the BBIFF-C present in the SMF to notify the LMISF-IRI whenever a PDU session is created, modified, or deleted for inbounding roaming UEs with an N9HR DNN.\n-\tThe BBIFF-C present in the SMF notifies the LMISF-IRI whenever it detects that a PDU session is created, modified, or deleted for inbound roaming UEs with N9HR DNN. The UE location information and the PDU session ID is included in such notifications.\n-\tWhen the LMISF-IRI determines that IMS voice media interception is required, the LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SMF with the PDU session information that the IMS voice media related user plane packets from that PDU session are to be delivered to LMISF-CC.\nNOTE 3:\tThe LMISF-IRI includes the target UE location (when required) in the xIRI based on the UE location that it receives within the messages that denote the creation, modification, or deletion of the PDU session.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen a target UE is involved in more than one IMS session, the release of an IMS session will not result in the BBIFF-U stopping delivery of IMS media related user plane packets since the IMS media related QoS Flow may still be active within the PDU session.\nThe CC-POI and IRI-POI functions are provided by the embedded functions LMISF-CC and LMISF-IRI within the LMISF. As such the only interaction required between the two is to establish the correlation between the xCC and xIRI at an IMS session-leg level.\nThe LMISF instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SMF to deliver to (to LMISF-CC) the IMS voice media related user plane packets from the PDU session associated with the intercepted IMS session. The BBIFF-C present in the SMF forwards the instruction along with the PDU session information to BBIFF-U present in the UPF.\nDuring a session that involves the target UE, the SMF that has the BBIFF-C, or the UPF that has the BBIFF-U can change.\nTo support the continued interception of IMS sessions, the BBIFF-C in the new SMF notifies the LMISF-IRI that a BBIFF (i.e., SMF or UPF) relocation has occurred.\nThe LMISF-IRI provides the functions described in clause 7.4.7.4.12 to support the continued and correlated interception of CC.\nNOTE:\tThe LMISF should not disrupt the ongoing interception, if a PDU session deletion related notification is received from the BBIFF-C present in the old SMF.\nWith home-routed roaming architecture, all the IMS Signalling Functions and IMS Media Functions reside in the HPLMN. National regulations may still require the VPLMN to have the capabilities to perform the lawful interception of voice services involving the inbound roaming targets. The LI capabilities provided in the VPLMN with home-routed roaming architecture shall be to the same extent as the LI capabilities provided in the VPLMN with LBO approach as the roaming architecture.\nThe IMS signalling messages are exchanged between the UE and the P-CSCF (in HPLMN) and the media is exchanged between the UE and the IMS-AGW (in HPLMN).\nTo provide the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN with home-routed roaming architecture, new LI-specific functions are introduced to examine the packets that flow through the VPLMN packet core network functions in order to generate IRI and CC when the communication involves an inbound roaming target.\nFigure 7.4.7.4-1 shown below illustrates a generic LI architecture for home-routed roaming architecture in the VPLMN.\nThe figure depicts a generic LI architecture for home-routed roaming in a 7.4 VPLMN (Virtual Private LAN) network. It illustrates the network's structure, including the home gateway (HGW), the home router (HR), and the home device (HD). The figure also shows the network's routing and switching capabilities, with the home gateway acting as the central point of control and the home router and home device as the primary communication links. The figure is a visual representation of the network's architecture, providing a clear understanding of its components and their interconnections.\nFigure 7.4.7.4-1: VPLMN generic LI architecture for home-routed roaming\nNOTE:\tSee clause 7.4.7.4.10 for brief descriptions of the LI functions and interfaces depicted in figure 7.4.7.4-1.\nThe target identifiers used for inbound roaming UEs are same as the identifiers used for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with LBO as the roaming architecture. See clause 7.4.2.2 for further details.\nDepending on the session direction, different SIP parameters are used to identify the target. The SIP parameters used to identify the target can be different from the SIP parameters used to identify a target at the P-CSCF (with LBO as the roaming architecture).\nFurther details on the use of SIP parameters in identifying a target are described in TS 33.128 [15].\nThe IRI events are same as the xIRI defined for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with LBO as the roaming architecture. See clause 7.4.3.2 for details.\nThe IRI parameters are the same as those defined for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with LBO as the roaming architecture. See clauses 7.4.3.3 and 7.4.3.4 for details.\nThe LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C (over the LI_T1 interface) to deliver the IMS media packets when it determines that an IMS session is associated with a target and requires CC interception. The BBIFF-C forwards the instruction to BBIFF-U over the LI_T3 interface.\nThe CC parameters are the same as those defined for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with LBO as the roaming architecture. See clause 7.4.4.3 for details.\nThe LMISF assigns the correlation number for an IMS session and uses the same correlation number in the associated xIRI and xCC. The interaction between the LMISF-IRI that generates the xIRI and LMISF-CC that generates the xCC is an internal function of LMISF.\nThe additional LI specific functions and interfaces introduced to support the LI with home-routed roaming architecture shown in figure 7.4.7.4-1 are listed below:\n-\tLMISF (LI Mirror IMS State Function): A logical LI specific function that provides the IMS state function for LI purposes. The LMISF provides the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions. The LMISF also initiates the required trigger for IMS media interception. The LMISF may be viewed as consisting of two embedded functions: 1) LMISF-IRI (handling the IMS signalling related LI functions, i.e. IRI-POI), 2) LMISF-CC (handling the IMS media related LI functions, i.e. CC-POI). The interface between the two embedded functions is not defined.\nNOTE 1:\tThe present document assumes one LMISF per VPLMN for a given roaming agreement.\nNOTE 2:\tThe term LMISF is used when a description applies to LMISF-IRI or LMISF-CC.\n-\tBBIFF (Bearer Binding Intercept and Forward Function): Binds the IMS signalling and media to the LMISF for interception purpose. The BBIFF may be split into two BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U, with the former present in the NF that provides the control plane related functions and the latter present in the NF that provides the user plane related functions associated with the inbound roaming UEs.\n-\tLI_X2_LITE: Used to carry the control plane information (e.g. packet data connection related notifications, UE location) from BBIFF-C to LMISF-IRI.\n-\tLI_X3_LITE_S: Used to forward the IMS signalling related user plane packets of inbound roaming UEs from BBIFF-U to the LMISF-IRI.\n-\tLI_X3_LITE_M: Used to forward the IMS media related user plane packets of inbound roaming target UE from BBIFF-U to the LMISF-CC.\n-\tLI_T1: Used to instruct the BBIFF-C that user plane packets of the associated IMS media need to be captured and delivered to the LMISF-CC.\n-\tLI_T3: Used to instruct the BBIFF-U to capture and deliver the selective user plane packets of inbound roaming UEs to the LMISF.\nThe user plane packets reported by BBIFF-U include the IMS signalling related packets and IMS media related packets. A condition required for this LI architecture is that LMISF shall have access to the IMS signalling messages and the IMS media packets in an unencrypted form.\nNOTE 3:\tThe LI functions available within the VPLMN network functions that have access to the packet data connections that carry the IMS signalling and IMS media may be used to provide the BBIFF-C, BBIFF-U functions.\nThe following steps happen for all home-routed inbound roaming UEs irrespective of whether those UEs are associated with a target:\n-\tThe LIPF configures the BBIFF-C (over LI_X1 interface) to notify the LMISF-IRI whenever home-routed inbound roaming UEs establish, modify or delete the IMS signalling and the IMS media channels. The UE exchanges the IMS signalling messages with the P-CSCF residing in the HPLMN over the IMS signalling channel and IMS media with the IMS-AGW residing in the HPLMN over the IMS media channel. The LIPF also provides the same information to LMISF-IRI (over LI_X1 interface) in order to let it know the notifications to be expected from the BBIFF-C.\nNOTE 1:\tThe term channel is a generic term used in this description to represent IMS signalling or media related packet data connection within a PDN (Packet Data Network) connection.\n-\tThe BBIFF-C notifies the LMISF-IRI (over LI_X2_LITE interface) whenever the IMS signalling channel or the IMS media channel is established, modified or deleted for home-routed inbound roaming UEs. The UE location information is included in such notifications. The BBIFF-C instructs the BBIFF-U (over LI_T3 interface) to deliver the appropriate IMS signalling related user plane packets to the LMISF-IRI.\n-\tThe BBIFF-U delivers the IMS signalling related user plane packets to the LMISF-IRI (over the LI_X3_LITE_S interface).\nThe following steps are performed for the target UEs:\n-\tThe LIPF provisions the LMISF-IRI, MDF2 and MDF3 (over LI_X1 interface) with the IMS target information.\n-\tWhen the received user plane packets from the BBIFF-U represent IMS signalling messages associated with a target, the LMISF-IRI generates the xIRI and delivers them to the MDF2 over the LI_X2 interface.\n-\tUpon identifying that IMS signalling messages are associated with a target that requires CC interception, the LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C (over LI_T1 interface) that the user plane packets that represent associated IMS media (i.e. from the IMS media channel associated with the IMS signalling channel) are to be delivered to LMISF-CC.\n-\tThe BBIFF-C instructs the BBIFF-U (over LI_T3 interface) to deliver user plane packets that represent the associated IMS media to the LMISF-CC.\n-\tThe BBIFF-U delivers the indicated user plane packets that represent the IMS media to the LMISF-CC (over LI_X3_LITE_M interface). The LMISF-CC generates xCC from the received IMS media related user plane packets and delivers them to the MDF3 over LI_X3 interface along with the information that correlates the xCC with the xIRI.\nNOTE 2:\tLMISF-CC interacts with the LMISF-IRI to correlate the xCC with the xIRI.\n-\tWhen all IMS sessions for a target UE have ended, LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C (over LI_T1 interface) to stop the delivery of IMS media related user plane packets. Upon receiving such a notification, the BBIFF-C instructs the BBIFF-U (over LI_T3 interface) to stop the delivery of the IMS media related user plane packets to the LMISF-CC.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the above steps, BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U functions are not aware of any IMS target information (i.e. SIP URI or TEL URI).\nNOTE 4:\tThe LMISF-IRI includes the target UE location (when required) in the xIRI based on the UE location that it receives from the BBIFF-C.\nThe LMISF-IRI stores the IMS signalling messages received from the BBIFF-U for a potential future LI activation (i.e. mid-call interception). Furthermore, the xCC generated from the IMS media related user plane packets may be associated with different session-legs, and hence may have different correlation numbers.\nWhen the inbound roaming UE deregisters for the IMS signalling (i.e. with HPLMN), the LMISF shall ensure that deregistration is mirrored in its own maintained state for that UE.\nDuring a session that involves the target UE, the network function associated with the BBIFF-C, or the BBIFF U can change. The lawful interception of IMS sessions involving a target shall continue when such a relocation happens. The xIRI and xCC delivered before and after the relocation shall be correlated.\nTo support the continued interception of IMS sessions, the BBIFF-C in the new network function notifies the LMISF-IRI (over LI_X2_LITE interface) that a BBIFF relocation has occurred.\nThe LMISF-IRI provides the following functions to support the continued and correlated interception of CC:\n-\tWhen a notification is received from the BBIFF-C that a BBIFF relocation has occurred, examine to see whether any IMS session is setup for the UE and is being intercepted.\n-\tIf an intercepted IMS session is setup, examine to see whether a CC interception for that IMS session is required.\n-\tIf the intercepted IMS session requires CC interception, inform the new BBIFF-C (over the LI_T1 interface) with an instruction that the user plane packets that represent associated IMS media are to be delivered to LMISF-CC.\nFurther handling of CC interception is as defined in clause 7.4.7.4.11.\n",

Such delivery to an AF is accomplished by one of the following two mechanisms (see TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.31.5):\n-\tDelivery using NEF.\n-\tDelivery using UPF via a Point-to-Point (PtP) N6 tunnel.\nIf the subscription includes a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" corresponding to the DNN and S-NSSAI information, then the SMF selects that NEF as the anchor of this PDU session, otherwise, the SMF selects a UPF as the anchor of this PDU session. If NEF is used, the NIDD traffic is forwarded by NEF to the AF. If UPF is used, the NIDD traffic is forwarded by UPF to the AF.\nNIDD applies to non-roaming and roaming with home-routed roaming architecture.\nFigure 7.8-1 presents the architecture for delivery of NIDD using NEF in non-roaming scenario. NIDD using NEF requires a control plane PDU session. The PDU session is established between UE and NEF via AMF and SMF. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS (Data over NAS) between UE and AMF, then over N11 interface between AMF and SMF, then over N29 interface between SMF and NEF and finally over N33 interface between NEF and AF (see TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.25).\nThe figure depicts a 5G network architecture, specifically focusing on the use of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and Line-of-Sight (LOS) communication paths. It illustrates the various components involved in the network, such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the presence of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design of the network aligns with the principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).\nFigure 7.8-1: 5GS Architecture for NIDD using NEF\nFigure 7.8-2 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using UPF via a PtP N6 tunnel in non-roaming scenario. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and AMF, over N11 interface between AMF and SMF, over N4 interface between SMF and UPF and finally over PtP N6 tunnel between UPF and AF. The tunnel is typically a UDP/IP tunnel.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network architecture, specifically highlighting the use of a PtP N6 tunnel for network slicing. The architecture includes a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, with key components such as the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure 7.8-2: 5GS Architecture for NIDD using a PtP N6 tunnel\nIn roaming scenario, the PDU session for NIDD using NEF is established between the UE and NEF via V-AMF, V-SMF and H-SMF. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and AMF, then over N11 interface between AMF and V-SMF, over N16 interface between V-SMF and H-SMF and over N29 interface between SMF and NEF and finally over N33 interface between NEF and AF. Figure 7.8-3 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using NEF in roaming situation.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network architecture, specifically focusing on the use of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Forward Error Correction (FEC) for network-to-device (NIDD) communication. The architecture includes a network edge (NEF) and a network edge forwarding (NEFF) system, which are crucial for ensuring reliable communication in roaming situations. The figure also highlights the use of Non-Line-of-Sight Forward Error Correction (NLOS FEC) to improve the quality of communication in the presence of NLOS interference.\nFigure 7.8-3: 5GS Architecture for NIDD using NEF in roaming situation\nIn roaming scenario, the user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and AMF, over N11 interface between AMF and V-SMF, over N4 interface between V-SMF and V-UPF, over N9 between V-UPF and H-UPF and finally over PtP N6 tunnel between H-UPF and AF (figure 7.8-4).\nThe figure depicts a 5G network architecture, specifically highlighting the use of a Point-to-Point (PtP) N6 tunnel in a roaming situation.

Such delivery to the SCS/AS (Service Capability Server/ Application Server) is accomplished by one of the following two mechanisms as defined in TS 23.682 [33] clause 4.5.14:\n-\tDelivery using SCEF.\n-\tDelivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel.\nIf the subscription includes a \"SCEF Identity for NIDD\" corresponding with the APN information, then the MME selects that SCEF and uses the T6a interface to that SCEF, otherwise, the MME selects a SGW and PGW which handle this PDN connection. The PDN GW shares a SGi tunnel with the SCS/AS for the NIDD traffic exchange. If SCEF is used, the NIDD traffic is forwarded by SCEF to the SCS/AS.NIDD applies to non-roaming and roaming with home-routed roaming architecture.\nFigure 7.10-1 presents the architecture for delivery of NIDD using SCEF in non-roaming scenario. NIDD using SCEF requires a control plane PDN connection. The PDN connection is established between UE and SCEF via MME. The user traffic (i.e. NIDD traffic) is exchanged with DoNAS (Data over NAS) between UE and MME, then over T6a interface between MME and SCEF and finally over T8 interface between SCEF and SCS/AS.\nThe EPS architecture for NIDD, as depicted in Figure 7.10 - 1, is a comprehensive solution that combines the strengths of both the SDN and NIDD methodologies. This architecture leverages the principles of SDN to enable efficient network control and management, while also incorporating the principles of NIDD to ensure seamless and reliable communication. The architecture is designed to be scalable, flexible, and adaptable, making it suitable for a wide range of network environments and applications.\nFigure 7.10-1: EPS Architecture for NIDD using SCEF\nFigure 7.10-2 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel in non-roaming scenario. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and MME, over S11 interface between MME and SGW, over S5 interface between SGW and PGW and finally over a PtP SGi tunnel between PGW and AF. The tunnel is typically a UDP/IP tunnel.\nThe EPS architecture for NIDD, as depicted in Figure 7.10-2, utilizes a PtP SGi tunnel to facilitate efficient and secure communication between the network edge and the network interface device (NIDD). This architecture is designed to support high-speed data transmission and ensure reliable communication between the network edge and the NIDD, which is crucial for managing and monitoring network traffic. The use of a PtP SGi tunnel allows for the efficient transmission of data, reducing latency and improving overall network performance.\nFigure 7.10-2: EPS Architecture for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel\nIn roaming scenario, the PDN connection for NIDD using SCEF is established between UE and SCEF via MME and IWK-SCEF in the visited network and SCEF in the home network. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and MME, over T6a interface between MME and IWK-SCEF, over T7a interface between IWK-SCEF and SCEF and finally over T8 interface between SCEF and SCS/AS. Figure 7.10-3 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using SCEF in roaming situation.\nThe EPS architecture for NIDD, as depicted in Figure 7.10-3, is a crucial component of the network's roaming capabilities. It enables seamless communication between different network domains, such as the core network, the access network, and the mobile network, by utilizing the Enhanced Packet Segment (EPS) technology.

The RAN may then use the assistance information to minimize UE state transitions. The SCS/AS provides the communication pattern parameters to SCEF, and SCEF updates the UE subscription data via HSS. The parameters shall have a validity time. The validity time indicates when the communication pattern parameters expire. The validity time may be set to indicate that the communication pattern parameters have no expiration time.\nThe EPS architecture for Parameter Provisioning in Figure 7.11 illustrates the key components of an enterprise-scale, distributed, and secure system. It consists of a central server, a set of distributed servers, and a set of clients. The central server manages the system's configuration, data, and security. The distributed servers provide the necessary resources and services to the clients. The clients interact with the central server and the distributed servers to access the system's resources and services.

The IRI-POI generates the xIRI from the user plane packets and sends it to the MDF2. The MDF2 generates the IRI messages and sends them to the LEMF.\n-\tIn approach 2, xCC is generated by the CC-POI in the UP Entity as if the warrant involves the interception of communication contents. To enable this, the CC-POI is presumed to be present and provisioned in the UP Entity even when the warrant does not require the interception of communication contents. The CC-POI generates the xCC and sends it to the MDF3. The MDF3 (based on the provisioned intercept information) does not generate and deliver the CC to the LEMF. Instead, the MDF3 forwards the xCC to the MDF2 over LI_MDF interface. The MDF2 then generates the IRI messages from xCC and delivers those IRI messages to the LEMF.\nIn 5GS and CUPS EPS, the POI in the UP Entity requires a trigger to enable it to detect the user plane packets. The corresponding Triggering Function (IRI-TF or CC-TF) resides in the CP Entity that has the IRI-POI for the generation of other xIRI. The trigger sent by the IRI-TF or CC-TF to the corresponding POI includes the following:\n-\tUser plane packet detection rules.\n-\tTarget identity.\n-\tCorrelation information.\n-\tMDF2 (in approach 1) or MDF3 (in approach 2) address.\n",

In general, the LI functions involved in the interception of RCS events are located either in the IMS core or in RCS specific network functions.\nAdditional topology options for RCS are described in clause 7.13.2.2.\nThe present document refers to any server that provides support, services or functions for RCS as an RCS Server. In general, RCS Servers are IMS Application Servers. The HTTP Content Server supports file upload, URI generation, and file download to allow for the transfer of files over RCS.\nThe following sub-clauses contain general stage 2 details for LI for RCS.\nThe RCS Servers shall have LI capabilities to generate xIRI records and xCC when RCS events related to the target UE are handled. The HTTP Content Server shall have LI capabilities to generate xIRI records and xCC when the target UE uploads or downloads a file and when any user downloads a file previously uploaded by a target.

The figure shows a layered architecture with a central core, distributed nodes, and a set of RCS services. The architecture is designed to support the efficient delivery of RCS services, ensuring high-quality and reliable communication.\nFigure 7.13.2-1: LI architecture for RCS services\nThe LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF.\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI present in each RCS Server, the IRI-TF in the relevant RCS Servers, the MDF2 and the MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces.\nIf the authentication method used to authenticate at the HTTP Content Server uses a permanent identifier, the LIPF present in the ADMF also provisions the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content Server.\nTo enable the interception of the target's message contents (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception of communication contents), the CC-POI in each RCS Server and the CC-TF present in the relevant RCS Servers are also provisioned with the intercept data.\nIf the authentication method used to authenticate at the HTTP Content Server uses a permanent identifier and the interception of the target's communication contents is required, the LIPF present in the ADMF also provisions the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server.\nNOTE 1:\tThe IRI-POI, CC-POI, IRI-TF and CC-TF represented in figure 7.13.2-1 are logical functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be handled by the same process within the NF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe details on which RCS Servers require IRI-POIs, CC-POIs, and IRI-TFs or CC-TFs is dependent on implementation.\nNOTE 3:\tThe IRI-POI, CC-POI represented in figure 7.13.2-1 with LI_T2, LI_T3, and LI_X1 (Management) interfaces are the triggered POIs and are logically separate from the non-triggered IRI-POI, CC-POI represented in figure 7.13.2-1 with LI_X1 interface.\nNOTE 4:\tThe use of File Transfer Localisation Function (figure 7.13.2-1) is a deployment option for the CSP. See clause 7.13.2.2.2 for the details when File Transfer Localisation Function is deployed.\nThe IRI-POI present in the relevant RCS Server detects RCS registration and deregistration; session establishment, modification, and deletion; and message related events, generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nWhen the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server detects a URI for file transfer, the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server sends a trigger to the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content Server over the LI_T2 interface.\nThe IRI-POI present in the HTTP Content Server detects file uploads,  downloads, or retrieval (i.e. by File Transfer Localisation Function, see clause 7.13.2.2.2), generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nWhen interception of communication contents is required, the CC-POI present in the relevant RCS Server generates the xCC from RCS messages and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.\nWhen interception of communication contents is required, the CC-TF present in the RCS Servers sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the HTTP Content Server over the LI_T3 interface.\nThe trigger sent from the IRI-TF to the IRI-POI or the CC-TF to the CC-POI includes the following information:\n-\tFile detection rules.\n-\tTarget identity.\n-\tCorrelation information.\n-\tMDF3 address.\nThe CC-POI present in the HTTP Content Server generates the xCC from the uploaded file and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.\nAs a deployment option, the S-CSCF may not perform a third party registration with the RCS Server. In this case, in addition to the architecture information in clause 7.13.2.1, the IRI-POI present in the IMS Signalling Function detects RCS registration and deregistration, generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2.\nNOTE: \tThe method used within the IRI-POI present in the IMS Signalling Function to determine that the third party registration to the RCS Server is deployed is outside the scope of the present document.\nAs described in GSMA RCC.07, clause 4.1.15.3 [35],  the terminating CSP may utilize a File Transfer Localisation Function which retrieves objects from the originating HTTP Content Server and makes the same available to the terminating user.\nIf the CSP implements a File Transfer Localisation Function, in addition to the architecture information in clause 7.13.2.1, the following requirements apply.\nThe LI architectue for the File Transfer Localisation Function is depicted in figure 7.13.2-1.\nWhen the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server detects a URI for an incoming file transfer, the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server sends a trigger to the IRI-POI in the File Transfer Localisation Function over the LI_T2 interface. When interception of communication contents is required, the CC-TF present in the RCS Servers sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the File Transfer Localisation Function over the LI_T3 interface. The trigger sent from the TF to the POI includes the following information:\n-\tFile detection rules.\n-\tTarget identity.\n-\tCorrelation information.\n-\tMDF2 (for xIRI) or MDF3 (for xCC) address.\nIf the authentication method used to authenticate at the File Transfer Localisation Function uses a permanent identifier (see clause 7.13.3), the LIPF present in the ADMF also provisions the IRI-POI in the File Transfer Localisation Function.\nIn both cases, the IRI-POI present in the File Transfer Localisation Function detects file retrieval (i.e. from the HTTP Content Server)  or downloads, generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.\nIf the authentication method used to authenticate at the File Transfer Localisation Function uses a permanent identifier and the interception of the target's communication contents is required, the LIPF present in the ADMF also provisions the CC-POI in the Localisation Function.\nIf the interception of communications content is required, the CC-POI present in the File Transfer Localisation Function generates the xCC from the retrieved file and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the MDF3.

                            "text_content": "3GPP standards have defined frameworks for encrypting application layer traffic based on cryptographic keys derived from USIM (or equivalents such as eSIM). These frameworks can be characterized by a Key Server Function (KSF), located at the home CSP and having a connection to the AAA infrastructure (typically the AUSF). The KSF reuses the basic network layer authentication service (native 5G AKA or EAP-AKA’) to obtain a derived anchor key. From this anchor key, the KSF can derive one or more service specific keys, which can be provided to various application functions. Such an application function provides, besides the application specific functionality,  a Security Termination Function (STF) endpoint for the security with the UE. The KSF uses a 5G native identifier space for subscribers such as SUPI , wheras the STF could in principle use any identifier type to identify its users. Additionally, while the KSF is always located in HPLMN, the STF can be located either in HPLMN, in VPLMN, or even outside a PLMN, e.g. at an enterprise.\nIn 5G context, the principles laid out above are currently realized by the Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) based on 3GPP credentials in the 5G System as defined in TS 33.535 [47] and also by legacy frameworks such as the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA), TS 33.220 [48], which is currently undergoing specification for use in the 5GS.\nNOTE :\tThe terms KSF and STF above are defined for use in the present document, and will in general be realised by network functions specific to a given key management protocol or framework. See clause 7.15.3.1.1 for an example of how these terms are mapped to functions defined by the AKMA framework.\nThis clause specifies a common LI architecture for a general CSP-provided key management solution in support of encryption, implemented by generic KSF and STF functionality as defined in clause 7.15.1.1.\nWhen encryption keys are provided by a CSP, lawful interception for a target's communication may be done in one of the two ways: (i) decrypt intercepted communication traffic before delivering IRIs and CCs to the LEA, or, (ii) provide to the LEA the decryption keys and other information necessary to enable the decryption of communication traffic. To fully enable decryption of communicaiton traffic, LI functions are in general required both at the KSF and at the STF as illustrated by the following examples.\nEXAMPLE 1:\tIn most situations, after STF has obtained encryption key from KSF, the STF has all the necessary information to decrypt the communication traffic without the additional help of KSF.  In this situation, an LI function within the STF can decrypt the target's communication and does not need to provide, explicit encryption-related xIRI.  However, the STF can also have access to xIRI which is not related to encryption, but which is still application specific, and which also can be of relevance to include as part of IRI.\nEXAMPLE 2:\tIn some situations, STF may not know whether communication traffic is that of a target since it could use a user identfier space which is independent from the 5G identifiers used for LI provisiong. In this situation, the LI function in KSF will have to provide intercept triggers to the LI function in the STF in order to identify the target communication traffic. Moreover, even if decrypted xCC is provided by the STF, the KSF can still typically report xIRI relating to key management (e.g. request for keys from other STFs, expiry of keys etc) which are of relevance for LI. For a third example of applicabity of LI at the KSF, refer to NOTE 3 below.\nAs mentioned, the physical/jurisdictional location of KSF and STF can differ depending on the scenario which can have bearing on LI requirements.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen a warrant is served to a PLMN that has neither the STF nor the KSF, handling of LI aspects specifically related to the encrypted communication traffic of a target is outside the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 2:\tFor roaming situations, where LI providing unencrypted communication in the VPLMN is required, the STF would need to be located in the VPLMN and the STF would also need to use 5G native user identifiers which enable LI provisioning in the VPLMN (since LI can not rely on triggering from HPLMN in this case). However, such roaming scenarios are outside the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen a warrant is issued to a HPLMN that has the KSF, but not the STF, then the LI function in that KSF can still provide encryption related keys and related events to the LEMF. LI at the STF is however then outside the scope of the present document.\nTo summarize, with respect to the LI at KSF and STF, three specific type of xIRIs are identified:\n1.\txIRI from KSF consting of key managment information such as decryption keys and thereto related information.\n2.\txIRI from STF consisting of other encryption related parameters, refered to as auxiliary security parameters.\n3.\txIRI from STF which are application specific but not pertaining to encryption.\n",

The STF can provide xIRI and xCC for the target's communication traffic, as described in more detail below. Figure 7.15.2-1 shows the case where STF is assumed to provide services based on 5G-native identifier, e.g. SUPI, enabling the STF to be provisioned over LI_X1.\nThe figure depicts a network infrastructure with a focus on the optical backbone, illustrating the fiber-optic backbone architecture. The diagram includes core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, which are crucial components for ensuring redundancy and failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, as it allows for the efficient management of key management information such as decryption keys via MDF2.\nNOTE:\tIf the STF is located outside the PLMN (not shown), the LI_X2 from IRI-POI in KSF can be used to provide IRI with key management information such as decryption keys via MDF2.\nFigure 7.15.2-1: General architecture, STF using 5G native identifiers.\nIf the STF instead provides services based on some other user identifier space, the STF POIs are assumed to be triggered by IRI-TF and CC-TF in the KSF, as shown in figure 7.15.2-2. The triggering is based on the KSF detecting requests from the STF for cryptographic keys associated with a target UE. When the key management service of the KSF is based on target specific key identifiers (KID) known both at KSF and STF, such KID can serve as basis for mapping STF-identifiers to 5G-native identifiers at the KSF. The IRI-TF or CC-TF present in the KSF send the triggers to the IRI-POI or CC-POI present in the STF to indicate that the communication traffic is that of a target. The IRI-POI and CC-POI are then enabled for delivery of xIRI and the xCC with communication traffic of the target in a decrypted form as laid out above.\nThe figure depicts a general architecture of a 5G network, highlighting the use of non-native identifiers for signaling, such as STF (Service Traffic Facilitation). This approach allows for efficient use of resources and supports the use of non-native signaling protocols.\nFigure 7.15.2-2: General architecture, STF not relying on 5G native identifiers.\nThe IRI-POI present in the KSF is provisioned by the LIPF over LI_X1 and is responsible for providing key management related information in the form of xIRI. The key management related information can comprise information about requesting, creating, changing, or deleting encryption keys, and most importantly, can comprise decryption keys. Such decryption keys are generically denoted KLI and may comprise one or more cryptographic keys.\nThe IRI-POI in the STF is responsible for providing xIRI with auxiliary security parameters necessary to decrypt xCC which has been encrypted using the keys provided by the KSF. In addition, application specific (not encryption related) xIRI for the target's communication traffic. In more detail, the auxiliary security parameters can typically include:\n-\tAdditional cryptographic keys.\n-\tSelected protocols / cipher-suites / cryptographic algorithms for UE-STF traffic encryption.\n-\tParameters for key derivation (e.g. nonces).\n-\tOther cryptographic state information (e.g. counters).\nSimilarly, the CC-POI in the STF is responsible for providing the xCC for the target's communicaiton traffic in a decrypted form.\nThe remainder of the present clause provides details of IRI-intercept and, as applicable, CC-intercept of specific services encrypted by CSP-provided keys.\n",

The STF corresponds to the AKMA Application Function (AF), identified by an application identifier AKMA AF_ID. Key requests from external AFs are routed to AAnF via the NEF.\nAn AKMA Anchor Key is provided to the AAnF and is referred to as KAKMA.The Anchor Key Identifier (A-KID) is used to identify the key KAKMA.  A-KID can by TS 33.535 [47] be assumed to be globally unique. The AAnF derives, from the anchor key, one or more application-dependent keys referred to as KAF and provides the same to the AF.\nThe A-KID (and the associated KAKMA) of a specific UE can be modified by running 5G primary authentication. The A-KID can also become invalid at the AAnF due to specific AKMA Context Removal request from some duly authorized NF.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with a focus on the optical backbone, illustrating the fiber-optic backbone with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, with redundancy paths shown in dashed lines to ensure failover reliability. The figure also includes the AF (Access Facet) and the PLMN (Physical Line Node) interfaces, which are not shown but can be used to provide IRI (Intermediate Routing Information) with key management information such as decryption keys via MDF2 (Multi-Domain Fiber-Optic).\nNOTE:\tIf the AF is located outside the PLMN (not shown) the LI_T2 and LI_T3 interfaces are not used but LI_X2 from IRI-POI in AAnF can still be used to provide IRI with key management information such as decryption keys via MDF2.\nFigure 7.15.3.1-1: General AKMA LI Architecture\nTable 7.15.3.1-1: Mapping functions between the general architecture and AKMA\n\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI present in the AAnF and the MDF2/MDF3 over LI_X1 interfaces. The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over LI_SI) to find the correct instances of these functions. Depending on the warrant received from LEA, provisioning could be restricted to only specific services/AFs or could be general.\nThe LIPF also provisions IRI-TF and CC-TF present in the AAnF. The IRI-TF and CC-TF are capable of mapping AKMA key identifiers (A-KID) to/from SUPI. When a UE presents A-KID to the AAnF, via the AF, the IRI-TF and CC-TF present in the AAnF trigger the IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the AF respectively when LI is active on the SUPI associated with the A-KID.\nThe AAnF only provides xIRI comprising key management events (creation, modification, deletion, etc, of encryption keys), as well as cryptographic keys themselves (KAKMA and/or KAF) and key identifiers (A-KID). The AF can provide both xIRI and xCC. The xIRI from the AF can comprise both auxiliary security parameters (Ua* security protocol parameters, see below) and any other application specific information as set out in the general case described in clause 7.15.2.\nProviding decrypted xCC depends on details of the security protocol used between the target UE and AF. This protocol is in AKMA referred to as the Ua* security protocol. Below, the generic term \"Ua* security protocol parameters\" is used to denote the complete set of auxiliary security parameters, besides the AKMA-related key material itself, necessary to decrypt the application traffic.\nEXAMPLE:\tThe Ua* security protocol can be a profile of TLS version 1.2.\nNOTE:\tAFs making use of AKMA for security purposes provide various services/applications toward subscribers. Details of LI related to the specifics of such services/applications are outside the scope of the present document, Only LI for the AKMA key management service itself is described in the present clause.\n3GPP-defined Ua* security protocols and protocol identifiers are defined in annex B of TS 33.535 [47] and currently cross-reference protocols defined in TS 33.222 [49].\nTable 7.15.3.1-2: Mapping xIRI between the general architecture and AKMA\n\nThe LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated with the following target identity to the IRI-POI, IRI-TF and CC-TF present in the AAnF:\n-\tSUPI.\nProvisioning of AKMA AF, as an alternative to the triggering described in clause 7.15.3.1.3.2, could be possible for certain types of AFs. This is however service specific and outside the scope of the present document.\nAFs making use of AKMA can use either SUPI or some other form of identifier as basis for providing their services. The AAnF maintains a mapping from valid AKMA key identifiers (A-KID) to the SUPI.\nWhen the IRI-TF in the AAnF receives an A-KID, it shall use said mapping to determine whether or not to trigger the IRI-POI in the AF. Thus, this is done independently of the type of subscriber identifier used locally at the AF.\nCC intercept and CC-TF behaviour is service specific and outside the scope of the present document. Non-service-specific CC intercept can be achieved as described in clause 7.15.3.1.8.\nAn initial trigger for a new Task shall be issued to POIs of AFs matching the scope of the warrant when an A-KID for a target is first created. Since all such AFs might not be known in advance, this triggering can alternatively be performed dynamically, when a previously unknown AF requests key material related to a specific A-KID, from the AAnF.\nEach time the A-KID of a target changes (due to primary authentication), the TF shall issue a new Task to the AF POI containing the new A-KID.\nThe IRI-POI present in the AAnF shall generate xIRI when it detects the following specific events or information related to an LI target:\n-\tAnchor key register: AAnF receives AKMA-related key material from AUSF.

Non-service specific intercept of encrypted UP traffic could in some cases however be accomplished by combining the IRI-intercept (in particular, intercepted key material) of clauses 7.15.3.1.3 to 7.15.3.1.6 with the general solution for network layer xCC-intercept at the UPF as defined in clause 6.2.3.\n",

An Edge Computing Service Provider (ECSP) is a mobile network operator or a 3rd party service provider offering edge computing service. Details of edge hosting environment, are outside the scope of 3GPP (see clause 4.1 of TS 23.558 [51]).\nFor edge computing, it is essential that the Application Clients (ACs) are able to locate and connect with the most suitable application server available in the Edge Data Network (EDN), depending on the needs of the application. The edge enabler layer exposes APIs to support such capabilities. The edge computing capabilities supported by 3GPP are defined in TS 23.558 [51]. Figure 4.1-1 in clause 4.1 of TS 23.558 [51] gives an overview of 3GPP edge computing.\nFigure 7.16.1-1: Void\nThe EES (see clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.558 [51]) is a component of the edge enabler layer which facilitates communication between the Application Clients running on the UE and the EAS deployed on the EDN. This includes EAS discovery by the UE and application context transfer between EASs for service continuity. The ECS (Edge Configuration Server) is another component of the edge enabler layer providing supporting functions needed for the EEC to connect with an EES. Figure 6.2-1 in clause 6.2 of TS 23.558 [51] shows the general architecture for enabling edge applications using a service-based representation.\nFigure 7.16.1.-2: Void\nFigure 7.16.1-3 shows an edge computing network, where EDN owned/managed by a ECSP (Edge Computing Service Provider) is communicating with the PLMN operator mobile network, and connected via UPF. The EDN contains EAS, EES and ECS. The PLMN operator is responsible for the deployment of NG-RAN, 5GC including AMF, SMF, UPF and NEF. Other models such as where the PLMN operator is the ECSP are possible.\nThe ECSP can have service agreement with one or more PLMN operators and may request the PLMN operators to connect EAS and EES with 5GC network functions.\n\nThe figure depicts a network architecture for edge computing, highlighting the role of edge nodes in processing data at the network edge. The network consists of edge nodes, which are responsible for processing data, and edge switches, which facilitate communication between the edge nodes. The figure also includes a network diagram and a flow chart, providing a visual representation of the data flow and communication paths within the network.\nFigure 7.16.1-3: Edge computing network\n",

                    "text_content": "CSPs use a wide range of 3GPP NFs to provide services to users. In order to intercept a service, POIs are associated with specific NFs, as depicted in Figure 8.5-1. The manner the POI obtains the required information from the NF depends on the service and can range from something as simple as a copy-and-forward mechanism, to sophisticated isolation and filtering. The POI may be embedded in the NF or external to the NF, connected to its interfaces. The choice of one, the other, or both approaches is service specific.\nThe figure depicts a comparison between embedded and external POIs in a network. Embedded POIs are those that are directly connected to the network, while external POIs are those that are not directly connected to the network. The figure shows that embedded POIs are more likely to be used for data transmission, while external POIs are more likely to be used for voice communication. This can be useful for network planning and design, as it allows for the optimization of network resources.\nFigure 8.5-1: Embedded vs. external POIs\nIn figures 8.5-2 and 8.5-3 the POI will be depicted straddling the edge of the NF to simultaneously indicate both approaches.\nFigure 8.5-2 shows the basic job of a POI: to obtain the state, or communicated user data, of the intercepted service. As the NF changes state, or as additional user data is generated or forwarded, in the course of providing the service, the appropriate interceptable events or real-time content are transferred into the POI.\nThe figure depicts a POI state capture system, illustrating the process of capturing and analyzing the state of a point of interest (POI) in a wireless network. The system is designed to ensure efficient and reliable communication, with the POI state captured and analyzed to optimize network performance.\nFigure 8.5-2: POI state capture\nAlthough the POI has access to service state in the NF and information flows in and out of the NF, the NF shall not be able to access data in the POI, for obvious security reasons, as depicted in figure 8.5-3. If the POI is embedded, LI data leakage from the POI back into the non-secure area of the NF shall be prohibited. If the POI is not embedded, the implementation shall prohibit LI data leakage back into the NF.\nThe same requirements apply to TFs.\nFigure 8.5-3: POI state capture security\nGenerally, embedded POIs have full access to the state machine of the service they intercept, while external POIs have to infer the state of the intercepted service from the events detected on the interfaces or externally applied traffic filtering criteria.\n",

It illustrates the communication path between the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE). The figure shows the use of multiple paths, including the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design of the architecture aligns with SDN principles, ensuring efficient communication and failover reliability.\nFigure 8.6-1: LI architecture showing CC-PAG.\nNOTE:\tThe IRI-POI and CC-TF represented in figure 8.6-1 are logical functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be handled by the same process within the SMF.\nThe CC-PAG is an optional LI function and may be deployed in networks that need aggregation of xCC from potentially large number of different CC-POIs towards the MDF3. The CC-PAG may be deployed closer to the UPFs, to reduce the impact of latencies, packet drops, and buffering on UPFs for lawful interception of highspeed user plane traffic. The system resources such as hardware interfaces, CPUs and memory for the CC-PAG node may be tuned to balance the forwarding/reception capabilities of CC-POI and MDF3.\nAs shown in figure 8.6-1, the CC-POI is triggered by the CC-TF to deliver the xCC (on a per flow basis) to the CC-PAG (via LI_X3A interface) or to the MDF3 (via LI_X3 interface as described in clause 6.2.3).\nIn the option where CC-PAG is involved, the LIPF configures the CC-PAG with the appropriate MDF3 address. The CC-PAG address is provided to the CC-POI using one of the two methods:\n1) \tpre-provisioned (e.g. by LIPF over LI_X0 interface) while instructed to use the pre-provisioned address over LI_X1;\n2) \tas a part of the CC intercept trigger by the CC-TF which in turn is provisioned by the LIPF over LI_X1.\nThe CC-PAG aggregates the xCC received from different CC-POIs before forwarding the same to the MDF3. The xCC is not modified. The LI_X3A interface is the same as LI_X3 interface on the application level but may be used with other transport protocol options as described in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [16].\n",

It illustrates the use of a Time-Nearest Neighbor Gateway (TNGF) to provide non-3GPP access to 5G networks, which is a crucial component in ensuring interoperability and compatibility between different network technologies. The figure also shows the use of Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) to transmit data over the network, which is a key technology in 5G networks.

The LI_X1 interfaces between the LIPF and the UPF is to monitor the user plane data.\n\nThe Administration Function (ADMF) provides the CSP's administrative and management functions for the LI capability.\nThe ADMF’s primary roles and responsibilities include:\n-\tThe logical point of contact from the LEA to the CSP via LI_HI1 for Lawfully authorised requests (e.g. warrant).\n-\tMaintaining the CSP / LEA mutually agreed unique Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID) for the warrant which is used for all corresponding LI_HI2, LI_HI3, and LI_HI4 communications for warrant correlation.\n-\tCSP administration and local management of the warrant including start/stop times, filter criteria, LEA policy toggles, etc.\n-\tDeriving internal information (ID mappings, potential POIs, etc.) from the warrant.\n-\tFor virtualised instances, verifying the authenticity/integrity of CSP LI functions (e.g. LI function's software image) prior to instantiation, see e.g. ETSI NFV-SEC 011 [10] or equivalent.\n-\tWhen required, providing keys to newly instantiated LI functions to enable decryption of LI specific software.\n-\tLI functions physical location policy control ensuring LI functions are within the legal location policy of the warrant.\n-\tLI Certificate Authority (LI CA, sub-CA of the CSP root CA) for issuing certificates to LI functions as part of their LI provisioning via LI_X0 interface, see clause 5.6.3.2.\n-\tProvisioning of all required and valid LI functions instantiated by the CSP network.\n-\tMaintaining the master list of all authorised and provisioned LI functions.\n-\tManaging the termination of LI instances across all impacted LI functions when the warrant expires or the LEA specifically requests termination of a LI instance.\n-\tCertificate revoking when the LI function is terminated or the LI function is de-instantiated.\n-\tMaintaining the status of the warrant execution within the CSP (e.g. accepted, pending/provisioning, active, suspended, de-provisioned, etc.).\n-\tAs agreed between the LEA and CSP, reporting warrant execution status changes to the LEA as well as responds to warrant audit requests from the LEA.\n-\tKeeping records of the CSP's management of LI related activities (e.g. log files).\nRefer to clause 5.4 LI interfaces, and figures 5.4-1 and 5.6-1 for details on specific interfaces between the ADMF and other network functions.\n\nThis annex presents a means within current ETSI and 3GPP specifications to support the temporary suspension (suspend) and subsequent resuming (resume) of a Lawful Intercept. Temporary suspension of LI is either directly initiated by the LEA or automatically initiated based on predefined criteria/policy between the LEA and CSP as part of the warrant. This clause only addresses the case of LEA initiated temporary suspension of the delivery of LI product to the LEA.\nThe underlying baseline is that a Lawful Intercept has been fully authorised and established between the LEA and the CSP via LI_HI with an agreed LIID to map the warrant to the CSP provided LI product via LI_HI2, LI_HI3 and LI_HI4.\nThe LEA may request that this active LI instance be temporarily suspended. This means, at a minimum, that the CSP no longer delivers (or buffers) LI product to the LEA.\nLEA initiated LI suspension may involve the following steps:\n-\tThe LEA, via LI_HI1, sends an Update Request, referencing the intercept, with the DesiredStatus of Suspended; reference ETSI TS 103 120 [7].\n-\tThe ADMF, via LI_X1, deactivates/deprovisions the required LI Functions, reference ETSI TS 103 221-1 [8].   These LI Functions then locally fully delete the active intercept as required and hence stops any subsequent LI_HI2/3 delivery.\n-\tThe ADMF should maintain all the intercept warrant information of the original intercept, with the status advanced to Suspended.\n-\tThe MDFs for which the intercept instance has been de-activated send an LI_HI4 deactivation notification to the LEMF.\n-\tThe ADMF sends an Update Response message to the LEA, via LI_HI1, with a status of Suspended.\nTo resume the LI product delivery, this may involve the following steps:\n-\tThe LEA sends the CSP, via LI_H1, an Update Request, referencing the original intercept, with the DesiredStatus of Active. This is equivalent to the initial LI activation but without having to repeat all the warrant information in the original intercept request, and the existing LIID is maintained. Sessions that were active before the intercept suspension that are still active when resumed, or new sessions initiated while the intercept is resumed, are handled as per mid-call intercept activation.\n-\tThe ADMF, via LI_X1, re-provisions the de-activated LI Functions just as for a new intercept to re-instantiate the intercept.\nNOTE:\tThis implies all LI Product deliveries will restart just as for a new intercept; e.g. PDU sequence numbers will restart at zero, etc.\n-\tThe re-provisioned MDFs send an LI_HI4 activation notification to the LEMF.\n-\tThe ADMF sends an Update Response message to the LEA, via LI_HI1, with a status of Active.\nIf the intercept (warrant) timespan expires or the LEA directly requests intercept deactivation while the intercept is in a suspended state, all remaining LI Functions are deactivated/deprovisioned and the rest of LI instance is taken down as per usual warrant deactivation.\n\n",

Call spoofing is when a session originator changes the calling number to hide or change which calling number is shown on the telephony session display.\nSTIR provides the ability within SIP to authenticate caller ID, and SHAKEN defines the end-to-end architecture to implement caller ID authentication using STIR in the telephone network.\nSTIR/SHAKEN uses digital certificates, based on common public key cryptography techniques, to ensure the calling number of a telephony session is secure. Each telephone service provider obtains its digital certificates from a trusted certificate authority. The certificate technology enables verifying that the calling number is accurate and has not been spoofed.\nFigure E.2.1-1 below depicts the SHAKEN reference architecture as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [39] when using end-to-end SIP signalling.\nThe figure depicts the SHAKEN reference architecture for end-to-end SIP signaling, which is a standardized method for implementing SIP signaling in a network. The architecture includes various components such as the signaling protocol, network elements, and security measures. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the components and their interconnections, making it easier to understand the overall structure and functionality of the SIP signaling system.\nFigure E.2.1-1: SHAKEN reference architecture for end-to-end SIP signaling\nIt is based on IMS architecture. The \"application server (AS) for signing\" is an HTTP-based application server that performs the function of the authentication service defined in RFC 8224 [40] for originating number identity and in RFC 8946 [41] for diverting number identity. The \"AS for verification\" is an HTTP-based application server that performs the function of the verification service defined in RFC 8224 [40] and in RFC 8946 [41]. Certificate Repository (CR) represents the publicly accessible store for public key certificates.\nEither the Telephony AS or IBCF in the originating service provider’s network invokes the AS for signing which creates a digital signature for the call called a PASSportT (Personal Assertion Token) assigned to a SIP Identity header. The IBCF or Telephony AS in the terminating service provider’s network invokes the AS for verification which verifies the digital signature of the call. The AS includes a VERSTAT parameter in the P-Asserted-Identity or From header of the SIP INVITE request, with possible values of TN-Validation-Passed, TN-Validation-Failed or No-TN-Validation.\nA SIP INVITE request might have one Identity added by an authentication service at the originating administrative domain and then other Identity header fields added by some further intermediaries. The presence of multiple Identity header fields within a SIP INVITE request raises the prospect that a verification service could receive a message containing both valid and invalid Identity header fields. As a guideline, RFC 8224 [40] recommends that only if a verifier determines that all Identity header fields within a message are invalid should the request be considered to have an invalid identity. If at least one Identity header field value is valid and from a trusted source, then relying parties can use that header for authorization decisions regardless of whether other untrusted or invalid Identity headers appear in a request.\n",

In these scenarios, usage of STIR/SHAKEN is very similar to that for voice sessions.\nIn sessionless scenarios such as RCS pager mode standalone messaging service, a PASSporT could be generated on a per-message (i.e. SIP MESSAGE) basis with its own built-in message security. An Identity header could be added to any SIP MESSAGE request, but without some extension to the PASSporT claims, the PASSporT would offer no protection to the message content.

CPS as defined in RFC 8816 [45] permits the identity token to be stored during call processing and retrieved for verification purposes when a session is not using end-to-end SIP signaling, i.e. a leg in the session is using circuit switching and ISUP signaling.\nOut-of-Band SHAKEN is used when a service provider wants to use STIR/SHAKEN for a call sent or received across a non-SIP network segment. For example, Out-of-Band SHAKEN would be used in the following situations:\n-\tA service provider originating a call using TDM signaling would generate the applicable PASSporTs using their AS for signing and publish them to a CPS.\n-\tAn Intermediate Service Provider converting a session from SIP to TDM would publish all PASSporTs received in SIP signaling for that call to a CPS.\n-\tAn Intermediate Service Provider converting a call from TDM to SIP would retrieve all PASSporTs for that call from a CPS and insert them into the SIP signaling for that call.\n-\tA service provider terminating a call using TDM signaling would retrieve all PASSporTs for that call from a CPS and verify the call using their AS for verification.\nService providers originating, transiting, or terminating calls using only SIP signaling do not use Out-of-Band SHAKEN. They use PASSporTs in SIP signaling. Intermediate providers transiting calls with TDM signaling only do not use Out-of-Band SHAKEN. An upstream provider would have already published PASSporTs for those calls to a CPS. There is no need for an all-TDM intermediate provider to do anything as shown in figure E.3.4-2. The interworking function (IWF) is the interface to the AS for signing at the originating side and the interface to the AS for verification at the terminated side.\nThe figure depicts the Out of Band SHAKEN (SHAKEN-over-TDMA) reference architecture for end-to-end TDM signaling, illustrating the various components and their interconnections.
