(stated in TS 29.509 [10], clause 5.2.2.2.2).\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot, packet captures or application log files containing the operational results.\nRequirement Name: NAS based redirection from 5GS to EPS\nRequirement Reference: TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.16.4, TS 23.501 [8], clause 5.31.3.\nRequirement Description: As specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.16.4, when a UE initiates registration procedure with the AMF, the AMF may redirect the UE from 5GC to EPC by including a EMM cause indicating to the UE that it shall not use 5GC, as described in clause 5.31.3 in TS 23.501 [2]. The following requirements apply to Registration Reject message with an EMM cause which indicates to the UE that the UE shall not use 5GC:\n-\tthe AMF only sends such a Registration Reject message once NAS security has been established between the AMF and the UE; and\n-\tthe UE only acts upon such Registration Reject message if received integrity protected and if UE has verified the integrity of the Registration Reject message successfully.\nNOTE 1:\tVoid\nIn addition, in networks that support CIoT features in both EPC and 5GC, the operator may steer UEs from a specific CN type due to operator policy, e.g. due to roaming agreements, Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, load redistribution, etc. Operator policies in EPC and 5GC are assumed to avoid steering UEs back and forth between EPC and 5GC.\nThreat Reference:  TR 33.926 [6], clause K.2.8, NAS based redirection from 5GS to EPS in 5G CIoT\nTest Name: TC_AMF_REDIRECTION_5GS_EPS\nPurpose:\nVerify that AMF under test does not send a Registration Reject message containing an EMM cause indicating to the UE that the UE shall not use 5GC, if NAS security is not established.\nNOTE 2: Void\nPre-Conditions:\n-\tAMF under test supports the security handling in CIoT.\n-\tTest environment with a CIoT UE. The UE may be simulated.\n-\tAMF under test is connected in emulated/real network environment.\n-\tTester configures the operator policy of the AMF that all the UEs sending initial registration request should be redirected from 5GS to EPS.\nExecution Steps\n1. The tester triggers the UE to initiate an initial registration procedure with the AMF.\n2. The AMF under test determines that the UE shall not use 5GC and needs to redirect the UE from 5GC to EPC.\n3. The AMF under test sends a Registration Reject message with a 5GMM cause indicating to the UE that the UE shall not use 5GC.\nExpected Results:\nThe NAS SMC is performed before sending the Registration Reject message.\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot, packet captures or application log files containing the operational results.\nRequirement Name: NAS integrity failure\nRequirement Reference: TS 33.501 [2] clause 6.4.3.3.\nRequirement Description: In case of failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or missing NAS-MAC) is detected after the start of NAS integrity protection, the concerned message shall be discarded except for some NAS messages specified in TS 24.501.\nThreat Reference:  TBD\nTest Name: TC_AMF_NAS_INTEGRITY_FAILURE\nPurpose:\nVerify that AMF under test drops messages in case the NAS integrity fails or is missing.\nPre-Conditions:\n-\tTest environment with UE. The UE may be simulated.\n-\tAMF under test is connected in emulated/real network environment.\n- \tNAS Integrity algorithm different than NIA0 is used.\nExecution Steps\nTest case 1 (wrong NAS-MAC):\n1. The tester triggers the UE to initiate an initial registration procedure with the AMF.\n2. The AMF sends the Security Mode Complete message to the UE.\n3. After the Security Mode Complete message, send a NAS message from the UE to the AMF with a wrong NAS-MAC. The message used must not be an exception in TS 24.501 [5].\nTest case 2 (missing NAS-MAC):\n1. The tester triggers the UE to initiate an initial registration procedure with the AMF.\n2. The AMF sends the Security Mode Complete message to the UE.\n3. After the Security Mode Complete message, send a NAS message from the UE to the AMF removing the NAS-MAC field. The message used must not be an exception in TS 24.501 [5].\nExpected Results:\nIn both test cases, the AMF discards the NAS messages.\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot, packet captures or application log files containing the operational results.\nRequirement Name: Replay protection of NAS signalling messages\nRequirement Reference: TS 33.501 [2], clause 5.5.2.\nRequirement Description: The AMF  supports integrity protection and replay protection of NAS-signalling as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 5.5.2.\nThreat References: TR 33.926 [6], clause K.2.3.1, Bidding Down\nTest case:\nTest Name: TC_NAS_REPLAY_AMF\nPurpose:\nVerify that the NAS signalling messages are replay protected by AMF over N1 interface between UE and AMF.\nProcedure and execution steps:\nPre-Condition:\n-\tAMF network product is connected in emulated/real network environment.\n-\tTester shall have access to the NAS signalling packets sent between UE and AMF over N1 interface.\n-\tTester shall ensure that integrity protection algorithm other than NIA0 is used.\nExecution Steps:\n1.\tThe tester shall capture the NAS Security Mode Command procedure taking place between UE and AMF over N1 interface using any network analyser.\n2.\tThe tester shall filter the NAS Security Mode Complete message by using a filter.\n3.\tThe tester shall replay the captured NAS Security Mode Complete message.\n4.\tThe tester shall check whether the replayed NAS Security Mode Complete message was not processed by the AMF by capturing traffic over the N1 interface to see if no corresponding response message was sent by the AMF.
