                    "text_content": "Telecommunication networks energy efficiency KPIs are defined by various SDOs / organizations and are of various natures. They can be applied to either:\n-\twhole networks (i.e. end-to-end), or to\n-\tsub-networks (e.g. the radio access network), or to\n-\tsingle network elements, or to\n-\ttelecommunication sites, which contain network elements and site equipment.\nNOTE 1:\tData centers used by network operators are considered in the present document as telecommunication sites.\nMoreover, EE KPIs can also be categorized according to the operator's network life cycle phase they may apply to, e.g.:\n-\tduring the Buy phase, mobile network operators may be willing to compare network elements from various vendors from an EE standpoint. Some EE KPIs and measurement methods have been specified for this purpose.\n-\tduring the Design / Build phase, mobile network operators are always faced to several design options, and may be willing to compare them from an EE standpoint. This may happen for the whole network, sub-networks and for telecom sites. For telecom sites, EE KPIs have been specified.\n-\tduring the Run phase, mobile network operators need to assess the energy efficiency of the live network, as a whole (i.e. end-to-end), or for sub-networks, or for single network elements or telecom sites. Some EE KPIs and measurement methods have also been specified for this purpose.\nNOTE 2: \tEE KPIs in the present document are only applicable for the Run phase.\nGenerally, EE KPIs for network elements are expressed in terms of Data Volume divided by the Energy Consumption of the considered network elements. In the case of radio access networks, an EE KPI variant may also be used, expressed by the Coverage Area divided by the Energy Consumption of the considered network elements.\nThe calculation of the energy efficiency of 5G networks relies on the following principles:\n- \tit is based on the two high-level EE KPIs defined in ETSI ES 203 228 [2]:\n- , and\n-\n- \tEEMN,DV may apply to the whole 5G network whereas EEMN,CoA may apply only to NG-RAN;\n- \tEEMN,DV requires the collection of both Data Volumes (DV) and Energy Consumption (EC) of 5G Network Functions (NF);\n- \tIn NG-RAN, DV is measured per cell;\n- \tIn 5GC, DV is measured per NF;\n- \tEC definition and measurement method for 5G PNFs rely on ETSI ES 202 336-1 [3] and ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4];\n- \tEC is measured by PEE parameters (cf. ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4] – Annexes A and B);\n- \tPEE measurements requirements for all deployment scenario in NG-RAN: The 3GPP management system responsible for the management of the gNB (single or multiple vendor gNB) shall be able to collect PEE measurements data from all PNFs in the gNB, in the same way as the other PM measurements;\n- \tWhen gNBCU/gNBCU-CP/gNBCU-UP energy consumption is assumed to be very small compared to gNBDU and given that, in some cases, the gNBCU/gNBCU-CP/gNBCU-UP may be virtualized, the present document only considers the energy consumed in gNBDU(s) (in case of split scenarios) and in non-split gNBs (see clause 4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 28.541 [11] and clause 6.1.1 of 3GPP TS 38.401 [12]). There might be a need for some correction in KPI between the different deployment scenarios.\nNOTE 3: \tThe vendor(s) of 2-split (gNBDU/gNBCU) or 3-split gNB/en-gNB components (gNBDU/gNBCU-CP/gNBCU-UP) may be same or different depending on the implementations.\n- \tIn the present document, it is assumed that NG-RAN is only composed of base stations with built-in sensors (see ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4] – clause 4.4.1).\nBesides the parameters required to calculate the energy efficiency, e.g. DV and EC, other parameters may be used to interpret variations in energy efficiency KPI values from different networks. These parameters can be classified into demography, topography and climate classes (see ETSI ES 203 228 [2] – section 4.3), which describe the network characteristics with regard to population density, geographical conditions and climate zones. For each class of parameters, there can be subclasses, e.g. demography can be further classified into dense urban, urban, sub-urban, rural or unpopulated scenarios. For each class / subclass, the energy efficiency KPI values may be interpreted differently.\n",

With the foreseen deployment of more NR base stations, e.g., small base stations with massive MIMO in high-band, energy saving becomes even more urgent and challenging.\nManagement of 5G networks contributes to energy saving by reducing energy consumption of 5G networks, while maintaining coverage, capacity and quality of service. The permitted impact on coverage, capacity and quality of service is determined by operator's decision.\n",

However a cell in energySaving state should not cause coverage holes or create undue load on the surrounding cells. All traffic on that cell is expected to be drained to other overlaid/umbrella candidate cells before the cell moves to energySaving state.\nSimilarly, when a network element or network function is in energy saving state it may need candidate network elements or network functions to pick up the load. For example, during off-peak traffic periods, one or more edge UPFs in energySaving state should not cause undue load on the other UPFs, all remaining traffic on those edge UPFs is expected to be redirected to other UPFs before the edge UPFs move into energySaving state.\nA cell in energySaving state is not considered as a cell outage or a fault condition. No alarms should be raised for any condition that is a consequence of a subject cell or network element or network function moving into energySaving state.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "The objective of energy saving is to lower OPEX for mobile operators, through the reduction of power consumption in the mobile networks that is becoming more urgent and challenging, as there are much more network elements in NR (e.g., small cells with massive MIMO in higher frequency bands) than those used in LTE (TR 37.816 [14], TS 38.300 [13]). One typical scenario of energy saving is to switch off capacity boosters when the traffic demand is low, and re-activated them on a need basis (see clause 5.6 in TR 37.816 [14]).\nFor NG-RAN, the energy saving consists of two scenarios where the capacity booster cell - gNB is fully or partially overlaid by the candidate cell(s). For 5GC, the energy saving consists of scenario where some UPFs deployed at the edge of 5GC network may be switched off during off-peak traffic time.\nFigure 5.1.3.2.1-1 shows that a NR capacity booster cell is partially overlaid by the gNB or eNB candidate cell(s). There can be two cases of energy saving:\n-\t Intra-RAT energy saving if the candidate cell is a gNB\n-\t Inter-RAT energy saving if the candidate cell is an eNB\nThe figure depicts a 3GPP NR (New Radio) capacity booster cell partially overlaid by candidate cells, illustrating the coexistence of different technologies in a 3GPP network.\nFigure 5.1.3.2.1-1: NR capacity booster cell partially overlaid by candidate cells\nTraceability: REQ-ESCOL-FUN-1, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-2, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-3, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-4, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-5, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-6, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-7.\nIntra-RAT energy saving focuses on a scenario where the gNB candidate cells provides the coverage for the NR capacity booster cells that is switched off. Intra-RAT energy saving (ES) consists of distributed energy saving where the energy saving decision is made in the NR cells with MnS producer(s) assist to provide relevant information, such as policies, and centralized energy saving where the energy saving decision is made in MnS producer (see clause 15.4 in TS 38.300 [13]).\nFor the distributed energy saving, the NR capacity booster cell may decide to enter the energy saving mode when it detects that its traffic load is below certain threshold, and its coverage can be provided by the candidate cells. However, the NR capacity booster cell can be switched off only after the handover actions to off-load its traffic to the candidate cells is completed (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]). The candidate cell decides to re-activate the NR capacity booster cell when it detects additional capacity is needed (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]).\nFor the centralized energy saving, MnS producer collects the traffic load performance measurements from the NR capacity booster cell and candidate cells, and may request a NR capacity booster cell to enter the energy saving mode when its traffic is below certain threshold. The NR capacity booster may initiate handover actions to off-load the traffic to the neighbouring cells (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]) prior to entering into the energy saving mode.\nInter-RAT energy saving focuses on a scenario where the LTE eNB provides basic coverage, with the gNB providing the capacity booster that can be switched off, based on its own cell load information or by MnS producer(s). The LTE eNB is allowed to activate the dormant capacity booster NR cell (see clause 5.6 in TR 37.816 [14]).\nInter-RAT energy saving consists of centralized energy saving where the energy saving decision is made in MnS producer. The inter-RAT energy saving is almost the same as the intra-RAT energy with the exception that the candidate cells are eNB.\nAn NG-RAN node, which connects with 5GC to provide boost capacity, may enter into energySaving state if there is radio coverage by other radio systems – be another NG-RAN node or an entity of another radio access technology - for the whole coverage area of the NG-RAN node in question, see figure 5.1.3.3-1 for gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate cell(s) case.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a gNB (gNB capacity booster cell) overlaid by a candidate cell (possibly a 5G base station or a 5G femtocell). The figure illustrates the importance of gNB capacity boosters in enhancing the network's capacity and performance.\nFigure 5.1.3.3-1: gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate cell(s)\nThis use case applies both for Intra- and Inter-RAT Energy Saving.\nInter-frequency Intra-RAT gNB Coverage\nTwo gNB cells (Cell A, Cell B) with separate frequency bands cover the same geographical area. Cell B has a smaller size than Cell A and is covered totally by Cell A. Generally, Cell A is deployed to provide continuous coverage of the area, while Cell B increases the capacity of the special sub-areas, such as hot spots. The ES activation procedure in the coverage of Cell B (ES area) may be triggered in case that light traffic in Cell B is detected. Cell B ES activation may also be triggered when the traffic of ES area (measured by candidate Cell A) resumes to a high level. A Cell B capable of ES probing can execute the ES probing procedure and based on Cell B measurements the centralized or distributed ES management can decide if the Cell B needs to be activated and take portion of the traffic from Cell A.\nInter-RAT gNB Coverage\nTwo IRAT cells (Cell A, Cell B) cover the same geographical area. gNB Cell B is totally covered by inter-RAT Cell A (such as legacy system UMTS or LTE). Cell A is deployed to provide continuous coverage of basic eMBB services in the area, while Cell B enhances the capability of the area to support eMBB services with high data rate or URLLC services. The ES activation in the coverage of Cell B (ES area) may be triggered in case that no eMBB services with high data rate or URLLC traffic in Cell B is detected or load threshold for going into energySaving state is reached. Cell B ES deactivation may be triggered when the eMBB services with high data rate or URLLC service request in ES area is restarted again or load threshold for going out of energySaving state (i.e. going into notEnergySaving state) is reached. A Cell B capable of ES probing can execute the ES probing procedure and based on Cell B measurements the centralized or distributed ES management can decide if the Cell B needs to be activated and take portion of the traffic from Cell A.\nDifferent scenarios of gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate cell(s) are listed in below table 5.1.3.3-1.\nTable 5.1.3.3-1: Different scenarios of gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate cell(s)\n\nTraceability: REQ-ESCOL-FUN-1, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-2, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-3, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-4, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-5, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-6, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-7.\nTo meet service demands, e.g. in terms of latency, the Network Operator (NOP) decided to deploy some UPFs at the edge of 5GC network, i.e. closer to low latency demanding service users than if they were deployed in its central core network.\nDuring off-peak periods and depending on service users’ profile, observed behaviour and habits, the NOP may decide that some of these edge UPFs are no longer justified. For example, at night, in some locations where no user paying for low latency services is connected, the remaining traffic (not demanding low latency) can be redirected from the edge UPFs to central UPFs. The NOP may then decide to:\n- redirect the remaining traffic to and from these edge UPFs to existing central UPFs, and\n- decommission these edge UPFs, or scale them in/down, or any other action enabling to achieve energy saving, depending on e.g. whether these UPFs are virtualized or not.\nThe decommissioning of edge UPFs can be done e.g. by administratively putting them out of service so that they can’t carry any more traffic, either with immediate effect or only when no more users are using these UPFs.\nThe NOP may decide at any time to come back to the initial situation.\nTraceability: REQ-SOUPF-FUN-1, REQ-SOUPF-FUN-2.\n",

Examples for policies/conditions are: A time period, during which energy saving is or not allowed; load thresholds to be considered for energy saving decisions; which of the RATs should be considered with priority in Inter-RAT scenario; service characteristic information or tenant information of service.\n-\tBased on these policies/conditions and further information - e.g. the operational status of the candidate cell to take over the coverage- the NG-RAN node controls the energy saving procedures (ES activation procedure and ES deactivation procedure) in the network nodes.

                            "text_content": "In case of Network Functions (NF) composed of Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) running on a Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), it is expected to be able to measure the energy consumption of each VNF separately. However, in a NFVI, the finest grain at which Energy Consumption can be measured is the NFVI Node, making it impossible to measure the energy consumed by each and every VNF separately given that a) a VNF can run on more than one NFVI node and b) a NFVI node can support more than one VNF. Therefore, this clause describes a solution for estimating the energy consumption of VNFs.\nETSI GR NFV-IFA 015 [19] states that:\n-\ta VNF is composed of 1-to-many VNF Component(s) (VNFC) – see diagram below.\n-\ta VNFC runs over a single VirtualisationContainer – see diagram below.\nThe figure depicts a VNF-VNFC-Virtualisation Container relationship, illustrating the interconnection of virtualised network functions (VNFs) and virtual network functions containers (VNFCs) within a virtualised network environment. The diagram highlights the relationship between VNFs and VNFCs, emphasizing the importance of containerisation and virtualisation in modern network architecture.\nFigure 3.2.1-1: VNF-VNFC-Virtualisation Container relationship\nwhere a Virtualisation Container is defined in ETSI GR NFV 003 [20] as follows:\n\"\npartition of a compute node that provides an isolated virtualised computation environment.\nNOTE:\tExamples of virtualisation container includes virtual machine and OS container.\n\".\nHence, a Virtualisation Container runs on a single NFVI Compute Node. A NFVI Compute Node may support 1-to-many Virtualisation Container(s).\n\nTo estimate the Energy Consumption of VNF / VNFCs, it is assumed that:\n- Pre-condition #1: there exists a Management Function (MF) in charge of estimating the energy consumption of the VNFs.\n- Pre-condition #2: this MF knows on which NFVI node(s), the VNF/VNFC instances run;\n- Pre-condition #3: NFVI nodes are equipped with embedded or external sensors (see ETSI ES 202 336-12).\nThe procedure for estimating the energy consumption of VNF/VNFCs based on the vCPU usage of underlying virtual compute resources is as follows:\n1. The MF in charge of estimating the energy consumption of VNFs collects Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) measurements from NFVI nodes (see clause 6.3.1), during a given period of time. The procedure described here is independent from whether the NFVI nodes are equipped with embedded sensors or external sensors;\n2. The MF subscribes to PM notifications towards the VNFM, so as to receive notifications about the vCPU mean usage of selected VNF/VNFC instances (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 008 [14] clause 7.4.4) for a given period of time (same observation period as in 1);\n3. The MF requests the VNFM to create a PM job to collect the vCPU usage of selected VNF/VNFC instances (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 008 [14] clause 7.4.2);\n4. The VNFM subscribes to PM notifications towards the VIM, so as to receive notifications about the vCPU usage of the virtual compute instances on which each VNF/VNFC instance runs (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 006 [20] clause 7.7.5);\n5. The VNFM requests the VIM to create a PM job to collect the vCPU usage of the virtual compute instances on which each VNF/VNFC instance runs and whose IDs are provided as input parameters of the CreatePMJob request (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 006 [20] clause 7.7.2);\n6. The VIM gets, at pre-defined intervals, the process utilization compute metric values from all CPU Cores of the NFVI (see ETSI NFV TST 008 [14] – clause 6.6). Whether the VIM gets this data in pull mode or in push mode is out of scope of the present document;\n7. The VIM aggregates them per virtual compute resource and calculates their arithmetic mean per virtual compute resource; this per virtual compute resource arithmetic mean of process utilization compute metric values is called VCpuUsageMean (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 027 clause 7.1.2);\n8. The VIM notifies the VNFM about VCpuUsageMean measurement(s) for the virtual compute instance(s) (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 006 [20] clause 7.7.6);\n9. The VNFM maps the received VCpuUsageMean measurement(s) from virtual compute instances to the VNF/VNFC instance(s);\n10. The VNFM generates the measurement for the subject VNF/VNFC instances by assigning the value of the multiple VCpuUsageMean measurements received (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 027 [18] clause 7.2.2);\n11. The VNFM notifies the Management Function in charge of estimating the 5GC NF EC, about the average VCpuUsageMean of each virtual compute instance used by the VNF/VNFC instance(s) which constitute the NF (see ETSI GS NFV IFA 008 [14] clause 7.4.5);\n12. NF energy consumption can be now estimated as follows:\n-\tThe energy consumed by the NF is the sum of the energy consumed by all its constituent VNF/VNFC instances.\n-\tFor each VNF/VNFC instance, its estimated energy consumption is a proportion of the NFVI node energy consumption on which it runs.\n-\tThis proportion is equal to the vCPU mean usage of the VNF/VNFC instance relatively to the sum of the vCPU mean usage of all VNF/VNFC instances running on the same NFVI node.\n",
