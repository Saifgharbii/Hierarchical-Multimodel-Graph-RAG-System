            "description": "Air-to-ground (ATG) network refers to in-flight connectivity technique, using ground-based cell towers that send signals up to an aircraft’s antenna(s) of onboard ATG terminal. As a plane travels into different sections of airspace, the onboard ATG terminal automatically connects to the cell with strongest received signal power, just as a mobile phone does on the ground. In this network, a direct radio link will be established between BS on the ground and CPE type of UE mounted in the aircraft.\nFrom the trials and commercial operation [https://inflight.telekom.net/ean/] of adapted LTE ATG solutions, some characteristics are considered for ATG network deployment scenarios.\n-\tExtremely large inter-site distance (ISD) and large coverage range: In order to control the network deployment cost and considering the limited number of flights, large ISD is preferred, e.g., about 100km to 200km. At the same time, when the plane is above the sea, the distance between the plane and the nearest base station could be more than 200km and even up to 300km. Therefore, ATG network should be able to provide up to 300km cell coverage range.\n-\tUtilizing non-disjoint frequency for deploying both ATG and terrestrial networks, i.e. same operating band but ATG network and TN use adjacent carriers: Operators are interested to adopt the same frequency for deploying both ATG and terrestrial networks to save frequency resource cost, while interference between ATG and terrestrial networks becomes non-negligible and should be addressed.\n-\tMuch powerful on-board ATG terminal capacity: On-board ATG terminal can be much powerful than normal terrestrial UE, e.g., with higher EIRP via much larger transmission power and/or much larger on-board antenna gain.\n",

Two options exist for the positioning of the TN cluster relative to the ATG BS.\nFor simulation cases 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 the worst-case network layout for simulation is one in which the TN cluster is placed at the same location as the ATG BS. The ATG BS are offset from the TN BS with  as depicted in figure 6.2.1.1-2.\nThe figure depicts a network layout with a TN network located close to an ATG BS, illustrating the distribution of network elements and their proximity to each other.\nFigure 6.2.1.1-1 Network layout with TN network located close to ATG BS\n\nThe figure depicts the offset of ATG (Antenna Termination Group) and TN (Terminal Node) BSs in a 5G network, highlighting the impact of the distance between the two BSs on the signal propagation. The ATG BS is located closer to the user equipment (UE), resulting in a higher offset compared to the TN BS, which is located further away. This figure is crucial for understanding the spatial distribution of BSs in a 5G network and the impact of distance on signal quality.\nFigure 6.2.1.1-2 Offset of ATG BS compared to TN BS grid when the TN cluster is located close to the ATG BS\nFor the remaining simulation cases, if the ATG UE has an omni-directional radiation pattern then the worst-case network layout for simulation is one in which the TN is placed directly below the aircraft. If the UE has a directional radiation pattern, then in these cases companies should assess which of the network layout options (TN placed close to ATG BS or TN placed underneath the aircraft) is worst case and apply the worst-case option.\nThe figure depicts a network layout with a TN network directly underneath the aircraft, illustrating the intricate network structure and its connection to the aircraft. The TN network is designed to provide reliable communication and navigation services, ensuring seamless communication and navigation for the aircraft.\nFigure 6.2.1.1-3 Network layout with TN network located directly underneath the aircraft\n\nA rural hexagonal grid layout is assumed for TN network clusters with the parameters of table 6.2.1.2-1.\nTable 6.2.1.2-1: Simulation scenarios for TN network layout\n\nA single ATG BS with a single cell is assumed for the ATG network. The aircraft are assumed to fly in a straight line from the minimum distance to the maximum horizontal distance from the ATG BS in the horizontal boresight of the ATG sector. The minimum and maximum horizontal distance of the ATG UE from the ATG BS are as depicted in table 6.2.1.3-1 and depend on the assumption of sub-arrays or not for the antenna model\nIn the vertical domain, ATG UEs are distributed in height between 3000m and 10000m\nTable 6.2.1.3-1: Simulation scenarios for ATG coexistence study\n\nThe figure depicts the layout of an ATG (Antenna-Ground-Transmitting) base station (BS) in horizontal boresight direction, showing the antenna, ground, and transmission lines. The layout is designed to optimize the signal path and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 6.2.1.3-1 ATG BS layout (In horizontal boresight direction of ATG antenna)\n\nFor Scenarios 2, 3, 10, 11, in addition to simulations in the above assumptions some extra simulations were carried out in which the ATG UE is assumed to be around 300km from the ATG BS. The TN network is also located at 300km, and the ATG UE is assumed to be positioned within a straight line from the ATG BS and within the TN ground network area.\nFor Scenario 2,3,10,11, it is agreed to conclude simulation results based on that ATG UEs flying over a TN cluster while ATG BS is 100km away as shown below.\n-\tOptional: ATG BS is 300km away.\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed layout of an ATG (Analog Terrestrial Gateway) base station (BS) in Case 2, 3, 10, and 11, showcasing the various components and their arrangement. The layout includes the ATG, the antenna array, the power distribution unit (PDU), and the control and monitoring equipment. The figure provides a comprehensive understanding of the ATG BS's design and its components, making it a valuable resource for understanding the architecture of ATG-based communication systems.\nFigure 6.2.1.3-2: ATG BS layout (Case 2,3, 10 and 11)\n\nCase 1 - Angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN BS boresight in azimuth is 0 degree\nFigure 6.2.1.4-1 depicts the case when the angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN boresight in azimuth is 0 degree, also highlighted below –\n-\tThe nearest TN BS sector points at the ATG BS in azimuth, with angle between the ATG BS boresight and nearest TN boresight as 0 degree (In Figure 6.2.1.4-1, highlighted through the orange dotted line)\n-\tATG BS points at the ATG UE (In Figure 6.2.1.4-1, highlighted through the orange dotted line).\n-\tATG BS, ATG UE and TN cluster center are in a straight line.\n-\tIsolation distance is the between the ATG BS and nearest TN BS.\n-\tATG UE is dropped between the maximum and minimum distance assumption depending on the ATG/ TN BS antenna configuration.\nThe figure depicts the angle between the azimuth boresight of an Automatic TerminalGLOBLE (ATG) base station (BS) and the nearest Terminal Boresight (TN) BS boresight in azimuth. The angle is 0 degrees, indicating that the two BSs are aligned in the same direction. This is important for ensuring accurate and reliable communication between the two devices.\nFigure 6.2.1.4-1: Angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN BS boresight in azimuth is 0 degree\n\nCase 2 - Angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN BS boresight in azimuth is 30 degrees\nFigure 6.2.1.4-2 depicts the case when the angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN boresight in azimuth is 30 degrees, also highlighted below –\n-\tThe nearest TN BS sector points at the ATG BS in azimuth, with angle between the ATG BS boresight and nearest TN boresight as 30 degrees (In Figure 6.2.1.4-2, highlighted through the orange dotted line)\n-\tATG BS points at the ATG UE ((In Figure 6.2.1.4-2, highlighted through the orange dotted line)\n-\tIsolation distance is the between the ATG BS and nearest TN BS.\n-\tATG UE is dropped between the maximum and minimum distance assumption depending on the ATG/ TN BS antenna configuration.\n\nThe figure depicts the angle between the azimuth boresight of an Automatic TerminalGLOB (ATG) base station (BS) and the nearest Terminal GLOB (TN) base station (BS) in the horizontal plane.

The range of its power limit are defined as following:\n-\tThe lower limit of conductive MOP or TRP of ATG UE is 23 dBm\n-\tThe upper limit of conductive MOP or TRP of ATG UE is 40 dBm\nIn addition, considering the implementation freedom for ATG UE(e.g. for 2 GHz, to use omni-directional antenna for ATG UE and for 4 GHz, to use antenna array for ATG UE), therefore 3GPP RAN4 agreed to introduce two ATG UE  types to distinguish the antenna types for ATG UE.\n",

Then the maximum DL doppler frequency is approaching 5.5kHz and the UL doppler frequency compared to the configured UL central frequency is approaching 5.5kHz if without any compensation which may cause not negligible impact for link performance and access successful rate. ATG UE needs to perform frequency compensation. The frequency accuracy requirement will be written assuming Doppler frequency pre-compensation.\nThe ATG BS coarse location information captured in new SIB specified in TS 38.331 for ATG could be broadcasted for ATG UE to do frequency compensation if necessary. [UE shall rely on the ATG BS location broadcasted by the IE EphemerisInfo in NTN SIB 19 in 38.331 if pre-compensation is based on SIB19. Where, Ephemeris may be expressed in format of position and velocity state vector].\nFor ATG UE, the maximum output power is declared at maximum modulation order and full PRB configurations within the channel bandwidth of NR carrier unless otherwise stated. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame (1ms).\nATG UE implementations/antenna patterns might be varying for different operating bands. The output power from the UE may depend on the aircraft type and exact deployment scenario. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge in 3GPP of the appropriate output power for an ATG UE considering all design, regulatory constraints and potential avionics device protection. For this reason, it is agreed that ATG UE is allowed to declare the output power and signal it to the network. The lower limit of conductive MOP or TRP declared by ATG UE is 23dBm. The upper limit of conductive MOP or TRP declared by ATG UE is 40dBm. The capability report granularity is 1dB.\nATG UE is allowed to declare the output power at supported maximum modulation order and full PRB configurations. Thus, MPR/AMPR requirements are not needed as ATG UE can declare a lower power whenever power back-off is needed. Additionally, when ATG UE indicate the maximum output power under the specific conditions (the supported maximum modulation order, full PRB configurations, SEM/spurious emission requirements, regulation requirements and so on), the necessary power back-off should be considered. In total, the power back-off has been included in the declared maximum output power, so there is no need to specify MPR/AMPR requirements for ATG UE.\nThe UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power PCMAX,f,c for carrier f of serving cell c in each slot. The configured maximum output power PCMAX,f,c is set within the following bounds:\nPCMAX_L,f,c ≤  PCMAX,f,c  ≤  PCMAX_H,f,c with\nPCMAX_L,f,c = MIN {PEMAX,c, PMaxOutputPower}\nPCMAX_H,f,c = PEMAX,c\nwhere\nPEMAX,c is the value given by either the p-Max IE or the field additionalPmax of the NR-NS-PmaxList IE, whichever is applicable according to TS 38.331[7];\nPMaxOutputPower is the maximum UE output power at maximum modulation order and full PRB configurations which is indicated by ATG UE;\nThe calculation and results for minimum output power are listed below.\nTable 7.1.2.5-1 the calculation for minimum output power requirements\n\nThe minimum output power requirements are specified below.\nTable 7.1.2.5-2 the calculation for minimum output power requirements\n\nThe current requirements for Transmit OFF power specified in clause 6.3.2 of TS 38.101-1 are applicable to ATG UE, i.e. -50dBm.\nThe current requirements for Transmit ON/OFF time mask specified in clause 6.3.3 of TS 38.101-1 are applicable to ATG UE.\nThe current requirements for power control specified in clause 6.3.4 of TS 38.101-1 are applicable to ATG UE.\nTransmit signal quality include frequency error and transmit modulation quality.\nFor frequency error, frequency pre-compensation is assumed for ATG UE. The existing requirement defined for NTN UE in TS 38.101-5 [7] will be reused as baseline.\nRegarding modulation scheme, QPSK/16QAM/64QAM will be supported as mandatory. For 256QAM, there are some challenges for ATG due to large propagation distance. While according to the evaluation for 2GHz and 4GHz in [6], the SNR above 25dB can still be seen in the considered scenarios for both UL and DL. UL 256QAM is supported for ATG UE as optional feature.\n\nFigure 7.1.2.9-1: received SNR for FDD 20MHz at 2GHz\n\nFigure 7.1.2.9-2: received SNR for TDD 100MHz at 4GHz\n\nFor transmit modulation quality, the following requirement for FR1 UE in 38.101-1 [4] will be reused for ATG UE.\n\nThe Occupied bandwidth requirement in subclause 6.5.1 of 38.101-1 [4] is applicable for ATG UE operating in FR1.\n\nFR1 PC3 ACLR requirement in 38.101-1 is reused for ATG CPE.\nThe general spurious emission requirement in subclause 6.5.3.1 of 38.101-1 [4] is applicable for ATG UE operating in FR1.\nGiven the separation distance between ATG UE and TN UE is quite large, it is expected that the achievable MCL can be large enough to overcome the UE-UE interference. This requirement will not be specified for ATG UE.\n\n",

For CPE(s) with an integral antenna only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each antenna port(s). CPE with an integral antenna(s) may be taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For CPEs with more than one receiver antenna connector, identical interfering signals shall be applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of these is used (diversity).\nThe CPE for ATG is required to be equipped with a minimum of two Rx antenna ports in all the ATG operating bands in FR1.\nThe reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power applied to each one of the CPE antenna ports, at which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.\nThe same assumptions of NR FR1 handheld UE are used for NR ATG CEP in ATG operating bands in FR1. Therefore, the reference sensitivity of NR FR1 handheld UE could be reused for ATG UE.\nThe throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2 and A.3.2 from TS 38.101-1 [4] (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1 from TS 38.101-1 [4]) with parameters specified in Table 7.1.3.3-1a, Table 7.1.3.3-1b and Table 7.1.3.2.2-3\nTable 7.1.3.3-1a: Two antenna port reference sensitivity QPSK REFSENS for FDD bands\n\nTable 7.1.3.3-1b: Two antenna port reference sensitivity QPSK REFSENS for TDD bands\n\nFor UE(s) equipped with 4 Rx antenna ports, reference sensitivity for 2Rx antenna ports in Table 7.1.3.3-1a and in Table 7.1.3.3-1b shall be modified by the amount given in ΔRIB,4R in Table 7.1.3.3-2 for the applicable operating bands.\nTable 7.1.3.3-2: Four antenna port reference sensitivity allowance ΔRIB,4R\n\nTable 7.1.3.3-3: Uplink configuration for reference sensitivity\n\nThe calculation and results for maximum input level are listed in Table 7.1.3.4-1. The maximum input level is a compromise of the theoretical worst-case which assumes the 5 dBi UE element gain under the condition that the ATG UE antenna and BS antenna are not directly pointing to each other.\nTable 7.1.3.4-1 the calculation for maximum input level requirements\n\nMaximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the UE antenna port, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement channel. For ATG, the maximum input level requirements are defined in Table 7.1.3.4-2 based on two types of UE antenna, i.e., omni-directional antenna and phased array antenna.\nTable 7.1.3.4-2: Maximum input level for ATG\n\nFor ACS, the coexistence studies outcome shows that the legacy ACS values as for NR FR1 UE are appropriate, and therefore reused.\nThe legacy ACS test parameters in case 1 is applied for ATG UE. ACS requirements in case 2 shall be specified based on the maximum input level of xdBm.\n\nBlocking due to TN interference\nCompared to terrestrial UE, ATG UEs are distant from base stations, experiencing LoS path loss from the TN BS that is not directly pointed at them. ATG UE at 2 GHz with omni-directional antennas, may receive power from multiple TN BSs. Even at 4 GHz, an ATG UE pointing downwards may still receive Rx power from the ground TN BS.\nTo evaluate the TN’s blocking power, simulations are conducted based on Scenario 3 and 11 (TN aggressor DL to ATG DL) and analyze the CDF of the absolute Rx power received by the ATG UE from the TN. The simulation is based on the following deployment scenarios: the ATG BS is located 300 km away from the center of the TN cluster and the ATG UEs x-coordinate is uniformly distributed over the horizontal extent of the TN cluster. The TN BSs utilize non-co-located 8-column non-subarray antennas. A single 5 dBi gain element has been used at the ATG UE at 4 GHz while an isotropic radiator is used at 2 GHz.\nAt a CDF of 99.999%, the simulation shows that the Rx power for a uniform distribution of ATG UEs’ altitude between 3 km and 10 km is -52 dBm and -56 dBm for 2 GHz and 4 GHz, respectively. For a fixed 10 km case, the Rx power is quite similar. A 6 dB difference can be observed in the fixed 3 km case, which is an unlikely scenario. Strictly following the simulation suggests -52 dBm in-band blocking, but it is essential to note that this relies on a 99.999% CDF. Lowering CDF to 99.99% is expected to yield lower interference at least several dB lower.\nTherefore, it is suggested to reuse the in-band blocking requirements in TS 38.101-1 for ATG UE.\n\nThe figure depicts simulation results of ACI blocking for scenario 3, showing the impact of different ACI blocking strategies on the network's performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed blocking strategies in mitigating network congestion and improving overall network efficiency.\nFigure 7.1.3.6-1 Simulation results of ACI blocking for scenario 3.\n\nThe figure depicts simulation results of ACI blocking for scenario 11, showing the impact of ACI (Application Control Infrastructure) blocking on the network performance. The results indicate that ACI blocking can lead to significant delays in data transmission, impacting the overall network efficiency.\nFigure 7.1.3.6-2 Simulation results of ACI blocking for scenario 11.\nBlocking due to interference from another ATG network\nThe co-existence simulations do not consider ATG-ATG co-existence. In the case of in-band blocking, the involvement of neighboring operators operating ATG could be significant. The most severe situation arises when co-located ATG BS direct their beams toward aircraft that are relatively close to each other and the BS. In such a case, the victim ATG UE could still be in the vicinity of the beam of the aggressor BS. Two scenarios are illustrated in 7.1.3.6-3, scenario 1 with two adjacent aircrafts separated vertically by 300 m and scenario 2 with a 9.26 km horizontal separation.\n\nIn this figure, we can observe two scenarios where co-located base stations (BSs) are pointing towards different aircraft that are relatively close. The first scenario shows a scenario where the BSs are pointing towards a single aircraft, while the second scenario depicts a scenario where the BSs are pointing towards two aircraft that are relatively close. This figure provides a visual representation of the spatial distribution of BSs and their potential impact on the performance of the network.\nFigure 7.1.3.6-3 Two scenarios when co-located BS pointing towards different aircraft that are relatively close.\nConsidering the FAA regulations mandating minimum aircraft separations of 300 m (1000 ft) vertically or 9.26 km (5 NM) horizontally in en-route airspace, one can estimate the angular separation. The victim aircraft could fall within the main lobe or the edge of the beam lobe towards the aggressor aircraft. Assuming 20 km distance from the ATG BS to the victim aircraft at a 10 km flight level, the angle separation is less than 1 deg in Scenario 1 and 15.4 deg in Scenario 2.\nIn Scenario 1, the victim UE falls into the main lobe of the aggressor beam. Determining the EIRP of the victim involves utilizing the ATG BS output power from simulation parameters and accounting for free space path loss. For an ATG UE operating at 2 GHz, the EIRP is calculated to be - 72 dBm, significantly lower than the blocking caused by TN interference. Furthermore, the 300 m vertical separation is an absolute minimum distance and is very unlikely to occur during normal cruising in the same direction.\nThus, it is not necessary to consider blocking from other ATG networks when assessing the in-band blocking requirement.\nReferring to the ITU-R M.2059-0 [8], Tables 1 and 2 of ITU-R M.2059-0 provide technical characteristics for representative analogue and digital FMCW radio altimeters. In 3GPP, the ATG UE OOB specification is defined to ensure the telecommunication link and there may be other sources of interference and regulatory issues that need to be considered when designing ATG UE, i.e. avionic equipment.\nThus, the existing out-of-band blocking requirements and spurious response requirement (-44dBm) in TS 38.101-1 are used for ATG UE.\nIt was agreed not to specify narrow band blocking requirements for ATG UE.\nIntermodulation response rejection is a measure of the receiver's capability to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two or more interfering signals with a specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.\nIt was agreed to reuse the intermodulation characteristics requirements specified in TS 38.101-1 for ATG UE.\nAs this is regulatory requirements and referring to the ERC Recommendation 74-01 Annex 3 [3], the spurious emissions limits specified in sub-clause of TS 38.101-1[4] would also be applicable to ATG UE.\n",

After some discussion, the three BS FR1 types are specified for ATG BS, i.e. ATG BS type type1-C, 1-H and 1-O are defined.\nFor the ATG BS class, the deployment scenarios were discussed. ATG BSs are supposed to be deployed on the ground to serve ATG UEs (CPE type of UE mounted in the aircraft) in the air. The flight altitude of ATG UE is supposed to turn on is assumed from 3~10km based on the regulatory input and coexistence study. The distance between aircraft and the nearest ATG BS in azimuth angle could be more than 200km and even up to 300km. So the scenario for ATG is different from existing scenarios for TN BS and scenario for HAPS. Separate BS classes for ATG need to be defined.\nFor ATG BS type type1-C, 1-H and 1-O, ATG BS class is defined as below:\nATG Base Stations are characterized by requirements derived from ATG scenarios with a ground BS to air UE with typical vertical altitude of around 10,000m and take-off/landing altitudes down to 3000m.\nGenerally most of the WA BS class requirements can be reused by ATG BS.

Similar to NR Wide area BS, there is no upper limit for the rated carrier output power, maximum output power should be left up to the declaration. The existing requirement defined in TS 38.104 [5] can be reused.\n\nRE power control dynamic range\nThe RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the power of an RE and the average RE power for a BS at maximum output power for a specified reference condition.\nThe RE power control dynamic range was derived by considering the relation between RE power boosting/de-boosting and other RF requirements like UEM, ACLR and EVM. For ATG BS, since the same waveform as NR is used, the existing requirement defined in TS 38.104 [5] can be applicable.\n\nTotal power dynamic range\nThe BS total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified reference condition. It can be calculated by 10log10 (NRB). The Total power dynamic range for ATG BS can reuse the requirement from TN BS in 3GPP TS 38.104 [5] for the same channel bandwidth.\nFrequency error\nFrequency error mainly depends on the timing and synchronization performance and PLL performance within transceiver chain. ATG system is expected to use the existing timing and synchronization network directly. Meanwhile, similar PLL performance of ATG BS as NR BS is also expected as they are operating at the same frequency range. With the above considerations, frequency error requirement of NR can be reused for ATG BS.\nConsidering the 0.05ppm BS frequency error, for 2100 MHz, it is 105 Hz. For ATG system, UE velocity can be reach up 900-1200km/h at cruising speed, it can be seen that the more serious frequency offset is caused by the Doppler effect. The 0.05 ppm frequency offset has little impact on the system performance.\nTime alignment error\nFor a specific set of NR signals/transmitter configurations/transmission modes, the conducted Time Alignment Error (TAE) is defined as the largest allowed timing difference (i.e. error) between two different reference signals belonging to different antenna connectors (for 1-C type NR BS), or TAB connectors (for 1-H type NR BS).\nTAE is only applicable for NR BS transmitting from multiple antennas via MIMO, CA, or combination of them.\nHowever, in ATG system, BS transmits signals from the ground to the air. Generally, these are only the main path signals, and few multipath signals. Thus, it’s unnecessary to specify the MIMO TAE requirements for ATG BS. In addition, CA is not supported for ATG in Rel-18. As a result, no TAE requirements need to be developed for ATG BS.\nModulation quality\nIt is agreed to specify QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM for ATG, for the supported modulation order is up to the vendor’s declaration.\nFor ATG BS, the EVM value of each carrier for different modulation schemes on PDSCH in TS 38.104 [5] shall be met.\nOccupied bandwidth\nThe occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each equal to a specified percentage /2 (=0.5%) of the total mean transmitted power. For ATG BS, it is agreed to reuse the same requirement defined in TS38.104 [5] which is following Recommendation ITU-R SM.328.\nAdjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)\nBased on the coexistence simulation results, it is sufficient to reuse the legacy FR1 ACLR 45dBc requirement for ATG BS..\nOperating band unwanted emissions\nATG BS can follow Wide Area BS, that the UEM level in the spurious domain is aligned with ITU-R recommendation SM.329.\nSince transmitter spurious emissions for TN BS should meet the requirements of ITU-R SM329, CEPT, and FCC etc., the spurious emission requirement defined in TS 38.104 [5] for TN BS is sufficient for ATG.\nThe same spurious emission requirement defined in TS 38.104 [5] for TN BS can be reused.\nIn the standard discussion, it's supposed that there’s no surrounding interfering BS with same bands existing for ATG BS. But some other scenarios were identified, for example, interfering signals from other bands or other asynchronous BS, also temporary interferers could occur close to the ATG BS. Therefore, it was agreed that it is important to verify that the ATG BS will still meet all emissions requirements, including regulatory requirements robustly.\nIt was agreed that the Tx IM requirement in TS 38.104 [5] can be reused to guarantee the performance of the ATG BS.\n",

Detailed investigation has not been made, but since the main difference between an ATG BS and TN BS is the tilt, it is not expected to be greater and may be expected sometimes to be similar to a TN BS. The existing requirements specified in clause 7.3 of TS 38.104[5] can be reused for ATG BS type1-C, 1-H, and clause 10.4 of TS 38.104[5] can be reused for ATG BS type1-O.\nThe co-existence simulations demonstrate that if 46dBc ACS is applied for BS in ATG scenarios then the cross operator interference is acceptable (<5% degradation) in all scenarios. It is desirable to apply the same ACS as TN BS to maximize compatibility with BS hardware platforms. Thus, based on the simulation results, the ATG adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) reuse the existing FR1 ACS (i.e. 46dBc) requirement applied for TN BS. The existing requirements specified in clause 7.4 of TS 38.104[5] can be reused for ATG BS type1-C, 1-H, and clause 10.5 of TS 38.104[5] can be reused for ATG BS type1-O.\nSince ATG BS is supposed to steer its beam up towards to provide the service for ATG UE in the air, the received power level of in-band blocking would be also lower than that for the legacy TN BS with beam steering down towards to provide the service on the ground. In addition, considering that it’s agreed to reuse the FR1 BS ACS requirement [46dBc] for ATG BS, therefore it is also reasonable to reuse the in-band blocking requirement for FR1 WA BS for ATG BS.\nRegarding the Rx intermodulation,  although it is not likely to have the coexistence scenario in which ATG BS is subject to intermodulation interferers with the power levels defined in FR1 WA Rx intermodulation requirement, Rx intermodulation still dimension some aspects of receiver design (e.g. receiver linearity to minimize the interfering signal intermodulation fall into the wanted signal). Therefore, it’ s still useful to keep the receiver intermodulation requirements and it is agreed to reuse the Rx IM requirement for FR1 WA BS for ATG BS.\nSince ATG BS is supposed to steer its beam up towards to provide the service for ATG UE in the air, the received OOBB power level would be also lower than that for the legacy TN BS with beam steering down towards to provide the service on the ground, then it’s sufficient to reuse the existing OOBB requirement defined for Wide Area BS in TS38.104.\nSince the IoT level of ATG BS is supposed to quite low compared with IoT level of the legacy TN BS. In addition, considering that noise figure for WA BS and FRC could be reused for ATG BS, then  it’s sufficient to reuse the existing requirement for Wide Area BS defined in TS 38.104.\n",

Two kinds of layout have been conducted to simulate different location relationship between ATG UE and TN network, one for ATG UE on top of TN network and the other for ATG UE away from TN UE in azimuth. For adjacent channel co-existence, RAN4 has concluded to reuse legacy FR1 TN BS and UE RF requirements (i.e., ACLR and ACS) for ATG BS and UE, respectively.\n-\tThe non-synchronized operation assumption is used to analyze isolation distance between ATG BS and TN network based on derived ACLR and ACS from synchronization operation. Moreover, a total of 3 cases have been performed to describe different boresight relationship between ATG BS and nearest TN BS. ATG BS point directly at nearest TN BS in azimuth is the worst case. RAN4 conclusions for different propagation conditions and modeling have been summarized in Section 6.5.\nBesides, ATG specific operation bands are listed in clause 5 based on request from operators. It’s noted this TR only encompass FR1 operation bands with larger than 1GHz frequency.\nRAN4 also studied the UE RF, BS RF, UE RRM requirement in Chapter 7.1, 7.2 and 8 respectively. Two kinds of UE RF and RRM requirements have been considered considering the implementation freedom for ATG UE with omi-directional antenna and/or antenna array.\n",
