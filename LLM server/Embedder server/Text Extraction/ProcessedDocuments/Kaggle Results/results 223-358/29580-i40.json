The figure is a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 5.3.2.3.2-1: MBS User Data Ingest Session Retrieval procedure\n1.\tIn order to retrieve the properties of an existing MBS User Data Ingest Session, the NF service consumer (e.g. AF, NEF) shall send an HTTP GET request message targeting the corresponding \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource.\nIf the MBSF determines that the received HTTP GET request message needs to be redirected, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n2.\tUpon success, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the response body containing a representation of the requested \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource within the MBSUserDataIngSession data structure.\nOn failure, the MBSF shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in clause 6.2.7, and respond to the NF service consumer with an appropriate error status code.\nThis service operation is used by the NF service consumer to request the update of an existing MBS User Data Ingest Session and potentially also its set of subordinate MBS Distribution Session(s) at the MBSF.\nThe following procedures are supported by the \"Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession_Update\" service operation:\n-\tMBS User Data Ingest Session Update.\nFigure 5.3.2.4.2-1 depicts a scenario where an NF service consumer requests the update or modification of an existing \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource at the MBSF.\nThe figure depicts a user data ingestion session update procedure for a MBS (Multi-Building Service) user. The session involves the update of user data, which is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the MBS service. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the update process, including the selection of the user data, the transmission of the update, and the verification of the update. The figure is crucial for ensuring that the MBS service remains up-to-date and reliable for its users.\nFigure 5.3.2.4.2-1: MBS User Data Ingest Session Update procedure\n1.\tIn order to request the update or modification of an existing MBS User Data Ingest Session and potentially also its set of subordinate MBS Distribution Session(s), the NF service consumer (e.g. AF, NEF) shall send an HTTP PUT or PATCH request message targeting the corresponding \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource, with the request body containing the MBSUserDataIngSession data structure (for an HTTP PUT request) or the MBSUserDataIngSessionPatch data structure (for an HTTP PATCH request).\nThe attributes that may be updated/modified at any time are as follows:\n-\tthe set(s) of active period(s) of the MBS User Data Ingest Session, within the \"actPeriods\" attribute; and\n-\twithin each map entry of the \"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute encoded using the MBSDistributionSessionInfo data structure (for an HTTP PUT request) or the MBSUserDataIngSessionPatch data structure (for an HTTP PATCH request):\n-\tthe MBS Service Information, within the \"mbsServInfo\" attribute;\n-\tthe MBS Frequency Selection Area (FSA) Identifier, for a broadcast service type, within the \"mbsFSAId\" attribute; and\n-\tthe target service area(s), within the \"tgtServAreas\" attribute.\nThe other attributes, except for the \"mbsSessionId\", the \"mbsDisSessionId\" and the \"locationDependent\" attributes, which shall never be updated after being provisioned, all the other attributes within each map entry of the \"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute encoded using the MBSDistributionSessionInfo data structure (for an HTTP PUT request) or the MBSUserDataIngSessionPatch data structure (for an HTTP PATCH request) may be updated only if the corresponding MBS Distribution Session is in the \"INACTIVE\" state.\nAs part of an MBS User Data Ingest Session update/modification procedure, the AF may also add new MBS Distribution Session(s) and/or remove existing MBS Distribution Session(s). In order to do so:\n-\tif a new MBS Distribution Session shall be created, the AF shall include its properties encoded using the MBSDistributionSessionInfo data structure as a new map entry within the \"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute with a newly assigned string-based map key that shall be unique within the scope of the parent MBS User Data Ingest Session; and\n-\tif an existing MBS Distribution Session shall be deleted, the AF shall include the corresponding map entry set to the value \"NULL\" within the \"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute with the map key set to its string-based map key provisioned during the request that initially created the MBS Distribution Session.\nIf the MBSF determines that the received HTTP PUT or PATCH request needs to be redirected, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP redirect response, as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n2.\tUpon success, the MBSF shall respond with either:\na)\tan HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the response body containing the updated representation of the \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource within the MBSUserDataIngSession data structure; or\nb)\tan HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nOn failure, the MBSF shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in clause 6.2.7, and respond to the NF service consumer with an appropriate error status code.\nThis service operation is used by the NF service consumer to request the deletion of an MBS User Data Ingest Session along with its subordinate MBS Distribution Session(s) at the MBSF.\nThe following procedures are supported by the \"Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession_Delete\" service operation:\n-\tMBS User Data Ingest Session Deletion.\nFigure 5.3.2.5.2-1 depicts a scenario where an NF service consumer requests the deletion of an existing \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource at the MBSF.\nThe figure depicts a user data ingestion session deletion procedure for a MBS (Multi-Bank Switching Center) user. The session is deleted when the user data is no longer required, and the process involves the deletion of the session log, user data, and any associated metadata. This ensures that the user data is properly managed and does not cause unnecessary storage or network traffic.\nFigure 5.3.2.5.2-1: MBS User Data Ingest Session Deletion procedure\n1.\tIn order to request the deletion of an existing MBS User Data Ingest Session along with its subordinate MBS Distribution Session(s), the NF service consumer (e.g. AF, NEF) shall send an HTTP DELETE request message targeting the corresponding \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource.\nIf the MBSF determines that the received HTTP DELETE request message needs to be redirected, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n2.\tUpon success, the MBSF shall:\n-\tdelete the targeted \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource; and\n-\trespond with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nOn failure, the MBSF shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in clause 6.2.7, and respond to the NF service consumer with an appropriate error status code.\nThis service operation is invoked by an NF service consumer to request the creation of a subscription to MBS User Data Ingest Session Status event(s) reporting at the MBSF.\nThe following procedures are supported by the \"Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession_StatusSubscribe\" service operation:\n-\t MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription Creation.\nFigure 5.3.2.6.2-1 depicts a scenario where an NF service consumer requests the creation of a subscription to MBS User Data Ingest Session Status event(s) reporting at the MBSF.\nThe figure depicts a user data ingestion session in a MBS (Multi-Building Service) user data subscription status, illustrating the creation procedure and the status of the subscription.\nFigure 5.3.2.6.2-1: MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription Creation procedure\n1.\tIn order to request the creation of a new MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request message targeting the \"MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscriptions\" resource, with the request body containing the MBSUserDataIngStatSubsc data structure that shall include:\n-\tthe identifier of the MBS User Data Ingest Session to which the subscription is related, within the \"mbsIngSessionId\" attribute;\n-\tthe list of subscribed MBS User Data Ingest Session Status event(s), within the \"eventSubscs\" attribute; and\n-\tthe URI towards which the notifications should be sent, within the \"notifUri\" attribute.\n2.\tUpon success, the MBSF shall create a new \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription\" resource and respond to the NF service consumer with an HTTP \"201 Created\" status code including an HTTP Location header field containing the URI of the created resource, i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nmbsf-mbs-ud-ingest/<apiVersion>/status-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\", and the response body containing a representation of the created \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription\" resource within the MBSUserDataIngStatSubsc data structure.\nOn failure, the MBSF shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in clause 6.2.7, and respond to the NF service consumer with an appropriate error status code.\nThis service operation is invoked by an NF service consumer to request the update/modification of a subscription to MBS User Data Ingest Session Status event(s) reporting at the MBSF.\nThe following procedures are supported by the \"Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession_StatusSubscribeMod\" service operation:\n-\tMBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription Update.\nFigure 5.3.2.7.2-1 depicts a scenario where an NF service consumer requests the update/modification of an existing \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session Status Subscription\" resource at the MBSF.\nThe figure depicts a user data ingestion session in a MBS (Multi-Building System) user data update procedure.
