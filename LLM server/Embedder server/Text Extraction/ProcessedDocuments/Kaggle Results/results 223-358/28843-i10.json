The architecture is designed to facilitate seamless transactions and ensure efficient charging of electric vehicles (EVs).\nFigure X.3.2-1: High Level charging architecture for the B2B\nX.3.3\tBusiness to Consumer Charging\nIn the charging architecture for B2C, the interaction for the NF and UE CCS is present, and the related NF and the corresponding reference will be described as the following.\nThe figure depicts a high-level charging architecture for the B2C market, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. It includes a charging station (CS), a payment gateway (PG), and a payment processing system (PPS). The CS is responsible for accepting payments and managing the charging process, while the PG facilitates the payment gateway and ensures secure transactions. The PPS is responsible for processing the payment and providing the user with the charging information. The figure highlights the importance of interoperability and integration between these components to ensure a seamless user experience.\nFigure X.3.3-1: High Level charging architecture for the B2C\n",

In that way, B2B and B2C are separated which brings some trouble for the internal and external stakeholder to search required information and the internal relationship between B2B and B2C is difficult to covered.\n-\tSolution #2 proposed to add the new clause in the existing TS 32.240 [2], which can present the charging principle for the B2C and B2B in the same TS. In that way, understand the common charging principle as the whole charging system and the special charging principle for the certain services in the charging service specifications.\nThe new annex also can include the charging architecture applicability for B2B, B2C.\nThe Solution #3, #4, #5, #6 #7 and #8 solve the key issue #2:\n-\tSolution #3 about existing converged charging architecture is applicable for the general charging capabilities and B2B charging scenarios, which distributed in the different charging service TSs.\n-\tSolution #4 about existing network slice tenant charging architecture is applicable for the network slice charging, can support the B2B, B2C charging,\n-\tSolution #5 about existing converged tenant charging architecture merged the solution #x for network slice tenant charging and solution #x converged charging architecture is applicable for all the charging scenarios, can support B2B and B2C charging.\n-\tSolution #6 about the existing NF to CHFs communication is applicable for roaming and MVNO charging, can support B2B and B2C charging, which distributed in the different charging service TSs.\n-\tSolution #7 about the existing CHF to CHF communication is applicable for roaming and MVNO charging, can support B2B and B2C charging, which distributed in the different charging service TSs.\n-\tSolution #8 about existing separated charging architecture describes the different business relationship for B2B, B2C, which can clearly present the charging architecture applicability in the different charging scenarios via the different NF referred to the different special charging service specifications. In that way, the internal and external stakeholder can understand the charging scenarios and reference for the NF charging in the common way, which is easy to find the required information distributed in the multiple TSs.\n",
