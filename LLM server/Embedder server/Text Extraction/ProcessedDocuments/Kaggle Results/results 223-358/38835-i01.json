                    "text_content": "Extended Reality (XR) refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. XR is an umbrella term for different types of realities (see TR 26.918 [5] and TR 26.928 [7]):\n-\tVirtual reality (VR) is a rendered version of a delivered visual and audio scene. The rendering is designed to mimic the visual and audio sensory stimuli of the real world as naturally as possible to an observer or user as they move within the limits defined by the application. Virtual reality usually, but not necessarily, requires a user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the user's field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying audio. Some form of head and motion tracking of the user in VR is usually also necessary to allow the simulated visual and audio components to be updated in order to ensure that, from the user's perspective, items and sound sources remain consistent with the user's movements.\n-\tAugmented reality (AR) is when a user is provided with additional information or artificially generated items or content overlaid upon their current environment. Such additional information or content will usually be visual and/or audible and their observation of their current environment may be direct, with no intermediate sensing, processing and rendering, or indirect, where their perception of their environment is relayed via sensors and may be enhanced or processed.\n-\tMixed reality (MR) is an advanced form of AR where some virtual elements are inserted into the physical scene with the intent to provide the illusion that these elements are part of the real scene.\nOther terms used in the context of XR are Immersion as the sense of being surrounded by the virtual environment as well as Presence providing the feeling of being physically and spatially located in the virtual environment. The sense of presence provides significant minimum performance requirements for different technologies such as tracking, latency, persistency, resolution and optics.\nThis document uses the acronym XR throughout to refer to equipment, applications and functions used for VR, AR and MR. Examples include, but are not limited to HMDs for VR, optical see-through glasses and camera see-through HMDs for AR and MR and mobile devices with positional tracking and camera. They all offer some degree of spatial tracking and the spatial tracking results in an interaction to view some form of virtual content.\n",

                    "text_content": "For providing XR experiences that make the user feel immersed and present, several relevant quality of experience factors have been collected (see TR 26.926 [7]). Presence is the feeling of being physically and spatially located in an environment. Presence is divided into 2 types: Cognitive Presence and Perceptive Presence. Cognitive Presence is the presence of one's mind. It can be achieved by watching a compelling film or reading an engaging book. Cognitive Presence is important for an immersive experience of any kind. Perceptive Presence is the presence of one's senses. To accomplish perceptive presence, one's senses, sights, sound, touch and smell, have to be tricked. To create perceptive presence, the XR Device has to fool the user's senses, most notably the audio-visual system. XR Devices achieve this through positional tracking based on the movement. The goal of the system is to maintain your sense of presence and avoid breaking it. Perceptive Presence is the objective to be achieved by XR applications.\nThe Human field of view (FoV) is defined as the area of vision at a given moment (with a fixed head). It is the angle of visible field expressed in degrees measured from the focal point. The monocular FoV is the angle of the visible field of one eye whereas the binocular FoV is the combination of the two eyes fields (see TR 26.918 [5]). The binocular horizontal FoV is around 200-220°, while the vertical one around 135°. The central vision, which is about 60°, is also called the comfort zone where sensibility to details is the most important. Although less sensitive to definition, the peripheral vision is more receptive to movements.\nIn XR, actions and interactions involve movements and gestures. Thereby, the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) describe the number of independent parameters used to define movement in the 3D space (see TR 26.928 [7]):\n-\t3DoF: three rotational and un-limited movements around the X, Y and Z axes (respectively pitch, yaw and roll). A typical use case is a user sitting in a chair looking at 3D 360 VR content on an HMD.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a 3D-DoF (degrees of freedom) system, illustrating the various degrees of freedom that can be used to control the system. The system is composed of a 3D-DoF controller, a 3D-DoF actuator, and a 3D-DoF sensor. The figure shows the system in a 3D perspective, with the 3D-DoF controller in the center, the 3D-DoF actuator on the left, and the 3D-DoF sensor on the right. The figure also includes a 3D-DoF controller's control input, a 3D-DoF actuator's control input, and a 3D-DoF sensor's control input. The figure is a visual representation of the system's control architecture and its ability to control the system in a 3D-DoF manner.\nFigure 4.2-1: 3DoF\n-\t6DoF: 3DoF with full translational movements along X, Y and Z axes. Beyond the 3DoF experience, it adds (i) moving up and down (elevating/heaving); (ii) moving left and right (strafing/swaying); and (iii) moving forward and backward (walking/surging). A typical use case is a user freely walking through 3D 360 VR content (physically or via dedicated user input means) displayed on an HMD.\nThe figure depicts a 6DoF (degrees of freedom) representation of a 6-axis robotic arm, showcasing its ability to perform complex movements and tasks. The figure illustrates the various degrees of freedom, such as the position, orientation, and velocity, that the robotic arm can move in 3D space. This allows for precise control and manipulation of objects in a variety of scenarios.\nFigure 4.2-2: 6DoF\nAn XR View describes a single view into an XR scene for a given time. Each view corresponds to a display or portion of a display used by an XR device to present the portion of the scene to the user.\nAn XR Viewport describes a viewport, or a rectangular region, of a graphics surface. The XR viewport corresponds to the projection of the XR View onto a target display. An XR viewport is predominantly defined by the width and height of the rectangular dimensions of the viewport.\nAn XR Pose describes a position and orientation in space relative to an XR Space. An essential element of XR is the spatial tracking of the viewer pose.\n",

                            "text_content": "XR content may be represented in different formats, e.g. panoramas or spheres depending on the capabilities of the capture systems. Since modern video coding standards are not designed to handle spherical content. Projection is used for conversion of a spherical (or 360°) video into a two-dimensional rectangular video before the encoding stage. After projection, the obtained two-dimensional rectangular image can be partitioned into regions (e.g. front, right, left, back, top, bottom) that can be rearranged to generate \"packed\" frames to increase coding efficiency or viewport dependent stream arrangement.\nThere are mainly three approaches that can be considered for 360 video delivery (see TR 26.918 [5]):\n-\tSingle stream approach: the single stream approach consists in providing the full 360 video and showing the interesting part only. Solutions that lie within this group have the drawback that either they may not be scalable or they may impose a big challenge in terms of required network resources (high bitrate of high resolution video) and required processing at the client side (decode a very high resolution video).\n-\tMulti-stream approach: the multi-stream approach consists of encoding several streams, each of them emphasizing a given viewport and making them available for the receiver, so that the receiver decides which stream is delivered at each time instance.\n-\tTiled stream approach: the tiled stream approach consists in emphasizing the current user viewport through transmitting non-viewport samples with decreased resolution. The tiles can be provided as one common bitstream (using motion-constrained HEVC tiles) or as separate video streams.\nIn modern video codecs (see S4-220505 [13]):\n-\tComplex prediction structures are used that take into account application constraints, encoding complexity, latency and dynamic decisions in the encoding. This may result in irregularities, for example based on sequence properties. In particular for low-latency delivery with error resiliency, different flavours of encoding operations are in use, and the concept of I, P and B pictures is not generally applicable.\n-\tAll PDUs in a PDU Set are needed by the application layer to use the corresponding unit of information in some implementations; while in some others, receivers may use the data up to the first lost fragmentation unit to recover at least parts of the video data and apply error concealment afterward.\n-\tFurthermore, in motion-compensated predicted video decoding, some frames refer to other frames based on the video encoding configuration but also based on dynamic operational decisions. As a consequence, a PDU Set may \"depend\" on previously received PDU Sets. However, such dependencies do not necessarily result in discarding dependent information units.\n",

The metadata embody the artistic intent by specifying the transformation of each of the audio elements to playback by the final reproduction system. Sound objects generally use monophonic audio tracks that have been recorded or synthesized through a process of sound design.

In power and resource constrained devices, it can be assisted or split across the network through edge computing (see TR 22.842 [2]): the UE sends the sensor data in uplink direction to the cloud side in a real time manner and when the cloud side receives the sensor data, it performs rendering computing and produces the multimedia data and then sends back to the user devices for display.

Thus, a mode of operation where the lower-layers on the receiver side do not always enforce in-sequence delivery to upper layers is preferred (see S4aR230035 [17]).\nOther than that, it is difficult to identify characteristics common for different XR applications since they heavily depend on the application choices, such as the application itself, the codec in use, the data formats and the encoding operation (see S4-220505 [13]). In particular, low-latency XR and cloud gaming video services such as Split-Rendering or Cloud Gaming typically would not use the traditional coding structure with a fixed Group of-Picture (GOP). In addition, the field of low-latency video delivery is undergoing heavy innovation and new coding methods may be established frequently. Thus, the traffic characteristics and requirements derived from the work done in SA4 (TR 26.926 [6] and TR 26.928 [7]) and listed below, can only be used as a baseline when specific examples for XR traffic characteristics are needed – bearing in mind that they are not universally applicable for all XR applications.\n",

The size of a XR Viewer Pose associated to time, typically results in packets of size in the range of 30-100 bytes, such that the generated data is around several hundred kbit/s if delivered over the network with latency requirements in the range of 10-20ms (see TR 26.928 [7]).\nRepeatedly providing the XR Viewer Pose for the same display time may not necessarily return the same result (the prediction gets increasingly accurate as the information is closer to the time when a prediction is made) and there is a trade-off between providing several XR Viewer Pose for a display time and using the same XR Viewer Pose for several consecutive display times. However, it can be assumed that sending one XR Viewer Pose aligned with the frame rate of the rendered video may be sufficient, for example at 60fps (see S4-221626 [16]).\nNOTE:\tIn case the pose is used for pre-rendering in the network (edge/cloud), an accurate and most recent pose information is preferable.\nPose information has to be delivered with ultra-high reliability, therefore, similar performance as URLLC is expected i.e. packet loss rate should be lower than 10E-3 for uplink sensor data – see S4-221626 [16].\n",

During a Data Burst, periods of data transmission inactivity should not be assumed. Although the duration of Data Bursts may vary, it can be assumed that it stays within the same order of magnitude. Also, the arrival time of the first packet of a data burst cannot be provided by 5GC.\nThe following information may be provided by the CN to RAN (see TR 23.700-60 [9]):\n-\tSemi-static information per QoS flow:\n-\tPeriodicity for UL and DL traffic of the QoS Flow provided via TSCAI/TSCAC;\n-\tDL Traffic jitter information (e.g. jitter range) associated with each periodicity of the QoS flow provided via TSCAI/TSCAC.\n-\tPDU Set QoS parameters of the QoS flow (i.e. applicable to all PDU sets of the QoS flow) provided by the SMF via NGAP:\n-\tPDU Set Error Rate (PSER): defines an upper bound for a rate of non-congestion related PDU Set losses between RAN and the UE (see TR 23.700-60 [9]).\nNOTE 2:\tIn this release, a PDU set is considered as successfully delivered only when all PDUs of a PDU Set are delivered successfully, and if the PSER is available, the usage of PSER supersedes the usage of PER.\n-\tPDU Set Delay Budget (PSDB): time between reception of the first PDU (at the UPF in DL, at the UE in UL) and the successful delivery of the last arrived PDU of a PDU Set (at the UE in DL, at the UPF in UL). PSDB is an optional parameter and when provided, the PSDB supersedes the PDB (see TR 23.700-60 [9]).\n-\tPDU Set Integrated Handling Indication (PSIHI): indicates whether all PDUs of the PDU Set are needed for the usage of PDU Set by application layer.\n-\tPDU Set Information and Identification (dynamic information for DL provided by user plane in GTP-U header):\n-\tPDU Set Sequence Number;\n-\tPDU Set Size in bytes (FFS);\n-\tPDU SN within a PDU Set;\n-\tIndication of End PDU of the PDU Set;\n-\tPDU Set Importance (PSI): identifies the relative importance of a PDU Set compared to other PDU Sets within a QoS Flow. RAN may use it for PDU Set level packet discarding in presence of congestion;\n-\tEnd of Data Burst indication in the header of the last PDU of the Data Burst (optional).\nFor the uplink XR traffic, the UE needs to be able to identify PDU Set and Data Bursts dynamically, including PSI, but in-band marking over Uu of PDUs is not needed. Additional potential improvements to enhance the scheduling of uplink resources are given in clause 5.3.2.\nWhen the PSIHI is set for a QoS flow, as soon as one PDU of a PDU set is known to be lost, the remaining PDUs of that PDU Set can be considered as no longer needed by the application and may be subject to discard operation (see clause 5.3.2).\nNOTE 3:\tIt cannot always be assumed that the remaining PDUs are not useful and can safely be discarded.\nNOTE 4:\tIn case of Forward Error Correction (FEC), active discarding of PDUs when assuming that a large enough number of packets have already been transmitted for FEC to recover without the remaining PDUs is not recommended as it might trigger an increase of FEC packets (see S4aV220921 [14]).\n",

The figure shows different mapping options, such as point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-multipoint with a fallback, which are crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure also highlights the need for careful consideration of the network's architecture, including the use of core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, to ensure optimal performance and reliability.\nFigure 5.1.2-1: Mapping Alternatives\nWhen comparing these alternatives, it was agreed that a QoS flow cannot be mapped onto multiple DRBs in the uplink, thereby excluding alternative N1N. For the other alternatives, providing different QoS by splitting PDU sets of one DRB to different RLC bearers will not be possible i.e. that splitting a DRB onto multiple RLC entities will remain limited to existing cases (e.g. duplication).\nIn addition, the notion of PDU Set does not impact the granularity of:\n-\tSDAP SDU handling: SDAP still maps every incoming SDU to a single PDU for a single PDCP entity;\n-\tRetransmissions: HARQ still relies on MAC PDUs and ARQ on RLC PDUs.\nIn terms of logical channel prioritisation in uplink, changes due to PDU prioritisation will not be introduced, e.g. delay criteria was considered but agreed not to be pursued further unless fundamental issues are identified.\n",

Particularly, the following schemes, where multi-PDSCH is scheduled by a single DCI, have been evaluated:\n-\tScheme 1.2: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where unoccupied CORESET in a slot can be re-used for PDSCH transmission.\n-\tScheme 1.3: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbol(s) are always reserved for PDCCH transmission in each slot.\n-\tScheme 1.4: Multi-PDSCH scheduling with FDRA enhancement - more than one FDRA indication is contained in the scheduling DCI, each of which is applied to one or more scheduled PDSCH.\n-\tScheme 1.5: Multi-PDSCH scheduling enhancement with early HARQ-ACK feedback - multiple PUCCHs may be considered where HARQ-ACK for the earlier PDSCH(s) can be reported earlier than the later PDSCH(s) scheduled by the same DCI, to reduce latency of HARQ-ACK feedback.\n-\tScheme 1.6: Multi-PDSCH scheduling where single PDCCH schedules up to 4 PDSCHs and full flexibility in terms of resource (RB allocation) as well as MCS for each of the 4 PDSCHs.\n-\tScheme 1.7: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbols per slot are used for PDCCH if there is at least one UE that needs to be scheduled with first TB out of multiple TBs and 0 symbols per slot are used for PDCCH if no UE with the first TB out of multiple TBs needs to be scheduled.\nThe performance results of the above schemes are reported in Table B.1.1-1, Table B.1.1-2, Table B.1.1-3 in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.\nTable B.1.1-1: FR1, DL, InH, VR/AR and Cloud Gaming at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.1-2: FR1, DL, DU, VR/AR and Cloud Gaming at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.1-3: FR1, DL, UMa, VR/AR at 60 FPS\n\nBased on the evaluation results in Table B.1.1-1 and Table B.1.1-3, the following observations regarding multi-PDSCH scheduling by a single DCI as compared to single PDSCH scheduling can be made:\n-\tFor FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is observed from Source [vivo] that the capacity is decreased from 9.8 UEs per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 8.81 UEs per cell with multi-PDSCH scheduling, where 1 symbol is always reserved for PDCCH transmission in each slot (capacity drop is -10%).

In TDD system, channel UL-DL reciprocity is utilized to obtain DL channel state information for improved performance of single-cell (non-cooperative) MU-MIMO. However, inter-cell interference is still the bottleneck that limits further capacity improvement.\nThe performance of MU-MIMO with zero forcing precoding (scheme 2.1 in Tables B.1.2-1,2) has been compared against Cooperative MIMO with DL interference probing (scheme 2.2 in Tables B.1.2-1,2).\nScheme 2.2: Cooperative MIMO with DL interference probing via SRS and precoding via bi-directional training (BiT), is the scheme where SRS triggering and transmission are enhanced to directly reflect DL interference spatial information (utilizing UL-DL reciprocity). Each gNB performs its own (MU) scheduling and instructs the scheduled UEs to sound on the scheduled PRBs. Then by TDD reciprocity, a gNB seeing strong UL interference from a certain spatial direction on the SRS resources (for example, via estimating the UL spatial covariance matrix of interference signals) implies that in DL transmission the gNB will cause strong interference to UE(s) in that direction. The gNB can then adjust the precoding for DL interference avoidance during the PDSCH transmissions. Each gNB measures the corresponding UL SRS resources and adjusts its DL precoding accordingly to achieve multi-cell DL interference coordination/avoidance in a distributed way, and hence the so-called 'Bi-directional Training' (BiT).\nThe performance results are reported in B.1.2-1 and B.1.2-2 in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.\nTable B.1.2-1: FR1, DL, DU, VR/AR and Cloud Gaming at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.2-2: FR1, DL, UMa, VR/AR and Cloud Gaming at 60 FPS\n\nBased on the evaluation results in Table B.1.2-1 and Table B.1.2-2, the following observations can be made:\n-\tFor FR1, DU, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with MU-MIMO, 64TxRU and DDDSU, it is observed from Source [Futurewei] that the capacity is increased from 21.7 UEs per cell with MU-MIMO and zero forcing precoding to 25.8 UEs per cell with Cooperative MIMO via SRS enhancements (capacity gain is 19%).

The 2-bit soft-HARQ feedback represents 4 states: ACK, and NACK with n=1, 2, or 3, where \"n\" indicates how many redundant transmissions are requested by the UE.\nThe performance results are reported in Table B.1.5-1, Table B.1.5-2, Table B.1.5-3 in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.\nTable B.1.5-1: FR1, DL, InH, VR/AR at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.5-2: FR1, DL, DU, VR/AR at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.5-3: FR1, DL, UMa, VR/AR at 60 FPS\n\nBased on the evaluation results in Table B.1.5-1, Table B.1.5-2, Table B.1.5-3 the following observations can be made:\n-\tFor FR1, DU, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with MU-MIMO and 64TxRU, it is observed from Source [Qualcomm] that the capacity is increased from 11.3 UEs per cell with baseline HARQ-ACK to 11.9 UEs per cell with soft HARQ-ACK indicating delta MCS based on PDSCH decoding and k3=4 slots (capacity gain is 5%).

                    "text_content": "This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for configured grant scheduling. A UE can transmit UL data using CG resources after configuration (of a CG Config Type 1) or activation (of a CG Config Type 2), without the need of receiving UL grant from the gNB.\nThe performance of dynamic grant (DG) scheduling has been compared against configured grant (CG) scheduling. Particularly, the following schemes have been evaluated:\n-\tScheme 6.1.1: DG scheduling with SR followed by UL grant with BSR and data. It is assumed that an SR is triggered upon arrival of a new XR packet in the UE buffer. An UL resource is then granted to the UE to transmit BSR and a number of UL data. A periodicity of SR and a size of initial UL grant may vary and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.1.2: DG scheduling with SR followed by UL grant with BSR only. A periodicity of SR may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.2: Pre-scheduling dynamic grant: The scheduling is based on dynamic grants where it is assumed that the network is provided with XR traffic periodicity. An initial grant to the UE when its traffic is expected is transmitted (implementation-based learning) without using SR. A size of initial UL grant may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.3: Dynamic scheduling with genie BSR (DG with genie BSR): The scheduling is based on dynamic grants where it is assumed BSR is available with zero delay at the scheduler when a new XR packet arrives in the UE buffer, to be used for indicating UL grants to the UE. Hence, in this case, no SR or BSR delay is assumed.\n-\tScheme 6.4: Single CG configuration, where single PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. In this scheme no scheduling delay is assumed. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.5.1: Multiple CG configurations, where multiple PUSCH occasions per CG period are pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. In this scheme no scheduling delay is assumed. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.5.2: Multiple CG configurations, where multiple PUSCH occasions per CG period are pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. In this scheme scheduling delay for scheduling more packets with DG is assumed as 2.5 ms. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.6.1: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling – the scheduling is based on a combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not used. Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in UL slot in order to transmit BSR and data when a new XR packet arrives. Whenever a new XR packet arrives in the UE buffer, the UE uses the nearest possible CG PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission and possibly some amount of data. The network can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic grants for the following data transmission. CG periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.6.2: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling – the scheduling is based on a combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not used. Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in order to transmit BSR only when a new XR packet arrives. It is assumed that one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets. Whenever a new XR packet arrives in the UE buffer, the UE uses the nearest possible CG PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission. The network can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic grants for the corresponding data scheduling. CG periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.6.3: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling – the scheduling is based on a combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not used. Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in UL slot in order to transmit BSR and data when a new XR packet arrives. Whenever a new XR packet arrives in the UE's buffer, the UE uses the nearest possible CG PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission and possibly some amount of data. The network can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic grants for the following data transmission. The PDCCH monitoring window for the dynamic grant is pre-configured and associated with the CG PUSCH occasion in each CG period. The enhanced BSR that the BSR report will be triggered at the first used CG PUSCH occasion in each CG period to indicate to the gNB the remaining packet size is assumed. If the BSR is reported by the UE with the status \"not empty\", the UE would monitor PDCCH in the subsequent slots for dynamic grant after XR packet transmission with the CG resource, in which the dynamic grant is used to schedule the remaining data of XR packet. If the BSR is reported by the UE with the status \"empty\", the UE would not monitor PDCCH in the subsequent slots of the PDCCH monitoring window for XR packet transmission. Furthermore, if the XR packets are completely transmitted during the monitoring window, the UE can be indicated to go to sleep. If the XR packets arrive during the monitoring window, the UE can be indicated to skip the PDCCH monitoring until the packets arrive. CG periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.7: Enhanced CG with flexible resource allocation, where at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. In this scheme, it is assumed the UE can indicate to gNB unused CG PUSCH resources via CG-UCI. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.8: Enhanced CG with dynamic adaptation of CG parameters and indication of unused/used CG PUSCH occasion(s). In this scheme, the UE adjusts CG parameters dynamically: MCS, number of PRBs, number of layers within the CG resource. The UE indicates these scheduling parameters to the gNB via UCI transmitted separately in the same CG resource, and whether the subsequent CG PUSCH occasions will be used/unused until next XR packet arrival. It is assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.9: Enhanced CG with indication of unused/used CG PUSCH occasion(s), where the UE only indicates if the subsequent CG PUSCH occasions will be used/unused until next XR packet arrival. It is assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.10: Enhanced CG with MAC CE based dynamic resource adjustment indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry MAC CE based dynamic resource adjustment indication and video data, and resource adjustment indication delay based on MAC CE is 2.5ms. It is assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.11: Enhanced CG with UCI based dynamic resource adjustment indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry UCI based dynamic resource adjustment indication and video data, and resource adjustment indication delay based on UCI is 0.5ms. It is assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\n-\tScheme 6.12: Enhanced CG with UCI based dynamic resource adjustment indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry UCI based dynamic resource adjustment indication only, and the dynamic resource adjustment indication is used to inform the gNB data volume of an XR packet or required resources to transmit the XR packet. Resource adjustment indication delay based on UCI is 0.5ms. It is assumed that one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.\nTable B.1.6-1: FR1, UL, InH, AR at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.6-2: FR1, UL, DU, AR at 60 FPS\n\nTable B.1.6-3: FR1, UL, InH, AR pose/control at 250 FPS\n\nBased on the evaluation results in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2 the following observations can be made:\n-\tFor FR1, DU, UL, with 100MHz bandwidth for AR single-stream traffic model, 10Mbps, 30ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 64TxRU, it is observed from Source [Ericsson] that the capacity is increased from 6.42 UEs per cell with DG scheduling with SR followed by small initial UL grant (288 bits) with BSR and data (scheme 6.1.1) to 6.86 UEs per cell with pre-scheduling dynamic grant (scheme 6.2) (capacity gain is 7%).

Scheduling restrictions apply for the UEs during time-intervals where it is performing intra-frequency RRM measurements at FR2, or gap assisted inter-frequency RRM measurements. Such scheduling restrictions does not allow to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS. When XR frame arrival collides with RRM measurements, the XR frame will be delayed for the duration of SMTC window or measurement gap (MG).\nThe performance with SMTC/MG scheduling restrictions (scheme 7.2 and 7.4 in Table B.1.7-1 and Table B.1.7-2) has been compared against no SMTC/MG scheduling restrictions as well as with adaptation of MG period. Particularly, the following schemes have been evaluated:\n-\tScheme 7.1: Without SMTC scheduling restrictions. In this scheme, no scheduling restrictions for FR2 intra-frequency measurements were assumed. This can be realized via gNB-2-UE signalling to configure the UE with time-mask where it shall always prioritize PDCCH/PDSCH decoding and/or PUSCH transmission in line with XR traffic, even if colliding with SMTC windows. Alternatively, the UE-to-gNB signalling to make the gNB scheduler aware of when s-MeasureConfig induced scheduling restrictions apply could be applied.\n-\tScheme 7.2: With SMTC scheduling restrictions. In this scheme, scheduling restrictions every 20 ms time period for an SMTC window of 5 ms for FR2 intra-frequency measurements were assumed. In case the SMTC windows with scheduling restrictions collide with time periods where the gNB would need to schedule the XR transmission, XR frame transmission will be delayed.\n-\tScheme 7.3: No scheduling restrictions during measurement gap. In this scheme, no scheduling restrictions during measurement gap for inter-frequency measurements were assumed.\n-\tScheme 7.4: With scheduling restrictions during measurement gap. In this scheme, scheduling restrictions for the duration of measurement gap length of 6 ms are applied. Measurement gaps (MG) are configured to allow UE to do inter-frequency neighbour cell measurement and the corresponding RF tuning for RRM purposes (e.g. mobility, load balancing, CA set-up). In case the MG with scheduling restrictions collide with time periods where the gNB would need to schedule the XR transmission, XR frame transmission will be delayed.\n-\tScheme 7.5.1: Adaptation of MG period. The MG period is adapted to be 2 times when PCell RSRP is 2dB better than the best neighbour cell and 4 times when PCell RSRP is 4dB better than the best neighbour cell.

FFS how this is modelled in PDCP specification, can be discussed in WI phase.\n-\tRAN2 aims to allow XR frame rates that correspond to non-integer periodicities in at least semi-static manner (e.g. RRC). Details can be left to WI phase.\n-\tRAN2 thinks we need one or more additional BSR table(s) for XR. FFS whether these are static (=specified) or dynamic (e.g. generated, differs according to some RRC parameter), can be discussed in WI phase.\n-\tRAN2 will introduce data volume information associated with delay information (e.g. remaining time) in a MAC CE. FFS if this is extension of BSR or new format. FFS how to do that (e.g. what exactly is reported) and how to ensure this information is up-to-date e.g. considering UL scheduling delay.\n-\tRAN2 needs to discuss additional BSR triggering conditions to allow timely availability of buffer status information at gNB. This can be discussed in WI phase.\n-\tRAN2 sees some benefit from CG to XR services. RAN2 will address enhancements triggered by RAN1 work.\n-\tRAN2 agrees some assistance information can be beneficial (e.g. periodicity, packet size). RAN2 assumes baseline could be TSCAI (pending SA2 conclusions), can discuss during WI phase whether something additional is needed on top of that. If any assistance information is needed, its definition should be standardized.\n-\tRAN2 thinks all information may not be always available at UE application.\n",
