The figure 4.6.2 below illustrates multiple scenarios:\n-\tMnF1 produces Management Service MnS-a;\n-\tMnF2 consumes Management Service MnS-a produced by MnF1 and produces Management Services MnS-b and MnS-c;\n-\tMnF3 produces Management Service MnS-c;\n-\tMnF4 consumes Management Service MnS-b produced by the MnF2;\n-\tMnF5 consumes Management Services MnS-c produced by the MnF2 and MnF3, and in turn produces the same Management Service MnS-c. The behaviour of MnF5 may be seen as aggregation of Management Services MnS-c.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a 5G network, illustrating the interactions between management functions.

This, along with increasing flexibility of the network may present management and operational challenges and complexities. The management system can therefore benefit from management data analytics services for improving  networks performance and efficiency to accommodate and support the diversity of services and requirements. The management data analytics utilize the network management data collected from the network (including e.g. service, slicing and/or network functions related data) and make the corresponding analytics based on the collected information. The information provided by PM  analytics can be used to optimize network performance, and the information provided by FM analytics can be used to predict and prevent failures of the network. MDAF can be deployed at different levels, for example, at a domain level (e.g. RAN, CN, network slice subnet) and/or in a centralized manner (e.g. at a PLMN level).\nThe figure depicts a service-based architecture for management data analytics, illustrating the various components and their interactions. The architecture is based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) model, with a focus on data analytics. Key components include data sources, data processing, and data visualization. The figure also includes a service catalog, which provides a comprehensive overview of the services offered. The architecture is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for easy integration and management of new services.\nFigure: 4.6.1: Service based architecture for management data analytics\n\n",

The subscriber sends a request to the service provider, which then sends a response back to the subscriber. The response includes the subscriber's data, which is then sent to the subscriber's device. The figure shows the different stages of the communication process, including the request, response, and data transmission.\nFigure 5.1.2.2: Subscribe-notify communication paradigm\nNOTE: \tExample of a common aspect applicable to all management services is the use of notifications. For a management service to use notifications the management service consumer needs a subscription to notifications it is interested in. The management service consumer requests the creation of a subscription by sending a subscribe operation to the management service producer. To cancel a subscription the consumer sends an unsubscribe operation to the producer.\n-\t\"Connect-streaming\": A management producer is provided with the address the management service consumer. The management service producer requests to establish a connection with the management service consumer for management data streaming. The management service producer sends the management data, when they are ready, by streaming to the management service consumer over the established connection.\nThe figure depicts a 2-3-1 communication paradigm, where two streams of data are transmitted simultaneously over a single network link. This model is used in the context of connect-streaming communication, where data is transmitted in parallel to reduce latency and improve efficiency.\nFigure 5.1.2.3: Connect-streaming communication paradigm\n-\t\"Request-response with access control\" in explicit authentication and authorization mode: An authentication service producer is requested by a management service consumer for authentication, the authentication service producer authenticates the management service consumer according to information in the request, authentication policies and other information associated to the identity of the management service consumer. After being successfully authenticated, the management service consumer may send request to an authorization service producer to get access token for permissions. After getting access token from an authorization service producer,  the management service consumer sends request to corresponding management service producers to access management services. The management service producer provides response to the consumer after verifying the access token.  Figure 5.1.1.2-4 depicted typical Request-response communication paradigm with access control explicit authentication and authorization mode\nThe figure depicts a request-response communication paradigm with access control, illustrating the two-step authentication and authorization process. The first step involves the client initiating a request, and the second step involves the server responding with a response. The figure includes explicit authentication and authorization, ensuring secure communication.\nFigure 5.1.1.2-4: Request-response communication paradigm with access control (explicit authentication and authorization)\n-\t\"Request-response with access control\" in implicit authentication and authorization mode: management service consumer initiates a management session towards management service producer.  Management service producer accesses authentication service producer to authenticate the management service consumer according to information in the request, groups and other information associated to the identity of the management service consumer. After successfully being authenticated, the management service consumer sends request to management service producer to access management services, management service producer enforces access control using local policies applicable for the current authentication context\nNOTE:  If Authentication Service Producer is unavailable, MnS Producer may opt to perform local authentication.\nThe figure depicts a request-response communication paradigm with implicit authentication and authorization, illustrating the access control mechanism in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.1.1.2-5: Request-response communication paradigm with access control (implicit authentication and authorization)\n\n",

            "description": "\n\nPrecondition:\nA centralized authentication service producer, e.g. LDAP server, is deployed in operator’s network and will be used by MnS Producer to perform authentication.  MnS Consumer does not interact directly with authenication service producer.\nAuthentication service producer contains authentication information required for MnS Producer to perform authentication such as MnS Consumer identities (including credentials) and/or groups.  The specific information required will depend on the implementation.\nMnS Producer has been configured to use the centralized authentication service producer.\nMnS Producer optionally has support for local authentication, i.e. in event centralized authentication service is unavailable.\nMnS Producer has been configured with access rules, used for local enforcement based on MnS Consumer access privileges.\n\nProcedure:\nSession Initiation:\n101. MnS Consumer initiates a management session towards MnS Producer.  As part of session establishment credentials are exchanged.\n102. Based on credentials in the request, MnS Producer accesses Authentication Service Producer to verify the identity, and information required to perform access control including the associated group(s) of the identity.\n103.  If Authentication Service Producer is unavailable, MnS Producer may opt to perform local authentication.\n104.  If authentication is successful,  MnS Producer sends success response and an authentication context is established between MnS Consumer and MnS Producer.\n105.  If authentication fails, MnS Producer sends failure response to MnS Consumer.\nSession Duration:\n106/7. For each MnS Consumer request, MnS Producer enforces access control using local policies applicable for the current authentication context.\nSession Termination:\n108.  Upon session termination the authentication context is also terminated.\nThe following figure and table show the overview information of 5G specifications which capture corresponding management features:\n\nThe figure depicts an overview of 5G management specifications, highlighting key features such as network slicing, network slicing management, and network slicing security. It also includes a visual representation of the network slicing architecture, with network slices, slices management, and slices security.\nFigure E-1: Overview of 5G management specifications\nIn the figure, some features are generic management features which are applied to management of different network technologies, and some features are 5G specific management features which apply for management of 5G network only. The following table provides the overall 5G management features and the related specification information.\n\n\nThe model driven approach (i.e. usage of CRUD operations specified in TS 28.532 [9] and NRM fragments) can be used to support various types of management capabilities in SBMA. Following is the overview of MnS usage for different types of management capabilities implemented by CRUD operations and an NRM fragment.\nTable F-1: Overview of MnS usage label for different types of management capabilities implemented by CRUD operations and an NRM fragment\n\n",
