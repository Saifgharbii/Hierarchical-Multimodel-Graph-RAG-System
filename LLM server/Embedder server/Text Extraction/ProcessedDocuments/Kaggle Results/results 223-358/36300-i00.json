The eNBs are also connected by means of the S1 interface to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core), more specifically to the MME (Mobility Management Entity) by means of the S1-MME interface and to the Serving Gateway (S-GW) by means of the S1-U interface. The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relation between MMEs / Serving Gateways and eNBs.\nThe E-UTRAN architecture is illustrated in Figure 4 below.\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture of a 5G network, illustrating the multi-path signal propagation, with key components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the fiber-optic backbone architecture with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes.\nFigure 4-1: Overall Architecture\nIf the eNB supports SIPTO@LN with collocated L-GW, it shall support an S5 interface towards the S-GW and an SGi interface towards the IP network. See clause 4.8.2 for the details of the architecture and functions in case SIPTO@LN with collocated L-GW is supported.\nThe E-UTRAN may also comprise LMUs (Location Measurement Unit) (see TS 36.305 [51]) used for Uplink positioning.\nFor NB-IoT the positioning is supported based on the existing LCS architecture.\n",

The diagram includes the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, with key components such as the core switch, optical line terminal (OLT), and distributed nodes.

The figure highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the importance of redundancy paths to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4.6.6-1: E-UTRAN operating with X2 GW - Logical Architecture\nSupport for the X2 GW relies on following principles:\n-\tA HeNB connects to a single X2 GW only. Each HeNB is preconfigured with information about which X2 GW it connects to, e.g. an IP address of the X2 GW.\n-\tThere is no limitation on the number of X2 GWs an eNB may connect to.\n-\tThe X2 GW does not terminate X2AP procedures except for the X2AP Message Transfer procedure, but it initiates the X2 Release procedure and the X2 Error Indication procedure.\n-\tThis version of the specification does not support an interface between two X2 GWs. The routing of X2AP messages via more than one X2 GW (i.e. more than two SCTP hops) is not allowed.\n-\tX2AP contexts only exist in the two peer (H)eNBs (same as without X2 GW). The peer X2AP contexts define an \"X2AP association\" between peer (H)eNBs which spans over two SCTP associations (one per each hop).\n-\tThe X2 GW puts no constraints on the X2 user plane interface (X2-U).\n-\tFor each (H)eNB connected to the X2 GW, the X2 GW maintains the association information, i.e. the mapping of the Global eNB ID to the TNL address(es). The registration procedure, described in Sec. 4.6.6.4, is used to update the association information in the X2 GW.\nIn case of Enhanced TNL Address Discovery is used with the X2 GW, in addition to the procedures specified in clause 22.3.6.1, the following also applies.\n-\tDuring HeNB initiated Enhanced TNL address discovery procedure, the HeNB may include the IP address of the X2 GW to which the HeNB connected in the eNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message thus indicating its X2 GW support capability. Upon the reception of the IP address of the X2 GW, the candidate eNB may include in its reply the received IP address of the X2 GW thus indicating the support of indirect X2 via the indicated X2 GW.\n-\tDuring the eNB or HeNB initiated Enhanced TNL address discovery procedure towards an HeNB, the candidate HeNB may include in its reply the IP address of the X2 GW to which the candidate HeNB connected thus indicating the support of indirect X2 via the indicated X2 GW.\nWhen a (H)eNB sends an X2AP message (except the X2AP X2 MESSAGE TRANSFER message) to a peer node via the X2 GW, the (H)eNB encapsulates the X2AP message in an X2AP X2 MESSAGE TRANSFER message, adds the routing information, then sends the X2AP X2 MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the X2 GW. The routing information includes both Target (H)eNB ID and source (H)eNB ID. The X2 GW routes the message based on the target (H)eNB ID. The source (H)eNB ID is used by the destination (H)eNB node to reply.\nUpon the detection that the signalling (i.e. SCTP) connection to a (H)eNB is unavailable, the X2 GW initiates the X2 Release procedure to inform the relevant (H)eNBs. The relevant (H)eNBs are the ones which had an \"X2AP association\" with this (H)eNB via the X2 GW when the signalling connection became unavailable.\nRegistration of a (H)eNB is performed by initiating the X2AP Message Transfer procedure towards the X2 GW signalling a Source (H)eNB ID, no Target (H)eNB ID, and no X2AP Message in the X2AP MESSAGE TRANSFER message. Upon receipt of this message, the X2 GW saves the association information, i.e. the mapping of the received Global eNB ID to the TNL address(es) of the originating (H)eNB.\n",

Due to the proxy functionality, the DeNB appears as an MME (for S1-MME), an eNB (for X2) and an S-GW (for S1-U) to the RN.\nIn phase II of RN operation (see clause 4.7.6.3), the DeNB also embeds and provides the S-GW/P-GW-like functions needed for the RN operation. This includes creating a session for the RN and managing EPS bearers for the RN, as well as terminating the S11 interface towards the MME serving the RN.\nThe RN and DeNB also perform mapping of signalling and data packets onto EPS bearers that are setup for the RN. The mapping is based on existing QoS mechanisms defined for the UE and the P-GW.\nIn phase II of RN operation (see clause 4.7.6.3), the P-GW functions in the DeNB allocate an IP address for the RN for the O&M which may be different than the S1 IP address of the DeNB.\nIf the RN address is not routable to the RN O&M domain, it shall be reachable from the RN O&M domain (e.g. via NAT).\nThe figure depicts the overall E-UTRAN architecture supporting RNs, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. It includes base stations (BTS), radio access network (RAN), and user equipment (UE) nodes, as well as the optical backbone, which supports the transmission of radio signals. The figure also highlights the use of redundancy paths to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4.7.2-1: Overall E-UTRAN Architecture supporting RNs\n",

The RN may request such a configuration from the DeNB during the RRC connection establishment, and the DeNB may initiate the RRC signalling for such configuration. The RN applies the configuration immediately upon reception;\nNOTE:\tThe RN subframe configuration on the Un interface can be temporarily misaligned with the MBSFN subframes configured in the RN cell due to the RN subframe configuration; i.e. a new subframe configuration can be applied earlier by the RN on Un than in the RN cell.\n-\tthe RRC layer of the Un interface has functionality to send updated system information in a dedicated message to an RN with an RN subframe configuration. The RN applies the received system information immediately;\n-\tthe PDCP layer of the Un interface has functionality to provide integrity protection for the user plane.

It shows the steps involved in attaching a network resource (e.g., a router) to a network interface (e.g., a switch). The figure includes a flowchart and a list of steps, providing a clear and concise visual representation of the procedure.\nFigure 4.7.6.1-1: RN attach procedure\nFigure 4.7.6.2-1 shows a simplified version of the DeNB-initiated bearer activation/modification procedure. This procedure can be used by the DeNB to change the EPS bearer allocation for the RN. The procedure is the same as the normal network-initiated bearer activation/modification procedure TS 23.401 [17] with the exception that the S-GW/P-GW functionality (steps 1 and 6) is performed by the DeNB.\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for decommissioning a bearer in a network, including the initiation of the bearer activation/modification process. The figure includes various steps and components, such as the decommissioning of the bearer, the initiation of the decommissioning process, and the completion of the decommissioning process. The figure is important for network operators to understand the decommissioning process and ensure the proper termination of the bearer.\nFigure 4.7.6.2-1: DeNB-initiated bearer activation/modification procedure\nFigure 4.7.6.3-1 shows a simplified version of the startup procedure for the RN. The procedure is based on the normal UE attach procedure TS 23.401 [17] and it consists of the following two phases:\nI.\tPhase I: Attach for RN preconfiguration.\nThe RN attaches to the E-UTRAN/EPC as a UE at power-up and retrieves initial configuration parameters, including the list of DeNB cells, from RN OAM. After this operation is complete, the RN detaches from the network as a UE and triggers Phase II. The MME performs the S-GW and P-GW selection for the RN as a normal UE.\nII.\tPhase II: Attach for RN operation.\nThe RN connects to a DeNB selected from the list acquired during Phase I to start relay operations. For this purpose, the normal RN attach procedure described in clause 4.7.6.1 is applied. After the DeNB initiates setup of bearer for S1/X2, the RN initiates the setup of S1 and X2 associations with the DeNB (see clause 4.7.4). In addition, the DeNB may initiate an RN reconfiguration procedure via RRC signalling for RN-specific parameters.\nAfter the S1 setup, the DeNB performs the S1 eNB Configuration Update procedure(s), if the configuration data for the DeNB is updated due to the RN attach. After the X2 setup, the DeNB performs the X2 eNB Configuration Update procedure(s) to update the cell information.\nIn this phase the RN cells' ECGIs are configured by RN OAM.\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for the RN 3-1 tartup, which is a crucial step in the optical network's routing and switching process. The figure illustrates the step-by-step process of configuring the network, including the use of routing tables, network protocols, and network protocols. The figure also highlights the importance of network protocols, such as OSPF and OLSFV, in ensuring efficient and reliable network performance.\nFigure 4.7.6.3-1: RN startup procedure\nFigure 4.7.6.4-1 shows a simplified version of the detach procedure for the RN operation in case no UE is connected to the RN cells.\n1.\tThe detach procedure is the same as the normal UE detach procedure TS 23.401 [17].\n2.\tThe DeNB performs the X2 eNB Configuration Update procedure(s) to update the cell information.\n3\tThe DeNB performs the S1 eNB Configuration Update procedure(s), if the configuration data for the DeNB is updated due to the RN detach.\n\nThe figure depicts the RN detach procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's operation. It illustrates the steps involved in removing a node from the network, ensuring that the network remains stable and efficient.\nFigure 4.7.6.4-1: RN detach procedure\nThe X2 eNB Configuration Update procedure (see clause 20.2.2.8) is used by the DeNB to also transfer application level configuration data of a single neighbouring eNB to the RN. Upon reception of an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, if the served cells contained in the message belong to the neighbour eNB rather than the DeNB, the RN shall regard the X2 interface between DeNB and the neighbour eNB as available. The RN will update the X2 availability, the corresponding GU Group ID and other information of the neighbour eNB according to the message.\nIn case of Handover between RN and neighbour eNB, in addition to the procedures specified in clause 10.1.2.1.1, the following also applies.\n-\tThe DeNB may inform the RN of any GUMMEI of the UE's serving MME in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST and S1 HANDOVER REQUEST messages. Considering this information as well as the GU Group ID of the neighbour eNB and the X2 interface availability between DeNB and neighbour eNB, the RN initiates either S1 or X2 handover for the UE. In case the GUMMEI information is not available to the RN, the RN attempts X2 handover for the UE (see clause 19.2.2.5); upon X2 handover failure, S1 handover may be initiated.\n-\tThe S1/X2 HANDOVER REQUEST is received by the DeNB, which reads the target cell ID from the message, finds the target node corresponding to the target cell ID, and forwards the message toward the target node if appropriate.\n",

This transport connection between each RN and its OAM, using IP, is provided by the DeNB; the reference architecture is shown in Figure 4.7.7.1-1. RN OAM traffic is transported over the Un interface, and it shares resources with the rest of the traffic, including UEs attached to the DeNB. The secure connection between the RN and its OAM may be direct or hop-by-hop, i.e. involving intermediate hops trusted by the operator for this purpose.\nThe relay OAM architecture, depicted in Figure 4.7.7.1-1, is a crucial component in the telecommunication network. It enables the efficient transmission of data packets over long distances, ensuring reliable communication. The architecture consists of relay nodes, which are responsible for forwarding data packets to the destination. The relay nodes are equipped with a relaying mechanism that allows them to forward packets to the next hop, reducing the overall latency and improving the network's performance. The relay OAM architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for the addition of new relay nodes as needed. This architecture is an essential part of the telecommunication network, enabling the efficient transmission of data packets over long distances.\nFigure 4.7.7.1-1: Relay OAM architecture.\nIt has to be noted that Figure 4.7.7.1-1 refers to normal operating conditions for the RN, i.e. after the initial start-up phase has been completed. The case where the secure connection between the RN and the OAM does not go through the DeNB, e.g. during the initial start-up phase, is not precluded.\nAlarms in the RN generate bursts of high-priority traffic, to be transported in real time. Traffic counters generate bursts of traffic, but their transport need not be real-time. Configuration messages from OAM to the RN will also generate small bursts of traffic, possibly with lower priority than alarms but still delay-sensitive: when a configuration is committed on the OAM, the time interval between the commitment and the effect on the equipment shall be small.\nAlarm messages and commands should be transported on a high-priority bearer, while counters may be transported on a lower priority bearer. There is no need to specify a new QCI value other than those already standardized.\nAlarm messages and commands may be mapped over a dedicated bearer or over the same bearer that carries S1 and/or X2 messages between the RN and the DeNB.\nOAM software download to the RN may generate larger amounts of data, but both the required data rate and the priority of this kind of traffic are much lower than in the case of alarms, commands and counters. OAM software downloads may be mapped to a dedicated, non-GBR bearer, or transported together with the user plane traffic. If a dedicated bearer is used, it may be present at all times, or its setup may be event-triggered (software upgrades are triggered by the operator).\nRefer to clause D.2.5 of TS 33.401 [22] for details on secure management procedures for RN.\nOAM provides the appropriate support to configure a QCI-to-DSCP mapping function at the relay node which is used to control the mapping in uplink of Uu bearer(s) of different QCI(s) to Un bearer(s).\n",

Three bearer types exist: MCG bearer, SCG bearer and split bearer. Those three bearer types are depicted on Figure 4.9.2-1 below. RRC is located in MeNB and SRBs are always configured as MCG bearer type and therefore only use the radio resources of the MeNB.\nNOTE:\tDC can also be described as having at least one bearer configured to use radio resources provided by the SeNB.\nThe figure depicts a radio protocol architecture for dual connectivity, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The diagram includes a base station (BS), a mobile station (MS), and a relay station (RS), all connected through a radio frequency (RF) link. The figure also shows the use of frequency hopping and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) techniques to ensure reliable communication. The architecture is designed to support both voice and data communication, with the BS and MS operating in separate frequency bands. The RS serves as a relay station, forwarding the data from the MS to the BS. The figure is a visual representation of the radio protocol used in 9.2-1, which is a standard for dual connectivity in the 900 MHz band.\nFigure 4.9.2-1: Radio Protocol Architecture for Dual Connectivity\n",

                            "text_content": "Inter-eNB control plane signalling for DC is performed by means of X2 interface signalling. Control plane signalling towards the MME is performed by means of S1 interface signalling.\nThere is only one S1-MME connection per DC UE between the MeNB and the MME. Each eNB should be able to handle UEs independently, i.e. provide the PCell to some UEs while providing SCell(s) for SCG to others. Each eNB involved in DC for a certain UE controls its radio resources and is primarily responsible for allocating radio resources of its cells. Respective coordination between MeNB and SeNB is performed by means of X2 interface signalling.\nFigure 4.9.3.1-1 shows C-plane connectivity of eNBs involved in DC for a certain UE: the S1-MME is terminated in MeNB and the MeNB and the SeNB are interconnected via X2-C.\nThe figure depicts the connectivity of eNBs involved in Dual Connectivity, showing the C-Plane connectivity of eNBs in the 900 MHz band. The figure illustrates the various eNBs, their respective C-Plane connectivity, and the corresponding 900 MHz frequency bands.\nFigure 4.9.3.1-1: C-Plane connectivity of eNBs involved in Dual Connectivity\nFor dual connectivity two different user plane architectures are allowed: one in which the S1-U only terminates in the MeNB and the user plane data is transferred from MeNB to SeNB using the X2-U, and a second architecture where the S1-U can terminate in the SeNB. Figure 4.9.3.2-1 shows different U-plane connectivity options of eNBs involved in DC for a certain UE.\nDifferent bearer options can be configured with different user plane architectures. U-plane connectivity depends on the bearer option configured:\n-\tFor MCG bearers, the S1-U connection for the corresponding bearer(s) to the S-GW is terminated in the MeNB. The SeNB is not involved in the transport of user plane data for this type of bearer(s) over the Uu.\n-\tFor split bearers, the S1-U connection to the S-GW is terminated in the MeNB. PDCP data is transferred between the MeNB and the SeNB via X2-U. The SeNB and MeNB are involved in transmitting data of this bearer type over the Uu.\n-\tFor SCG bearers, the SeNB is directly connected with the S-GW via S1-U. The MeNB is not involved in the transport of user plane data for this type of bearer(s) over the Uu.\nThe figure depicts the U-Plane connectivity of eNBs involved in Dual Connectivity, highlighting the importance of network slicing and the use of eNBs to provide differentiated services.\nFigure 4.9.3.2-1: U-Plane connectivity of eNBs involved in Dual Connectivity\nNOTE:\tif only MCG and split bearers are configured, there is no S1-U termination in the SeNB.\nThe following scenarios for Dual Connectivity involving HeNBs are supported as listed in Table 4.9.3.3-1.\nTable 4.9.3.3-1: Support of HeNBs for Dual Connectivity\n\nMembership Verification for the hybrid access HeNB is performed between the MeNB and the MME and is based on membership status information reported by the UE and the CSG ID.\nIf the cell served by the SeNB is a shared hybrid cell, the UE reports the subset of the broadcasted PLMN identities passing PLMN ID check and the Permitted CSG list of the UE includes an entry comprising of the concerned PLMN identity and the CSG ID broadcast by the cell served by the SeNB. The MeNB performs PLMN ID check for the PLMNs reported by the UE and selects one if multiple pass the PLMN ID check. If the cell served by the SeNB belongs to a different PLMN than the PLMN serving for the UE in the MeNB, the information provided to the MME for membership verification needs to contain the PLMN-ID of the hybrid cell served by the SeNB as well. Finally the MME verifies the CSG membership according to the received CSG ID, the selected PLMN ID and stored subscription CSG information of the UE.\nIn case the UE has been admitted with SCG resources configured with the split bearer option from a hybrid HeNB and a SeNB Change is performed within the coverage area of the MeNB towards another hybrid HeNB which has the same CSG ID as the first one, the MeNB may re-use the result of the membership verification performed for the first HeNB.\nThis version of the specification supports SIPTO@LN and LIPA for Dual Connectivity according to the following logical architecture:\n-\tSIPTO@LN with co-located L-GW in the MeNB. The MeNB and the MME support the functions described in clause. 4.8.2 with the following change:\n-\tFor SCG bearer option, the MeNB sets GTP TEID and Transport Layer Address in S1 UL GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE in the SENB ADDITION REQUEST message and SENB MODIFICATION REQUEST messages as the correlation ID received from the MME and the IP address of the collocated L-GW respectively.\nThe figure depicts a SIPTO@LN network configuration with co-located L-GW in MeNB, featuring split and SCG bearer options.\nFigure 4.9.3.4-1: SIPTO@LN with co-located L-GW in MeNB – split and SCG bearer options.\n-\tSIPTO@LN with co-located L-GW in the SeNB. For this scenario, only the SCG bearer option is supported for the SIPTO bearer. The SeNB signals its L-GW IP address using the SeNB Addition Preparation procedure, or the MeNB obtains such address via OAM. The MeNB signals the \"SIPTO correlation id\" to the SeNB using the SeNB Addition Preparation and SeNB Modification Preparation procedures. The functions described in clause 4.8.2 are supported with the following changes:\n-\tThe MeNB supports the transfer of the L-GW IP address of SeNB over S1-MME to the EPC within every Uplink NAS Transport procedure;\n-\tThe SeNB supports basic P-GW functions in the collocated L-GW such as support of the SGi interface corresponding to SIPTO@LN;\n-\tAdditional support by the SeNB of first packet sending, buffering of subsequent packets, internal direct L-GW-eNB user path management and in sequence packet delivery to the UE;\n-\tThe SeNB supports the necessary restricted set of S5 procedures corresponding to the support of SIPTO@LN function as specified in TS 23.401 [17];\n-\tThe MeNB supports the notification to the EPC of the L-GW uplink TEID(s) or GRE key(s) for the SIPTO@LN bearer(s) over S5 interface within the restricted set of procedures to be forwarded over S1-MME and further used as \"SIPTO correlation id\" for correlation purposes between the L-GW and the SeNB;\n-\tThe SeNB supports triggering SIPTO@LN PDN connection release by the collocated L-GW after an SeNB change or MeNB to eNB handover is performed.\nThe figure depicts a SIPTO@LN configuration with co-located L-GW in a SeNB, illustrating the use of a co-located L-GW for enhanced network performance and improved reliability.\nFigure 4.9.3.4-2: SIPTO@LN with co-located L-GW in SeNB\n-\tSIPTO@LN with stand-alone gateway: the MeNB and the SeNB belong to the same LHN (i.e. they have the same LHN ID). The MeNB and the SeNB exchange their LHN ID using the X2 Setup procedure or via OAM. The MeNB initiates the SeNB Modification Preparation procedure in order to support the MME-triggered S-GW relocation without UE mobility. The MeNB and the MME support the functions described in Sec. 4.8.3.\n-\tLIPA: the logical architectures for LIPA correspond to the logical architectures for SIPTO@LN with co-located L-GW in the SeNB.\n-\tBefore handover, the MeNB shall initiate the SeNB Modification Preparation procedure or the UE Context Release procedure to release radio and control plane related resources associated to the LIPA bearer.\n",

Nevertheless, existing mechanisms (e.g. barring) may be used to avoid Rel-8/9 UEs to camp on a CC.\nThe spacing between centre frequencies of contiguously aggregated CCs shall be a multiple of 300 kHz. This is in order to be compatible with the 100 kHz frequency raster of Rel-8/9 and at the same time preserve orthogonality of the subcarriers with 15 kHz spacing. Depending on the aggregation scenario, the n  300 kHz spacing can be facilitated by insertion of a low number of unused subcarriers between contiguous CCs.\nFor TDD CA, the downlink/uplink configuration is identical across component carriers in the same band and may be the same or different across component carriers in different bands.\n",

The SAPs between the MAC sublayer and the RLC sublayer provide the logical channels.\n-\tThe multiplexing of several logical channels (i.e. radio bearers) on the same transport channel (i.e. transport block) is performed by the MAC sublayer;\n-\tIn both uplink and downlink, when neither CA nor DC are configured, only one transport block is generated per TTI in the absence of spatial multiplexing;\n-\tIn Sidelink, only one transport block is generated per TTI for each carrier.\nThe figure depicts a layered structure for data link layer (DL) in a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The figure includes the core network, the core network, the core network, and the core network, with each layer represented by different colors and symbols. The figure also shows the various types of nodes, such as base stations (BSs), mobile stations (MSs), and access points (APs), and their respective connections to the core network. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the data link layer in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of this layer in ensuring efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure 6-1: Layer 2 Structure for DL\nThe figure depicts the layer-2 structure for the Universal Radio Access Network (URAN) in the United States, illustrating the various sub-layers and their respective functions.\nFigure 6-2: Layer 2 Structure for UL\nNOTE 1:\tThe eNB may not be able to guarantee that a L2 buffer overflow will never occur. If such overflow occurs, UE may discard packets in the L2 buffer.\nNOTE 2:\tFor a NB-IoT UE that only supports Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisations, as defined in TS 24.301 [20], PDCP is bypassed. For a NB-IoT UE that supports Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation and S1-U data transfer or User Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, as defined in TS 24.301 [20], PDCP is also bypassed (i.e. not used) until AS security is activated.\nThe figure depicts a layered structure for Sidelink, illustrating the various layers and their respective functions. The top layer is the Sidelink Core, responsible for routing and forwarding data packets. The middle layer is the Sidelink Gateway, which acts as a bridge between the Sidelink Core and the network. The bottom layer is the Sidelink Sublayer, which encapsulates the data packets and provides a secure and reliable connection. The figure also includes a diagram of the Sidelink Core, Gateway, and Sublayer, illustrating the interconnection and communication between these components.\nFigure 6-3: Layer 2 Structure for Sidelink\n",

Note that the description here is only intended as an overview and all parameters are therefore not listed in the message flows.\nThe figure depicts a RRC (Remote Radio Head) connection in an EPS (Enhanced Packet System) network, illustrating the process of suspending the connection in the event of a failure. The figure shows the RRC connection, which is a critical component of the network, suspended in the event of a failure. The figure also shows the connection's status, indicating whether it is active or suspended, and the status of the RRC connection itself. The figure provides a visual representation of the RRC connection's status and the steps involved in suspending it in the event of a failure.\nFigure 7.3a.3-1: RRC Connection Suspend procedure in EPS\nThe figure depicts a RRC (Remote Radio Head) connection in a 5G network, illustrating the process of suspending the connection when the RRC is not in use. The figure shows the RRC connection, the associated RRC interface, and the RRC connection status. The RRC connection is suspended when the RRC interface is not in use, and the status is displayed as \"off\" to indicate that the connection is not currently active.\nFigure 7.3a.3-1a: RRC Connection Suspend procedure in 5GS\n1.\tDue to some triggers, e.g. the expiry of a UE inactivity timer, the (ng-)eNB decides to suspend the RRC connection.\n2.\tIn EPS, the eNB initiates the S1-AP UE Context Suspend procedure to inform the MME that the RRC connection is being suspended. In 5GS, the ng-eNB initiates the NG-AP UE Context Suspend procedure to inform the AMF that the RRC connection is being suspended.\n3.\tIn EPS, the MME requests the S-GW to release all S1-U bearers for the UE. In 5GS, the AMF requests the SMF to suspend the PDU session and the SMF requests the UPF to release the tunnel information for the UE.\n4.\tMME/AMF Acks step 2.\n5.\tThe (ng-)eNB suspends the RRC connection by sending an RRCConnectionRelease message with the releaseCause set to rrc-Suspend. For EPS, the message includes the Resume ID which is stored by the UE and optionally, for EDT and transmission using PUR, the message also includes the NextHopChainingCount which is stored by the UE. For 5GS, the message includes the I-RNTI and NextHopChainingCount which are stored by the UE.\n6.\tThe UE stores the AS context, suspends all SRBs and DRBs, and enters RRC_IDLE.\nThe figure depicts the RRC (Remote Radio Head) connection resume procedure in EPS (Enhanced Packet System), which is a crucial component of the network's data transmission. The figure illustrates the steps involved in resuming the connection after a temporary interruption, including the identification of the RRC, the initiation of the connection, and the subsequent transmission of data. The figure's layout and color-coding help to clearly distinguish between different components and facilitate easy understanding of the process.\nFigure 7.3a.3-2: RRC Connection Resume procedure in EPS\nThe figure depicts the RRC (Remote Radio Head) connection resume procedure in 5G, illustrating the steps taken to reestablish communication after a disruption. The figure shows the RRC connection in a state of disconnection, with the signal strength at 0 dB, and the steps to reestablish the connection are shown in a step-by-step manner. The figure also includes a visual representation of the RRC connection, with the signal strength at 0 dB, and the steps to reestablish the connection are shown in a step-by-step manner.\nFigure 7.3a.3-2a: RRC Connection Resume procedure in 5GS\n1.\tAt some later point in time (e.g. when the UE is being paged or when new data arrives in the uplink buffer) the UE resumes the connection by sending an RRCConnectionResumeRequest to the (ng-)eNB. The UE includes its Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS), the establishment cause, and authentication token. The authentication token is calculated in the same way as the short MAC-I used in RRC connection re-establishment and allows the (ng-)eNB to verify the UE identity. For 5GS, the UE resumes SRB1, derives new security keys using the NextHopChainingCount provided in the RRCConnectionRelease message of the previous RRC connection and re-establishes the AS security.\n2.\tProvided that the Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS) exists and the authentication token is successfully validated, the (ng-)eNB responds with an RRCConnectionResume. For EPS, the message includes the Next Hop Chaining Count (NCC) value which is required in order to re-establish the AS security.\n3.\tFor EPS, the UE resumes all SRBs and DRBs and re-establishes the AS security. For 5GS, the UE resumes all other SRBs and all DRBs. The UE is now in RRC_CONNECTED.\n4.\tThe UE responds with an RRCConnectionResumeComplete confirming that the RRC connection was resumed successfully, along with an uplink Buffer Status Report, and/or UL data, whenever possible, to the (ng-)eNB.\n5.\tFor EPS, the eNB initiates the S1-AP Context Resume procedure to notify the MME about the UE state change. For 5GS, the ng-eNB initiates the NG-AP Context Resume procedure to notify the AMF about the UE state change.\n6.\tFor EPS, the MME requests the S-GW to activate the S1-U bearers for the UE. For 5GS, the AMF requests the SMF to resume the PDU session and the SMF requests the UPF to establish the tunnel information for the UE.\n7.\tMME/AMF Acks step 5.\nAn RRC connection can also be resumed in an (ng-)eNB (the new (ng-)eNB) different from the one where the connection was suspended (the old (ng-)eNB). Inter (ng-)eNB connection resumption is handled using context fetching, whereby the new (ng-)eNB retrieves the UE context from the old (ng-)eNB over the X2/Xn interface. The new (ng-)eNB provides the Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS) which is used by the old (ng-)eNB to identify the UE context. This is illustrated in Figure 7.3a.3-3/7.3a.3-3a.\nThe figure depicts the RRC (Remote Radio Head) connection resume procedure in different eNB (Evolved Packet Core) in EPS (Evolved Packet System). It illustrates the steps taken by the eNB to reconnect to the RRC after a failure, including the use of the RRC connection manager and the RRC connection manager's response. The figure also shows the RRC connection manager's response to the eNB's request for connection, and the eNB's response to the RRC connection manager's response.\nFigure 7.3a.3-3: RRC Connection Resume procedure in different eNB in EPS\nThe figure depicts the RRC (Remote Radio Head) connection resume procedure in different 5G New Radio (NR) eNB (Evolved Netback) scenarios. It illustrates the steps taken to resume the connection after a failure, including the use of the RRC, which is a crucial component in ensuring network reliability and performance. The figure provides a visual representation of the RRC connection resume process, highlighting the importance of this step in the overall network architecture.\nFigure 7.3a.3-3a: RRC Connection Resume procedure in different ng-eNB in 5GS\n1.\tSame as step 1 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n2.\tThe new (ng-)eNB locates the old (ng-)eNB using the Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS) and retrieves the UE context by means of the X2-AP (for EPS) or Xn-AP (for 5GS) Retrieve UE Context procedure.\n3.\tThe old (ng-)eNB responds with the UE context associated with the Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS).\n4.\tSame as step 2 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n5.\tSame as step 3 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n6.\tSame as step 4 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n7.\tFor EPS, the new eNB initiates the S1-AP Path Switch procedure to establish a S1 UE associated signalling connection to the serving MME and to request the MME to resume the UE context. For 5GS, the new ng-eNB initiates the NG-AP Path Switch procedure to establish a NG UE associated signalling connection to the serving AMF and to request the AMF to resume the UE context.\n8.\tFor EPS, the MME requests the S-GW to activate the S1-U bearers for the UE and updates the downlink path. For 5GS, the AMF requests the SMF to resume the PDU session and the SMF requests the UPF to create the tunnel information for the UE and update the downlink path.\n9.\tMME/AMF Acks step 7.\n10.\tFor EPS, after the S1-AP Path Switch procedure the new eNB triggers release of the UE context at the old eNB by means of the X2-AP UE Context Release procedure. For 5GS, after the NG-AP Path Switch procedure the new ng-eNB triggers release of the UE context at the old ng-eNB by means of the Xn-AP UE Context Release procedure.\nFor a NB-IoT UE that supports Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation and S1-U data transfer or User Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, as defined in TS 24.301 [20], and for a NB-IoT UE that supports Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and NG-U data transfer or User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, as defined in TS 24.501 [91], PDCP is not used until AS security is activated.\n",

The MO- EDT is a decision tree-based optimization algorithm that aims to find the best solution for the Quality of Service (QoS) metric, which is a measure of the reliability and performance of a wireless network. The figure shows the MO- EDT algorithm with its decision nodes and the optimization process, which involves selecting the best solution from a set of candidate solutions based on the QoS metric. The figure also includes the EPS (Evolutionary Optimization for Quality of Service) metric, which is a measure of the reliability and performance of the wireless network. The figure provides a visual representation of the MO- EDT algorithm and its optimization process, which can be used to understand the process and its effectiveness in improving the QoS of wireless networks.\nFigure 7.3b-2: MO-EDT for User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\n0.\tUpon connection resumption request for Mobile Originated data from the upper layers, the UE initiates the MO-EDT procedure and selects a random access preamble configured for EDT.\n1.\tThe UE sends an RRCConnectionResumeRequest to the eNB, including its Resume ID, the establishment cause, and an authentication token. The UE resumes all SRBs and DRBs, derives new security keys using the NextHopChainingCount provided in the RRCConnectionRelease message of the previous RRC connection and re-establishes the AS security. The user data are ciphered and transmitted on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionResumeRequest message on CCCH.

The message includes the releaseCause set to rrc-Suspend, the resumeID, the NextHopChainingCount and drb-ContinueROHC which are stored by the UE. If downlink data were received in step 6, they are sent ciphered on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionRelease message on DCCH. The procedure ends with the reception of the HARQ feedback (ARQ) acknowledging the successful DL transmission.\nThe MO-EDT procedure for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is illustrated in Figure 7.3b-2a.\nThe figure depicts a MO-EDT (Multi-Objective Evolutionary Decision Tree) for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, which is a technique used in network optimization to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. The MO-EDT is a decision tree-based optimization algorithm that considers multiple objectives, such as latency, throughput, and energy efficiency, to make informed decisions about network configuration. The figure shows the tree structure and the decision points, which are used to select the optimal configuration for the network. The optimization process is iterative, with each decision point leading to a better solution than the previous one. The figure is important for network engineers and operators to understand the trade-offs and constraints involved in optimizing wireless communication systems.\nFigure 7.3b-2a: MO-EDT for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation\n0.\tUpon connection resumption request for Mobile Originated data from the upper layers, the UE initiates the MO-EDT procedure and selects a random access preamble configured for EDT.\n1.\tThe UE sends an RRCConnectionResumeRequest to the ng-eNB, including its I-RNTI, the resume cause, and an authentication token. The UE resumes all SRBs and DRBs, derives new security keys using the NextHopChainingCount provided in the RRCConnectionRelease message of the previous connection and re-establishes the AS security. The user data are ciphered and transmitted on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionResumeRequest message on CCCH. The UE may indicate AS Release Assistance Information.\n2.\tThe uplink data are delivered to the UPF.\n3.\tThe ng-eNB sends a NG-AP Context Resume Request message to the AMF to resume the connection. If the UE included AS Release Assistance information indicating No further UL/DL higher layer PDU in step 1, ng-eNB may request for immediate transition to RRC IDLE with Suspend.\n4.\tIf the AMF does not receive a request for immediate transition to RRC IDLE with Suspend in step 3 or the AMF is aware of downlink data or signalling pending, the AMF requests the SMF to resume the PDU session.\n5.\tThe AMF sends a NG-AP Context Resume Response to the ng-eNB. If the AMF receives a request for immediate transition to RRC IDLE with Suspend in step 3 and there is no downlink data or signalling pending, the AMF includes a Suspend indication, and keeps the UE in CM-IDLE with Suspend.\n6.\tIf the AMF includes Suspend indication in step 5, the ng-eNB proceeds to step 8. If the AMF does not include Suspend indication and the UE included AS Release Assistance information indicating Only a single Downlink Data transmission subsequent to the Uplink transmission in step 1, the ng-eNB may wait for the DL data to arrive, and proceeds to step 7.\n7\tThe ng-eNB initiates the NG-AP UE Context Suspend procedure to inform the AMF that the RRC connection is being suspended. The AMF requests the SMF to suspend the PDU session and the SMF requests the UPF to release the tunnel information for the UE.\n8.\tThe eNB sends the RRCConnectionRelease message to keep the UE in RRC_IDLE. The message includes the releaseCause set to rrc-Suspend, the I-RNTI, the NextHopChainingCount and drb-ContinueROHC which are stored by the UE. If downlink data were received in step 6, they are sent ciphered on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionRelease message on DCCH. The procedure ends with the reception of the HARQ feedback (ARQ) acknowledging the successful DL transmission.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the MME/AMF or (ng-)eNB decides the UE to move in RRC_CONNECTED mode, RRCConnectionResume message is sent in step 7 to fall back to the RRC Connection resume procedure. In that case, the RRCConnectionResume message is integrity protected and ciphered with the keys derived in step 1 and the UE ignores the NextHopChainingCount included in the RRCConnectionResume message. Downlink data can be transmitted on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionResume message. In addition, an RRCConnectionSetup can also be sent in step 7 to fall back to the RRC Connection establishment procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tIf neither RRCConnectionRelease nor, in case of fallback, RRCConnectionResume is received in response to RRCConnectionResumeRequest for MO-EDT, the UE considers the UL data transmission not successful.\nFor MO-EDT for User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, an RRC connection can also be resumed in an (ng-)eNB (the new (ng-)eNB) different from the one where the connection was suspended (the old (ng-)eNB). Inter (ng-)eNB connection resumption is handled using context fetching, whereby the new (ng-)eNB retrieves the UE context from the old (ng-)eNB over the X2 (Xn) interface. The new (ng-)eNB provides the Resume ID for EPS or I-RNTI for 5GS which is used by the old (ng-)eNB to identify the UE context. This is illustrated in Figure 7.3b-3 and Figure 7.3b-3a for the case of User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and for the case of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation respectively.\nThe figure depicts a MO- EDT (Multi-Objective Evolutionary Decision Tree) for User Plane CIoT EPS (Evolutionary Optimization for Quality of Service) in different eNB (Evolved Node B) scenarios, illustrating the optimization process for enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) in the user plane. The figure highlights the importance of considering various factors such as network capacity, latency, and reliability when optimizing the EPS.\nFigure: 7.3b-3: MO-EDT for User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisations in different eNB\nThe figure depicts a MO-EDT (Multi-Operator Edge Device) for User Plane CIoT (Customer Intelligence and Optimization) in different 5G New Radio (5G NR) network environments. It illustrates the MO-EDT's role in optimizing user plane traffic, highlighting its importance in ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure also highlights the use of different 5G NR technologies, such as Massive MIMO (Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output) and Massive MIMO with Beamforming (MIMO-B), to enhance the network's capacity and performance.\nFigure: 7.3b-3a: MO-EDT for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in different ng-eNB\n1.\tSame as step 1 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n2.\tThe new (ng-)eNB locates the old (ng-)eNB using the Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS) and retrieves the UE context by means of the X2-AP (for EPS) or Xn-AP (for 5GS) Retrieve UE Context procedure.\n3.\tThe old (ng-)eNB responds with the UE context associated with the Resume ID (for EPS) or I-RNTI (for 5GS).\n4.\tFor EPS, the new eNB initiates the S1-AP Path Switch procedure to establish a S1 UE associated signalling connection to the serving MME and to request the MME to resume the UE context. For 5GS, the new ng-eNB initiates the NG-AP Path Switch procedure to establish a NG UE associated signalling connection to the serving AMF and to request the AMF to resume the UE context.\n5.\tFor EPS, the MME requests the S-GW to activate the S1-U bearers for the UE and updates the downlink path. For 5GS, the AMF requests requests the SMF to resume the PDU session and the SMF requests the UPF to create the tunnel information for the UE and update the downlink path.\n6.\tMME/AMF Acks step 5.\n7.\tFor EPS, after the S1-AP Path Switch procedure the new eNB triggers release of the UE context at the old eNB by means of the X2-AP UE Context Release procedure. For 5GS, after the NG-AP Path Switch procedure the new ng-eNB triggers release of the UE context at the old ng-eNB by means of the Xn-AP UE Context Release procedure.\n8.\tFor EPS, same as step 5 in the intra eNB connection resumption. For 5GS, the uplink data are delivered to the UPF.\n9.\tSame as step 6 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n10.\tSame as step 7 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n11.\tSame as step 8 in the intra (ng-)eNB connection resumption.\n",

of SystemInformationBlocks-NB (SIBs-NB):\n-\tMasterInformationBlock-NB defines the most essential information of the cell required to receive further system information;\n-\tSystemInformationBlockType1-NB contains information relevant when evaluating if a UE is allowed to access a cell and defines the scheduling of other system information

for accessing an NTN cell;\n-\tSystemInformationBlockType32-NB contains assistance information for discontinuous coverage in NTN;\n-\tSystemInformationBlockType33-NB contains assistance information for neighbouring cells in NTN.\nOn MBMS-dedicated cell, only system information relevant for receiving MBMS service is broadcasted. MasterInformationBlock-MBMS (MIB-MBMS) and SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS (SIB1-MBMS) are used instead of MIB and SIB1 respectively:\n-\tMasterInformationBlock-MBMS defines the most essential physical layer information of the cell required to receive further system information on MBMS-dedicated cell;\n-\tSystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS contains information relevant for receiving MBMS service and defines the scheduling of other system information blocks on MBMS-dedicated cell;\nThe MIB is mapped on the BCCH and carried on BCH while all other SI messages are mapped on the BCCH and BR-BCCH, and carried on DL-SCH. Except for BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs, all other SI messages than the MIB which are dynamically carried on DL-SCH, can be identified through the SI-RNTI (System Information RNTI). Both the MIB and SystemInformationBlockType1 (SystemInformationBlockType1-BR for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage) use a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 and 80 ms respectively. The scheduling of other SI messages is flexible and indicated by SystemInformationBlockType1 (SystemInformationBlockType1-BR for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage, and SystemInformationBlockType1-NB for NB-IoT). For NB-IoT, the MIB-NB is mapped on the BCCH and carried on BCH while all other SI messages are mapped on the BCCH and carried on DL-SCH. Both the MIB-NB and SystemInformationBlockType1-NB use a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 640 and 2560 ms respectively. The MIB-NB contains all information required to acquire SIB1-NB and SIB1-NB contains all information required to acquire other SI messages.\nOn MBMS-dedicated cell, the MIB-MBMS and SIB1-MBMS use a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms. Additionally, SIB1-MBMS may be scheduled in additional non-MBSFN subframes indicated in MIB-MBMS.\nFor NB-IoT, in TDD mode, the MIB-TDD-NB is transmitted on the same NB-IoT carrier as NPSS/NSSS, SystemInformationBlockType1-NB can be transmitted on NB-IoT carrier other than the MIB-NB, and the SI messages can be transmitted on a NB-IoT carrier other than the MIB-NB. At most two NB-IoT carriers are used to transmit the MIB-NB, SystemInformationBlockType1-NB and the SI messages.\nExcept for NB-IoT, the eNB may schedule DL-SCH transmissions concerning logical channels other than BCCH or BR-BCCH in the same subframe as used for BCCH or BR-BCCH. The minimum UE capability restricts the BCCH or BR-BCCH mapped to DL-SCH e.g. regarding the maximum rate.\nThe Paging message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. For NB-IoT UEs, BL UEs, and UEs in CE, the UE is not required to detect SIB changes when in RRC_CONNECTED, and the network may release the NB-IoT UE, BL UE or UE in CE to RRC_IDLE if it wants the NB-IoT UE, BL UE or UE in CE to acquire changed SIB(s).\nExcept for NB-IoT, system information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated signalling e.g. upon handover.\n",

At RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides the NAS mobility information (e.g. TAI), and at RRC connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides the security input. This cell is referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell). In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to the PCell is the Downlink Primary Component Carrier (DL PCC) while in the uplink it is the Uplink Primary Component Carrier (UL PCC).\nDepending on UE capabilities, Secondary Cells (SCells) can be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells. In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to an SCell is a Downlink Secondary Component Carrier (DL SCC) while in the uplink it is an Uplink Secondary Component Carrier (UL SCC).\nThe configured set of serving cells for a UE therefore always consists of one PCell and one or more SCells:\n-\tFor each SCell the usage of uplink resources by the UE in addition to the downlink ones is configurable (the number of DL SCCs configured is therefore always larger than or equal to the number of UL SCCs and no SCell can be configured for usage of uplink resources only);\n-\tAn SCell may be configured to start in either deactivated, dormant or activated mode;\n-\tFrom a UE viewpoint, each uplink resource only belongs to one serving cell;\n-\tThe number of serving cells that can be configured depends on the aggregation capability of the UE (see clause 5.5);\n-\tPCell can only be changed with handover procedure (i.e. with security key change and, unless RACH-less HO is configured, with RACH procedure);\n-\tPCell is used for transmission of PUCCH;\n-\tIf DC is not configured one additional PUCCH can be configured on an SCell, the PUCCH SCell;\n-\tUnlike SCells, PCell cannot be de-activated or be in dormant SCell state (see clause 11.2);\n-\tRe-establishment is triggered when PCell experiences RLF, not when SCells experience RLF;\n-\tNAS information is taken from PCell.\nThe reconfiguration, addition and removal of SCells can be performed by RRC. During connection resume from suspended RRC connection or from RRC_INACTIVE, the network may decide to keep or release any previously configured SCells from the UE context. At intra-LTE handover and during connection resume from RRC_INACTIVE, the network can also add, remove, or reconfigure SCells for usage with the target PCell. When adding a new SCell, dedicated RRC signalling is used for sending all required system information of the SCell i.e. while in connected mode, UEs need not acquire broadcasted system information directly from the SCells. A common configuration, applicable for multiple SCells, may be provided in addition to dedicated SCell configuration.\nWhen a PUCCH SCell is configured, RRC configures the mapping of each serving cell to Primary PUCCH group or Secondary PUCCH group, i.e., for each SCell whether the PCell or the PUCCH SCell is used for the transmission of ACK/NAKs and CSI reports. A PUCCH SCell cannot be in dormant state.\nFor LAA SCell the following additional principles are applied:\n-\tThe eNB can configure whether the data of a logical channel can be transferred via LAA SCells.\n",

Cell selection is required on transition from EMM_DETACHED to EMM-REGISTERED and from ECM-IDLE or ECM-CONNECTED.\nCell selection:\n-\tThe UE NAS layer identifies a selected PLMN and equivalent PLMNs;\n-\tThe UE searches the E-UTRA frequency bands and for each carrier frequency identifies the strongest cell. It reads cell system information broadcast to identify its PLMN(s):\n-\tThe UE may search each carrier in turn (\"initial cell selection\") or make use of stored information to shorten the search (\"stored information cell selection\").\n-\tThe UE seeks to identify a suitable cell; if it is not able to identify a suitable cell it seeks to identify an acceptable cell. When a suitable cell is found or if only an acceptable cell is found it camps on that cell and commence the cell reselection procedure:\n-\tA suitable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes satisfy the cell selection criteria; the cell PLMN is the selected PLMN, registered or an equivalent PLMN; the cell is not barred or reserved and the cell is not part of a tracking area which is in the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\";\n-\tAn acceptable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes satisfy the cell selection criteria and the cell is not barred.\nTransition to RRC_IDLE:\nOn transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE, a UE should camp on the last cell for which it was in RRC_CONNECTED or a cell/any cell of set of cells or frequency be assigned by RRC in the state transition message.\nRecovery from out of coverage:\nThe UE should attempt to find a suitable cell in the manner described for stored information or initial cell selection above. If no suitable cell is found on any frequency or RAT the UE should attempt to find an acceptable cell.\nA UE in RRC_IDLE performs cell reselection. The principles of the procedure are the following:\n-\tThe UE makes measurements of attributes of the serving and neighbour cells to enable the reselection process:\n-\tThere is no need to indicate neighbouring cells in the serving cell system information to enable the UE to search and measure a cell i.e. E-UTRAN relies on the UE to detect the neighbouring cells;\n-\tFor the search and measurement of inter-frequency neighbouring cells, only the carrier frequencies need to be indicated;\n-\tMeasurements may be omitted if the serving cell attribute fulfils particular search or measurement criteria.\n-\tCell reselection identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It is based on cell reselection criteria which involves measurements of the serving and neighbour cells, except for NB-IoT:\n-\tIntra-frequency reselection is based on ranking of cells;\n-\tInter-frequency reselection is based on absolute priorities where a UE tries to camp on the highest priority frequency available. Absolute priorities for reselection are provided only by the RPLMN and are valid only within the RPLMN; priorities are given by the system information and are valid for all UEs in a cell, specific priorities per UE can be signalled in the RRC Connection Release message. A validity time can be associated with UE specific priorities.\n-\tInter-frequency E-UTRAN reselection can be also based on redistribution priority. A UE may be redistributed to a redistribution target (frequency or cell) and will consider the redistribution target (frequency or cell) as having the highest priority (i.e. higher than any network configured priority) for a period of time (i.e. validity timer). The redistribution parameters are defined in system information and can be triggered by Paging.\n-\tFor inter-frequency neighbouring cells, it is possible to indicate layer-specific cell reselection parameters (e.g., layer specific offset). These parameters are common to all neighbouring cells on a frequency;\n-\tAn NCL can be provided by the serving cell to handle specific cases for intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells. This NCL contains cell specific cell reselection parameters (e.g., cell specific offset) for specific neighbouring cells;\n-\tExclude-lists can be provided to prevent the UE from reselecting to specific intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;\n-\tCell reselection can be speed dependent (speed detection based on UTRAN solution);\n-\tCell reselection parameters are applicable for all UEs in a cell, but it is possible to configure specific reselection parameters per UE group or per UE.\nFor NB-IoT, cell reselection identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It is based on cell reselection criteria which involve measurements of the serving and neighbour cells as follows:\n-\tIntra-frequency reselection is based on ranking of cells (potentially with cell specific offsets);\n-\tInter-frequency reselection is based on ranking of frequencies (potentially with frequency specific offsets);\n-\tBlind redirection supported for load balancing (potentially with a dedicated offset for the frequency where the UE is redirected to).\nCell access restrictions apply as for UTRAN, which consist of access class (AC) barring and cell reservation (e.g. for cells \"reserved for operator use\") applicable for mobiles in RRC_IDLE mode. For NB-IoT UEs, BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, E-UTRAN can also restrict access to the cell based on the level of coverage enhancements that would be needed by the UE.\n",

A non-gap assisted measurement is a measurement on a cell that does not require transmission/reception gaps to allow the measurement to be performed. A gap assisted measurement is a measurement on a cell that does require transmission/reception gaps to allow the measurement to be performed.

If the UE does not receive the preallocated uplink grant in the RRC message from the source eNB, the UE monitors the PDCCH of the target cell;\n-\tIf DAPS handover is configured, the UE continues the downlink user data reception from the source eNB until releasing the source cell and continues the uplink user data transmission to the source eNB until successful random access procedure to the target eNB.

Any other configured serving cells, NR sidelink configurations and V2X sidelink configurations are released by the network before the handover command is sent to the UE.\nNOTE:\tVoid.\n-\tIf the access towards the target cell (using RACH or RACH-less procedure) is not successful within a certain time, the UE initiates radio link failure recovery using a suitable cell except in DAPS handover or CHO scenarios:\n-\tWhen DAPS handover fails, the UE falls back to source cell configuration, resumes the connection with source cell, and reports the DAPS handover failure via the source without triggering RRC connection re-establishment if the source link is still available; Otherwise, RRC re-establishment is performed;\n-\tWhen initial CHO execution attempt fails or Handover fails, if network configured the UE to try CHO after HO/CHO failure and the UE performs cell selection to a CHO candidate cell, the UE attempts CHO execution to that cell; Otherwise, RRC re-establishment is performed.\n-\tNo ROHC and EHC context is transferred at handover;\n-\tNo UDC context is transferred at handover;\n-\tROHC and EHC contexts can be kept at handover within the same eNB.\nThe preparation and execution phase of the HO procedure is performed without EPC involvement, i.e. preparation messages are directly exchanged between the eNBs. The release of the resources at the source side during the HO completion phase is triggered by the eNB. In case an RN is involved, its DeNB relays the appropriate S1 messages between the RN and the MME (S1-based handover) and X2 messages between the RN and target eNB (X2-based handover); the DeNB is explicitly aware of a UE attached to the RN due to the S1 proxy and X2 proxy functionality (see clause 4.7.6.6). The figure below depicts the basic handover scenario where neither MME nor Serving Gateway changes:\nThe figure depicts a network topology with multiple MME/Serving Gateway HO (Hierarchical Overlay Networks) and inter-MME/Serving Gateway connections. The network is designed to support high-speed data transmission and is equipped with redundant paths to ensure reliability.\nFigure 10.1.2.1.1-1: Intra-MME/Serving Gateway HO\nBelow is a more detailed description of the intra-MME/Serving Gateway HO procedure:\n0\tThe UE context within the source eNB contains information regarding roaming and access restrictions which were provided either at connection establishment or at the last TA update.\n1\tThe source eNB configures the UE measurement procedures according to the roaming and access restriction information and e.g. the available multiple frequency band information. Measurements provided by the source eNB may assist the function controlling the UE's connection mobility.\n2\tA MEASUREMENT REPORT is triggered and sent to the eNB.\n3\tThe source eNB makes decision based on MEASUREMENT REPORT and RRM information to hand off the UE.\n4\tThe source eNB issues a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target eNB passing necessary information to prepare the HO at the target side (UE X2 signalling context reference at source eNB, UE S1 EPC signalling context reference, target cell ID, KeNB*, RRC context including the C-RNTI of the UE in the source eNB, AS-configuration, E-RAB context and physical layer ID of the source cell + short MAC-I for possible RLF recovery). The source eNB may also request a DAPS Handover for one or more E-RABs. UE X2 / UE S1 signalling references enable the target eNB to address the source eNB and the EPC. The E-RAB context includes necessary RNL and TNL addressing information, and QoS profiles of the E-RABs.\n5\tAdmission Control may be performed by the target eNB dependent on the received E-RAB QoS information to increase the likelihood of a successful HO, if the resources can be granted by target eNB. The target eNB configures the required resources according to the received E-RAB QoS information and reserves a C-RNTI and optionally a RACH preamble. The AS-configuration to be used in the target cell can either be specified independently (i.e. an \"establishment\") or as a delta compared to the AS-configuration used in the source cell (i.e. a \"reconfiguration\").\n6\tThe target eNB prepares HO with L1/L2 and sends the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE to the source eNB. The HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message includes a transparent container to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform the handover. The container includes a new C-RNTI, target eNB security algorithm identifiers for the selected security algorithms, may include a dedicated RACH preamble, and possibly some other parameters i.e. access parameters, SIBs, etc. If RACH-less HO is configured, the container includes timing adjustment indication and optionally a preallocated uplink grant. The HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message may also include RNL/TNL information for the forwarding tunnels, if necessary. The target eNB also indicates if a DAPS Handover is accepted.\nNOTE 1:\tAs soon as the source eNB receives the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE, or as soon as the transmission of the handover command is initiated in the downlink, data forwarding may be initiated.\nNOTE 1a:\tFor E-RABs configured with DAPS, downlink PDCP SDUs are forwarded with SN assigned by the source eNB, until SN assignment is handed over to the target eNB in step 11b, for which the normal data forwarding follows as defined in 10.1.2.3.\nSteps 7 to 16 provide means to avoid data loss during HO and are further detailed in 10.1.2.1.2 and 10.1.2.3.\n7\tThe target eNB generates the RRC message to perform the handover, i.e. RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfo, to be sent by the source eNB towards the UE. The source eNB performs the necessary integrity protection and ciphering of the message.\n\nThe UE receives the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with necessary parameters (i.e. new C-RNTI, target eNB security algorithm identifiers, and optionally dedicated RACH preamble, target eNB SIBs, etc.) and is commanded by the source eNB to perform the HO. If RACH-less HO is configured, the RRCConnectionReconfiguration includes timing adjustment indication and optionally preallocated uplink grant for accessing the target eNB. If preallocated uplink grant is not included, the UE should monitor PDCCH of the target eNB to receive an uplink grant. The UE does not need to delay the handover execution for delivering the HARQ/ARQ responses to source eNB.\n\nIf Make-Before-Break HO is configured, the connection to the source cell is maintained after the reception of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with mobilityControlInfo before the UE executes initial uplink transmission to the target cell.\nNOTE 2:\tIf Make-Before-Break HO is configured, the source eNB decides when to stop transmitting to the UE.\nNOTE 3:\tThe UE can be configured with Make-Before-Break HO and RACH-less HO simultaneously.\nIn case of DAPS Handover, the UE does not detach from the source cell upon receiving the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. The UE releases the source SRB resources, security configuration of the source cell and stops DL/UL reception/transmission with the source upon receiving an explicit release from the target node.\nNOTE 3a:\tThe DAPS Handover is considered to only be completed after the UE has released the source cell as explicitly requested from the target node. Features that cannot be configured simultaneously with DAPS Handover (CA, DC, EHC, UDC and CHO) can be configured earliest in the same RRCConnectionReconfiguration message that releases the source cell. RRC suspend, a subsequent handover or inter-RAT handover cannot be initiated until the source cell has been released.\nNOTE 4:\tCA, DC, EHC, UDC, CHO or RACH-less HO cannot be configured simultaneously with DAPS Handover and must be released by the source eNB before the DAPS Handover command is sent to the UE.\nNOTE 5:\tFor E-RABs configured with DAPS, the source eNB does not stop transmitting downlink packets until it receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message from the target eNB in step 11a.\n8a\tFor E-RABs configured with DAPS, the source eNB sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message. The DL COUNT value conveyed in the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message indicates PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source eNB forwards to the target eNB. The source eNB does not stop assigning PDCP SNs to downlink packets until it sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target eNB in step 11b.\n8\tFor E-RABs not configured with DAPS, the source eNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target eNB to convey the uplink PDCP SN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter status of E-RABs for which PDCP status preservation applies (i.e. for RLC AM). The uplink PDCP SN receiver status includes at least the PDCP SN of the first missing UL SDU and may include a bit map of the receive status of the out of sequence UL SDUs that the UE needs to retransmit in the target cell, if there are any such SDUs. The downlink PDCP SN transmitter status indicates the next PDCP SN that the target eNB shall assign to new SDUs, not having a PDCP SN yet. The source eNB may omit sending this message if none of the E-RABs of the UE shall be treated with PDCP status preservation.\nNOTE 6:\tIn case of DAPS Handover, the uplink PDCP SN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter status for an E-RAB with RLC-AM and not configured with DAPS may be transferred by the SN STATUS TRANSFER message in step 11b instead of step 8.\nNOTE 7:\tFor E-RABs configured with DAPS, the source eNB may additionally send the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message(s) between step 8 and step 11b, to inform discarding of already forwarded PDCP SDUs. The target eNB does not transmit forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs to the UE whose COUNT is less than the conveyed DL COUNT value and discards them if transmission has not been attempted already.\n9\tIf RACH-less HO is not configured, after receiving the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfo, UE performs synchronisation to target eNB and accesses the target cell via RACH, following a contention-free procedure if a dedicated RACH preamble was indicated in the mobilityControlInfo, or following a contention-based procedure if no dedicated preamble was indicated. UE derives target eNB specific keys and configures the selected security algorithms to be used in the target cell. \n\nIf RACH-less HO is configured, UE performs synchronisation to target eNB. UE derives target eNB specific keys and configures the selected security algorithms to be used in the target cell.\n10\tIf RACH-less HO is not configured, the target eNB responds with UL allocation and timing advance.\n10a If RACH-less HO is configured and the UE did not get the periodic pre-allocated uplink grant in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfo, the UE receives uplink grant via the PDCCH of the target cell. The UE uses the first available uplink grant after synchronization to the target cell.\n11\tWhen the RACH-less HO is not configured and the UE has successfully accessed the target cell, the UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to confirm the handover, along with an uplink Buffer Status Report, and/or UL data, whenever possible, to the target eNB, which indicates that the handover procedure is completed for the UE. The target eNB can now begin sending data to the UE.\nWhen the RACH-less HO is configured, after the UE has received uplink grant, the UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to confirm the handover, along with an uplink Buffer Status Report, and/or UL data, whenever possible, to the target eNB. The target eNB can now begin sending data to the UE. The handover procedure is completed for the UE when the UE receives the UE contention resolution identity MAC control element from the target eNB.\n11a/b\tIn case of DAPS Handover, the target eNB sends the HANDOVER SUCCESS message to the source eNB to inform that the UE has successfully accessed the target cell. In return, the source eNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message for E-RABs configured with DAPS for which the description in step 8 applies, and the normal data forwarding follows as defined in 10.1.2.3.\nNOTE 8:\tFor E-RABs configured with DAPS, the source eNB does not stop delivering uplink packets to the S-GW until it sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message in step 11b. The target eNB does not forward the uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received in-sequence to the S-GW until it receives the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, in which UL HFN and the first missing SN in the uplink PDCP SN receiver status indicates the start of uplink PDCP SDUs to be delivered to the S-GW. The target eNB does not deliver any uplink packet which has an UL COUNT lower than the provided.\nNOTE 9:\tVoid.\n12\tThe target eNB sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to MME to inform that the UE has changed cell.\n13\tThe MME sends a MODIFY BEARER REQUEST message to the Serving Gateway.\n14\tThe Serving Gateway switches the downlink data path to the target side. The Serving gateway sends one or more \"end marker\" packets on the old path to the source eNB and then can release any U-plane/TNL resources towards the source eNB.\n15\tThe Serving Gateway sends a MODIFY BEARER RESPONSE message to MME.\n16\tThe MME confirms the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message with the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.\n17\tBy sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the target eNB informs success of HO to source eNB and triggers the release of resources by the source eNB. The target eNB sends this message after the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message is received from the MME.\n18\tUpon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the source eNB can release radio and C-plane related resources associated to the UE context. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.\nWhen an X2 handover is used involving HeNBs and when the source HeNB is connected to a HeNB GW, a UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message including an explicit GW Context Release Indication is sent by the source HeNB, in order to indicate that the HeNB GW may release of all the resources related to the UE context.\nFor DAPS handover, upon receiving DAPS handover command message, the UE suspends source cell SRBs, stops sending and receiving any RRC control plane signalling towards the source cell and establishes SRBs for the target cell. The UE releases the source cell SRBs configuration upon receiving source cell release indication from the target cell after successful DAPS handover execution. When DAPS handover to the target cell fails and if the source cell link is available then the UE reverts back to the source cell configuration and activates source cell SRBs for control plane signalling. When DAPS handover is configured, PDCP duplication is not allowed.\nThe U-plane handling during the Intra-E-UTRAN-Access mobility activity for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED takes the following principles into account to avoid data loss during HO:\n-\tDuring HO preparation U-plane tunnels can be established between the source eNB and the target eNB. There is one tunnel established for uplink data forwarding and another one for downlink data forwarding for each E-RAB for which data forwarding is applied. In the case of a UE under an RN performing handover, forwarding tunnels can be established between the RN and the target eNB via the DeNB.\n-\tDuring HO execution, user data can be forwarded from the source eNB to the target eNB. The forwarding may take place in a service and deployment dependent and implementation specific way.\n-\tForwarding of downlink user data from the source to the target eNB should take place in order as long as packets are received at the source eNB from the EPC or the source eNB buffer has not been emptied.\n-\tDuring HO completion:\n-\tThe target eNB sends a PATH SWITCH message to MME to inform that the UE has gained access and MME sends a MODIFY BEARER REQUEST message to the Serving Gateway, the U-plane path is switched by the Serving Gateway from the source eNB to the target eNB.\n-\tThe source eNB should continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are received at the source eNB from the Serving Gateway or the source eNB buffer has not been emptied.\nFor RLC-AM bearers:\n-\tDuring normal HO not involving Full Configuration:\n-\tFor in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance, PDCP SN is maintained on a bearer basis and the source eNB informs the target eNB about the next DL PDCP SN to allocate to a packet which does not have a PDCP sequence number yet (either from source eNB or from the Serving Gateway).\n-\tFor security synchronisation, HFN is also maintained and the source eNB provides to the target one reference HFN for the UL and one for the DL i.e. HFN and corresponding SN.\n-\tIn both the UE and the target eNB, a window-based mechanism is needed for duplication detection.\n-\tThe occurrence of duplicates over the air interface in the target eNB is minimised by means of PDCP SN based reporting at the target eNB by the UE. In uplink, the reporting is optionally configured on a bearer basis by the eNB and the UE should first start by transmitting those reports when granted resources in the target eNB. In downlink, the eNB is free to decide when and for which bearers a report is sent and the UE does not wait for the report to resume uplink transmission.\n-\tThe target eNB re-transmits and prioritizes all downlink PDCP SDUs forwarded by the source eNB (i.e. the target eNB should send data with PDCP SNs from X2 before sending data from S1), with the exception of PDCP SDUs of which the reception was acknowledged through PDCP SN based reporting by the UE.\n-\tThe UE re-transmits in the target eNB all uplink PDCP SDUs starting from the first PDCP SDU following the last consecutively confirmed PDCP SDU i.e. the oldest PDCP SDU that has not been acknowledged at RLC in the source, excluding the PDCP SDUs of which the reception was acknowledged through PDCP SN based reporting by the target.\n-\tDuring HO involving Full Configuration:\n-\tThe following description below for RLC-UM bearers also applies for RLC-AM bearers. Data loss may happen.\nFor RLC-UM bearers:\n-\tThe PDCP SN and HFN are reset in the target eNB, unless the bearer is configured with DAPS Handover.\n-\tNo PDCP SDUs are retransmitted in the target eNB.\n-\tThe target eNB prioritizes all downlink PDCP SDUs forwarded by the source eNB if any (i.e. the target eNB should send data with PDCP SNs from X2 before sending data from S1).\n-\tThe UE PDCP entity does not attempt to retransmit any PDCP SDU in the target cell for which transmission had been completed in the source cell. Instead UE PDCP entity starts the transmission with other PDCP SDUs.\nFor DAPS handover:\nA DAPS Handover can be used for an RLC-AM or RLC-UM bearer. For a DRB configured with DAPS, the following principles are additionally applied.\nDownlink:\n-\tDuring HO preparation, a forwarding tunnel is always established.\n-\tThe source eNB is responsible for allocating downlink PDCP SNs until the SN assignment is handed over to the target eNB and data forwarding in 10.1.2.3.1 (RLC-AM) or in 10.1.2.3.2 (RLC-UM) takes place. That is, the source eNB does not stop assigning PDCP SNs to downlink packets until it receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message and sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target eNB.\n-\tUpon allocation of downlink PDCP SNs by the source eNB, it starts scheduling downlink data on the source radio link and also starts forwarding downlink PDCP SDUs along with assigned PDCP SNs to the target eNB.\n-\tFor security synchronisation, HFN is maintained for the forwarded downlink SDUs with PDCP SNs assigned by the source eNB. The source eNB sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message to convey the DL COUNT value, indicating PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source eNB forwards to the target eNB.\n-\tHFN and PDCP SN are maintained after the SN assignment is handed over to the target eNB. The SN STATUS TRANSFER message indicates the next DL COUNT to allocate to a packet which does not have a PDCP sequence number yet, even for RLC-UM.\n-\tDuring handover execution period, the source and target eNBs separately perform ROHC header compression, ciphering and adding PDCP header.\n-\tDuring handover execution period, the UE continues to receive downlink data from both source and target eNBs until the source eNB connection is released by an explicit release command from the target eNB.\n-\tDuring handover execution period, the UE PDCP entity configured with DAPS maintains separate security and ROHC header decompression functions associated with each eNB, while maintaining common functions for reordering, duplicate detection and discard, and PDCP SDUs in-sequence delivery to upper layers, PDCP SN continuity will be supported for both RLC AM and UM DRBs configured with DAPS.\nUplink:\n-\tThe UE transmits UL data to the source eNB until the random access procedure towards the target eNB has been successfully completed. Afterwards the UE switches its UL data transmission to the target eNB.\n-\tEven after switching its UL data transmissions towards the target eNB, the UE continues to send UL layer 1 CSI feedback, HARQ feedback, layer 2 RLC feedback, ROHC feedback, HARQ data (re-)transmissions and RLC data (re-)transmissions to the source eNB.\n-\tDuring handover execution period, the UE maintains separate security context and ROHC header compressor context for uplink transmissions towards the source and target eNBs. The UE maintains common UL PDCP SN allocation, PDCP SN continuity is supported for both RLC AM and UM DRBs configured with DAPS.\n-\tDuring handover execution period, the source and target eNBs maintain their own security and ROHC header decompressor contexts to process UL data received from the UE.\n-\tThe establishment of a forwarding tunnel is optional.\n-\tHFN and PDCP SN are maintained in the target eNB. The SN STATUS TRANSFER message indicates the UL COUNT of the first missing PDCP SDU that the target eNB should start delivering to the S-GW, even for RLC-UM.\nFor DRBs not configured with DAPS, upon UE receiving DAPS handover command message, UE stops transmission and reception of data from source cell and keeps source cell non-DAPS DRB configuration. When DAPS handover to target cell fails and if source cell link is available then UE will revert back to source cell configuration prior to the reception of DAPS handover command (including RLC, PDCP state variables and buffers).\nA Conditional Handover (CHO) is defined as a handover that is executed by the UE when one or more handover execution conditions are met. The UE starts evaluating the execution condition(s) for CHO candidate cells upon receiving the CHO configuration, and executes CHO once the execution condition(s) are met for a CHO candidate cell. UE stops evaluating the execution condition(s) once a handover is executed.\nThe following principles apply to CHO:\n-\tThe CHO configuration contains the configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) generated by each CHO candidate cell and execution condition(s) generated by the source cell.\n-\tAn execution condition may consist of one or two trigger condition(s) (CHO events A3/A5). Only single RS type is supported and at most two different trigger quantities (e.g. RSRP and RSRQ, RSRP and SINR, etc.) can be configured simultaneously for the evaluation of CHO execution condition of a single candidate cell.\n-\tUE maintains connection with source eNB until UE determines a CHO execution condition is met for CHO candidate cell.\n-\tBefore any CHO execution condition is satisfied, upon reception of HO command (without CHO configuration), the UE executes the HO procedure as described in clause 10.1.2.1, regardless of any previously received CHO configuration.\n-\tAfter source eNB sends CHO command to UE, the network is allowed to change source eNB configuration and network can add, modify or release a configured CHO configuration using RRC message (i.e. until UE starts executing CHO.\n-\tWhile executing CHO, i.e. from the time when the UE starts synchronization with target cell, UE does not monitor source cell.\nNOTE 1:\tCHO is not supported for S1 based handover in this release of the specification.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case LTE-DC is configured, CHO is only supported in MeNB to eNB change procedure in this release of the specification.\nThe figure below depicts the CHO scenario where neither MME nor Serving Gateway changes:\nThe figure depicts a conditional handover scenario within a multi-media edge (MME/Serving Gateway) network. It illustrates the process of transitioning from a serving gateway to an intra-MME/serving gateway, which is a crucial step in network management. The figure shows the various components involved, such as the serving gateway, MME/Serving Gateway, and the inter-MME/Serving Gateway, as well as the handover process. The diagram highlights the importance of proper handover procedures to ensure smooth network operations and minimize disruptions.\nFigure 10.1.2.1a-1: Intra-MME/Serving Gateway Conditional Handover\n1.\tThe source eNB configures the UE with measurement configuration, which may be used by the UE to trigger Measurement Reports for potential CHO candidate cell(s).\n2.\tA MEASUREMENT REPORT is triggered and sent to the source eNB.\n3.\tThe source eNB makes decision on the usage of CHO to handoff the UE based on MEASUREMENT REPORT information.\n4.\tThe source eNB requests a CHO to the eNB(s) of candidate cell(s). A CHO request message is sent for each candidate cell.\n5.\tSame as step 5 in Figure 10.1.2.1.1-1 of clause 10.1.2.1.1.\n6.\tThe eNB(s) of candidate cell(s) sends CHO response including configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) to the source eNB. The response message is also sent for each candidate cell.\n7.\tThe source eNB sends a RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE, containing configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) and CHO execution condition(s). The source eNB decides on the condition for the execution of CHO and adds the condition(s) to the RRC message sent to the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe source eNB may reconfigure the UE's source configuration after providing CHO configuration for candidate target cell(s).\nNOTE 1a:\tA configuration of a CHO candidate cell cannot contain a DAPS handover.\n8.\tThe UE sends an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to the source eNB.\n8a.\tIf early data forwarding is applied, the source eNB sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message.\n9.\tThe UE maintains connection with the source eNB after receiving CHO configuration, and starts evaluating the CHO execution condition(s) for the CHO candidate cell(s). If at least one CHO candidate cell satisfies the corresponding CHO execution condition, the UE detaches from the source eNB, applies the stored corresponding configuration for that candidate cell and synchronises to that candidate cell.\n10-11. The UE accesses to the target eNB and completes the handover procedure by sending RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to the target eNB. The UE releases the stored CHO configurations after successful completion of RRC handover procedure.\n11a/b.\tThe target eNB sends the HANDOVER SUCCESS message to the source eNB to inform that the UE has successfully accessed the target cell. In return, the source eNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message.\nNOTE 2:\tLate data forwarding may be initiated as soon as the source eNB receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message.\n11c.\tThe source eNB sends the HANDOVER CANCEL message toward the other signalling connections or other potential target eNBs, if any, to cancel CHO for the UE.\n12.\tSteps 12-18 as in Figure 10.1.2.1.1-1.\nThe U-plane handling for Conditional Handover follows the same principles for DAPS Handover in 10.1.2.1.2, if early data forwarding is applied, except that, in case of Full Configuration, HFN and PDCP SN are reset in the target eNB after the SN assignment is handed over to the target eNB. If late data forwarding is applied, the U-plane handling follows the RLC-AM or RLC-UM bearer principles defined in 10.1.2.1.2.\nIf late data forwarding is applied, the source eNB initiates data forwarding once it knows which target eNB the UE has successfully accessed. In that case the behavior of the Conditional Handover data forwarding follows the same behavior as defined in 10.1.2.3.1 and 10.1.2.3.2 for the intra-system handover data forwarding for RLC-AM and RLC-UM bearers.\nIf early data forwarding is applied instead, the source eNB initiates data forwarding before the UE executes the handover, to a candidate target node of interest, The behavior of early data forwarding for the Conditional Handover follows the same principles for DRBs configured with DAPS Handover in the intra-system handover as defined in 10.1.2.3.5.\nAfter the downlink path is switched at the Serving GW downlink packets on the forwarding path and on the new direct path may arrive interchanged at the target eNB. The target eNodeB should first deliver all forwarded packets to the UE before delivering any of the packets received on the new direct path. The method employed in the target eNB to enforce the correct delivery order of packets is outside the scope of the standard.\nIn order to assist the reordering function in the target eNB, the Serving GW shall send one or more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path for each E-RAB of the UE. The \"end marker\" packet shall not contain user data. The \"end marker\" is indicated in the GTP header. After completing the sending of the tagged packets the GW shall not send any further user data packets via the old path.\nUpon receiving the \"end marker\" packets, the source eNB shall, if forwarding is activated for that bearer, forward the packet toward the target eNB.\nOn detection of an \"end marker\" the target eNB shall discard the end marker packet and initiate any necessary processing to maintain in sequence delivery of user data forwarded over X2 interface and user data received from the serving GW over S1 as a result of the path switch.\nOn detection of the \"end marker\", the target eNB may also initiate the release of the data forwarding resource. However, the release of the data forwarding resource is implementation dependent and could also be based on other mechanisms (e.g. timer-based mechanism).\nEPC may change the uplink end-point of the tunnels with Path Switch procedure. However, the EPC should keep the old GTP tunnel end-point(s) sufficiently long time in order to minimise the probability of packet losses and avoid unintentional release of respective E-RAB(s).\nUpon DC specific activities which involve the transfer of bearer contexts from one eNB to another, if one of the eNBs involved in DC provides radio resources to the UE for one or several E-RABs configured with the SCG bearer option, the update of the downlink path towards the EPC for the relevant E-RABs needs to be communicated by the MeNB to the MME. The functions specified for the path switch for handover as specified in clause 10.1.2.2.1 are applicable for the path update for DC with SCG bearer option as well except that:\n-\tThe role of involved eNBs are different: in DC, the \"source eNB\" as specified for handover, is the eNB from which the bearer context is transferred and the \"target eNB\" is the eNB to which the bearer context is transferred.\n-\tThe EPC does not change the uplink end-point of the tunnels with the Path Update procedure in a way that this would change the Serving GW.\nUpon resumption of a UE context in an eNB different from the one where the UE context was suspended, the Path Switch procedure is used to request the MME to resume the UE context and related bearer contexts in the EPC and update the downlink path.\nUpon handover, the source eNB may forward in order to the target eNB all downlink PDCP SDUs with their SN that have not been acknowledged by the UE. In addition, the source eNB may also forward without a PDCP SN fresh data arriving over S1 to the target eNB.\nNOTE 1:\tThe target eNB does not have to wait for the completion of forwarding from the source eNB before it begins transmitting packets to the UE.\nThe source eNB discards any remaining downlink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the source eNB does not forward the downlink RLC context to the target eNB.\nNOTE 2:\tThe source eNB does not need to abort ongoing RLC transmissions with the UE as it starts data forwarding to the target eNB.\nUpon handover, the source eNB forwards to the Serving Gateway the uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received in-sequence until the sending of the Status Transfer message to the target eNB. Then at that point of time the source eNB stops delivering uplink PDCP SDUs to the S-GW and shall discard any remaining uplink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the source eNB does not forward the uplink RLC context to the target eNB.\nThen the source eNB shall either:\n-\tdiscard the uplink PDCP SDUs received out of sequence if the source eNB has not accepted the request from the target eNB for uplink forwarding or if the target eNB has not requested uplink forwarding for the bearer during the Handover Preparation procedure,\n-\tforward to the target eNB the uplink PDCP SDUs received out of sequence if the source eNB has accepted the request from the target eNB for uplink forwarding for the bearer during the Handover Preparation procedure.\nThe PDCP SN of forwarded SDUs is carried in the \"PDCP PDU number\" field of the GTP-U extension header. The target eNB shall use the PDCP SN if it is available in the forwarded GTP-U packet.\nFor normal HO in-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs during handover is based on a continuous PDCP SN and is provided by the \"in-order delivery and duplicate elimination\" function at the PDCP layer:\n-\tin the downlink, the \"in-order delivery and duplicate elimination\" function at the UE PDCP layer guarantees in-sequence delivery of downlink PDCP SDUs;\n-\tin the uplink, the \"in-order delivery and duplicate elimination\" function at the target eNB PDCP layer guarantees in-sequence delivery of uplink PDCP SDUs.\nAfter a normal handover, when the UE receives a PDCP SDU from the target eNB, it can deliver it to higher layer together with all PDCP SDUs with lower SNs regardless of possible gaps.\nFor handovers involving Full Configuration, the source eNB behaviour is unchanged from the description above. The target eNB may not send PDCP SDUs for which delivery was attempted by the source eNB. The target eNB identifies these by the presence of the PDCP SN in the forwarded GTP-U packet and discards them.\nAfter a Full Configuration handover, the UE delivers received PDCP SDU from the source cell to the higher layer regardless of possible gaps. UE discards uplink PDCP SDUs for which transmission was attempted and retransmission of these over the target cell is not possible.\nUpon handover, the source eNB does not forward to the target eNB downlink PDCP SDUs for which transmission had been completed in the source cell. PDCP SDUs that have not been transmitted may be forwarded. In addition, the source eNB may forward fresh downlink data arriving over S1 to the target eNB. The source eNB discards any remaining downlink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the source eNB does not forward the downlink RLC context to the target eNB.\nUpon handover, the source eNB forwards all uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received to the Serving Gateway (i.e. including the ones received out of sequence) and discards any remaining uplink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the source eNB does not forward the uplink RLC context to the target eNB.\nWith respect to SRBs, the following principles apply at HO:\n-\tNo forwarding or retransmissions of RRC messages in the target;\n-\tThe PDCP SN and HFN are reset in the target.\nUpon DC specific activities user data forwarding may be performed for E-RABs configured with the SCG bearer option　or with the split bearer option. The behaviour of the eNB from which data is forwarded is the same as specified for the \"source eNB\" for handover, the behaviour of the eNB to which data is forwarded is the same as specified for the \"target eNB\" for handover. If data forwarding for split bearer option is applied, the PDCP PDUs which are not acknowledged by the UE are forwarded from the SeNB to the MeNB in the course of procedures involving the release of the SCG part of the split bearer (e.g., SeNB Modification, SeNB Release, Change of SeNB).\nData forwarding after the source eNB receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message from the target eNB follows the same behaviors as defined in 10.1.2.3.1 if with RLC-AM and in 10.1.2.3.2 if with RLC-UM.\nBefore the source eNB receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message:\n-\tThe source eNB may forward to the target eNB downlink PDCP SDUs with SNs assigned by the source eNB. No downlink PDCP SDU without a SN assigned is forwarded. No uplink PDCP SDU is forwarded.\n-\tThe source eNB sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message to maintain HFN continuity by indicating PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source eNB forwards to the target eNB. The subsequent messages may be sent for discarding of already forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs in the target eNB.\n-\tThe source eNB does not stop transmitting downlink packets to the UE. The source eNB keeps forwarding to the Serving Gateway the uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received in-sequence from the UE.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED, the eNB is responsible for maintaining the timing advance. Serving cells having UL to which the same timing advance applies (typically corresponding to the serving cells hosted by the same receiver) and using the same timing reference cell are grouped in a timing advance group (TAG). Each TAG contains at least one serving cell with configured uplink, and the mapping of each serving cell to a TAG is configured by RRC. In case of DC, a TAG only includes cells that are associated to the same CG and the maximum number of TAG is 8.\nFor the pTAG the UE uses the PCell in MCG and the PSCell in SCG as timing reference. In a sTAG, the UE may use any of the activated SCells of this TAG as a timing reference cell, but should not change it unless necessary.\nFor NB-IoT, the UE uses the anchor carrier as timing reference no matter if the non-anchor carrier is configured or not.\nIn some cases (e.g. during DRX), the timing advance is not necessarily always maintained and the MAC sublayer knows if the L1 is synchronised and which procedure to use to start transmitting in the uplink:\n-\tas long as the L1 is non-synchronised, uplink transmission can only take place on PRACH.\nFor a TAG, cases where the UL synchronisation status moves from \"synchronised\" to \"non-synchronised\" include:\n-\tExpiration of a timer specific to the TAG;\n-\tNon-synchronised handover.\nThe synchronisation status of the UE follows the synchronisation status of the pTAG of MCG. The synchronisation status of the UE w.r.t. SCG follows the synchronisation status of the pTAG of SCG. When the timer associated with pTAG is not running, the timer associated with an sTAG in that CG shall not be running. Expiry of the timers associated with one CG does not affect the operation of the other CG.\nThe value of the timer associated to the pTAG of MCG is either UE specific and managed through dedicated signalling between the UE and the eNB, or cell specific and indicated via broadcast information. In both cases, the timer is normally restarted whenever a new timing advance is given by the eNB for the pTAG:\n-\trestarted to a UE specific value if any; or\n-\trestarted to a cell specific value otherwise.\nThe value of the timer associated to a pTAG of SCG and the value of a timer associated to an sTAG of an MCG or an sTAG of SCG are managed through dedicated signalling between the UE and the eNB, and the timers associated to these TAGs can be configured with different values. The timers of these TAGs are normally restarted whenever a new timing advance is given by the eNB for the corresponding TAG.\nUpon DL data arrival or for positioning purpose, a dedicated signature on PRACH can be allocated by the eNB to the UE. When a dedicated signature on PRACH is allocated, the UE shall perform the corresponding random access procedure regardless of its L1 synchronisation status.\nTiming advance updates are signalled by the eNB to the UE in MAC PDUs.\nWith RACH-less HO, only timing adjustment indication, NTA=0 or reuse NTA from a source eNB, are allowed where NTA denotes a parameter defined in TS36.213 [6] and TS36.211 [4].\nThe SeNB Addition procedure is initiated by the MeNB and is used to establish a UE context at the SeNB in order to provide radio resources from the SeNB to the UE. This procedure is used to add at least the first cell (PSCell) of the SCG. Figure 10.1.2.8.1-1 shows the SeNB Addition procedure.\nThe figure depicts the SeNB addition procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's operation. The figure shows the process of adding a new SeNB (Serving Equipment Node) to the network, which is a critical component for providing high-speed data services. The figure illustrates the steps involved in adding a new SeNB, including the connection of the new node to the existing network, the configuration of the node, and the connection to the network's control center. This figure is essential for understanding the network's operation and ensuring that the network is running efficiently and effectively.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.1-1: SeNB Addition procedure\n1.\tThe MeNB decides to request the SeNB to allocate radio resources for a specific E-RAB, indicating E-RAB characteristics (E-RAB parameters, TNL address information corresponding to bearer type). In addition, MeNB indicates within SCG-ConfigInfo the MCG configuration and the entire UE capabilities for UE capability coordination to be used as basis for the reconfiguration by the SeNB, but does not include SCG configuration. The MeNB can provide the latest measurement results for the SCG cell(s) requested to be added. The SeNB may reject the request.\nNOTE:\tIn contrast to SCG bearer, for the split bearer option the MeNB may either decide to request resources from the SeNB of such an amount, that the QoS for the respective E-RAB is guaranteed by the exact sum of resources provided by the MeNB and the SeNB together, or even more. The MeNBs decision may be reflected in step 1 by the E-RAB parameters signalled to the SeNB, which may differ from E-RAB parameters received over S1.\nNOTE:\tFor a specific E-RAB, the MeNB may request the direct establishment of an SCG or a Split bearer, i.e., without first having to establish an MCG bearer.\n2.\tIf the RRM entity in the SeNB is able to admit the resource request, it allocates respective radio resources and, dependent on the bearer option, respective transport network resources. The SeNB triggers Random Access so that synchronisation of the SeNB radio resource configuration can be performed. The SeNB provides the new radio resource of SCG in SCG-Config to the MeNB. For SCG bearers, the SeNB provides the new radio resource of the SCG together with S1 DL TNL address information for the respective E-RAB and security algorithm, for split bearers together with X2 DL TNL address information.\nNOTE:\tIn case of split bearers, transmission of user plane data may take place after step 2.\nNOTE:\tIn case of SCG bearers, data forwarding and the SN Status Transfer may take place after step 2.\n3.\tIf the MeNB endorses the new configuration, the MeNB sends the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE including the new radio resource configuration of SCG according to the SCG-Config.\n4.\tThe UE applies the new configuration and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n5.\tThe MeNB informs the SeNB that the UE has completed the reconfiguration procedure successfully.\n6.\tThe UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell of the SeNB. The order the UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is not defined. The successful RA procedure towards the SCG is not required for a successful completion of the RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure.\n7./8.\tIn case of SCG bearers, and dependent on the bearer characteristics of the respective E-RAB, the MeNB may take actions to minimise service interruption due to activation of dual connectivity (Data forwarding, SN Status Transfer).\n9.-12.\tFor SCG bearers, the update of the UP path towards the EPC is performed.\nThe SeNB Modification procedure may be initiated either by the MeNB or by the SeNB and be used to modify, establish or release bearer contexts, to transfer bearer contexts to and from the SeNB or to modify other properties of the UE context within the same SeNB.\nThe SeNB modification procedure does not necessarily need to involve signalling towards the UE.\nMeNB initiated SeNB Modification\n\nThe figure depicts a SeNB modification procedure, where MeNB initiates the process. The diagram illustrates the steps involved in modifying the SeNB, including the selection of the appropriate SeNB, the initiation of the modification process, and the completion of the modification.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.2-1: SeNB Modification procedure - MeNB initiated\nThe MeNB uses the procedure to initiate configuration changes of the SCG within the same SeNB, e.g. the addition or release of SCG SCells, the addition, modification or release of SCG bearer(s) and the SCG part of split bearer(s) and to trigger PSCell change involving PSCell release. The SeNB may reject the request, except if it concerns the release of SCG cells, of SCG bearer(s) or the SCG part of split bearer(s). Figure 10.1.2.8.2-1 shows an example signalling flow for a MeNB initiated SeNB Modification procedure.\n1.\tThe MeNB sends the SeNB Modification Request message, which may contain bearer context related or other UE context related information, data forwarding address information (if applicable) and SCG-ConfigInfo which contains the MCG configuration and the entire UE capabilities for UE capability coordination to be used as basis for the reconfiguration by the SeNB. In case of SCG SCell addition request, the MeNB can provide the latest measurement results for the SCG cell(s) requested to be added and SCG serving cell(s). In case of SCG Change, SCG Change Indication is included.\nNOTE:\tMeNB may request the establishment or release of SCG or Split bearer while not reconfiguration to MCG bearer, which can be performed without SCG change.\n2.\tThe SeNB responds with the SeNB Modification Request Acknowledge message, which may contain radio configuration information within SCG-Config message and data forwarding address information (if applicable). In this step, the SeNB does not initiate an SCG change i.e. the SCG-Config message indicates an SCG Change only if the MeNB included the SCG Change Indication in the SeNB Modification Request message (as an SCG change initiated by the SeNB would subsequently require an SCG counter from the MeNB). In case of SCG Change, for E-RABs configured with the split bearer option for which no bearer type change is performed, the SeNB provides a new DL GTP TEID to the MeNB. The MeNB shall continue sending DL PDCP PDUs to the SeNB with the previous DL GTP TEID until it performs PDCP re-establishment or PDCP data recovery, and use the new DL GTP TEID starting with the PDCP re-establishment or data recovery.\n3/4.\tThe MeNB initiates the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure. The UE applies the new configuration and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n5.\tUpon successful completion of the reconfiguration, the success of the procedure is indicated in the SeNB Reconfiguration Complete message.\n6.\tIf instructed, the UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell of the SeNB as described in SeNB addition procedure. Otherwise, the UE may perform UL transmission after having applied the new configuration.\n7/8.\tIf applicable, data forwarding between MeNB and the SeNB takes place (Figure 10.1.2.8.2-1 depicts the case where a bearer context is transferred from the MeNB to the SeNB).\n9.\tIf applicable, a path update is performed.\nSeNB initiated SeNB Modification\nThe figure depicts a SeNB modification procedure, showing the step-by-step process of modifying a SeNB. The figure includes a diagram of the SeNB, a list of modifications, and a legend to guide the user through the process.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.2-2: SeNB Modification procedure - SeNB initiated\nThe SeNB uses the procedure to perform configuration changes of the SCG within the same SeNB, e.g. to trigger the release of SCG SCell(s) (other than PSCell), SCG bearer(s) and the SCG part of split bearer(s) (upon which the MeNB may release the bearer or reconfigure it to an MCG bearer), and to trigger PSCell change. The MeNB cannot reject the release request of SCG SCells (other than PSCell), SCG bearer and the SCG part of split bearer. The SeNB cannot initiate an SCG SCell addition except for the case of SI update of an SCG SCell. Figure 10.1.2.8.2-2 shows an example signalling flow for an SeNB initiated SeNB Modification procedure.\n1.\tThe SeNB sends the SeNB Modification Required message, which may contain bearer context related, other UE context related information and SCG-Config which contains the new radio resource configuration of SCG. For bearer release or modification a corresponding E-RAB list is included in the SeNB Modification Required message. In case of SCG Change, SCG Change Indication together with SCG-Config are included. In case of release of bearer served by SeNB, SCG-Config is not included.\nThe SeNB can decide whether the Random Access procedure is required, i.e. SCG change.\n2./3.\tIf data forwarding and/or SeNB security key change needs to be applied, the MeNB triggers the preparation of the MeNB initiated SeNB Modification procedure and provides forwarding address and/or a new SeNB security key information within the SeNB Modification Request message, respectively. If the SeNB requested to release a bearer in step 1, and the MeNB decides to reconfigure it to an MCG bearer, the MeNB provides the SCG Change Indication within the SeNB Modification Request message and the SeNB provides respective RRC information in the SCG-Configuration within the SeNB Modification Request Acknowledgement message.\nNOTE:\tWhen the SeNB Modification Required message contains SCG-Config in step 1, the following MeNB initiated SeNB Modification procedure triggered by the MeNB in step 2 cannot be used for anything that would require a new SCG configuration (as SCG-Config cannot be subsequently signalled by the SeNB).\nNOTE:\tIf only SeNB security key (i.e. without SCG Change Indication) is provided in step 2, the MeNB does not need to wait for the reception of step 3 to initiate the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure.\n4.\tIf MeNB accepts the SeNB request, the MeNB sends the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE including the new radio resource configuration of SCG according to the SCG-Config.\n5.\tThe UE applies the new configuration and replies the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\n6.\tUpon successful completion of the reconfiguration, the success of the procedure related to SCG-Config is indicated in the SeNB Modification Confirm message.\n7.\tIf instructed, the UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell of the SeNB as described in SeNB addition procedure. Otherwise, the UE may perform UL transmission after having applied the new configuration.\n8/9.\tIf applicable, data forwarding between MeNB and the SeNB takes place (Figure 10.1.2.8.2-2 depicts the case where a bearer context is transferred from the SeNB to the MeNB).\n10.\tIf applicable, a path update is performed.\nThis procedure is used to perform handover within the same MeNB while keeping the SCG in the same SeNB.\nThe figure depicts an intra-MeNB handover procedure with SeNB configuration, illustrating the steps involved in transferring control from one network to another.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.2.1-1: Intra-MeNB handover procedure with SeNB configuration\n1.\tThe MeNB sends the SeNB Modification Request message, which may contain bearer context related or other UE context related information, data forwarding address information (if applicable) and SCG-ConfigInfo which contains the MCG configuration and the entire UE capabilities for UE capability coordination to be used as basis for the reconfiguration by the SeNB. In case of SCG SCell addition request, the MeNB can provide the latest measurement results for the SCG cell(s) requested to be added and SCG serving cell(s). For E-RABs configured with the split bearer option for which no bearer type change is performed during the SCG Change procedure the MeNB provides a new UL GTP TEID to the SeNB. The SeNB shall continue sending UL PDCP PDUs to the MeNB with the previous UL GTP TEID until it re-establishes the RLC and use the new UL GTP TEID after RLC re-establishment.\n2.\tThe SeNB responds with the SeNB Modification Request Acknowledge message, which may contain radio configuration information within SCG-Config message and data forwarding address information (if applicable).\n3.\tThe MeNB triggers the UE to apply the new configuration including SCG configuration.\n4/5.\tThe UE synchronizes to the MeNB.\n6.\tUpon successful completion of the reconfiguration, the success of the procedure is indicated in the SeNB Reconfiguration Complete message.\n7.\tThe UE performs synchronisation towards the PSCell of the SeNB as described in SeNB addition procedure.\n8/9.\tData forwarding between MeNB and the SeNB may take place.\n10.\tIf applicable, a path update is performed.\nThe SeNB Release procedure may be initiated either by the MeNB or by the SeNB and is used to initiate the release of the UE context at the SeNB. The recipient node of this request cannot reject.\nIt does not necessarily need to involve signalling towards the UE, e.g., RRC connection re-establishment due to Radio Link Failure in MeNB.\nMeNB initiated SeNB Release\nThe figure depicts the release procedure of a SeNB (Service Node Base) in a 5G network. It shows the steps involved in initiating the MeNB (Medium Earth Station) to ensure seamless communication. The figure illustrates the process of configuring the MeNB, connecting it to the network, and initiating the release procedure.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.3-1: SeNB Release procedure – MeNB initiated\nFigure 10.1.2.8.3-1 shows an example signalling flow for the MeNB initiated SeNB Release procedure.\n1.\tThe MeNB initiates the procedure by sending the SeNB Release Request message. If data forwarding is requested, the MeNB provides data forwarding addresses to the SeNB.\n2/3.\tIf required, the MeNB indicates in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message towards the UE that the UE shall release the entire SCG configuration. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\nNOTE:\tIf data forwarding is applied, timely coordination between steps 1 and 2 may minimize gaps in service provision, this is however regarded to be an implementation matter.\n4/5.\tData forwarding from the SeNB to the MeNB takes place.\n6.\tIf applicable, the path update procedure is initiated.\n7.\tUpon reception of the UE Context Release message, the SeNB can release radio and C-plane related resource associated to the UE context. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.\nSeNB initiated SeNB Release\nThe figure depicts a SeNB release procedure, showing the steps involved in initiating a SeNB. The figure includes a diagram of the SeNB, the release process, and the associated steps.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.3-2: SeNB Release procedure – SeNB initiated\nFigure 10.1.2.8.3-2 shows an example signalling flow for the SeNB initiated SeNB Release procedure.\n1.\tThe SeNB initiates the procedure by sending the SeNB Release Required message which does not contain inter-node message.\n2.\tIf data forwarding is requested, the MeNB provides data forwarding addresses to the SeNB in the SeNB Release Confirm message. The SeNB may start data forwarding and stop providing user data to the UE as early as it receives the SeNB Release Confirm message.\n3/4.\tIf required, the MeNB indicates in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message towards the UE that the UE shall release the entire SCG configuration. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\nNOTE:\tIf data forwarding is applied, timely coordination between steps 2 and 3 may minimize gaps in service provision. This is however regarded to be an implementation matter.\n5/6.\tData forwarding from the SeNB to the MeNB takes place.\n7.\tIf applicable, the path update procedure is initiated.\n8.\tUpon reception of the UE Context Release message, the SeNB can release radio and C-plane related resource associated to the UE context. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.\nThe change of SeNB procedure is initiated by MeNB and used to transfer a UE context from a source SeNB to a target SeNB and to change the SCG configuration in UE from one SeNB to another.\nThe figure depicts a change of a 5G SeNB (Serving Equipment Node) in a 5G network. The figure shows the various components involved in the network, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.4-1: Change of SeNB\nFigure 10.1.2.8.4-1 shows an example signalling flow for the Change of SeNB:\n1/2.\tThe MeNB initiates the change of SeNB by requesting the target SeNB to allocate resources for the UE by means of the SeNB Addition Preparation procedure. MeNB includes the SCG configuration of the old SeNB in the SeNB Addition Request. If forwarding is needed, the target SeNB provides forwarding addresses to the MeNB.\n\nIf RACH-less SeNB Change is configured, the target SeNB includes timing adjustment indication and optionally a preallocated uplink grant in the container.\n3.\tIf the allocation of target SeNB resources was successful, the MeNB initiates the release of the source SeNB resources towards the UE and the source SeNB. In case Make-Before-Break SeNB change is configured, the source SeNB decides when to stop transmitting to the UE. If data forwarding is needed the MeNB provides data forwarding addresses to the source SeNB. Either direct data forwarding or indirect data forwarding is used for SCG bearer. Only indirect data forwarding is used for Split bearer. Reception of the SeNB Release Request message triggers the source SeNB to stop providing user data to the UE and, if applicable, to start data forwarding.\n4/5.\tThe MeNB triggers the UE to apply the new configuration. The MeNB indicates the new configuration in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message towards the UE. In case the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, it performs the reconfiguration failure procedure.\nIf Make-Before-Break SeNB change is configured, the connection to the source SeNB is maintained after the reception of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with mobilityControlInfoSCG before the UE executes initial uplink transmission to the target cell.\nNOTE:\tThe UE can be configured with Make-Before-Break SeNB change and RACH-less SeNB change simultaneously.\n6.\tIf the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure was successful, the MeNB informs the target SeNB.\n7.\tThe UE synchronizes to the target SeNB.\n\nIf RACH-less SeNB Change is configured, the preallocated uplink grant may be included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. If the preallocated uplink grant is not included, the UE should monitor PDCCH of the target SeNB for uplink grant. The SeNB Change procedure is completed for the UE when the UE receives the UE contention resolution identity.\n8/9.\tIf applicable, data forwarding from the source SeNB takes place. It may be initiated as early as the source SeNB receives the SeNB Release Request message from the MeNB.\n10-14.\tIf one of the bearer contexts was configured with the SCG bearer option at the source SeNB, path update is triggered by the MeNB.\n15.\tUpon reception of the UE Context Release message, the source SeNB can release radio and C-plane related resource associated to the UE context. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.\nThe MeNB to eNB Change procedure is used to transfer context data from a source MeNB/SeNB to a target eNB.\nThe figure depicts the change procedure for a MeNB to an eNB in an 8-port 5G network. The diagram illustrates the steps involved in transitioning from a MeNB to an eNB, including the connection of the new eNB to the network, the configuration of the new eNB, and the connection of the new eNB to the network. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different colors and symbols used in the diagram.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.5-1: MeNB to eNB Change procedure\nFigure 10.1.2.8.5-1 shows an example signalling flow for the MeNB to eNB Change procedure:\n1.\tThe source MeNB starts the MeNB to eNB Change procedure by initiating the X2 Handover Preparation procedure. The source MeNB includes the SCG configuration in the HandoverPreparationInformation.\n2.\tThe target eNB includes the field in HO command which releases SCG configuration, and may also provide forwarding addresses to the source MeNB. The addition of an SeNB can be initiated only after completing HO.\n3.\tIf the allocation of target eNB resources was successful, the MeNB initiates the release of the source SeNB resources towards the source SeNB. If data forwarding is needed, the MeNB provides data forwarding addresses to the source SeNB. Either direct data forwarding or indirect data forwarding is used for SCG bearer. Only indirect data forwarding is used for Split bearer. Reception of the SeNB Release Request message triggers the source SeNB to stop providing user data to the UE and, if applicable, to start data forwarding.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case the handover is a conditional handover, step 3 is performed after the source MeNB receives an indication that the UE has successfully accessed one of the potential target eNB (i.e. after step 6).\nNOTE 2:\tIn case the handover is a conditional handover, the Data Forwarding Address Indication procedure is executed right after step 2. This Data Forwarding Address Indication informs conditional handover to the source SeNB for which it may decide to perform, if applicable, early data forwarding for SN-terminated bearers, together with the sending of an EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message to the source MeNB. Separate Data Forwarding Address Indication procedures may be invoked to provide different forwarding addresses of the prepared conditional handovers. In this case, it is up to the source MeNB and SeNB implementations to make sure that the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message(s) from the source SeNB, if any, is forwarded to the right target destination. The Data Forwarding Address Indication procedure may further be invoked to indicate to the SeNB to stop already initiated early data forwarding for some SN-terminated bearers if they are no longer subject to data forwarding due to the modification or cancellation of the prepared conditional handovers. If applicable, the normal data forwarding and SN STATUS TRANSFER message would follow from the source SeNB once it receives SeNB release request of the step 3 that is performed after step 6.\n4.\tThe MeNB triggers the UE to apply the new configuration. Upon receiving the new configuration, the UE releases the entire SCG configuration.\n5/6.\tThe UE synchronizes to the target eNB.\n7/8.\tIf applicable, data forwarding from the source SeNB takes place. It may start as early as the source SeNB receives the SeNB Release Request message from the MeNB.\n9-13.\tThe target eNB initiates the S1 Path Switch procedure.\n14.\tThe target eNB initiates the UE Context Release procedure towards the source MeNB.\n15.\tUpon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the S-SeNB can release radio and C-plane related resource associated to the UE context. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.\n\"SCG change\" refers to a synchronous SCG reconfiguration procedure towards the UE involving random access on PSCell. This procedure is used to establish SCG, and can be used to reconfigure the SCG configuration. During SCG change, MAC configured for SCG is reset and RLC configured for SCG is re-established regardless of the bearer type(s) established on SCG. For SCG bearer, PDCP configured for SCG is re-established. In case of reconfiguration from split to MCG bearer, RLC configured for SCG is released. During SCG change, S-KeNB key is refreshed. To perform SCG change within the same SeNB, the SeNB Modification procedure as described in clause 10.1.2.8.2 is used and in this case, the path switch and data forwarding for DRB on SCG may be suppressed. To perform SCG change between different SeNBs, the change of SeNB as described in clause 10.1.2.8.4 is used.\nThe eNB to MeNB change procedure is used to transfer context data from a source eNB to a target MeNB that adds an SeNB during the handover.\nThe figure depicts the transition from an eNB (Enhanced Network Base Station) to a MeNB (Multiprotocol Network Base Station) in a 5G network. The eNB is responsible for providing radio access network (RAN) services, while the MeNB is responsible for providing network functions. The figure illustrates the process of transitioning from an eNB to a MeNB, including the change in radio frequency (RF) spectrum allocation and the transition of radio resources from the eNB to the MeNB.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.7-1: eNB to MeNB change\nFigure 10.1.2.8.7-1 shows an example signaling flow for eNB to MeNB change:\n1.\tThe source eNB starts the handover procedure by initiating the X2 Handover Preparation procedure.\n2.\tThe target MeNB sends SeNB Addition Request to the target SeNB.\n3.\tThe target SeNB replies with SeNB Addition Request Acknowledge. If data forwarding is needed, the target SeNB provides forwarding addresses to the target MeNB.\n4.\tThe target MeNB includes within the Handover Request Acknowledge message a transparent container to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform the handover which also includes the SCG configuration, and may also provide forwarding addresses to the source eNB. Either direct data forwarding or indirect data forwarding is used for SCG bearer. Only indirect data forwarding is used for split bearer.\n5.\tThe source eNB triggers the UE to apply the new configuration.\n6/7.\tThe UE synchronizes to the target MeNB and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.\n8.\tThe UE synchronizes to the target SeNB\n9.\tIf the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure was successful, the target MeNB informs the target SeNB.\n10/11.\tData forwarding from the source eNB takes place.\n12-15.\tThe target MeNB initiates the S1 Path Switch procedure.\nNOTE:\tIf new UL TEIDs of the S-GW are included, the target MeNB performs MeNB initiated SeNB Modification procedure to provide them to the target SeNB.\n16.\tThe target MeNB initiates the UE Context Release procedure towards the source eNB.\nInter-MeNB handover without SeNB change is used to transfer context data from a source MeNB to a target MeNB while the context at the SeNB is kept.\nThe figure depicts an inter-MeNB handover scenario without a SeNB change, illustrating the process of transitioning between two MeNB (Multipath Enhanced Base Station) networks. The figure shows the handover process, including the handover signal, the handover protocol, and the handover mechanism. The figure is important for understanding the handover process in a 5G network and for designing and implementing handover protocols.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.8-1: Inter-MeNB handover without SeNB change\nFigure 10.1.2.8.8-1 shows an example signaling flow for inter-MeNB handover without SeNB change:\n1.\tThe source MeNB starts the handover procedure by initiating the X2 Handover Preparation procedure. The source MeNB includes the SCG configuration in the HandoverPreparationInformation. The source MeNB includes the SeNB UE X2AP ID and SeNB ID as a reference to the UE context in the SeNB that was established by the source MeNB in the Handover Request message.\n2.\tIf the target MeNB decides to keep the SeNB, the target MeNB sends SeNB Addition Request to the SeNB including the SeNB UE X2AP ID as a reference to the UE context in the SeNB that was established by the source MeNB.\n3.\tThe SeNB replies with SeNB Addition Request Acknowledge.\n4.\tThe target MeNB includes within the Handover Request Acknowledge message a transparent container to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform the handover which also includes the SCG configuration, and may also provide forwarding addresses to the source MeNB. The target MeNB indicates to the source MeNB that the UE context in the SeNB is kept if the target MeNB and the SeNB decided to keep the UE context in the SeNB in step 2 and step 3.\n5.\tThe source MeNB sends SeNB Release Request to the SeNB. The source MeNB indicates to the SeNB that the UE context in SeNB is kept. If the indication as the UE context kept in SeNB is included, the SeNB keeps the UE context.\n6.\tThe source MeNB triggers the UE to apply the new configuration.\n7/8.\tThe UE synchronizes to the target MeNB and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.\n9.\tThe UE synchronizes to the SeNB.\n10.\tIf the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure was successful, the target MeNB informs the SeNB.\n11/12.\tData forwarding from the source MeNB takes place. Data forwarding may be omitted for SCG bearers. Direct data forwarding from the source MeNB to the SeNB is not possible for split bearers.\nNOTE:\tDirect data forwarding may occur only for bearer type change.\n13-16.\tThe target MeNB initiates the S1 Path Switch procedure.\nNOTE:\tIf new UL TEIDs of the S-GW are included, the target MeNB performs MeNB initiated SeNB Modification procedure to provide them to the SeNB.\n17.\tThe target MeNB initiates the UE Context Release procedure towards the source MeNB.\n18.\tUpon reception of the UE Context Release message, the SeNB can release C-plane related resource associated to the UE context towards the source MeNB. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue. The SeNB shall not release the UE context associated with the target MeNB if the indication was included in the SeNB Release Request in step 5.\nThe figure depicts a hybrid cell as the serving cell of the SeNB, illustrating the addition of a hybrid cell to the existing network. The figure shows the SeNB, which is a small cell, and the hybrid cell, which is a larger cell, both connected to the main network. The addition of the hybrid cell to the SeNB enhances the network's capacity and coverage, as it can serve more users and provide better coverage in areas with limited infrastructure.\nFigure 10.1.2.8.9-1: Addition of a hybrid cell as serving cell of the SeNB\nFigure 10.1.2.8.9-1 shows the signalling flow for the addition of the hybrid cell as serving cell of the SeNB procedure:\n1a.\tThe UE is connected to an MeNB and detects a potential candidate cell for dual connectivity.\n1b.\tThe UE reads System Information from the candidate cell (csg-Indication, csg-Identity).\n1c.\tThe MeNB receives CSG related information from the UE (csg-MemberStatus, csg-Identity).\n2.\tThe MeNB initiates the SeNB Addition preparation procedure including Memebership Status of the UE in the hybrid HeNB.\n3.\tThe SeNB takes the membership information provided by the MeNB into account (even if this was not yet verified with the MME).\n4-7.\tNo difference to the SeNB Addition Preparation procedure as described in 10.2.1.1.\n8/9.\tThe MeNB requests the MME to verify the membership status of the UE for the CSG-ID reported by the UE.\n-\tFor SCG bearer, the MeNB triggers the E-RAB Modification Indication procedure.\n-\tFor split bearer, the MeNB triggers the UE Context Modification Indication procedure.\n10-13.\tIf the result of the membership verification requires an update of the UE context at the SeNB, the MeNB triggers the MeNB initiated SeNB Modification Preparation procedure. If the membership verification fails, it is up to the SeNB to decide on further actions.\nInter-eNB handover without WT change is used to transfer context data from a source eNB to a target eNB while the LWA connectivity is kept.\nThe figure depicts a handover scenario without a wireless transfer change (WT change), illustrating the handover process from a mobile device to a base station (BS) in a 5G network. The figure shows the handover path from the mobile device to the BS, with the BS acting as the destination. The handover path is shown in dashed lines, indicating the path that the mobile device will take to reach the BS. The figure also includes the BS, the mobile device, and the handover path, providing a clear visual representation of the handover process.\nFigure 10.1.2.9-1: Handover without WT change\n1.\tThe source eNB starts the handover procedure by initiating the X2 Handover Preparation procedure. The source eNB includes the LWA configuration in the HANDOVER REQUEST: the Mobility Set currently valid for the UE, the WT UE XwAP ID and WT ID as a reference to the UE context in the WT that was established by the source eNB.\n2.\tIf the target eNB decides to keep the LWA connection, the target eNB sends WT ADDITION REQUEST to the WT including the WT UE XwAP ID as a reference to the UE context in the WT that was established by the source eNB. The WT shall use this information to check if the UE context is present.\n3.\tIf successful, the WT replies with WT ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE.\n4.\tIf both, the target eNB and the WT decided to keep the LWA connection in steps 2 and 3 respectively, the target eNB sends the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, which includes the LWA configuration and the UE LWA Context Kept Indicator, and may also provide forwarding addresses to the source eNB.\n5.\tThe source eNB triggers the UE to apply the new configuration.\n6a.\tAfter the UE applies the target eNB PDCP keys contained in the handover command for UL, the UL end marker packet is sent to WT.\nNOTE:\tThe UE can change the DL and UL encryption keys at different times since it can receive an end marker packet at a different time than changing the PDCP key for UL.\n6b.\tWT forwards the UL end marker packet to the source eNB. If WT is able to distinguish the UL end marker packet, it may also forward the end marker packet to target eNB.\n6c.\tWhen the source eNB has sent the last DL packet to UE, it sends a DL end marker packet to the UE. When UE receives the end marker packet, it starts using the target eNB PDCP keys for decoding of DL packets.\nNOTE:\tThe DL end marker packet should be sent before the UE completes the handover, i.e. before step 9.\n7.\tThe source eNB sends the WT Release Request to the WT, indicating whether the UE context has been matched at the target. The WT keeps the relevant part of the UE context based on the identification information provided from the target eNB at step 2.\nNOTE:\tThe source eNB may postpone sending the WT Release Request until the UE CONTEXT RELEASE is received in step 12.\n8-9.\tThe UE synchronizes to the target eNB and replies with RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.\n10.\tThe source eNB forwards the SN status to the target eNB.\n11-12.\tThe target eNB initiates the S1 Path Switch procedure.\n13.\tThe target eNB initiates the UE Context Release procedure towards the source eNB.\nNOTE:\tSome time after the handover without WT change procedure, the target eNB may provide the UE and the WT with new WLAN security information. Based on this information, the UE re-authenticates itself in the WLAN network.\nUser plane aspects:\nBefore the source eNB initiates the WT Release Request, the WT is configured with bearer tunnels to both source and target eNB (after WT Addition by the target eNB).\nIn the downlink, the source eNB forwards end marker packets immediately after the last data packets sent to the WT for a particular bearer, and the WT forwards packets received from either eNB towards the UE. The end marker packets may be used by the UE to switch the PDCP key.\nIn the uplink, the UE inserts end marker packets to indicate the key switch. The WT may use the end marker packets to infer which packets should be forwarded to source eNB or target eNB. The source eNB may use the end marker packets to infer which packets it should process or discard while the source Xw-u tunnel is operational. The target eNB processes all received packets.\nProcedures to support EN-DC Operation are described in TS 37.340 [76].\n",

In RRC_IDLE state, a UE shall follow the measurement parameters defined for cell reselection specified by the E-UTRAN broadcast. The use of dedicated measurement control for RRC_IDLE state is possible through the provision of UE specific priorities (see clause 10.2.4). In RRC_CONNECTED state, a UE shall follow the measurement configurations specified by RRC directed from the E-UTRAN (e.g. as in UTRAN MEASUREMENT_CONTROL).\nIn RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED the UE may be configured to monitor some UTRA or E-UTRA carriers according to reduced performance requirements as specified in TS 36.133 [21].\nIn RRC_IDLE, for NB-IoT UEs, BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, the UE may further limit the intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements when the relaxed monitoring criterion is fulfilled as specified in TS 36.304 [11].\nIn RRC_IDLE, for NB-IoT UEs, when enabled in the cell and the relaxed monitoring criterion is fulfilled, the UE may perform serving cell measurements on the non-anchor paging carrier as specified in TS 36.133 [21].\nFor CSI-RS based discovery signals measurements, \"cell\" should be interpreted as \"transmission point of the concerned cell\" in the following descriptions.\nIntra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements, inter-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements and inter-RAT measurements are defined as follows:\n-\tIntra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements performed by the UE are intra-frequency measurements when the current and target cell operates on the same carrier frequency.\n-\tInter-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements performed by the UE are inter-frequency measurements when the neighbour cell operates on a different carrier frequency, compared to the current cell.\n-\tInter-RAT neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements performed by the UE are inter-RAT measurements when the neighbour cell operates on a different RAT, compared to the current cell.\nWhether a measurement is non gap assisted or gap assisted depends on the UE's capability and the current operating frequency. In non gap assisted scenarios, the UE shall be able to carry out such measurements without measurement gaps. In gap assisted scenarios, the UE may not be able to perform such measurements without measurement gaps. The UE determines whether a particular cell measurement needs to be performed in a transmission/reception gap and the scheduler needs to know whether gaps are needed:\n-\tSame carrier frequency and cell bandwidths (Scenario A): an intra-frequency scenario; not measurement gap assisted.\n-\tSame carrier frequency, bandwidth of the target cell smaller than the bandwidth of the current cell (Scenario B): an intra-frequency scenario; not measurement gap assisted.\n-\tSame carrier frequency, bandwidth of the target cell larger than the bandwidth of the current cell (Scenario C): an intra-frequency scenario; not measurement gap assisted.\n-\tDifferent carrier frequencies, bandwidth of the target cell smaller than the bandwidth of the current cell and bandwidth of the target cell within bandwidth of the current cell (Scenario D): an inter-frequency scenario; measurement gap-assisted scenario.\n-\tDifferent carrier frequencies, bandwidth of the target cell larger than the bandwidth of the current cell and bandwidth of the current cell within bandwidth of the target cell (Scenario E): an inter-frequency scenario; measurement gap-assisted scenario.\n-\tDifferent carrier frequencies and non-overlapping bandwidth, (Scenario F): an inter-frequency scenario; measurement gap-assisted scenario.\n-\tSame carrier frequency, the operating frequency of the bandwidth reduced low complexity (BL) UE or the UE in Enhanced Coverage is not guaranteed to be aligned with the center frequency of the current cell (Scenario G): an intra-frequency scenario; measurement gap assisted scenario.\n\n\n\nThe figure depicts various scenarios for inter and intra-frequency measurements, illustrating the importance of accurate and reliable measurements in the context of wireless communication systems.\nFigure 10.1.3-1: Inter and Intra-frequency measurements scenarios\nMeasurement gaps may be needed by the UE to carry out inter-RAT measurements on NR frequencies. UE may need measurement gaps to perform inter-RAT measurements on NR frequencies depending on the UE's need for gap capability, as well as the UE capability to support independent FR measurement as specified in TS 38.306 [89]. The UE may not be able to perform inter-RAT NR measurements without measurement gaps in the following cases:\n-\tIf the UE only supports per-UE gaps and the UE is required to measure NR frequencies:\n-\tIf the UE supports per-FR gaps and the UE is required to measure at least one NR frequency in FR1;\nMeasurement gaps patterns are configured and activated by RRC.\nWhen CA is configured, the \"current cell\" above refers to any serving cell of the configured set of serving cells. For instance, for the definition of intra and inter frequency measurements, this means:\n-\tIntra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements performed by the UE are intra-frequency measurements when one of the serving cells of the configured set and the target cell operates on the same carrier frequency. The UE shall be able to carry out such measurements without measurement gaps.\n-\tInter-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements performed by the UE are inter-frequency measurements when the neighbour cell operates on a different carrier frequency than any serving cell of the configured set. The UE may not be able to perform such measurements without measurement gaps.\nWhen DC is configured, the following principles are applied:\n-\tThe configured set of serving cells includes all the cells from MCG and SCG as for CA;\n-\tThe measurement procedure of serving cells belonging to the SeNB shall not be impacted due to RLF of SeNB;\n-\tCommon gap for the MeNB and the SeNB is applied;\n-\tThere is only a single measurement gap configuration for the UE which is controlled and informed by the MeNB.\n-\tUE determines the starting point of the measurement gap based on the SFN, subframe number and subframe boundaries of the MCG serving cells.\nWhen LAA is configured:\n-\tThe eNB configures the UE with one DMTC window for all neighbor cells as well as for the serving cell (if any) on one frequency;\n-\tThe UE is only expected to detect and measure cells transmitting DRS during the configured DRS DMTC window;\n-\tFor channel selection in an environment where hidden nodes may exist, UE may be configured with one RMTC per a frequency to perform RSSI measurement, and to report average RSSI and channel occupancy (percentage of measurement samples that RSSI value is above a threshold) in a reporting interval.\nFor NB-IoT, measurements in RRC_CONNECTED are optionally supported to reduce the time taken for RRC reestablishment. The following principles are applied:\n-\tThe \"current cell\" above refers to the configured carrier in the serving cell. The \"target cell\" above refers to the anchor carrier in the target cell. For instance, for the definition of intra and inter frequency measurements, this means:\n-\tIntra-frequency neighbour (carrier) measurements: Neighbour carrier measurements performed by the UE are intra-frequency measurements when the configured carrier in the serving cell and the anchor carrier in the target cell operates on the same carrier frequency. The UE shall be able to carry out such measurements without measurement gaps.\n-\tInter-frequency neighbour (carrier) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements performed by the UE are inter-frequency measurements when the configured carrier in the serving cell and the anchor carrier in the target cell operates on a different carrier frequency. The UE may not be able to perform such measurements without measurement gaps.\n-\tThe eNB configures the criteria to perform measurements via broadcast signalling;\n-\tDedicated measurements gaps are not supported. The UE may need to perform neighbour cell measurements during DL/UL idle periods that are provided by DRX or packet scheduling;\n-\tMeasurement reporting is not supported.\nIn a system with frequency reuse = 1, mobility within the same frequency layer (i.e. between cells with the same carrier frequency) is predominant. Good neighbour cell measurements are needed for cells that have the same carrier frequency as the serving cell in order to ensure good mobility support and easy network deployment. Search for neighbour cells with the same carrier frequency as the serving cell, and measurements of the relevant quantities for identified cells are needed.\nNOTE:\tTo avoid UE activity outside the DRX cycle, the reporting criteria for neighbour cell measurements should match the used DRX cycle.\nRegarding mobility between different frequency layers (i.e. between cells with a different carrier frequency), UE may need to perform neighbour cell measurements during DL/UL idle periods that are provided by DRX or packet scheduling (i.e. gap assisted measurements).\nNetwork may request UE to measure inter-frequency carriers in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE via system information or via dedicated measurement configuration in RRC Connection Release. The UE performs the requested measurements and may provide an indication of the availability of measurement report to the eNB during RRC Connection Setup or Resume procedure. The network may request UE to report those measurements after security activation. The request for the measurements can be sent by the network immediately after transmitting the Security Mode Command (i.e. before the reception of the Security Mode Complete from the UE). Alternatively, during connection resume from suspended RRC connection or from RRC_INACTIVE, the eNB can request the UE to provide idle/inactive measurement results in the RRCConnectionResume message and then the UE can include the available measurement results in the RRCConnectionResumeComplete message.\n",

The timing between GWUS and the paging occasion (PO) is illustrated in Figure 10.1.4-2 and Figure 10.1.4-3.

When CA is configured in SCG, the first three steps of the contention based random access procedures occur on the PSCell while contention resolution (step 4) can be cross-scheduled by the PSCell.\nThe non-contention based random access procedure is outlined on Figure 10.1.5.2-1 below:\nThe figure depicts a non-contention based Random Access Procedure (RAP) in a wireless communication system. It illustrates the steps involved in selecting a random access point (RAP) for a user, ensuring that the user's signal is not interfered with by other users. The figure shows the user's signal strength, the RAP's signal strength, and the interference from other users. The RAP is selected based on the user's signal strength and the interference from other users. The figure also shows the steps involved in selecting the RAP, such as calculating the interference and selecting the RAP based on the interference.\nFigure 10.1.5.2-1: Non-contention based Random Access Procedure\nThe three steps of the non-contention based random access procedures are:\n0)\tRandom Access Preamble assignment via dedicated signalling in DL:\n-\teNB assigns to UE a non-contention Random Access Preamble (a Random Access Preamble not within the set sent in broadcast signalling).\n-\tSignalled via:\n-\tHO command generated by target eNB and sent via source eNB for handover;\n-\tPDCCH in case of DL data arrival or positioning;\n-\tPDCCH for initial UL time alignment for a sTAG.\n1)\tRandom Access Preamble on RACH in uplink:\n-\tUE transmits the assigned non-contention Random Access Preamble.\n2)\tRandom Access Response on DL-SCH:\n-\tSemi-synchronous (within a flexible window of which the size is two or more TTIs) with message 1;\n-\tNo HARQ;\n-\tAddressed to RA-RNTI on PDCCH;\n-\tConveys at least:\n-\tTiming Alignment information and initial UL grant for handover;\n-\tTiming Alignment information for DL data arrival;\n-\tRA-preamble identifier;\n-\tIntended for one or multiple UEs in one DL-SCH message.\nWhen performing non-contention based random access on the PCell while CA is configured, the Random Access Preamble assignment via PDCCH of step 0, step 1 and 2 of the non-contention based random access procedure occur on the PCell. In order to establish timing advance for a sTAG, the eNB may initiate a non-contention based random access procedure with a PDCCH order (step 0) that is sent on a scheduling cell of activated SCell of the sTAG. Preamble transmission (step 1) is on the indicated SCell and Random Access Response (step 2) takes place on PCell.\nWhen performing non-contention based random access on the PCell or PSCell while DC is configured, the Random Access Preamble assignment via PDCCH of step 0, step 1 and 2 of the non-contention based random access procedure occur on the corresponding cell. In order to establish timing advance for a sTAG, the eNB may initiate a non-contention based random access procedure with a PDCCH order (step 0) that is sent on a scheduling cell of activated SCell of the sTAG not including PSCell. Preamble transmission (step 1) is on the indicated SCell and Random Access Response (step 2) takes place on PCell for MCG and PSCell for SCG.\nRandom access procedure described above is modelled in Figure 10.1.5.3-1 below from L1 and L2/3 interaction point of view. L2/L3 receives indication from L1 whether ACK is received or DTX is detected after indication of Random Access Preamble transmission to L1. L2/3 indicates L1 to transmit first scheduled UL transmission (RRC Connection Request in case of initial access) if necessary or Random Access Preamble based on the indication from L1.\nThe figure depicts a simplified interaction model between L1 and L2/3 for a Random Access Procedure (RAP). It illustrates the communication paths between the two layers, highlighting the use of relay nodes and the utilization of the 802.11ac protocol for wireless communication. The figure is crucial for understanding the network's architecture and the role of relay nodes in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 10.1.5.3-1: Interaction model between L1 and L2/3 for Random Access Procedure\n",

The visual clues include the presence of a red signal, the damaged radio link, and the surrounding environment. This figure is used to illustrate the importance of proper radio link maintenance and the potential consequences of a failure.\nFigure 10.1.6-1: Radio Link Failure\nTable 10.1.6-1 below describes how mobility is handled with respect to radio link failure:\nTable 10.1.6-1: Mobility and Radio Link Failure\n\nFor a NB-IoT UE that only uses Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisations, as defined in TS 24.301 [20] and does not support RRC Connection re-establishment for the control plane as defined in TS 36.331 [16], at the end of the first phase, the UE enters RRC_IDLE (there is no second phase).In the Second Phase, in order to resume activity and avoid going via RRC_IDLE when the UE returns to the same cell or when the UE selects a different cell from the same eNB, or when the UE selects a cell from a different eNB, the following procedure applies:\n-\tThe UE stays in RRC_CONNECTED;\n-\tThe UE accesses the cell through the random access procedure;\n-\tExcept for a NB-IoT UE using only Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisations, the UE identifier used in the random access procedure for contention resolution (i.e. C-RNTI of the UE in the cell where the RLF occurred + physical layer identity of that cell + short MAC-I based on the keys of that cell) is used by the selected eNB to authenticate the UE and check whether it has a context stored for that UE:\n-\tIf the eNB finds a context that matches the identity of the UE, or obtains this context from the previously serving eNB, it indicates to the UE that its connection can be resumed;\n-\tIf the context is not found, RRC connection is released and UE initiates procedure to establish new RRC connection. In this case UE is required to go via RRC_IDLE.\n-\tFor a NB-IoT UE using only Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisations, the UE identifier used in the random access procedure for contention resolution (i.e. S-TMSI (for EPS) or truncated 5G-S-TMSI (for 5GS) of the UE at the time where the RLF occurred + UL NAS MAC + UL NAS COUNT) is used by the selected (ng-)eNB to request the MME/AMF to authenticate the UE's re-establishment request and provide the UE context:\n-\tIf the authentication of the UE is successful and a context is provided, it indicates to the UE that its connection can be resumed;\n-\tIf no context is provided, the RRC connection is released and UE initiates procedure to establish new RRC connection. In this case UE is required to go via RRC_IDLE.\nThe radio link failure procedure applies also for RNs, with the exception that the RN is limited to select a cell from its DeNB cell list. Upon detecting radio link failure, the RN discards any current RN subframe configuration (for communication with its DeNB), enabling the RN to perform normal contention-based RACH as part of the re-establishment. Upon successful re-establishment, an RN subframe configuration can be configured again using the RN reconfiguration procedure.\nFor DC, PCell supports above phases. In addition, the first phase of the radio link failure procedure is supported for PSCell. However, upon detecting RLF on the PSCell, the re-establishment procedure is not triggered at the end of the first phase. Instead, UE shall inform the radio link failure of PSCell to the MeNB.\nNOTE:\tIf the recovery attempt in the second phase fails, the details of the RN behaviour in RRC_IDLE to recover an RRC connection are up to the RN implementation.\nIn case of DAPS handover, the UE continues the detection of radio link failure at the source cell until the successful completion of the random access procedure to the target cell. If RLF is declared in the source cell, the UE:\n-\tstays in RRC_CONNECTED;\n-\tstops any data transmission or reception via the source link and releases the source link, but maintains the source RRC configuration;\n-\tif handover failure is declared at the target cell after source cell RLF was declared,\n-\tselects a suitable cell and initiates RRC re-establishment;\n-\tenters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain time after handover failure was declared.\nIn case of CHO, after RLF is declared in the source cell, the UE:\n-\tstays in RRC_CONNECTED;\n-\tselects a suitable cell and if the selected cell is a CHO candidate and if network configured the UE to try CHO at the selected CHO candidate cell after RLF, then the UE attempts CHO execution, otherwise re-establishment is performed;\n-\tenters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain time after RLF was declared.\n",

This can be done by following the principles specified for GERAN to/from UTRAN intersystem HO. In particular the following principles are applied to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO design:\n1.\tInter RAT HO is network controlled through source access system. The source access system decides about starting the preparation and provides the necessary information to the target system in the format required by the target system. That is, the source system adapts to the target system. The actual handover execution is decided in the source system.\n2.\tInter RAT HO is backwards handover, i.e. radio resources are prepared in the target 3GPP access system before the UE is commanded by the source 3GPP access system to change to the target 3GPP access system.\n3.\tTo enable backwards handover, and while RAN level interfaces are not available, a control interface exists in CN level. In Inter RAT HO involving E-UTRAN access, this interface is between:\n-\t2G/3G SGSN and corresponding MME/Serving Gateway;\n-\tAMF/UPF and corresponding MME/Serving Gateway.\n4.\tThe target access system will be responsible for giving exact guidance for the UE on how to make the radio access there (this includes radio resource configuration, target cell system information etc.). This information is given during the handover preparation and should be transported completely transparently through the source access system to the UE.\n5.\tMechanisms for avoiding or mitigating the loss of user data (i.e. forwarding) can be used until the 3GPP Anchor determines that it can send DL U-plane data directly to the target system.\n6.\tThe handover procedure should not require any UE to CN signalling in order for data to start to flow in the target system. This requires that the security context, UE capability context and QoS context is transferred (or translated) within the network between source and target system.\n7.\tSimilar handover procedure should apply for handovers of both real time and non-real time services.\n8.\tSimilar handover procedure should apply for Inter RAT Handover, intra-LTE Handover with EPC node change, and intra-E-UTRA inter-system Handover.\n9.\tNetwork controlled mobility is supported even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target cell and/or frequency i.e. \"blind HO\" is supported.\n10.\tInter-RAT HO from E-UTRA with EN-DC configuration to GERAN/UTRAN/NR is supported.\n11.\tInter-RAT HO from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRA with EN-DC configuration is not supported.\n12.\tInter-RAT HO from NR standalone to E-UTRA with EN-DC configuration is supported.\n",

The use of dedicated measurement control is possible through the provision of UE specific priorities (see clause 10.2.4).\nIntroduction of E-UTRA implies co-existence of various UE capabilities.

The overall system is described in TS 23.401 [17].\nIn order to efficiently support handover procedures when on E-UTRAN with a cdma2000 target system, cdma2000 messages are sent transparently to the target system over the E-UTRAN, with the eNB and MME acting as relay points.\nTo support the MME in its selection of the correct target system node to which it should route an Uplink tunnelled message and to provide the target system with information that is needed to resolve technology-specific measurement information (RouteUpdate and pilot strength measurements) that are delivered to the cdma2000 system, each eNB cell is associated with a cdma2000 HRPD SectorID and/or with a cdma2000 1xRTT SectorID (generically referred to as cdma2000 reference cellid). This cdma2000 reference cellid is provided by the eNB to the MME using the cdma2000 message transfer capability over S1-AP and forwarded to the target system via the S101 interface and corresponding interface to the cdma2000 1xRTT system.\nTunnelling is achieved over the E-UTRAN radio interface by encapsulating tunnelled cdma2000 messages in the UL Information Transfer (for pre-registration signalling) or UL Handover Preparation transfer (for handover signalling) and DL Information Transfer RRC messages (e.g., similar to UMTS Uplink/Downlink Direct Transfer). The reason for using different UL transfer messages is so that the UL Handover Preparation transfer messages can use a higher priority signalling radio bearer. For the UL/DL Information Transfer messages a specific IE in these RRC messages is used to identify the type of information contained in the message (e.g., NAS, TunneledMsg). Additionally if the message is carrying a tunnelled message, an additional IE is included to carry cdma2000 specific RRC Tunnelling Procedure Information (e.g. RAT type).\nAS level security will be applied for these UL Information Transfer / UL Handover Preparation Transfer and DL Information Transfer RRC messages as normal but there is no NAS level security for these tunnelled cdma2000 messages.\nThe figure depicts a downlink direct transfer scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the transmission of data from the base station (gNB) to the user equipment (UE) through the use of downlink direct transfer (D-DST) techniques. This process involves the use of multiple paths to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission. The figure highlights the importance of proper network design and management to ensure optimal performance and reliability in a 5G network.\nFigure 10.3.2.1-1: Downlink Direct Transfer\nThe figure depicts a Uplink Direct Transfer scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the direct transmission of data between the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE). The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to enhance signal quality and mitigate interference.\nFigure 10.3.2.1-2: Uplink Direct Transfer\nTunnelling to the MME is achieved over the S1-MME interface by encapsulating the tunnelled cdma2000 message in a new S1 CDMA tunnelling messages. These S1 messages carry in addition to the tunnelled message some additional cdma2000 specific IEs (e.g. cdma2000 Reference Cell Id, RAT type, cdma2000 message type).\nThe HRPD system information block (SIB) shall be sent on the E-UTRAN BCCH. The UE shall monitor the E-UTRAN BCCH during the RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED modes to retrieve the HRPD system information for the preparation of cell reselection or handover from the E-UTRAN to HRPD system. HRPD system information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated signalling. The HRPD system information contains HRPD neighbouring cell information, cdma timing information, as well as information controlling the HRPD pre-registration.\nMeasurement events and parameters for HRPD measurements are to be aligned with those defined in clause 10.2.3.\nUE shall be able to make measurements on the HRPD cells in RRC_IDLE mode to perform cell re-selection.\nThe intra-3GPP inter-RAT idle mode measurement control is re-used to control the idle mode measurements on HRPD. The UE performs measurement on HRPD when the signal quality from E-UTRAN serving cell falls below a given threshold.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE shall perform radio measurements on the HRPD network when directed by the E-UTRAN network. The network provides the required HRPD neighbour cell list information and measurement controls to the UE through dedicated RRC signalling. When needed the eNB is responsible for configuring and activating the HRPD measurements on the UE via the dedicated RRC signalling message. Periodic and event-triggered measurements are supported.\nFor single-radio terminals, measurement gaps are needed to allow the UE to switch into the HRPD network and do radio measurements. These measurement gaps are network-controlled. The eNB is responsible for configuring the gap pattern and providing it to the UE through RRC dedicated signalling. Terminals with a dual receiver perform measurements on HRPD neighbour cells without tuning away from the E-UTRAN network. No DL gap patterns will be required for UEs which are capable of simultaneous reception on the involved frequency bands. No UL gap patterns will be required for UEs which are capable simultaneous transmission in one access and measuring on another access.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE measures the strengths of each of the HRPD neighbour cells and reports them in an RRC message.\nPre-registration allows a UE to establish a presence with an HRPD system in advance of a cell re-selection or handover. E-UTRAN network instructs the UE whether the pre-registration is needed over broadcast channel and in a dedicated RRC message.\nThe signalling procedure is transparent to E-UTRAN network. In the pre-registration to HRPD, messages shall be tunnelled inside RRC and S1-AP messages between the UE and MME and in a generic \"transfer\" message between source MME and target access network.\nThe UE is responsible for maintaining the HRPD context e.g. by performing periodic re-registrations if needed. The UE will use pre-registration zone information (including the current HRPD Pre-registration Zone and a list of HRPD Secondary Pre-registration Zone ID) to decide whether a re-registration shall be performed. A dual-receiver UE can ignore the parameter. E-UTRAN will provide the pre-registration zone information on the E-UTRAN system information broadcast channel or dedicated RRC signalling (unless it is determined that the UE will read the E-UTRAN system information broadcast channel in RRC_CONNECTED). Re-registrations are only allowed in areas where pre-registration is requested.\nThe managing of pre-registration and re-registration is handled by HRPD upper layer. The UE should indicate if it is pre-registered when sending measurement reports on cdma2000 cells.\nFor the \"Optimized Idle-mode Mobility\" in TS 23.402 [19], the pre-condition for cell re-selection from E-UTRAN to HRPD is that the UE has previously established a presence in the target HRPD network, either through the pre-registration procedure or previous HRPD attachment.\nFor the \"Non-optimized Handover\" in TS 23.402 [19], the above pre-condition does not apply.\nThe UE performs Cell re-selection to HRPD while in RRC_IDLE.\nCell reselection from E-UTRAN to HRPD should be aligned with 3GPP inter RAT cell reselection mechanism.\nThe pre-condition for the E-UTRAN to HRPD Handover procedure is that the UE is attached in the E-UTRAN network in E-UTRAN_ACTIVE state and has pre-registered with the HRPD network. Based on measurement reports received from the UE the eNB initiates a handover by sending an RRC Handover FROM E-UTRA PREPARATION REQUEST message to the UE to indicate to the UE that it should begin the handover procedure. This message shall include the specified target RAT type and any cdma2000 specific HRPD parameters needed by the UE to create the appropriate HRPD messages needed to request a connection. Upon reception of this message the UE should begin handover signalling towards the HRPD access. The HRPD handover signalling is tunnelled through E-UTRAN between the UE and HRPD network. These HRPD parameters and HRPD messages are transparent to E-UTRAN. The set of the required HRPD parameters are out of scope of this specification.\nThe messages are transferred inside RRC transfer messages and S1 CDMA2000 tunnelling messages. The MME will, based on indication provided by the HRPD network, get information about if the handover succeeded or failed making it possible for the MME set the handover status in the S1 CDMA2000 tunnelling messages (e.g. handover success, handover failure). In case the handover succeeded E-UTRAN will include the tunnelled \"CDMA2000 handover command\", which will be sent to the UE, inside the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA COMMAND message.\nThe UE can continue to send and receive data on the E-UTRAN radio until it receives the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA COMMAND message including a tunnelled \"CDMA2000 handover command\". After this message is received by the UE, the UE shall leave the E-UTRAN radio and start acquiring the HRPD traffic channel. The HRPD handover signalling is tunnelled between the UE and HRPD network.\nMobility from HRPD to E-UTRAN has no impact on the E-UTRAN.\nThe cdma2000 1xRTT system information block (SIB) shall be sent on E-UTRAN BCCH. The UE shall monitor the E-UTRAN BCCH during the RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED modes to retrieve the 1xRTT system information for the preparation of handover from the E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT system. 1xRTT system information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated signalling. The 1xRTT system information contains 1xRTT neighbouring cell information, cdma timing information, and 1xRTT CS Fallback information.\nMeasurement events and parameters for 1xRTT measurements are to be aligned with those defined in clause 10.2.3.\nUE shall be able to make measurements on the 1xRTT system cells in LTE_IDLE mode to perform cell re-selection. UE shall perform cdma2000 1xRTT neighbour cell measurements during DRX periods, between paging occasions.\nThe intra-3GPP inter-RAT idle mode measurement control is re-used to control the idle mode measurements on cdma2000 1xRTT. The UE performs measurement on cdma2000 1xRTT when the signal quality from E-UTRAN serving cell falls below a given threshold.\nIn the E-UTRAN network, in RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE shall perform radio measurements on the cdma2000 1xRTT network when directed by the E-UTRAN network. The network provides the required cdma2000 1xRTT neighbour cell list information and measurement controls to the UE through dedicated RRC signalling. When needed the eNB is responsible for configuring and activating the cdma2000 1xRTT measurements on the UE via the dedicated RRC signalling message. As for intra-3GPP inter-RAT measurement reporting, periodic and event-triggered measurements are supported.\nFor single-radio terminals, measurement gaps are needed to allow the UE to switch into the cdma2000 1xRTT network and do radio measurements. These Measurement gaps are network-controlled. The eNB is responsible for configuring the gap pattern and providing it to the UE through RRC dedicated signalling. Terminals with a dual receiver perform measurements on cdma2000 1xRTT neighbour cells without tuning away from the E-UTRAN network. No DL gap patterns will be required for UEs which are capable of simultaneous reception on the involved frequency bands. No UL gap patterns will be required for UEs which are capable simultaneous transmission in one access and measuring on another access.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE measures the strengths of each of the cdma2000 1xRTT neighbour cells and reports them in an RRC Message.\nUE performs Cell re-selection to cdma2000 1xRTT while in RRC_IDLE.\nCell reselection from E-UTRAN to 1xRTT should be aligned with 3GPP inter RAT cell reselection mechanism.\nIn the high level procedure for handover from E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT except 1xRTT CS Fallback, registration and handover is performed directly after the handover decision has been made. Based on measurement reports received from the UE the eNB initiates a handover by sending a RRC Handover FROM E-UTRA PREPARATION REQUEST message to the UE to indicate to the UE that it should begin the handover procedure. This message shall include the specified target RAT type and any cdma2000 specific 1xRTT access parameters needed by the UE to create the appropriate 1xRTT Origination Request message. The 1xRTT handover signalling is tunnelled between the UE and 1xRTT network. The 1xRTT access parameters and 1xRTT messages are transparent to E-UTRAN. The set of the required 1xRTT access parameters are out of scope of this specification.\nThe messages are transferred inside RRC transfer messages and S1 CDMA2000 tunnelling messages. The MME will, based on indication provided by the 1xRTT network, get information about if the handover succeeded or failed making it possible for the MME set the handover status in the S1 CDMA2000 tunnelling messages (e.g. handover success, handover failure). In case the handover succeeded E-UTRAN will include the tunnelled \"CDMA2000 handover command\", which will be sent to the UE, inside the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA COMMAND message.\nThe UE can continue to send and receive data on the E-UTRAN radio until it receives the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA COMMAND message including a tunnelled \"CDMA2000 handover command\". After this message is received by the UE, the UE shall leave the E-UTRAN radio and start acquiring the 1xRTT traffic channel.\nMobility from cdma2000 1xRTT has no impact on E-UTRAN.\nCS fallback to 1xRTT enables the delivery of CS-domain services when a UE is being served by the E-UTRAN, as specified in TS 23.272 [23].\nThe UE initiates 1xCSFB (e.g. to perform a 1xCS call origination or accept a 1xCS call termination) by using NAS signalling to send a CSFB indication to the MME. The MME then indicates to the eNB that 1xCSFB is required, which triggers the eNB to execute one of the following 1xCSFB procedures depending on network support and UE capability:\n-\tRel-8 1xCSFB, characterized by RRC connection release with redirection to 1xRTT;\n-\tenhanced 1xCSFB, characterized by 1xRTT handover signalling tunnelled between the UE and 1xRTT network;\n-\tdual receiver 1xCSFB, characterized by RRC connection release without redirection information; or\n-\tdual receiver/transmitter enhanced 1xCSFB, characterized by either 1xRTT handover signalling tunnelled between the UE and 1xRTT network, or redirection of the UE's second radio to 1xRTT.\nThe network advertises its support for Rel-8 1xCSFB by broadcasting 1xRTT pre-registration parameters in system information (SIB8). The Rel-8 1xCSFB procedure is the default procedure, when no other 1xCSFB procedure can be performed. If Rel-8 1xCSFB is to be performed, the eNB optionally solicits 1xRTT measurements from the UE, and then sends an RRC Connection Release message with redirection to 1xRTT. The UE then performs the normal 1xCS call origination or termination procedure in the 1xRTT access network.\nA network which advertises support for Rel-8 1xCSFB may also support enhanced 1xCSFB, in which case the eNB determines to perform enhanced 1xCSFB based on UE capability. If enhanced 1xCSFB is to be performed, the eNB optionally solicits 1xRTT measurements from the UE, and then sends it a Handover From EUTRA Preparation Request message. This triggers the UE to send the UL Handover Preparation Transfer message containing 1xRTT dedicated information. The 1xRTT information is contained inside RRC and S1-AP messages between the UE and MME and in a generic \"transfer\" message between MME and 1xRTT network. The response from the 1xRTT network triggers the eNB to send a Mobility From EUTRA Command message which includes a 1xRTT channel assignment message that causes the UE to acquire a traffic channel in the 1xRTT access network. In addition to enhanced 1xCSFB, the eNB may determine to perform concurrent mobility to HRPD based on UE capability; if so, then two separate UL Handover Preparation Transfer messages are triggered from the UE containing 1xRTT and HRPD dedicated information, respectively. The concurrent HRPD handover procedure is handled independently from the e1xCSFB procedure, except that responses from the 1xRTT and HRPD networks shall be combined by the eNB into a single Mobility From EUTRA Command message.\nThe network advertises support for dual receiver 1xCSFB by broadcasting the dual receiver 1xCSFB support indicator in system information (SIB8). The eNB determines to perform dual receiver 1xCSFB if the UE has a dual Rx configuration according to UE capability, and enhanced 1xCSFB cannot be performed (i.e. because enhanced 1xCSFB is not supported by both network and UE). If dual receiver 1xCSFB is to be performed, the eNB sends an RRC Connection Release message without including redirection information. The UE then performs the normal 1xCS call origination or termination procedure in the 1xRTT access network. A UE with dual Rx configuration may initiate 1xCSFB to a network broadcasting 1xRTT pre-registration parameters but not broadcasting the dual receiver 1xCSFB support indicator; in this case, the UE may receive an RRC Connection Release message with redirection to 1xRTT.\nThe network advertises support for dual receiver/transmitter enhanced 1xCSFB (dual Rx/Tx e1xCSFB) by broadcasting the dual Rx/Tx e1xCSFB support indicator in system information (SIB8). The eNB determines to perform dual Rx/Tx e1xCSFB if the UE supports dual Rx/Tx e1xCSFB according to UE capability. If the network does not advertise support for dual Rx/Tx e1xCSFB, UE which have dual Rx/Tx configuration may decide to keep the 1xRTT receiver/transmitter turned on in order to continuously operate in both 1xRTT and E-UTRAN. If dual Rx/Tx e1xCSFB is to be performed, the eNB optionally solicits 1xRTT measurements from the UE, and then sends a Handover From EUTRA Preparation Request message. This triggers the UE to perform one of the following:\n-\tsend the UL Handover Preparation Transfer message containing 1xRTT dedicated information. The 1xRTT information is contained inside RRC and S1-AP messages between the UE and MME and in a generic \"transfer\" message between MME and 1xRTT network. The response from the 1xRTT network triggers the eNB to send a DL Information Transfer message which includes a 1xRTT channel assignment message that causes the UE to acquire a traffic channel in the 1xRTT access network while continuing to be served by the E-UTRAN (for PS-domain services).\n-\tdirect its second radio to 1xRTT, where it performs the 1xCS call origination or termination procedure in the 1xRTT access network while continuing to be served by the E-UTRAN (for PS-domain services).\nThe following table summarizes the various CS fallback options for 1xRTT, necessary UE capabilities and FGI index which should be set to '1'. The meaning of FGI index is specified in TS 36.331 [16], Annex B.\nTable 10.3.2.3.3-1: CS fallback options\n\n10.3.2.3.3.1\tPre-registration Procedure for 1xRTT CSFB\nA 1xCSFB capable terminal may pre-register in the 1xRTT network via the E-UTRAN in order to establish CS services (e.g. originating and terminating voice calls) in the 1xRTT network. Pre-registration applies only to Rel-8 1xCSFB, enhanced 1xCSFB and dual receiver/transmitter enhanced 1xCSFB. It does not apply to dual receiver 1xCSFB, since the UE registers directly in the 1xRTT network using the normal 1xCS registration procedure.\nThe UE determines whether pre-registration is needed based on 1xRTT pre-registration parameters broadcast in system information (SIB8). Before performing a 1xRTT pre-registration, the UE requests from the eNB the necessary information to perform the 1xRTT pre-registration using the CDMA2000 CSFB Parameters Request message. The eNB provides the necessary parameters in the CDMA2000 CSFB Parameters Response message. These necessary parameters are pre-configured in the eNB and are transparent to E-UTRAN.\nThe UE is responsible for maintaining the 1xRTT context, e.g. by performing re-registrations if needed. The UE will use the 1xRTT pre-registration information to decide whether a re-registration shall be performed. A dual receiver UE which registers directly in the 1xRTT network can ignore these parameters. Re-registrations are only allowed in areas where pre-registration is allowed.\nThe management of the pre-registration and re-registration is handled by the 1xRTT upper layer in the UE.\n",

                            "text_content": "Cell selection/reselection to CSG cells is based on a UE autonomous search function. The search function determines itself when/where to search, and need not be assisted by the network with information about frequencies which are dedicated to CSG cells.\nTo assist the search function on mixed carriers, all CSG cells on mixed carriers broadcast in system information a range of PCI values reserved by the network for use by CSG cells. Optionally also non-CSG cells on the mixed carrier can send this information in system information. The reserved PCI range is only applicable to the frequency of the PLMN where the UE received this information. The UE considers the last received reserved range of PCI values for CSG cells to be valid for a maximum of 24 hours within the entire PLMN. UE's use of the received PCI split information is UE implementation dependent.\nNOTE:\tIn shared NW scenario, aligned PCI ranges are beneficial in the shared carrier frequency across the involved PLMNs. Furthermore, in deployments where cells broadcast different primary PLMN (with or without multiple PLMN IDs), it is beneficial that CSG and non-CSG cells will broadcast same PCI ranges.\nUE checks the suitability of CSG cells (identified by the 1 bit indicator) based on the Permitted CSG list in the UE (provided by upper layers). Only CSG member cells are considered suitable.\nThe automated searching for the CSG cells by the UE shall be disabled by the search function, if the Permitted CSG list configured in the UE is empty.\nIn addition, manual selection of CSG cells is supported.\nCell selection/reselection to CSG cells does not require the network to provide neighbour cell information to the UE. The neighbour cell information can be provided to help the UE in specific cases, e.g. where the network wishes to trigger the UE to search for CSG cells.\nCell Reselection between CSG member cells is based on normal cell reselection procedure.\nWhile the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state, the UE performs normal measurement and mobility procedures based on configuration provided by the network.\nThe UE is not required to support manual selection of CSG IDs while in RRC_CONNECTED state.\nHandover to a HNB/HeNB follows the framework of UE assisted network controlled handover as described in 10.1.2.1. Handover to a HNB/HeNB is different from the normal handover procedure in four aspects:\n1.\tProximity Estimation: in case the UE is able to determine, using autonomous search procedures, that it is near a CSG member cell, the UE may provide to the source eNB an indication of proximity. The proximity indication may be used as follows:\n-\tIf a measurement configuration is not present for the concerned frequency/RAT, the source eNB may configure the UE to perform measurements and reporting for the concerned frequency/RAT.\n-\tThe source eNB may determine whether to perform other actions related to handover to HNB/HeNBs based on having received a proximity indication (for example, the source eNB may not configure the UE to acquire system information of the HNB/HeNB unless it has received a proximity indication).\n2.\tPSC/PCI Confusion: due to the typical cell size of HNB/HeNBs being much smaller than macro cells, there can be multiple HNBs/HeNBs within the coverage of the source eNB that have the same PSC/PCI. This leads to a condition referred to as PSC/PCI confusion, wherein the source eNB is unable to determine the correct target cell for handover from the PSC/PCI included in the measurement reports from the UE. PSC/PCI confusion is solved by the UE reporting the global cell identity of the target HNB/HeNB.\n3.\tAccess Control: if the target cell is a hybrid cell, prioritization of allocated resources may be performed based on the UE's membership status. Access control is done by a two step process, where first the UE reports whether the target cell is a CSG member cell based on the UE's Permitted CSG list, and then the network verifies the reported status. When the UE has an emergency call the MME allows inbound mobility to CSG cells even if the access control fails as specified in TS 23.401[17].\n4.\tPLMN Selection: If the target cell is a shared CSG/hybrid cell, the UE reports the subset of the broadcasted PLMN identities passing PLMN ID check and the Permitted CSG list of the UE includes an entry comprising of the concerned PLMN identity and the CSG ID broadcast by the target cell. The source eNB performs PLMN ID check for the PLMNs reported by the UE and selects one if multiple pass the PLMN ID check. Finally the MME verifies the CSG membership according to the received CSG ID, the selected PLMN ID and stored subscription CSG information of the UE.\nMobility from eNB/HeNB to a HeNB's CSG/hybrid cell may take place with the S1 Handover procedure. In the following call flow the source cell can be an eNB or a HeNB.\nThe current version of the specification also supports mobility involving HeNBs by using X2 handover in some cases (see clause 4.6.1). If membership verification is required for X2 mobility, the procedure described in clause 10.1.2.1 applies, with the following additions to the steps described in clause 10.1.2.1.1:\n-\tIn Step 4, the source eNB/HeNB includes the CSG membership status reported by the UE handed over in the X2AP HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target HeNB; the target HeNB performs admission control based on the CSG membership status reported by the UE;\n-\tIn Step 12, the target HeNB includes the CSG membership status of the UE handed over in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to the MME;\n-\tIn Step 16, after the MME has performed membership verification for the UE handed over, the MME includes its verified CSG membership status in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the target HeNB; the target HeNB updates its membership information if needed.\nThe procedure below applies to any scenario where the CSG ID is provided by the UE or provided by the source eNB.\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a 5G network, highlighting the mobility of the core network (HeNB) to the base station (gNB) and the presence of hybrid cells. The figure illustrates the various components involved in the network, such as the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, which are crucial for ensuring network reliability and efficiency.\nFigure 10.5.1.2-1: Mobility to HeNB's CSG and hybrid cells.\n1)\tThe source eNB configures the UE with proximity indication control.\n2)\tThe UE sends an \"entering\" proximity indication when it determines it may be near a CSG member cell (based on autonomous search procedures). The proximity indication includes the RAT and frequency of the cell.\n3)\tIf a measurement configuration is not present for the concerned frequency/RAT the source eNB configures the UE with relevant measurement configuration including measurement gaps as needed, so that the UE can perform measurements on the reported RAT and frequency. The network may also use the proximity indication to minimize the requesting of handover preparation information of CSG/hybrid cells by avoiding requesting such information when the UE is not in the geographical area where its CSG member cells are located.\n4)\tThe UE sends a measurement report including the PCI (e.g., due to triggered event A3).\n5)\tThe source eNB configures the UE to perform SI acquisition and reporting of a particular PCI.\n6)\tThe UE performs SI acquisition using autonomous gaps, i.e., the UE may suspend reception and transmission with the source eNB within the limits defined in TS 36.133 [21] to acquire the relevant system information from the target HeNB.\n7)\tThe UE sends a measurement report including (E-)CGI, TAI, CSG ID and \"member/non-member\" indication. If the target cell is a shared CSG/hybrid cell, the measurement report also includes the subset of the broadcast PLMN identities that pass PLMN ID check and for which the Permitted CSG list of the UE includes an entry comprising the cell's CSG ID and the respective PLMN identity.\n8)\tThe source eNB includes the target E-CGI and the CSG ID in the Handover Required message sent to the MME. If the target is a hybrid cell the Cell Access Mode of the target is included.\n9)\tThe MME performs UE access control to the CSG cell based on the CSG ID and the selected target PLMN received in the Handover Required message and the stored CSG subscription data for the UE (see TS 23.401 [17]). If the access control procedure fails, the MME ends the handover procedure by replying with the Handover Preparation Failure message. If the Cell Access Mode is present, the MME determines the CSG Membership Status of the UE handing over to the hybrid cell and includes it in the Handover Request message.\n10-11)\tThe MME sends the Handover Request message to the target HeNB including the target CSG ID received in the Handover Required message. If the target is a hybrid cell the CSG Membership Status will be included in the Handover Request message.\n12)\tThe target HeNB verifies that the CSG ID received in the Handover Request message matches the CSG ID broadcast in the target cell and if such validation is successful it allocates appropriate resources. UE prioritisation may also be applied if the CSG Membership Status indicates that the UE is a member.\n13-14)\tThe target HeNB sends the Handover Request Acknowledge message to the MME via the HeNB GW if present.\n15)\tThe MME sends the Handover Command message to the source eNB.\n16)\tThe source eNB transmits the Handover Command (RRC Connection Reconfiguration message including mobility control information) to the UE.\nNOTE:\tSteps 1-9, 15 and 16 also apply to inter-RAT mobility from LTE to HNB.\nAfter sending an \"entering\" proximity indication (step 2), if the UE determines that it is no longer near a CSG member cell, the UE sends a \"leaving\" proximity indication to the source eNB. Upon reception of this indication, the source eNB may reconfigure the UE to stop measurements on the reported RAT and frequency.\nIn the above procedure, steps 2 and 3 may not be performed in case the UE has not previously visited the HeNB, e.g., when the UE first visits a hybrid cell.\nThe PCI confusion is resolved by steps 5, 6 and 7. The source eNB can request SI acquisition and reporting for any PCI, not limited to PSCs/PCIs of CSG or hybrid cells.\n",

Conversely, when an SCell is active, the UE shall receive PDSCH and PDCCH (if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH from this SCell), and is expected to be able to perform CQI measurements. To enable faster CQI reporting, a temporary CQI reporting period (called short CQI period) can be supported during SCell activation period. E-UTRAN ensures that while PUCCH SCell is deactivated, SCells of secondary PUCCH group should not be activated or dormant. E-UTRAN ensures that SCells mapped to PUCCH SCell are deactivated before the PUCCH SCell is changed or removed.\nTo enable faster transition to activated state, a dormant state for SCells (i.e. not PCell or PSCell) is supported. When an SCell is in dormant state, the UE does not need to receive the corresponding PDCCH or PDSCH, cannot transmit in the corresponding uplink, but is required to perform CQI measurements. A PUCCH SCell cannot be in dormant state.\nThe activation/deactivation mechanism is based on the combination of a MAC control element and deactivation timers. The MAC control element carries a bitmap for the activation and deactivation of SCells: a bit set to 1 denotes activation of the corresponding SCell, while a bit set to 0 denotes deactivation. With the bitmap, SCells can be activated and deactivated individually, and a single activation/deactivation command can activate/deactivate a subset of the SCells. One deactivation timer is maintained per SCell but one common value is configured per UE by RRC.\nThe state transitions to and from dormant Scell state use MAC control elements.\nAt reconfiguration without mobility control information:\n-\tSCells added to the set of serving cells are initially \"deactivated\", \"dormant\" or \"activated\";\n-\tSCells which remain in the set of serving cells (either unchanged or reconfigured) do not change their activation status (\"activated\", \"deactivated\" or \"dormant\").\nAt reconfiguration with mobility control information (i.e. handover) or connection resume from RRC_INACTIVE:\n-\tSCells are \"deactivated\", \"dormant\" or \"activated\".\nIn DC, the serving cells of the MCG other than the PCell can only be activated/deactivated by the MAC Control Element received on MCG, and the serving cells of the SCG other than PSCell can only be activated/ deactivated by the MAC Control Element received on SCG. The MAC entity applies the bitmap for the associated cells of either MCG or SCG. PSCell in SCG is always activated like the PCell (i.e. deactivation timer is not applied to PSCell).

In the uplink, for asynchronous HARQ, a timer is used to limit the time the UE stays awake awaiting for a retransmission;\n-\tWhen DRX is configured, the UE may be further configured with an \"on-duration\" timer during which time the UE monitors the PDCCHs for possible allocations;\n-\tWhen DRX is configured, periodic CQI reports can only be sent by the UE during the \"active-time\". RRC can further restrict periodic CQI reports so that they are only sent during the on-duration;\n-\tA timer per TAG in the UE is used to detect need for obtaining timing advance for each TAG.\nThe following definitions apply to DRX in E-UTRAN, except for NB-IoT:\n-\ton-duration: duration in downlink subframes that the UE waits for, after waking up from DRX, to receive PDCCHs. If the UE successfully decodes a PDCCH, the UE stays awake and starts the inactivity timer;\n-\tinactivity-timer: duration in downlink subframes that the UE waits to successfully decode a PDCCH, from the last successful decoding of a PDCCH, failing which it re-enters DRX. The UE shall restart the inactivity timer following a single successful decoding of a PDCCH for a first transmission only (i.e. not for retransmissions).\n-\tactive-time: total duration that the UE is awake. This includes the \"on-duration\" of the DRX cycle, the time UE is performing continuous reception while the inactivity timer has not expired and the time UE is performing continuous reception while waiting for a DL retransmission after one HARQ RTT or, for asynchronous UL HARQ operation, for an UL retransmission grant after one UL HARQ RTT. Based on the above the minimum active time is of length equal to on-duration, and the maximum is undefined (infinite);\nOf the above parameters the on-duration and inactivity-timer are of fixed lengths, while the active-time is of varying lengths based on scheduling decision and UE decoding success. Only on-duration and inactivity-timer duration are signalled to the UE by the eNB:\n-\tThere is only one DRX configuration applied in the UE at any time;\n-\tUE shall apply an on-duration on wake-up from DRX sleep;\nNOTE:\tthis is also applicable for the case where the UE has only one service (e.g. Real Time) that is being handled through the allocation of predefined resources; this allows for other signalling such as RRC to be sent during the remaining portion of the active time.\n-\tNew transmissions can only take place during the active-time (so that when the UE is waiting for one retransmission only, it does not have to be \"awake\" during the RTT).\n-\tIf PDCCH has not been successfully decoded during the on-duration, the UE shall follow the DRX configuration (i.e. the UE can enter DRX sleep if allowed by the DRX configuration):\n-\tThis applies also for the sub-frames where the UE has been allocated predefined resources.\n-\tExcept for NB-IoT, if it successfully decodes a PDCCH for a first transmission, the UE shall stay awake and start the inactivity timer (even if a PDCCH is successfully decoded in the sub-frames where the UE has also been allocated predefined resources) until a MAC control message tells the UE to re-enter DRX, or until the inactivity timer expires. In both cases, the DRX cycle that the UE follows after re-entering DRX is given by the following rules:\n-\tIf a short DRX cycle is configured; the UE first follows the short DRX cycle and after a longer period of inactivity the UE follows the long DRX cycle;\n-\tElse the UE follows the long DRX cycle directly.\nNOTE:\tWhen DRX is configured, the network should detect whether UE remains in EUTRAN coverage by requesting UE to send periodic signals to the network.\nIn CA, whenever a UE is configured with only one serving cell (i.e. PCell) Rel-8/9 DRX applies. In other cases, the same DRX operation applies to all configured and activated serving cells (i.e. identical active time for PDCCH monitoring).\nIn DC, separate DRX configurations can be applied to MCG and SCG, and the CG specific DRX operation applies to all configured and activated serving cells in the same CG (i.e. identical active time for PDCCH monitoring).\n",

If WT Counter is not signalled to the UE, the UE uses authentication methods specified in TS 33.402 [70], clause 6, as described in 22A.1.8.\n-\tFor LWIP, the LWIP Counter in the LWIP Configuration is used when computing the LWIP-PSK (as specified in TS 33.401 [13], clause A.13, and TS 36.331 [16], subcause 5.6.17.2).\n-\tSeparate AS and NAS level security mode command procedures are used. AS level security mode command procedure configures AS security (RRC and user plane) and NAS level security mode command procedure configures NAS security. Both integrity protection and ciphering for RRC are activated within the same AS SMC procedure. User plane ciphering is activated at the same time as RRC ciphering. An EN-DC capable UE supporting user plane integrity protection (see TS 24.301 [20]) when connected to E-UTRA/EPC (as specified in TS 33.401 [22]) shall support integrity protection for all DRBs (MN and SN terminated) at any data rate, up to and including the highest data rate supported by the UE for both UL and DL. When supported, user plane integrity protection with NR PDCP can be activated (on a per radio bearer basis) upon DRB addition.\n-\tKeys stored inside eNBs shall never leave a secure environment within the eNB (except when done in accordance with this or other 3GPP specifications), and user plane data ciphering/deciphering shall take place inside the secure environment where the related keys are stored.\n-\tKey material for the eNB keys is sent between the eNBs during ECM-CONNECTED intra-E-UTRAN mobility and from the MeNB to the SeNB in DC for SCG bearer during SCG addition and SCG change.\n-\tA sequence number (COUNT) is used as input to the ciphering and integrity protection. A given sequence number must only be used once for a given eNB key (except for identical re-transmission) on the same radio bearer in the same direction. The same sequence number can be used for both ciphering and integrity protection.\n-\tA hyper frame number (HFN) (i.e. an overflow counter mechanism) is used in the eNB and UE in order to limit the actual number of sequence number bits that is needed to be sent over the radio. The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and eNB.\n-\tNo integrity protection initialisation number (FRESH).\n-\tSince SIM access is not granted in E-UTRAN TS 33.401 [22] except for making IMS Emergency calls, idle mode UE not equipped with USIM shall not attempt to reselect to E-UTRAN unless it is originating an IMS Emergency call. The RNC may try to prevent handover to E-UTRAN for example by identifying a SIM based UE from the security keys provided by the CN.\nA simplified key derivation is depicted on Figure 14.1-1 below, where:\n-\tKNASint is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS traffic with a particular integrity algorithm This key is derived by UE and MME from KASME , as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm.\n-\tKNASenc is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. This key is derived by UE and MME from KASME, as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm.\n-\tKeNB is a key derived by UE and MME from KASME. KeNB may also be derived by the target eNB from NH at handover. KeNB shall be used for the derivation of KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc, and for the derivation of KeNB* upon handover.\n-\tKeNB* is a key derived by UE and source eNB from either KeNB or from a fresh NH. KeNB* shall be used by UE and target eNB as a new KeNB for RRC and UP traffic.\n-\tKUPint is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of UP traffic with a particular integrity algorithm. This key is derived by UE and eNB from KeNB, as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm.\n-\tKUPenc is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of UP traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. This key is derived by UE and eNB from KeNB, as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm.\n-\tKRRCint is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of RRC traffic with a particular integrity algorithm. KRRCint is derived by UE and eNB from KeNB, as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm.\n-\tKRRCenc is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of RRC traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. KRRCenc is derived by UE and eNB from KeNB as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm.\n-\tNext Hop (NH) is used by UE and eNB in the derivation of KeNB* for the provision of \"forward security\", as specified in TS 33.401 [22]. NH is derived by UE and MME from KASME and KeNB when the security context is established, or from KASME and previous NH, otherwise.\n-\tNext Hop Chaining Count (NCC) is a counter related to NH (i.e. the amount of Key chaining that has been performed) which allow the UE to be synchronised with the eNB and to determine whether the next KeNB* needs to be based on the current KeNB or a fresh NH.\nThe figure depicts a key derivation process for a 5G network, illustrating the steps involved in deriving the key parameters of the network. The key derivation process is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of the network.\nFigure 14.1-1: Key Derivation\nKey derivation for SCG bearers in DC is depicted on Figure 14.1-2 below, where:\n-\tSCG Counter is a counter used as freshness input into S-KeNB derivations (see TS 33.401 [22], Annex E.2.4).\nThe figure depicts the process of deriving the DC key from the DC-DC converter. The DC-DC converter is a crucial component in power supply systems, responsible for converting DC power to AC power. The figure illustrates the key derivation process, which involves the use of a key generator and a key distribution network. The key is then used to encrypt the data, ensuring secure communication.\nFigure 14.1-2: DC Key Derivation\nThe MME invokes the AKA procedures by requesting authentication vectors to the HE (Home environment) if no unused EPS authentication vectors have been stored. The HE sends an authentication response back to the MME that contains a fresh authentication vector, including a base-key named KASME. Thus, as a result of an AKA run, the EPC and the UE share KASME. From KASME, the NAS keys, (and indirectly) KeNB keys and NH are derived. The KASME is never transported to an entity outside of the EPC, but KeNB and NH are transported to the eNB from the EPC when the UE transitions to ECM-CONNECTED. From the KeNB, the eNB and UE can derive the UP and RRC keys.\nRRC and UP keys are refreshed at handover. KeNB* is derived by UE and source eNB from target PCI, target frequency and KeNB (this is referred to as a horizontal key derivation and is indicated to UE with an NCC that does not increase) or from target PCI, target frequency and NH (this is referred to as a vertical key derivation and is indicated to UE with an NCC increase). KeNB* is then used as new KeNB for RRC and UP traffic at the target. When the UE goes into ECM-IDLE all keys are deleted from the eNB except for the UE which was enabled to use User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation.\nFor SCG Bearers in DC, UP keys are updated at SCG change by indicating in RRC signalling to the UE the value of the SCG Counter to be used in key derivation. When KeNB is refreshed, SCG Counter shall be reset and S-KeNB shall be newly derived from the KeNB.\nCOUNT reusing avoidance for the same radio bearer identity in RRC_CONNECTED mode without KeNB change is left to eNB implementation e.g. by using intra-cell handover, smart management of radio bearer identities or triggering a transition to RRC_IDLE.\nSCG bearers in DC share a common pool of radio bearer identities (DRB IDs) together with the MCG bearers and when no new DRB ID can be allocated for an SCG bearer without guaranteeing COUNT reuse avoidance, the MeNB shall derive a new S-KeNB. SeNB indicates to MeNB when uplink or downlink PDCP COUNTs are about to wrap around and MeNB shall update the S-KeNB. To update the S-KeNB, the MeNB increases the SCG Counter and uses it to derive a new S-KeNB from the currently active KeNB in the MeNB. The MeNB sends the newly derived S-KeNB to the SeNB. The newly derived S-KeNB is then used by the SeNB in computing a new encryption key KUPenc which is used with all DRBs in the SeNB for this UE. Furthermore, when the SCG Counter approaches its maximum value, the MeNB refreshes the currently active KeNB, before any further S-KeNB is derived.\nIn case of HFN de-synchronisation in RRC_CONNECTED mode between the UE and eNB, the UE is pushed to IDLE.\nWhen AS security context is to be established in the eNB, the MME sends the complete UE security capabilities to the eNB (i.e. all bits for every EPS or NR security capability defined in TS 24.301 [20] and received in NAS signaling). At handover (or during Dual Connectivity or at UE Context retrieval), the complete UE security capabilities are also sent by the source eNB to the target eNB (or by the old eNB to the new eNB or by the MeNB to the SeNB respectively).\n",

MBSFN Synchronization Areas are independent from the definition of MBMS Service Areas\nMBSFN Transmission or a transmission in MBSFN mode: a simulcast transmission technique realised by transmission of identical waveforms at the same time from multiple cells. An MBSFN Transmission from multiple cells within the MBSFN Area is seen as a single transmission by a UE.\nMBSFN Area: an MBSFN Area consists of a group of cells within an MBSFN Synchronization Area of a network, which are co-ordinated to achieve an MBSFN Transmission. Except for the MBSFN Area Reserved Cells, all cells within an MBSFN Area contribute to the MBSFN Transmission and advertise its availability. The UE may only need to consider a subset of the MBSFN areas that are configured, i.e. when it knows which MBSFN area applies for the service(s) it is interested to receive.\n\nThe figure depicts MBMS definitions, illustrating the various components and their roles in the MBMS architecture.

The figure also shows the interconnection between the different layers, including the E-MBMS Core, E-MBMS Core-to-Core, and E-MBMS Core-to-Edge. The figure is a crucial visual aid for understanding the complex network architecture of E-MBMS.\nFigure 15.1.1-1: E-MBMS Logical Architecture\nFigure 15.1.1-1 depicts the E-MBMS Logical Architecture.\nMulti-cell/multicast Coordination Entity (MCE)\nThe MCE is a logical entity – this does not preclude the possibility that it may be part of another network element – whose functions are:\n-\tthe admission control and the allocation of the radio resources used by all eNBs in the MBSFN area for multi-cell MBMS transmissions using MBSFN operation. The MCE decides not to establish the radio bearer(s) of the new MBMS service(s) if the radio resources are not sufficient for the corresponding MBMS service(s) or may pre-empt radio resources from other radio bearer(s) of ongoing MBMS service(s) according to ARP.

The coordination of the functions between MCEs is provided by OAM, if needed.\nThe MCE is involved in MBMS Session Control Signalling. The MCE does not perform UE - MCE signalling.\nAn eNB is served by a single MCE.\nE-MBMS Gateway (MBMS GW)\nThe MBMS GW is a logical entity – this does not preclude the possibility that it may be part of another network element – that is present between the BMSC and eNBs whose principal functions is the sending/broadcasting of MBMS packets to each eNB transmitting the service. The MBMS GW uses IP Multicast as the means of forwarding MBMS user data to the eNB. The MBMS GW performs MBMS Session Control Signalling (Session start/update/stop) towards the E-UTRAN via MME.\nControl Plane Interfaces\n\"M3\" Interface: MCE – MME\nAn Application Part is defined for this interface between MME and MCE. This application part allows for MBMS Session Control Signalling on E-RAB level (i.e. does not convey radio configuration data). The procedures comprise e.g. MBMS Session Start and Stop. SCTP is used as signalling transport i.e. Point-to-Point signalling is applied.\n\"M2\" Interface: MCE – eNB\nAn Application Part is defined for this interface, which conveys at least radio configuration data for the multi-cell transmission mode eNBs and Session Control Signalling. SCTP is used as signalling transport i.e. Point-to-Point signalling is applied.\nUser Plane Interface\n\"M1\" Interface: MBMS GW – eNB\nThis interface is a pure user plane interface. Consequently no Control Plane Application Part is defined for this interface. IP Multicast is used for point-to-multipoint delivery of user packets.\nDeployment consideration\nThe two envisaged alternatives are shown in Figure 15.1.1-2.\nThe architecture on the right part is defined as the \"distributed MCE architecture\". In this architecture, a MCE is part of the eNB and the M2 interface should be kept between the MCE and the corresponding eNB.\nThe architecture on the left part is defined as the \"centralized MCE architecture\". In this architecture, the MCE is a logical entity which means it can be deployed as a stand-alone physical entity or collocated in another physical entity e.g. eNB. In both cases of the centralized MCE architecture, the M2 interface is kept between the MCE and all eNB(s) belonging to the corresponding MBSFN area.\nThe eMBMS architecture, which stands for Enhanced Mobile Broadband System, is a wireless communication technology that aims to provide high-speed data services to mobile users. The figure depicts various deployment alternatives for eMBMS, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-multipoint with backhaul. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing management in ensuring efficient and reliable eMBMS services.\nFigure 15.1.1-2: eMBMS Architecture deployment alternatives\nMBMS for V2X\nWhen MBMS is used to deliver downlink V2X messages, the localized MBMS specified in TS 23.285 [72] may be used to improve latency if desired.\nSingle TMGI in non-overlapped MBMS service areas or multiple TMGIs in overlapped MBMS service areas may be used to support small MBMS areas for V2X.\n",

An MBSFN Area contains one or more MCHs. An MCH specific MCS is used for all subframes of the MCH that do not use the MCS indicated in BCCH. All MCHs have the same coverage area.\nFor MCCH and MTCH, the UE shall not perform RLC re-establishment at cell change between cells of the same MBSFN area. Within the MBSFN subframes, all MCHs within the same MBSFN area occupy a pattern of subframes, not necessarily adjacent in time, that is common for all these MCHs and is therefore called the Common Subframe Allocation (CSA) Pattern. The CSA pattern is periodically repeated with the CSA period. The actual MCH subframe allocation (MSA) for every MCH carrying MTCH is defined by the CSA pattern, the CSA period, and the MSA end, that are all signalled on MCCH. The MSA end indicates the last subframe of the MCH within the CSA period. Consequently, the MCHs are time multiplexed within the CSA period, which finally defines the interleaving degree between the MCHs. It shall be possible for MCHs to not use all MBSFN resources signalled as part of the Rel-8 MBSFN signalling. Further, such MBSFN resource can be shared for more than one purpose (MBMS, Positioning, etc.). During one MCH scheduling period (MSP), which is configurable per MCH, the eNB applies MAC multiplexing of different MTCHs and optionally MCCH to be transmitted on this MCH.\nMCH scheduling information (MSI) is provided per MCH to indicate which subframes are used by each MTCH during the MSP, and to indicate whether transmission for an MTCH is going to be, or has been, suspended by the eNode B. The following principles are used for the MSI:\n-\tit is used both when services are multiplexed onto the MCH and when only a single service is transmitted on the MCH;\n-\tit is generated by the eNB and provided once at the beginning of the MSP;\n-\tit has higher scheduling priority than the MCCH and, when needed, it appears first in the PDU;\n-\tit allows the receiver to determine what subframes are used by every MTCH, sessions are scheduled in the order in which they are included in the MCCH session list;\n-\tit is carried in a MAC control element which cannot be segmented;\n-\tit carries the mapping of MTCHs to the subframes of the associated MSP. This mapping is based on the indexing of subframes belonging to one MSP;\n-\tit carries an indication of whether the transmission of an MTCH is to be suspended by the eNode B.\nThe content synchronization for multi-cell transmission is provided by the following principles:\n1.\tAll eNBs in a given MBSFN Synchronization Area have a synchronized radio frame timing such that the radio frames are transmitted at the same time and have the same SFN.\n2.\tAll eNBs have the same configuration of RLC/MAC/PHY for each MBMS service, and identical information (e.g. time information, transmission order/priority information) such that synchronized MCH scheduling in the eNBs is ensured. These are indicated in advance by the MCE.\n3.\tAn E-MBMS GW sends/broadcasts MBMS packet with the SYNC protocol to each eNB transmitting the service.\n4.\tThe SYNC protocol provides additional information so that the eNBs identify the transmission radio frame(s). The E-MBMS GW does not need accurate knowledge of radio resource allocation in terms of exact time division (e.g. exact start time of the radio frame transmission).\n5.\teNB buffers MBMS packet and waits for the transmission timing indicated in the SYNC protocol.\n6.\tThe segmentation/concatenation is needed for MBMS packets and should be totally up to the RLC/MAC layer in eNB.\n7.\tThe SYNC protocol provides means to detect packet loss(es) and supports a recovery mechanism robust against loss of consecutive PDU packets (MBMS Packets with SYNC Header).\n8.\tFor the packet loss case the transmission of radio blocks potentially impacted by the lost packet should be muted.\n9.\tThe mechanism supports indication or detection of MBMS data burst termination (e.g. to identify and alternately use available spare resources related to pauses in the MBMS PDU data flow).\n10.\tIf two or more consecutive SYNC SDUs within a SYNC bearer are not received by the eNB, or if no SYNC PDUs of Type 0 or 3 are received for some synchronization sequence, the eNB may mute the exact subframes impacted by lost SYNC PDUs using information provided by SYNC protocol. If not muting only those exact subframes, the eNB stops transmitting the associated MCH from the subframe corresponding to the consecutive losses until the end of the corresponding MSP and it does not transmit in the subframe corresponding to the MSI of that MSP.\n11.\tThe eNB sets VT(US) to zero in the RLC UM entity corresponding to an MCCH at its modification period boundary.\n12.\tThe eNB sets VT(US) to zero in each RLC UM entity corresponding to an MTCH at the beginning of its MSP.\n13.\tThe eNB sets every bit in the MAC padding on MCH to \"0\".\n14.\tThe eNB's RLC concatenates as many RLC SDUs from the same radio bearer as possible.\n15.\tThe eNB's MAC multiplexes as many RLC PDUs as fit in the Transport Block.\n16.\tThe eNB sets every padding bit in the RLC UM PDU corresponding to an MTCH or MCCH to \"0\".\n17.\tA MAC PDU including a MAC subheader for a MTCH MAC SDU always includes non-zero size of MTCH MAC SDU.\n18.\tA MAC PDU including a MAC subheader for a MSI MAC control element always includes non-zero size of MSI MAC control element.\n",

This time stamp is based on a common time reference, and common start of the first synchronisation period available at the BM-SC and the concerned eNBs and represents a relative time value which refers to the start time of the synchronisation period.\nThe BM-SC shall set the timestamp of all SYNC PDU packets in one synchronisation sequence of an MBMS service to the same value. The BM-SC should take into account the following factors for setting the timestamp: arrival time of data, the Maximum Transmission Delay from the BM-SC to the farthermost eNB, the length of the synchronisation sequence used for time stamping and other extra delay (e.g. processing delay in the eNB). The MSP length is one or multiple times of the synchronisation sequence length for MBMS services in the MCH.\nMBMS user data shall be time-stamped based on separable synchronisation sequences which are tied to multiples of the TTI length. Each synchronisation sequence for each service is denoted by a single timestamp value working in such a manner that an increase of the timestamp value by one or more synchronisation sequence lengths shall be interpreted as an implicit start-of-a-new-synchronisation-sequence-indicator, so that the eNB becomes aware that a new sequence is starting.\nThe BM-SC does not know the absolute time point at which a TTI starts, but the sequence length for the time stamp is set by O&M like the delay parameters. The BM-SC will use the delay parameters to define the transmission time point of that user data packet and for the following user data packets the sequence length for the time stamp: following user data packets arriving within e.g. 40ms will receive the same time stamp value as the first data packet, if the sequence length is set to be 40ms.\nIn MBSFN operation,the eNB shall schedule the received data packets in the first MSP following the time point indicated by the timestamp unless the MBMS service is suspended, in which case no packet shall be sent by eNB. When a suspended MBMS service is resumed, the eNB shall enable the transmission from the beginning of the Modification Period indicated by the MCCH Update Time.\nThe elementary procedures related to the SYNC-protocol are defined in TS 25.446 [36].\nBased on the parameters in the SYNC Header (e.g. Timestamp, Packet Number, Elapsed Octet Counter), the eNB is able to derive the timing for downlink radio transmission and notice if any SYNC packets are lost during transmission from BM-SC to the eNB. The eNB is also able to know the size of the lost SYNC packet in case a single SYNC packet is lost. Furthermore, the eNB may also be able to know the sizes of each lost SYNC packet if multiple consecutive SYNC packets are lost. Additionally the eNB is able to reorder the PDUs before passing them to RLC processing, if needed.\nAt the end of each synchronisation sequence the BM-SC shall send to the eNBs a user data frame, which contains counter information including 'Total Number Of Packet Counter' and 'Total Number Of Octet' without MBMS payload. This Total Counter frame is implicitly marking the end-of-sync.seq. The Total Counter frame without payload may be repeated in order to improve the reliability of the delivery to the eNBs.\nIn MBSFN operation, in case the SYNC protocol delivers more data for an MCH than the air interface can transport in the scheduling period, the following procedure shall be used by the eNB. As long as the eNB must drop a packet because it has too much data for this MCH scheduling period, it does the following,\n-\tselect the last bearer according to the order in the MCCH list with a SYNC SDU available for dropping;\n-\tfor the selected bearer, drop the available SYNC SDU with the highest Packet Number among the SYNC SDUs with the latest Timestamp.\nA SYNC SDU is considered available for dropping when the eNB knows its size and it has not been dropped by the eNB.\nIn SC-PTM operation, if/how to use the timestamp information is left to eNB implementation.\n",

the following modifications:\n-\tthe UE which is receiving MBMS service(s) via MBSFN or SC-PTM and can only receive these MBMS service(s) via MBSFN or SC-PTM while camping on the frequency providing these MBMS service(s) is allowed to make this frequency highest priority;\n-\tthe UE which is interested in receiving MBMS service(s) via MBSFN or SC-PTM and can only receive these MBMS service(s) via MBSFN or SC-PTM while camping on the frequency providing these MBMS service(s) is allowed to make this frequency highest priority when it intends to receive these MBMS service(s);\n-\twhen the MBMS service(s) which the UE is interested in are no longer available (after the end of the session) or the UE is no longer interested in receiving the service(s), the UE no longer prioritises the frequency providing these MBMS service(s);\nNOTE 1:\tIn RRC IDLE, when the above modifications to cell reselection rules are applied, the prioritization between the frequency providing these MBMS service(s) and the frequency of a CSG cell, and the autonomous search are left to UE implementation.\nFor NB-IoT UEs, BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, the UE applies the normal cell reselection rules with the following modifications:\n-\tthe UE which is receiving MBMS service(s) via SC-PTM and can only receive these MBMS service(s) via SC-PTM while camping on the frequency providing these MBMS service(s) applies an offset signalled in SystemInformationBlockType5-NB for NB-IoT UEs and SystemInformationBlockType5 for BL UEs or UEs in CE to this frequency in ranking based cell reselection;\n-\tthe UE which is interested in receiving MBMS service(s) via SC-PTM and can only receive these MBMS service(s) via SC-PTM while camping on the frequency providing these MBMS service(s) applies an offset signalled in SystemInformationBlockType5-NB for NB-IoT UEs and SystemInformationBlockType5 for BL UEs or UEs in CE to this frequency in ranking based cell reselection;\n-\twhen the MBMS service(s) which the UE is interested in are no longer available (after the end of the session) or the UE is no longer interested in receiving the service(s), the UE no longer apply the offset to the frequency providing these MBMS service(s) in ranking based cell reselection.\nExcept for NB-IoT UEs, in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE that is receiving or interested to receive MBMS via MBSFN or SC-PTM informs the network about its MBMS interest via a RRC message and the network does its best to ensure that the UE is able to receive MBMS and unicast services subject to the UE's capabilities:\n-\tthe UE indicates the frequencies which provide the service(s) that the UE is receiving or is interested to receive simultaneously, and which can be received simultaneously in accordance with the UE capabilities.\n-\tif the PCell broadcasts SystemInformationBlockType20, the UE also indicates the list of services that the UE is receiving or is interested to receive on the indicated frequencies.\n-\tthe UE indicates its MBMS interest at RRC connection establishment (the UE does not need to wait until AS security is activated), and whenever the set of frequencies on which the UE is interested in receiving MBMS services has changed compared with the last indication sent to the network (e.g. due to a change of user interest or of service availability), and whenever the list of MBMS services that the UE is interested in receiving has changed compared with the last indication sent to the network.\n-\tthe UE may only indicate its interest when the PCell provides SystemInformationBlockType15 and after having acquired SystemInformationBlockType15 of the current PCell.\n-\tthe UE may indicate its MBMS interest even if the current configured serving cell(s) do not prevent it from receiving the MBMS services it is interested in.\n-\tthe UE indicates with a single bit whether it prioritises MBMS reception over unicast. This priority indication applies to all unicast bearers and all MBMS frequencies. It is sent whether the MBMS frequencies are congested or not.\n-\tthe E-UTRAN reuses the SupportedBandCombination IE to derive the UEs MBMS related reception capabilities, i.e. the E-UTRAN tries to ensure that the UE is able to receive MBMS and unicast bearers by providing them on the frequencies indicated in SupportedBandCombination IE signalled by the UE. The UE supporting MBMS reception via MBSFN or SC-PTM shall support MBMS reception via MBSFN or SC-PTM respectively, on any serving cell and on any cell that may be additionally configured as serving cell according to the UE capabilities.\n-\tthe E-UTRAN tries to ensure that the UE which does not support simultaneous reception of unicast transmission and SC-PTM transmission in one subframe on one carrier is able to receive the indicated MBMS services transmitted via SC-PTM and to receive unicast bearers by scheduling them in different subframes.\n-\tfor handover preparation, the source eNB transfers the MBMS interest of the UE, if available, to the target eNB. After handover, the UE reads SystemInformationBlockType15 before updating its MBMS interest. If SystemInformationBlockType15 is provided on the target cell but not on the source cell, the UE indicates its MBMS interest after handover.\nIf MBMS is prioritised and the unicast connection cannot be maintained because of congestion on the MBMS carrier then the E-UTRAN releases unicast bearers. It is left to E-UTRAN implementation whether all bearers or only GBR bearers are released. The E-UTRAN does not trigger re-establishment of the released unicast bearers. For congestion control, the E-UTRAN can rely on existing access control mechanisms.\nThe E-UTRAN may take into account the UE priority for MBMS or unicast reception when receiving an indication of proximity to a CSG cell from a UE which also indicated interest in MBMS reception (or vice-versa).\n",

                    "text_content": "Considerable gain in radio resource efficiency can be achieved by multiplexing several E-MBMS services on a single MCH. The services that share the resources are called E-MBMS Service Multiplex. The amount of common radio resources allocated to such an E-MBMS Service Multiplex can be smaller than the sum of radio resources, which would need to be allocated for the individual services without multiplexing. This represents the statistical multiplexing gain.\nThe MCE manages the E-MBMS Service Multiplex e.g. deciding which services are to be multiplexed on which MCH. The duration of each E-MBMS service may be different, so there is a need to manage the Service Multiplex dynamically, i.e. addition or removal of services into/from the E-MBMS Service Multiplex. The MCE allocates the optimal amount of resources to multiplexed services, using service related information. The MCE selects the CSA pattern for the MCHs and also the order in which the services appear in the MCCH. MBSFN transmission is ensured by identical multiplexing of the services in all cells belonging to the same MBSFN area. The location of the multiplexing function is in the eNB MAC layer.\nThese functions are supported by respective signalling information on M2 interface. This scheduling information is sent to all eNBs via the M2 interface procedure \"MBMS Scheduling Information\".\nThe figure depicts a flowchart illustrating the scheduling information procedure message flow on the M2 interface of a M-bus system. The message flow includes the initiation of the message, the transmission of the message, and the reception of the message. The message is then processed and the result is returned to the sender.

If not, MCE decides not to establish the radio bearers of the MBMS service(s) and does not forward the MBMS session start request message to the involved eNBs, or may pre-empt radio resources from other radio bearer(s) of ongoing MBMS service(s) according to ARP. The MCE confirms the reception of the MBMS Session Start request to the MME. This message can be transmitted before the step 4.

ICIC mechanism includes a frequency domain component and time domain component. ICIC is inherently a multi-cell RRM function that needs to take into account information (e.g. the resource usage status and traffic load situation) from multiple cells. The preferred ICIC method may be different in the uplink and downlink.\nThe frequency domain ICIC manages radio resource, notably the radio resource blocks, such that multiple cells coordinate use of frequency domain resources.\nIn TDD, intended UL-DL configuration may be exchanged through backhaul signalling, and frequency domain ICIC information may be exchanged per subframe set, such that multiple cells may coordinate the usage of frequency domain resources in the subframe sets.\nFor the time domain ICIC, subframe utilization across different cells are coordinated in time through backhaul signalling or OAM configuration of so called Almost Blank Subframe patterns. The Almost Blank Subframes (ABSs) in an aggressor cell are used to protect resources in subframes in the victim cell receiving strong inter-cell interference. Almost blank subframes are subframes with reduced transmit power (including no transmission) on some physical channels and/or reduced activity. The eNB ensures backwards compatibility towards UEs by transmitting necessary control channels and physical signals as well as System Information. Patterns based on ABSs are signalled to the UE to restrict the UE measurement to specific subframes, called measurement resource restrictions. There are different patterns depending on the type of measured cell (serving or neighbour cell) and measurement type (e.g. RRM, RLM). MBSFN subframes can be used for time domain ICIC when they are also included in ABS patterns. The eNB cannot configure MBSFN subframes, as specified in TS 36.211 [4], as ABSs when these MBSFN subframes are used for other usages (e.g., MBMS, LCS).\nExtending the coverage of a cell by means of connecting a UE to cell that is weaker than the strongest detected cell is referred to as cell range extension (CRE). With time domain ICIC, a CRE UE may continue to be served by a victim cell (i.e., the weaker cell) even while under strong interference from aggressor cells (i.e., the stronger cell).\nA UE under strong interference from aggressor cells may need to mitigate interference from the aggressor cells on some physical channels and signals in order to receive data from serving cell or to detect the weak cells or to perform measurements on the weak cells.\nThe network may provide SIB1 to the UE in the CRE region by a dedicated RRC signalling to assist UE system information acquisition.\nICIC is located in the eNB.\nFor the UE to measure \"protected\" resources of the serving cell and/or neighbour cells, RRM/RLM/CSI measurement resource restriction is signalled to the UE. There are three kinds of measurement resource restriction patterns that may be configured for the UE.\n-\tPattern 1:\tA single RRM/RLM measurement resource restriction for the PCell.\n-\tPattern 2:\tA single RRM measurement resource restriction for indicated list of neighbour cells operating in the same carrier frequency as the PCell.\n-\tPattern 3:\tResource restriction for CSI measurement of the PCell. If configured, two subframe subsets are configured per UE. The UE reports CSI for each configured subframe subset.\nFor pattern 3, it is up to the network to choose the two subframe subsets but typically the two subframe subsets are chosen with the expectation that CSI measurements using the two configured subframe subsets are subject to different levels of interference (e.g., one subframe subset indicates ABSs while the second subframe subset indicates non-ABSs). For periodic CSI reports, linkage of each CSI report to a configured subset of subframe is defined in TS 36.331 [16]. For aperiodic CSI reports, the UE reports CSI based on the subframe subset containing the CSI reference resource.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED, the RRM/RLM/CSI measurement resource restrictions are configured by dedicated RRC signalling.\nThe network may configure the UE with CRS assistance information of the aggressor cells in order to aid the UE to mitigate the interference from CRS of the aggressor cells.\nWhen the time-domain inter-cell interference coordination is used for non-members UE in close proximity of a CSG cell, OAM configures a CSG cell not to use a time domain resource set (i.e. a set of subframes), so that a non-member UE in close proximity of the CSG cell can be still served by another cell. OAM also configures a cell neighbour to a CSG cell with the protected time domain resource set not used by the CSG cell, so that the neighbour cell knows which time domain resource can be used for a non-member UE in close proximity of the CSG cell.\nWhen the time-domain inter-cell interference coordination is used to mitigate interference between two cells using X2 signalling of ABS patterns from an interfering eNB to an interfered eNB, the following OAM requirements are applied.\n-\tOAM may configure association between eNBs to use the time-domain inter-cell interference coordination.\n-\tFor the deployment scenarios where common subset for ABS patterns from multiple interfering cells is desirable, OAM configuration ensures that a 'common subset' exists between the ABS patterns of those interfering cells.\nNOTE 1:\tThe possibility of whether the common ABS pattern from multiple eNBs is desirable or not depends on the deployment cases of the time domain solution of inter-cell interference coordination.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is up to eNB implementation how a receiving eNB derives the 'usable ABS subset' from the ABS patterns coming from multiple neighbour eNBs.\n",

The benefit metric associated with the CoMP hypotheses quantifies the benefit assuming that the CoMP hypotheses are applied. The receiving eNB of the CoMP hypotheses and the benefit metrics may take them into account for RRM.\nRSRP measurement reports and CSI reports may be exploited for inter-eNB CoMP. For example, the RSRP measurement reports and CSI reports can be used to determine and/or validate CoMP hypotheses and benefit metrics.\nThe enhanced RNTP may be used in inter-eNB CoMP to exchange information between eNBs concerning the adopted power allocation.\nInter-eNB CoMP is located in the eNB.\n",

            "description": "RRC signalling carries AS capabilities and NAS signalling carries NAS capabilities. When a capability ID is used as described below, the ID representing AS capabilities may be carried in NAS signalling. The UE capability information is stored in the MME. In the uplink, except of NB-IoT no capability information is sent early in e.g. RRCConnectionRequest message. For NB-IoT, early indications for multi-tone support (IOT bit) and multi-carrier support (IOT bit) are sent in RRCConnectionRequest-NB message. In the downlink, enquiry procedure of the UE capability is supported.\nThe figure depicts the initial UE capability handling in a 5G network, illustrating the various stages of signal processing and transmission. The figure includes a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 18-1: Initial UE Capability Handling\nThe MME stores the UE Radio Capability uploaded in the UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message.\nThe possible RAT-Types are: EUTRAN, UTRAN, GERAN-PS, GERAN-CS, CDMA2000-1XRTT. The GERAN capability is divided into separate parts. MS Classmark 2 and Classmark 3 are used for CS domain (in both AS and NAS) and MS Radio Access Capability is used for PS domain. The main part of CDMA2000 capabilities is not handled by the eNB or the MME, but is exchanged via tunnelling (see 10.3.2). The small part of CDMA2000 capabilities (for CDMA2000-1XRTT) is needed for the eNB to be able to build messages for the target CDMA2000 RNC (see 10.3.2).\nThe eNB may acquire the UE capabilities after a Handover completion. The UE capabilities are then uploaded to the MME.\nUsually during handover preparation, the source RAN node transfers both the UE source RAT capabilities and the target RAT capabilities to the target RAN node, in order to minimize interruptions and to follow the principles in clause 10.2.2. The source RAN is not mandated to acquire other RAT capabilities (i.e. other than the source and target RAT capabilities) in order to start a handover preparation. This is described in clause 19.2.2.5.6. However, there are exceptions to this principle:\n-\tFor handover from GERAN to EUTRAN, due to limitations in GERAN radio interface signalling, source RAT (GERAN) never provides the EUTRA capabilities to the target RAN node.\n-\tAt handover from UTRAN to EUTRAN, it is optional to forward the UTRAN capabilities to the target RAN.\nThe UTRAN capabilities, i.e. the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO, include START-CS, START-PS and \"predefined configurations\", which are \"dynamic\" IEs. In order to avoid the START values desynchronisation and the key replaying issue, the eNB always enquiry the UE UTRAN capabilities at transition from RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED and before Handover to UTRAN. The eNB does not upload the UE UTRAN capabilities to the MME.\nDue to limitations in radio interface signalling, transfer of EUTRA capabilities is not supported in GERAN.\nFor BL UEs, UEs supporting Enhanced Coverage and NB-IoT UEs, the S1 signalling includes the UE Radio Capability for Paging. The eNB uploads the UE Radio Capability for Paging to the MME in the UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message separately from the UE Radio Capability. The MME includes the UE Radio Capability for Paging in the paging request to the eNB. The eNB may use the UE Radio Capability for Paging to determine how to page the UE.\nFor a NB-IoT UE that supports S1-U data transfer or User Plane CIoT EPS optimisations, as defined in TS 24.301 [20], the procedure in Figure 18-1 is applicable except that RAT-Types and handover are not supported.\nIf a request to retrieve the UE Radio Capability is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the eNB may request the UE Radio Capability from the UE and provide it to the MME in the UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message. The detailed procedure is defined in TS 36.413 [25].\nFor a UE that supports Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, as defined in TS 24.301 [20], the MME may initiate Connection Establishment Indication procedure to provide UE Radio Capability to the eNB after receiving INITIAL UE MESSAGE message. If the UE Radio Capability is not included in the procedure, this may trigger the eNB to request the UE Radio Capability from the UE and to provide it to the MME in the UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message. The detailed procedure is defined in TS 36.413 [25].\nIn NB-IoT, for a UE that supports Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisations, as defined in TS 24.301 [20], the eNB, based on configuration, may retrieve the UE Radio capability from the MME upon reception of RRC Connection Request as defined in TS 23.401 [17], clauses 5.3.4B.2 and 5.3.4B.3.\nIf supported by the UE and the network, the UE may provide an ID in NAS signalling that represents its radio capabilities for one or more RATs in order to reduce signalling overhead. The ID may be assigned either by the manufacturer or by the serving PLMN. The manufacturer-assigned ID corresponds to a pre-provisioned set of capabilities. In the case of the PLMN-assigned ID, assignment takes place in NAS signalling.\n",

Initial Context Setup is initiated by the MME.\nThe UE Context Modification function supports the modification of UE Context in eNB for UEs in active state.\nThe UE Context Resume function supports the suspension and resumption of an established UE Context and allows keeping the UE Context in eNB for UEs that were sent to RRC_IDLE and may resume the RRC connection without the necessity to re-establish the UE Context in the eNB.\nThe Intra-LTE-Handover function supports mobility for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED and comprises the preparation, execution and completion of handover via the X2 and S1 interfaces.\nThe Inter-3GPP-RAT Handover function supports mobility to and from other 3GPP-RATs for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED and comprises the preparation, execution and completion of handover via the S1 interface.\nThe E-RAB Service management function is responsible for establishing, modifying and releasing E-UTRAN resources for user data transport once a UE context is available in the eNB. The establishment and modification of E-UTRAN resources is triggered by the MME and requires respective QoS information to be provided to the eNB. The release of E-UTRAN resources is triggered by the MME either directly or following a request received from the eNB (optional).\nFor DC when SCG bearer option is applied, the modification of the E-RAB is triggered by the MeNB towards the MME for the modification of the transport information.\nThe NAS Signalling Transport function provides means to transport or reroute a NAS message (e.g. for NAS mobility management) for a specific UE on the S1 interface.\nThe interconnection of eNBs or HeNB GW, if deployed, to multiple MME/Serving S-GWs is supported in the E-UTRAN/EPC architecture. Therefore a NAS node selection function is located in the eNB or the HeNB GW, if deployed, to determine the MME association of the UE, based on the UE's temporary identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the CN node (e.g. MME or SGSN).\nNOTE:\tIn case the UE's temporary identifier is assigned by the SGSN, respective mapping rules are defined in TS 23.003 [26].\nDepending on the actual scenario the NNSF determines the UE's MME association either based its S-TMSI (e.g. at service request) or based on its GUMMEI and selected PLMN (e.g. at attach or tracking area update in non-registered TA).\nThe NNSF in the eNB or HeNB GW, if deployed, may differentiate between a GUMMEI mapped from P-TMSI/RAI and a native GUMMEI as described in TS 23.401 [17].\nThis functionality is located in the eNB or in the HeNB GW, if deployed, and enables proper routing via the S1 interface. On S1, no specific procedure corresponds to the NAS Node Selection Function.\neNB selects serving MME based on the DCN-ID provided by the UE and the configuration in eNB if a serving MME corresponding to the information provided by the UE (e.g. GUTI, etc.) cannot be found by eNB as described in TS 23.401[17].\nThe S1-interface management functions provide\n-\tmeans to ensure a defined start of S1-interface operation (reset);\n-\tmeans to handle different versions of application part implementations and protocol errors (error indication).\nMME Load balancing is the function which achieves load-balanced MMEs with respect to their processing capacity within a pool area during system operation. The means to load-balance MMEs is to distribute UEs newly entering the pool to different MMEs in the MME pool. In addition the MME load balancing function is able to achieve equally loaded MMEs within a pool area after the introduction of a new MME and after the removal of a MME from the network.\nThe support of the MME load balancing function is achieved by indicating the relative MME capacity in the S1 Setup procedure to all eNBs served by the MMEs of the pool area per MME. In order to support the introduction and/or removal of MMEs the MME initiated S1 setup update procedure may be used by the operator indicating relative MME capacity value changes. When there are more than one MME operational in the pool, the indicated relative MME capacity steers the UE assignment for UEs newly entering the MME pool. When there is only one MME operational in the pool, UEs may be assigned to this MME.\nThe MME Load balancing Function is described in detail in TS 23.401 [17].\nWhen DCN are used, the MME Load Balancing function is only performed between MMEs that belong to the same DCN.

The figure is a visual representation of the complex network operations, highlighting the importance of efficient network management in ensuring smooth communication.\nFigure 19.2.2.1-1: Paging procedure\nThe MME initiates the paging procedure by sending the PAGING message to each eNB with cells belonging to the tracking area(s) in which the UE is registered. Each eNB can contain cells belonging to different tracking areas, whereas each cell can only belong to one TA. In case MME initiates the paging procedure with eDRX configuration it shall include the S-TMSI in the PAGING message.\nThe paging response back to the MME is initiated on NAS layer and is sent by the eNB based on NAS-level routing information.\nThe S1 UE Context Release procedure causes the eNB to remove all UE individual signalling resources and the related user data transport resources. This procedure is initiated by the EPC and may be triggered on request of the serving eNB.\nThe figure depicts a S1 UE Context Release procedure (EPC triggered) in an LTE network, illustrating the steps taken by the UE to release its context.

The Initial Context Setup procedure is initiated by the MME.\nThe Initial Context Setup procedure comprises the following steps:\n-\tThe MME initiates the Initial Context Setup procedure by sending INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST to the eNB. This message may include general UE Context (e.g. security context, roaming and access restrictions, UE capability information, UE S1 signalling connection ID, CN assistance information, etc.), E-RAB context (Serving GW TEID, QoS information, Correlation id i.e. collocated L-GW TEID or GRE key in case of LIPA support or in case of SIPTO@LN with collocated L-GW support), and may be piggy-backed with the corresponding NAS messages. When there are multiple NAS messages in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message, the MME shall ensure that the NAS messages in the E-RAB to be Setup List are aligned in the order of reception from the NAS layer to ensure the in-sequence delivery of the NAS messages.\n-\tUpon receipt of INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST, the eNB setup the context of the associated UE, and perform the necessary RRC signalling towards the UE, e.g. Radio Bearer Setup procedure. When there are multiple NAS messages to be sent in the RRC message, the order of the NAS messages in the RRC message shall be kept the same as that in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message. If present, the eNB uses the CN assistance information as defined in TS 23.401[17] and propagates it during inter-eNB mobility.\n-\tThe eNB responds with INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE to inform a successful operation, and with INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP FAILURE to inform an unsuccessful operation.\nNOTE:\tIn case of failure, eNB and MME behaviours are not mandated. Both implicit release (local release at each node) and explicit release (MME-initiated UE Context Release procedure) may in principle be adopted. The eNB should ensure that no hanging resources remain at the eNB.\nThe figure depicts the initial context setup procedure in the Idle-to-Active procedure, highlighting the highlighted areas in blue. This procedure is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition from idle to active status, as it involves setting up the necessary parameters and configurations.\nFigure 19.2.2.3-1: Initial Context Setup procedure (highlighted in blue) in Idle-to-Active procedure\nThe UE Context Modification procedure enables the MME to modify the UE context in the eNB for UEs in active state. The UE Context Modification procedure is initiated by the MME.\nThe UE Context Modification procedure comprises the following steps:\n-\tThe MME initiates the UE Context Modification procedure by sending UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST to the eNB to modify the UE context in the eNB for UEs in active state.\n-\tThe eNB responds with UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE in case of a successful operation\n-\tIf the UE is served by a CSG cell, and is no longer a member of the CSG cell, the eNB may initiate a handover to another cell. If the UE is not handed over, the eNB should request the release of UE context;\n-\tIf the UE is served by a hybrid cell, and is no longer a CSG member of the hybrid cell, the eNB may provide the QoS for the UE as a non CSG member.\n-\tThe eNB responds with UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION FAILURE in case of an unsuccessful operation.\nThe figure depicts a UE context modification procedure, showing how the UE's context is modified to adapt to the changing environment. The figure includes various elements such as the UE's antenna, signal processing modules, and the network's infrastructure.

The figure shows the various components and steps involved in setting up an E-RAB network, including the use of radio frequency (RF) signals, power distribution, and network management. The figure is a crucial visual aid for understanding the technical aspects of E-RAB systems and their implementation.\nFigure 19.2.2.4.1-1: E-RAB Setup procedure\nThe E-RAB Setup procedure is initiated by the MME to support:\n-\tAssignment of resources to a dedicated E-RAB.\n-\tAssignment of resources for a default E-RAB.\n-\tSetup of S1 Bearer (on S1) and Data Radio Bearer (on Uu).\nThe E-RAB Setup procedure comprises the following steps:\n-\tThe E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message is sent by the MME to the eNB to setup resources on S1 and Uu for one or several E-RAB(s). The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message contains the Serving GW TEID, QoS indicator(s) and the corresponding NAS message per E-RAB within the E-RAB To Be Setup List. It may also include the Correlation id i.e. collocated L-GW TEID or GRE key in case of LIPA support or in case of SIPTO@LN with collocated L-GW support. When there are multiple NAS messages in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, the MME shall ensure that the NAS messages in the E-RAB to be Setup List are aligned in the order of reception from the NAS layer to ensure the in-sequence delivery of the NAS messages.\n-\tUpon receipt of the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message the eNB establishes the Data Radio Bearer(s) (RRC: Radio Bearer Setup) and resources for S1 Bearers. When there are multiple NAS messages to be sent in the RRC message, the order of the NAS messages in the RRC message shall be kept the same as that in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message.\n-\tThe eNB responds with a E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE messages to inform whether the setup of resources and establishment of each E-RAB was successful or unsuccessful, with the E-RAB Setup list (E-RAB ID, eNB TEID) and the E-RAB Failed to Setup list (E-RAB ID, Cause) The eNB also creates the binding between the S1 bearer(s) (DL/UL TEID) and the Data Radio Bearer(s).\nInteractions with UE Context Release Request procedure:\nIn case of no response from the UE the eNB shall trigger the S1 UE Context Release Request procedure.\nThe figure depicts a modification procedure for an E-RAB (Enhanced Radio Access Network) system, which is a crucial component in 5G networks.

The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message contains the QoS indicator(s), and the corresponding NAS message per E-RAB in the E-RAB To Be Modified List. When there are multiple NAS messages in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, the MME shall ensure that the NAS messages in the E-RAB to be Modified List are aligned in the order of reception from the NAS layer to ensure the in-sequence delivery of the NAS messages. The transport information for the new S-GW may be included in case of S-GW relocation without UE mobility.\n-\tUpon receipt of the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message the eNB modifies the Data Radio Bearer configuration (RRC procedure to modify the Data Radio bearer). When there are multiple NAS messages to be sent in the RRC message, the order of the NAS messages in the RRC message shall be kept the same as that in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message. In case of S-GW relocation without UE mobility, if transport information for the new S-GW is included, the eNB ignores the included QoS indicator and NAS message and uses the included transport information for S-GW selection.\n-\tThe eNB responds with an E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message to inform whether the E-RAB modification has succeeded or not indicating with the E-RAB Modify list and E-RAB Failed to Modify list. With E-RAB ID(s) in the E-RAB Modify List or E-RAB Failed to Modify List the eNB identifies the E-RAB(s) successfully modified or failed to modify.\nInteractions with UE Context Release Request procedure:\nIn case of no response from the UE the eNB shall trigger the S1 UE Context Release Request procedure.\nThe figure depicts the E-RAB (Enhanced Radio Access Network) release procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's lifecycle.

The current version of the specification supports the modification of the transport information and CSG membership verification. This procedure is used for DC if the SCG bearer option is applied.\nIf the EPC is able to apply the requested modification, the MME responds with the E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM.\nIf the EPC is not able to modify a transport path as requested, the MME responds with the list of E-RABs failed in the E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM, the MeNB either keeps the previous transport path unchanged and, if applicable, triggers to release the corresponding SCG bearers, or tears down the corresponding E-RABs.\nHandover signalling procedures support both, inter-eNB handover and inter-RAT handover.\nInter-RAT handovers shall be initiated via the S1 interface.\nInter-eNB handovers shall be initiated via the X2 interface except if any of the following conditions are true:\n-\tthe source eNB is not an RN and there is no X2 between source and target eNB.\n-\tthe source eNB is an RN and there is no X2 between DeNB and the target eNB or between the source RN and the DeNB.\n-\tthe source eNB is an RN and the UE's serving MME is not included in the MME Pool(s) connected with the target eNB.\n-\tthe source eNB has been configured to initiate handover to the particular target eNB via S1 interface in order to enable the change of an EPC node (MME and/or Serving GW).\n-\tthe source eNB has attempted to start the inter-eNB HO via X2 but receives a negative reply from the target eNB with a specific cause value.\nInter-eNB handovers shall be initiated via the S1 interface, if one of the above conditions applies.\nThe Handover preparation procedure is initiated by the source eNB if it determines the necessity to initiate the handover via the S1 interface.\nThe figure depicts the handover preparation procedure for a mobile network, illustrating the steps taken to ensure a smooth handover from one network to another. The figure shows the handover process from the mobile network to the core network, with various steps and components highlighted, such as the handover request, network handover, and network handover completion.

Figure 22.3.2a-1 shows ANR and its environment:\nThe figure depicts the interaction between an eNB (Enhanced Network Base Station) and O&M (Operational and Maintenance) due to ANR (Antenna-Related Issues). The eNB is shown in the upper left corner, while the O&M is located in the lower right corner. The figure illustrates the various scenarios where ANR can occur, such as when the eNB is in the middle of a call and the O&M is in the middle of a call, or when the eNB is in the middle of a call and the O&M is in the middle of a call. The figure also shows the various steps that can be taken to mitigate ANR, such as adjusting the eNB's power settings and the O&M's signal strength.\nFigure 22.3.2a-1: Interaction between eNB and O&M due to ANR\nThe ANR function resides in the eNB and manages the conceptual Neighbour Cell Relation Table (NCRT). Located within ANR, the Neighbour Detection Function finds new neighbours and adds them to the NCRT. ANR also contains the Neighbour Removal Function which removes outdated NCRs. The Neighbour Detection Function and the Neighbour Removal Function are implementation specific.\nA Neighbour Cell Relation (NCR) in the context of ANR is defined as follows:\nAn existing Neighbour Relation from a source cell to a target cell means that eNB controlling the source cell:\na)\tKnows the ECGI/CGI and PCI of the target cell.\nb)\tHas an entry in the Neighbour Cell Relation Table for the source cell identifying the target cell.\nc)\tHas the attributes in this Neighbour Cell Relation Table entry defined, either by O&M or set to default values.\nFor each cell that the eNB has, the eNB keeps a NCRT, see Figure 22.3.2a-1. For each NCR, the NCRT contains the Target Cell Identifier (TCI), which identifies the target cell. For E-UTRAN, the TCI corresponds to the E-UTAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI) and Physical Cell Identifier (PCI) of the target cell. Furthermore, each NCR has three attributes, the NoRemove, the NoHO and the NoX2 attribute. These attributes have the following definitions:\n-\tNo Remove: If checked, the eNB shall not remove the Neighbour Cell Relation from the NRT.\n-\tNo HO: If checked, the Neighbour Cell Relation shall not be used by the eNB for handover reasons.\n-\tNo X2: If checked, the Neighbour Relation shall not use an X2 interface in order to initiate procedures towards the eNB parenting the target cell.\nNeighbour Cell Relations are cell-to-cell relations, while an X2 link is set up between two eNBs. Neighbour Cell Relations are unidirectional, while an X2 link is bidirectional.\nNOTE:\tThe neighbour information exchange, which occurs during the X2 Setup procedure or in the eNB Configuration Update procedure, may be used for ANR purpose.\nThe ANR function also allows O&M to manage the NCRT. O&M can add and delete NCRs. It can also change the attributes of the NCRT. The O&M system is informed about changes in the NCRT.\n",

The RRC connection is released and the UE enters RRC_IDLE.\nWhen the UE is in RRC_IDLE and remains camped on the cell from which the ANR measurement configuration was received, the UE performs the ANR measurements requested by the eNB:\n2a\tFor each of the configured frequency, the UE performs measurements, identifies the strongest cell and stores the cell measurement results for later reporting.\n2b\tFor each of the configured frequency, if the NRSRP of the strongest cell is above the configured threshold, the UE reads the ECGI, the TAC and all available PLMN ID(s) of the related neighbour cell and stores the information for later reporting.\nNOTE:\tWhile performing an ANR measurement, the UE performs inter-frequency measurements on the configured frequency regardless of the measurement rules for cell re-selection and the relaxed monitoring measurement rules as specified in TS 36.304 [11].\nWhen the UE establishes or resumes the RRC connection:\n3\tThe UE reports the availability of an ANR report.\nWhen the eNB receives the indication of the ANR report availability, the following sequence may be used whilst UE is in RRC_CONNECTED mode:\n4\tThe eNB requests the UE to provide the report.\n5\tThe UE reports the stored cells and associated information.\nThe UE discards the ANR configuration and the ANR report when returning to RRC_IDLE after it has indicated the availability of the ANR report, after 96 hours of receiving the configuration, upon power off, upon detach or upon RAT change.\n",

                            "text_content": "The objective of load balancing is to distribute cell load evenly among cells or to transfer part of the traffic from congested cells. This is done by the means of self-optimisation of mobility parameters or handover actions.\nSelf-optimisation of the intra-LTE, inter-RAT and inter-system mobility parameters to the current load in the cell and in the adjacent cells can improve the system capacity compared to static/non-optimised cell reselection/handover parameters. Such optimisation can also minimize human intervention in the network management and optimisation tasks.\nSupport for mobility load balancing consists of one or more of following functions:\n-\tLoad reporting (for intra-LTE, inter-RAT, EN-DC and inter-system scenarios);\n-\tLoad balancing action based on handovers;\n-\tAdapting handover and/or reselection configuration.\nTriggering of each of these functions is optional and depends on implementation. Functional architecture is presented in Figure 22.4.1.1-1.\n\nThe figure depicts the functional architecture of SON load balancing, showing how it manages and distributes the load across multiple servers. The architecture includes a centralized load balancer, which distributes the load to the appropriate servers based on the load profile. This ensures that the system can handle high traffic loads and maintain a stable performance.\nFigure 22.4.1.1-1: Functional architecture of SON load balancing\nThe load reporting function is executed by exchanging cell specific load information between neighbour eNBs over the X2 interface (intra-LTE scenario) or S1 (inter-RAT scenario and EN-DC scenario). The load reporting function for inter-system load balancing is executed by exchanging load information between E-UTRAN and NG-RAN.\nThe load information consists of:\n-\tradio resource usage (UL/DL GBR PRB usage, UL/DL non-GBR PRB usage, UL/DL total PRB usage);\n-\tHW load indicator (UL/DL HW load: low, mid, high, overload);\n-\tTNL load indicator (UL/DL TNL load: low, mid, high, overload);\n-\t(Optionally) Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator: the same scale shall apply to E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN cells when mapping cell capacities on this value);\n-\tCapacity value (UL/DL available capacity for load balancing as percentage of total cell capacity).\nNOTE 1:\tCapacity value is expressed in available E-UTRAN resources.\nNOTE 2:\tA cell is expected to accept traffic corresponding to the indicated available capacity.\nThe load information consists of:\n-\tCell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator: the same scale shall apply to E-UTRAN, UTRAN, GERAN and eHRPD cells when mapping cell capacities on this value);\n-\tCapacity value (UL/DL available capacity for load balancing as percentage of total cell capacity).\nNOTE 1:\tCapacity value is expressed in available E-UTRAN resources.\nNOTE 2:\tA cell is expected to accept traffic corresponding to the indicated available capacity.\nEvent-triggered inter-RAT load reports are sent when the reporting node detects crossing of cell load thresholds.\nLoad information shall be provided in a procedure separated from existing active mode mobility procedures, which shall be used infrequently and with lower priority with respect to the UE dedicated signalling.\nThe load reporting function is executed by the way that an en-gNB provides its load information toward an eNB over the X2 interface.\nFor an NR cell, the following load related information should be supported which consists of:\n-\tRadio resource usage (per-SSB-area PRB usage: DL/UL/SUL GBR PRB usage, DL/UL/SUL non-GBR PRB usage, DL/UL/SUL total PRB usage, and DL/UL/SUL scheduling PDCCH CCE usage);\n-\tTNL capacity indicator (UL/DL TNL offered capacity and available capacity);\n-\tCell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);\n-\tCapacity value (UL/DL available capacity);\nTo achieve load reporting function, EN-DC Resource Status Reporting Initiation & EN-DC Resource Status Reporting procedures are used.\nBoth event-triggered and periodic inter-system load reporting are supported. Event-triggered inter-system load reports are sent when the reporting node detects crossing of cell load thresholds.\nThe following load related information should be supported which consists of:\n-\tCell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);\n-\tCapacity value (per cell: UL/DL available capacity);\n-\tRRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC Connection Capacity);\n-\tNumber of active UEs;\n-\tRadio Resource Status (per cell PRB usage: UL/DL GBR PRB usage, DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage, DL/UL total PRB usage, and DL/UL scheduling PDCCH CCE usage).\nNGAP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer and Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer.\nS1AP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are eNB Configuration Transfer and MME Configuration Transfer.\nThe source cell may initiate handover due to load (see clauses 10.1.2 and 10.2.2). The target cell performs admission control for the load balancing handovers. A handover preparation related to a mobility load balancing action shall be distinguishable from other handovers, so that the target cell is able to apply appropriate admission control.\nThis function enables requesting of a change of handover and/or reselection parameters at target cell. The source cell that initialized the load balancing estimates if it is needed to change mobility configuration in the source and/or target cell. If the amendment is needed, the source cell initializes mobility negotiation procedure toward the target cell.\nThe source cell informs the target cell about the new mobility setting and provides cause for the change (e.g. load balancing related request). The proposed change is expressed by the means of the difference (delta) between the current and the new values of the handover trigger. The handover trigger is the cell specific offset that corresponds to the threshold at which a cell initialises the handover preparation procedure. Cell reselection configuration may be amended to reflect changes in the HO setting. The target cell responds to the information from the source cell. The allowed delta range for HO trigger parameter may be carried in the failure response message. The source cell should consider the responses before executing the planned change of its mobility setting.\nAll automatic changes on the HO and/or reselection parameters must be within the range allowed by OAM.\n",

                            "text_content": "Mobility Robustness Optimisation aims at detecting and enabling correction of following problems:\n-\tConnection failure due to intra-LTE or inter-RAT mobility;\n-\tUnnecessary HO to another RAT (too early IRAT HO with no radio link failure);\n-\tInter-RAT ping-pong;\n-\tInter-system ping-pong.\nOne of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimisation is to detect connection failures that occur due to Too Early or Too Late Handovers, or Handover to Wrong Cell. These problems are defined as follows:\n-\t[Too Late Handover] An RLF occurs after the UE has stayed for a long period of time in the cell; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection in a different cell.\n-\t[Too Early Handover] An RLF occurs shortly after a successful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover failure occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection in the source cell.\n-\t[Handover to Wrong Cell] An RLF occurs shortly after a successful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover failure occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection in a cell other than the source cell and the target cell.\nIn the definition above, the \"successful handover\" refers to the UE state, namely the successful completion of the RA procedure.\nIn addition, MRO provides means to distinguish the above problems from LTE coverage related problems and other problems, not related to mobility.\nSolution for failure scenarios consists of one or more of following functions:\n-\tDetection of the failure after RRC re-establishment attempt;\n-\tDetection of the failure after RRC connection setup;\n-\tRetrieval of information needed for problem analysis.\nTriggering of each of these functions is optional and depends on situation and implementation.\nDetection of the failure after RRC re-establishment attempt:\nDetection mechanisms for Too Late Handover, Too Early Handover and Handover to Wrong Cell are carried out through the following:\n-\t[Too Late Handover]\nIf the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection in a cell that belongs to eNB B, indicating as the last serving cell a cell belonging to eNB A, different from eNB B, then eNB B may report this event to eNB A by means of the RLF Indication Procedure. eNB A may then use information in the RLF INDICATION message to determine whether the failure occurred in the serving cell.\n-\t[Too Early Handover]\nIf the target cell belongs to an eNB B different from the eNB A that controls the source cell, the eNB B may send a HANDOVER REPORT message indicating a Too Early Handover event to eNB A upon eNB B receives an RLF INDICATION message from eNB A and if eNB B has sent the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to eNB A related to the completion of an incoming handover for the same UE within the last Tstore_UE_cntxt seconds or there exists a prepared handover for the same UE in eNB B.\n-\t[Handover to Wrong Cell]\nIf the type of the failure is Radio Link Failure and the target cell belongs to eNB B that is different from the eNB A that controls the source cell, the eNB B may send a HANDOVER REPORT message indicating a Handover To Wrong Cell event to eNB A upon eNB B receives an RLF INDICATION message from eNB C, and if eNB B has sent the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to eNB A related to the completion of an incoming handover for the same UE within the last Tstore_UE_cntxt seconds or there exists a prepared handover for the same UE in eNB B. This also applies when eNB A and eNB C are the same. The HANDOVER REPORT message may also be sent if eNB B and eNB C are the same and the RLF Indication is internal to this eNB. \nIf the type of the failure is Handover Failure during a handover from a cell in eNB A, and the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection to a cell in eNB C, then eNB C may send a RLF INDICATION message to eNB A.\nThe detection of the above events, when involving more than one eNB, is enabled by the RLF Indication, Handover Report and MME Configuration Transfer procedures.\nThe RLF Indication procedure may be initiated after a UE attempts to re-establish the radio link connection at eNB B after a failure at eNB A. The RLF INDICATION message sent from eNB B to eNB A shall contain the following information elements:\n-\tFailure Cell ID: PCI of the cell in which the UE was connected prior to the failure occurred;\n-\tReestablishment Cell ID: ECGI of the cell where RL re-establishment attempt is made;\n-\tC-RNTI: C-RNTI of the UE in the cell where UE was connected prior to the failure occurred;\n-\tshortMAC-I (optionally): the 16 least significant bits of the MAC-I calculated using the security configuration of the source cell and the re-establishment cell identity;\n-\tUE RLF Report Container (optionally): the RLF Report received from the UE, as specified in TS 36.331 [16];\n-\tReestablishment Cause (optionally): provided by the UE during the RRC connection re-establishment attempt.\neNB B may initiate RLF Indication towards multiple eNBs if they control cells which use the PCI signalled by the UE during the re-establishment procedure. The eNB A selects the UE context that matches the received Failure Cell ID and C-RNTI, and, if available, uses the shortMAC-I to confirm this identification, by calculating the shortMAC-I and comparing it to the received IE.\nThe Handover Report procedure is used in the case of recently completed handovers, when a failure occurs in the target cell (in eNB B) shortly after it sent the UE Context Release message to the source eNB A. The Handover Report procedure is also used when an RLF occurs before the UE Context Release message is sent, if the random access procedure in the target cell was completed successfully. The HANDOVER REPORT message contains the following information:\n-\tType of detected handover problem (Too Early Handover, Handover to Wrong Cell);\n-\tECGI of source and target cells in the handover;\n-\tECGI of the re-establishment cell (in the case of Handover to Wrong Cell);\n-\tHandover cause (signalled by the source during handover preparation);\n-\tC-RNTI allocated for the UE in the source cell (if available);\n-\tMobility Information (optionally);\n-\tUE RLF Report (optionally): the RLF Report received from the UE and forwarded in the RLF INDICATION message.\nUE may provide the RLF Report to the eNB after successful RRC re-establishment. The radio measurements contained in the RLF Report may be used e.g. to identify coverage issues as the potential cause of the failure. The cause for the RLF contained in the RLF Report may be used to identify the cause of the failure and exclude the events that are irrelevant for MRO evaluation.\nDetection of the failure after RRC connection setup:\nIn case the RRC re-establishment fails or the UE does not perform any RRC re-establishment, the UE makes the RLF Report available to the eNB after reconnecting from idle mode. The RLF Report is described in clause 22.4.5. Availability of the RLF Report at the RRC connection setup procedure is the indication that the UE suffered from a connection failure and that the RLF Report from this failure was not yet delivered to the network. The RLF Report from the UE includes the following information:\n-\tThe E-CGI of the last cell that served the UE (in case of RLF) or the target of the handover (in case of handover failure). If the E-CGI is not known, the PCI and frequency information are used instead.\n-\tE-CGI of the cell that the re-establishment attempt was made at.\n-\tE-CGI of the cell that served the UE at the last handover initialisation, i.e. when message 7 (RRCConnectionReconfiguration) was received by the UE, as presented in Figure 10.1.2.1.1-1.\n-\tTime elapsed since the last handover initialisation until connection failure.\n-\tAn indication whether the connection failure was due to RLF or handover failure.\n-\tThe radio measurements.\n-\tC-RNTI allocated for the UE in the last serving cell.\n-\tRLF trigger of the last RLF that was detected.\n-\tTime elapsed from the connection failure till RLF Report signalling.\nThe eNB receiving the RLF Report from the UE may forward the report to the eNB that served the UE before the reported connection failure using the RLF INDICATION message. In case the RLF Report is received in an NG-RAN node (as defined in TS 38.300 [79]), it may be delivered to the eNB that served the UE before the reported connection failure using the MME Configuration Transfer procedure. The radio measurements contained in the RLF Report may be used e.g. to identify coverage issues as the potential cause of the failure. The cause for the RLF contained in the RLF Report may be used to identify the cause of the failure and exclude the irrelevant events that are irrelevant for MRO evaluation.\nDetection of Too Late Handover, Too Early Handover and Handover to Wrong Cell is carried out through the following:\n-\t[Too Late Handover]\nThere is no recent handover for the UE prior to the connection failure i.e. the UE reported timer is absent or larger than the configured threshold, e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt.\n-\t[Too Early Handover]\nThere is a recent handover for the UE prior to the connection failure i.e. the UE reported timer is smaller than the configured threshold, e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt, and the first re-establishment attempt cell is the cell that served the UE at the last handover initialisation.\n-\t[Handover to Wrong Cell]\nThere is a recent handover for the UE prior to the connection failure i.e. the UE reported timer is smaller than the configured threshold, e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt, and the first re-establishment attempt cell is neither the cell that served the UE at the last handover initialisation nor the cell that served the UE where the RLF happened or the cell that the handover was initialised toward.\nThe \"UE reported timer\" above indicates the time elapsed since the last handover initialisation until connection failure.\nIn case of Too Early Handover or Handover to Wrong Cell, the eNB receiving the RLF INDICATION message may use the HANDOVER REPORT message to inform the eNB controlling the cell where the mobility configuration caused the failure.\nRetrieval of information needed for problem analysis\nThe information needed for detailed problem analysis may be retrieved from both, the UE and the network sides. The information that is collected at the UE is provided to the network with the RLF Report, which may be forwarded to the last serving node in the RLF INDICATION message and, in case of \"Too Early HO\" or \"HO to Wrong Cell\", further in the HANDOVER REPORT message.\nIn order to retrieve relevant information collected at the network side as part of the UE context, the UE provides C-RNTI used in the last serving cell. If the cause for the failure is identified as a \"Too Early HO\" or a \"HO to Wrong Cell\", the eNB controlling the last serving cell shall, if supported, include in the HANDOVER REPORT message the C-RNTI used in the source cell of the last completed handover before the failure. If the eNB controlling that source cell provided the Mobility Information, it is included in the HANDOVER REPORT message. If used, the Mobility Information is prepared at the source eNB of a handover and may refer to or identify any handover-related data at this eNB.\nHandling multiple reports from a single failure event\nIn case the RRC re-establishment fails and the RRC connection setup succeeds, MRO evaluation of intra-LTE mobility connection failures may be triggered twice for the same failure event. In this case, only one failure event should be counted.\nOne of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimisation is to detect connection failures that occurred due to Too Early or Too Late inter-RAT handovers or Inter-system Mobility Failure for Voice Fallback. These problems are defined as follows:\n-\t[Too Late Inter-RAT Handover] An RLF occurs after the UE has stayed in an E-UTRAN cell for a long period of time; the UE attempts to re-connect to a UTRAN cell.\n-\t[Too Early Inter-RAT Handover] An RLF occurs shortly after a successful handover from a UTRAN cell to a target cell in E-UTRAN; the UE attempts to re-connect to the source cell or to another UTRAN cell.\n-\t[Inter-system Mobility Failure for Voice Fallback] An RLF occurs shortly after a successful handover triggered due to Voice Fallback, or a failure occurs during an handover triggered due to Voice Fallback, from a cell belonging to an NG-RAN node to a cell belonging to an E-UTRAN node; the UE attempts to re-connect to a cell belonging to an E-UTRAN node, or an NG-RAN node.\nThe UE makes the RLF Report available to an eNB, when RLF happens in E-UTRAN and the UE re-connects to an eNB cell. Availability of the RLF Report at the RRC connection setup or at a handover to E-UTRAN cell is the indication that the UE suffered a connection failure and that the RLF Report from this failure was not yet delivered to the network.\nThe eNB receiving the RLF Report from the UE may forward the report to the eNB that served the UE before the reported connection failure using the RLF INDICATION message over X2 or by means of the eNB configuration transfer procedure and MME configuration transfer procedure over S1. If present in the RLF Report, the radio measurements may be used to identify lack of coverage as the potential cause of the failure. This information may be used to exclude those events from the MRO evaluation and redirect them as input to other algorithms.\nDetection mechanisms for Too Late Inter-RAT Handover. Too Early Inter-RAT Handover and Inter-system Mobility Failure for Voice Fallback are carried out through the following:\n-\t[Too Late Inter-RAT Handover]\nThe connection failure occurs while being connected to an LTE cell, and there is no recent handover for the UE prior to the connection failure i.e., the UE reported timer is absent or larger than the configured threshold, e.g., Tstore_UE_cntxt, and the first cell where the UE attempts to re-connect is a UTRAN cell.\n-\t[Too Early Inter-RAT Handover]\nThe connection failure occurs while being connected to an LTE cell, and there is a recent inter-RAT handover for the UE prior to the connection failure i.e., the UE reported timer is smaller than the configured threshold, e.g., Tstore_UE_cntxt, and the first cell where the UE attempts to re-connect and the cell that served the UE at the last handover initialisation are both UTRAN cells.\n-\t[Inter-system Mobility Failure for Voice Fallback]\nThe connection failure occurs while being connected to an LTE cell, and there is a recent Inter-system handover due to voice fallback from NR prior to the connection failure i.e., the UE reported timer is smaller than the configured threshold, e.g., Tstore_UE_cntxt. The RLF Report from the UE includes a voice fallback indication, as defined in TS 36.331 [16].\nThe \"UE reported timer\" above indicates the time elapsed since the last handover initialisation until connection failure.\nIn case the failure is a Too Early Inter-RAT Handover, the eNB receiving the RLF INDICATION message may inform the UTRAN node by means of the eNB Direct Information Transfer procedure over S1. The information contains:\n-\tType of detected handover problem (Too Early Inter-RAT Handover);\n-\tUE RLF Report Container: the RLF Report received from the UE, as specified in TS 36.331 [16];\n-\tMobility Information (optionally, if provided in the last Handover Resource Allocation procedure from the UTRAN node);\nOne of the purposes of inter-RAT Mobility Robustness Optimisation is the detection of a non-optimal use of network resources. In particular, in case of inter-RAT operations and when E-UTRAN is considered, the case known as Unnecessary HO to another RAT is identified. The problem is defined as follows:\n-\tUE is handed over from E-UTRAN to other RAT (e.g. GERAN or UTRAN) even though quality of the E-UTRAN coverage was sufficient for the service used by the UE. The handover may therefore be considered as unnecessary HO to another RAT (too early IRAT HO without connection failure).\nIn inter-RAT HO, if the serving cell threshold (E-UTRAN) is set too high, and another RAT with good signal strength is available, a handover to another RAT (e.g. UTRAN or GERAN) may be triggered unnecessarily, resulting in an inefficient use of the networks. With a lower threshold the UE could have continued in the source RAT (E-UTRAN).\nTo be able to detect the Unnecessary HO to another RAT, an eNB may choose to put additional coverage and quality condition information into the HANDOVER REQUIRED message in the Handover Preparation procedure when an inter-RAT HO from E-UTRAN to another RAT occurs. The RAN node in the other RAT, upon receiving this additional coverage and quality information, may instruct the UE to continue measuring the source RAT (E-UTRAN) during a period of time, while being connected to another RAT (e.g. UTRAN or GERAN), and send periodic or single measurement reports to the other RAT (e.g. UTRAN or GERAN). When the period of time indicated by the source RAT (E-UTRAN) expires, the RAN node in the other RAT (e.g. UTRAN or GERAN), may evaluate the received measurement reports with the coverage/quality condition received during the inter-RAT HO procedure and decide if an inter-RAT unnecessary HO report should be sent to the RAN node in the source RAT (E-UTRAN). The inter-RAT unnecessary HO report should include the following information:\n-\tHandover type (LTE to UTRAN, LTE to GERAN);\n-\tType of detected handover problem (Unnecessary HO to another RAT);\n-\tECGI of the source cell in the handover;\n-\tCell ID of the target cell;\n-\tA list of cells whose radio quality, as reported in the UE's first measurement report following the handover, exceeds the threshold indicated in the additional coverage and quality information in the Handover Preparation procedure.\nThe inter-RAT unnecessary HO report shall only be sent in cases where, in all UE measurement reports collected during the measurement period, any source RAT cells exceed the radio coverage and/or quality threshold (the radio threshold RSRP or/and RSRQ and the measurement period are indicated in the additional coverage and quality information in the Handover Preparation procedure). If an inter-RAT handover towards LTE is executed from RNC within the indicated measurement period, the measurement period expires. In this case, the RNC may also send the HO Report. No HO Report shall be sent in case no E-UTRAN cell could be included, or if the indicated period of time is interrupted by an inter-RAT handover to a RAT different than LTE or by an intra-UMTS handover with SRNC relocation or inter-BSS handover.\nThe RAN node in the source RAT (E-UTRAN) upon receiving of the report, can decide if/how its parameters (e.g., threshold to trigger IRAT HO) should be adjusted.\nAll automatic changes of the HO and/or reselection parameters for mobility robustness optimisation shall be within the range allowed by OAM.\nThe following control parameters shall be provided by OAM to control MRO behaviour:\n-\tMaximum deviation of Handover Trigger\nThis parameter defines the maximum allowed absolute deviation of the Handover Trigger (as defined in 22.4.1.4), from the default point of operation defined by the parameter values assigned by OAM.\n-\tMinimum time between Handover Trigger changes\nThis parameter defines the minimum allowed time interval between two Handover Trigger change performed by MRO. This is used to control the stability and convergence of the algorithm.\nFurthermore, in order to support the solutions for detection of Too Late and Too Early HO, the parameter Tstore_UE_cntxt shall be configurable by the OAM system.\nOAM may define multiple coverage configurations for each cell served by an eNB. The coverage configuration may also mean a cell is inactive (no coverage). The eNB may dynamically select the most appropriate coverage configuration for its served cells.\nOne of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimisation is to detect ping-pongs that occur in inter-RAT environment. The problem is defined as follows:\n-\tA UE is handed over from a cell in a source RAT (e.g. E-UTRAN) to a cell in a target RAT different from the source RAT (e.g. UTRAN), then within a predefined limited time the UE is handed over back to a cell in the source RAT, while the coverage of the source RAT was sufficient for the service used by the UE. The event may occur more than once.\nThe solution for the problem may consist of the following steps:\n1)\tStatistics regarding inter-RAT ping-pong occurrences are collected by the responsible node.\n2)\tCoverage verification is performed to check if the mobility to other RAT was inevitable.\nThe statistics regarding ping-pong occurrence may be based on evaluation of the UE History Information IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message. If the evaluation indicates a potential ping-pong case and the source eNB of the 1st inter-RAT handover is different than the target eNB of the 2nd inter-RAT handover, the target eNB may use the HANDOVER REPORT message to indicate the occurrence of potential ping-pong cases to the source eNB. The HANDOVER REPORT message for ping-pong indication contains the following information:\n-\tType of detected handover problem (InterRAT ping-pong);\n-\tECGI of the source cell in the handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN;\n-\tECGI of the target in the handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN;\n-\tCell Identifier of the target UTRAN cell in the first inter-RAT handover;\n-\tCause of the first handover (signalled by the source during handover preparation).\nIf E-UTRAN coverage during the potential ping-pong event needs to be verified for the purpose of determining corrective measures, the Unnecessary HO to another RAT procedure may be used\nEach eNB may be configured with alternative coverage configurations and an eNB may autonomously select and switch between these configurations, e.g. using the Active Antenna Systems functions.\nAn eNB may notify its neighbour eNBs about the coverage reconfiguration using the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message with the list of cells with modified coverage included. The list contains the ECGI of each modified cell and its coverage state indicator. The indicator may be used at the receiving eNB to adjust the functions of the Mobility Robustness Optimisation, e.g. by using the indicator to retrieve a previously stored Mobility Robustness Optimisation state. If the list includes indication about planned reconfiguration and possibly a list of replacing cells, the receiving eNB may use this to avoid connection or re-establishment failures during the reconfiguration. Also, if the sending eNB adds cells in inactive state, the receiving eNB may use this information to avoid connection or re-establishment failures.\nThe receiving node may also use the notification to reduce the impact on mobility. For example, the receiving eNB should avoid triggering handovers towards cell(s) that are indicated to be inactive.\nIn NB-IoT, the function of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect connection failures due to radio link failure.\nSolution for failure scenarios consists of one or more of following functions:\n-\tDetection of the failure after RRC re-establishment attempt;\n-\tDetection of the failure after RRC connection setup;\n-\tRetrieval of information needed for problem analysis.\nTriggering of each of these functions is optional and depends on situation and implementation.\nDetection of the failure after RRC re-establishment attempt:\nUE provides the RLF Report to the eNB after successful RRC connection re-establishment.\nDetection of the failure after RRC connection setup:\nIn case the RRC connection re-establishment fails or the UE does not perform any RRC connection re-establishment, the UE makes the RLF Report available to the eNB after reconnecting from idle mode. Availability of the RLF Report at the RRC connection setup procedure is the indication that a RLF failure occured and that the RLF Report from this occurence could be obtained by the network.\nRetrieval of information needed for problem analysis\nThe information needed for detailed problem analysis may be retrieved from both, the UE and the network sides. The information that is collected at the UE is provided to the network with the RLF Report.\nThe RLF Report from the UE includes the following information:\n-\tThe E-CGI of the last cell that served the UE.\n-\tThe radio measurements of the last cell that served the UE.\n-\tTime elapsed from the connection failure till RLF Report signalling.\nThe eNB receiving the RLF Report from the UE may forward the report to the eNB that served the UE before the reported connection failure using the RLF INDICATION message.\nOne of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect ping-pongs that occur in inter-system environment. The problem is defined as follows:\n-\tA UE is handed over from a cell in a source system (e.g. E-UTRAN) to a cell in a target system different from the source system (e.g. NG-RAN), then within a predefined limited time the UE is handed over back to a cell in the source system, while the coverage of the source system was sufficient for the service used by the UE. The event may occur more than once.\nThe solution for the problem may consist of the following steps:\n1)\tStatistics regarding inter-system ping-pong occurrences are collected by the responsible node.\n2)\tCoverage verification is performed to check if the mobility to other system was inevitable.\nThe statistics regarding ping-pong occurrence may be based on evaluation of the UE History Information IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message. If the evaluation indicates a potential ping-pong case and the source E-UTRAN node of the 1st inter-system handover is different than the target E-UTRAN node of the 2nd inter-system handover, the target E-UTRAN node may use the HANDOVER REPORT message to indicate the occurrence of potential ping-pong cases to the source E-UTRAN node.\n",

The basic coverage may be provided by\n-\tE-UTRAN, UTRAN or GERAN cells, in the case of E-UTRA cells;\n-\tE-UTRA cells, in the case of EN-DC cells.\nThe solution builds upon the possibility for the eNB owning a capacity booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to lower energy consumption (dormant state). The decision is typically based on cell load information, consistently with configured information. The switch-off decision may also be taken by O&M.\nThe eNB may initiate handover actions in order to off-load the cell being switched off and may indicate the reason for handover with an appropriate cause value to support the target node in taking subsequent actions, e.g. when selecting the target cell for subsequent handovers.\nAll peer eNBs are informed by the eNB owning the concerned cell about the switch-off actions over the X2 interface, by means of the eNB Configuration Update procedure.

The diagram includes a bearer, a LWIP tunnel, and a protocol stack, with the bearer acting as the primary interface for communication. The LWIP tunnel is used to encapsulate the bearer's data, while the protocol stack handles the communication protocols and ensures the data is transmitted securely.\nFigure 22A.3-3: Bearer over LWIP Tunnel - Protocol Stack\nThe RRCConnectionReconfiguration message provides the necessary parameters for the UE to initiate the establishment of the IPSec tunnel for the DRB. When the IPsec tunnel is established a data bearer can be configured to use LWIP resources. The DRB configuration on the LTE access corresponding to the data bearer using IPsec resources shall not be released. The data bearer refers to the EPS bearer mapped to the data radio bearer (DRB) which is maintained on the LTE side.\nThe IPsec tunnel is established following the exchange of security information between the eNB and LWIP-SeGW using the XwAP LWIP Addition Preparation procedure.\nA single IPSec tunnel is used per UE for all the data bearers that are configured to send and/ or receive data over WLAN. The data corresponding to each IPSec Tunnel is transported over the Xw interface on a single GTP-U tunnel. Each data bearer may be configured so that traffic for that bearer can be routed over the IPsec tunnel in only downlink, only uplink, or both uplink and downlink over WLAN. SRBs are carried over LTE only. eNB configures specific bearer(s) to use the IPsec tunnel.\nNOTE:\tIf the IPsec tunnel is established then it is expected that eNB routes packets belonging to the data bearer via the LTE access or via the IPSec tunnel. If eNB implementation routes packets to both LTE Access and the IPSec tunnel simultaneously, then delivery of packets to upper layers at the UE may occur out of order.\nFor the DL of a data bearer, the packets received from the IPsec tunnel are forwarded directly to upper layers.\nFor the UL, the eNB configures the UE to route the uplink data either via LTE or via WLAN using RRC signalling. If routed via WLAN then all UL traffic of the data bearer is offloaded to the WLAN.\nUL bearer packets sent over the LWIP tunnel are encapsulated using LWIPEP as specified in TS 36.361 [68] with the 'Key' field in the LWIPEP header populated with the DRB Identity associated with offloaded UL bearer.\nIf aggregation over LWIP is enabled in UL or DL, the corresponding (UL or DL) packets sent over the LWIP tunnel and LTE are encapsulated using LWIPEP as specified in TS 36.361 [68]. The LWIPEP layer assigns sequence numbers to all packets and uses this sequence numbers to populate the 'Sequence Number' field in the LWIPEP header. The 'Key' field in the LWIPEP header is populated with the DRB Identity of the associated DRB.\nThe release of the IPsec tunnel is initiated by the eNB. Upon receiving the Handover Command or on transition to RRC_IDLE state, the UE shall autonomously release IPsec tunnel configuration and the use of it by the data bearers.\nA UE supporting LWIP may be configured for WLAN measurements as per clause 22A.1.5.\nThe same mobility concept as specified in 22A.1.4 for LWA is also used for LWIP. Since, WT node does not exist in LWIP operation, WT related description and procedures does not apply to LWIP. Mobility Set should be considered as the set of WLAN APs across which UE can perform mobility without informing the eNB, when applying the concept for LWIP operation.\nE-UTRAN does not configure LWIP with DC, LWA or RCLWI simultaneously for the same UE.\nIf LWIP and RAN assisted WLAN interworking are simultaneously configured for the same UE, in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE only applies LWIP.\n",

Call admission control for IMS emergency call is based on bearer QoS (e.g. the ARP).\nSecurity procedures are activated for emergency calls. For UE in limited service mode and the UE is not authenticated (as defined in TS 33.401 [22], clause 15.2.2), 'NULL' algorithms for ciphering and integrity protection are used and the related keys are set to specified value and may be ignored by the receiving node.

For example, a UE may be equipped with LTE, WiFi, and Bluetooth transceivers, and GNSS receivers. Due to extreme proximity of multiple radio transceivers within the same UE operating on adjacent frequencies or sub-harmonic frequencies, the interference power coming from a transmitter of the collocated radio may be much higher than the actual received power level of the desired signal for a receiver. This situation causes In-Device Coexistence (IDC) interference and is referred to as IDC problems. The challenge lies in avoiding or minimizing IDC interference between those collocated radio transceivers, as current state-of-the-art filter technology might not provide sufficient rejection for certain scenarios (see TR 36.816 [50]). IDC problem can happen when the UE (intends to) uses WLAN on the overlapped carrier/band or adjacent carrier/band to the unlicensed carrier used for LAA operation, e.g. when related UE hardware components, such as antennas, are shared between LAA and WLAN operations. If there is a risk of IDC problem which cannot be avoided (e.g. by level of regulation), the IDC functionality for a UE should be configured by the eNB when the UE is configured for LAA operation.\n",

                            "text_content": "When a UE experiences IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself and a network intervention is required, it sends an IDC indication via dedicated RRC signalling to report the IDC problems to the eNB. The UE may rely on existing LTE measurements and/or UE internal coordination to assess the interference and the details are left up to UE implementation.\nNOTE:\tFor instance, the interference is applicable over several subframes/slots where not necessarily all the subframes/slots are affected and consists of interference caused by the aggressor radio to the victim radio during either active data exchange or upcoming data activity which is expected in up to a few hundred milliseconds.\nA UE that supports IDC functionality indicates related capabilities to the network, and the network can then configure by dedicated signalling whether the UE is allowed to send an IDC indication. The IDC indication can only be triggered for frequencies for which a measurement object is configured and when:\n-\tfor the primary frequency, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself;\n-\tfor a secondary frequency, regardless of the activation state of the corresponding SCell, the UE is experiencing or expects to experience upon activation IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself;\n-\tfor a non-serving frequency, the UE expects to experience IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself if that non-serving frequency becomes a serving one.\nWhen notified of IDC problems through an IDC indication from the UE, the eNB can choose to apply a Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) solution or a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) solution:\n-\tThe basic concept of an FDM solution is to move the LTE signal away from the ISM band by e.g., performing inter-frequency handover within E-UTRAN, removing SCells from the set of serving cells or de-activation of affected SCells, or in case of uplink CA operations, allocate uplink PRB resources on CC(s) whose inter-modulation distortion and harmonics does not fall into the frequency range of the victim system receiver.\n-\tThe basic concept of a TDM solution is to ensure that transmission of a radio signal does not coincide with reception of another radio signal. LTE DRX mechanism is used to provide TDM patterns (i.e. periods during which the LTE UE may be scheduled or is not scheduled) to resolve the IDC issues. DRX based TDM solution should be used in a predictable way, i.e. the eNB should ensure a predictable pattern of unscheduled periods by means of e.g. DRX mechanism or de-activation of affected SCells.\nTo assist the eNB in selecting an appropriate solution, all necessary/available assistance information for both FDM and TDM solutions is sent together in the IDC indication to the eNB. The IDC assistance information contains the list of E-UTRA carriers suffering from IDC problems, the direction of the interference and, depending on the scenario (see TR 36.816 [50]), it also contains TDM patterns or parameters to enable appropriate DRX configuration for TDM solutions on the serving E-UTRA carrier. Furthermore, the IDC indication can also be configured to include uplink CA related assistance information containing the victim system as well as the list of supported uplink CA combinations suffering from IDC problems. Furthermore, the IDC indication can also be configured to indicate that the cause of IDC problems is hardware sharing between LAA and WLAN operation, in which case the UE may omit the TDM assistance information. The IDC indication is also used to update the IDC assistance information, including for the cases when the UE no longer suffers from IDC problems. In case of inter-eNB handover, the IDC assistance information is transferred from the source eNB to the target eNB.\nIDC interference situation can be divided into following three phases as shown in Figure -1:\n-\tPhase 1: The UE detects start of IDC interference but does not initiate the transmission of the IDC indication to the eNB yet.\n-\tPhase 2: The UE has initiated the transmission of the IDC indication to the eNB and no solution is yet configured by the eNB to solve the IDC issue.\n-\tPhase 3: The eNB has provided a solution that solved the IDC interference to the UE.\nThe figure depicts the various phases of interference-related operations by an UE in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of signal quality and network management in ensuring seamless communication.\nFigure -1: Different phases of IDC interference related operations by UE\nIn different phases, UE behaviours related to RRM, RLM, and CSI measurements are shown in Table -1.\nTable -1: RRM/RLM/CSI measurements in different phases of IDC interference\n\nIn addition, once configured by the network, the UE can autonomously deny LTE UL transmission in all phases to protect ISM in rare cases if other solutions cannot be used. Conversely, it is assumed that the UE also autonomously denies ISM transmission in order to ensure connectivity with the eNB to perform necessary LTE procedures, e.g., RRC connection reconfiguration and paging reception, etc. The network may configure a long-term denial rate by dedicated RRC signalling to limit the amount of LTE UL autonomous denials. Otherwise, the UE shall not perform any LTE UL autonomous denials.\n",

In this release of the specification two enhanced coverage modes (mode A, mode B) are supported. The support of enhanced coverage mode A is mandatory for a BL UE.

System information procedures for UEs in enhanced coverage are identical to the system information procedures for bandwidth reduced low complexity UEs. A UE capable of enhanced coverage acquires, if needed, and uses legacy system information when in normal coverage if it is not a BL UE. A UE capable of enhanced coverage acquires, if needed, and uses system information specific for UEs in enhanced coverage. A UE in enhanced coverage is not required to detect SIB change when in RRC_CONNECTED.\nA set of PRACH resources (e.g. time, frequency, preamble); each associated with a coverage enhancement level, is provided in SIB. Number of PRACH repetitions and number of maximum preamble transmission attempts per coverage enhancement level are provided in SIB.

At handover from a source cell in normal or enhanced coverage mode to a target cell in enhanced coverage mode, the network may provide SIB1-BR to the UE in the handover command. No additional mechanisms are introduced to support the use of enhanced coverage functionality to access an E-UTRA cell during inter-RAT handovers.\nReconfiguration of a UE in connected mode from normal to enhanced coverage mode (and vice versa) is supported by a means of intra-cell handover or RRC configuration without handover.\n",

Only those UEs authorised to be used for public safety operation can perform sidelink communication.\nIn order to perform synchronisation for out of coverage operation UE(s) may act as a synchronisation source by transmitting SBCCH and a synchronisation signal. SBCCH carries the most essential system information needed to receive other sidelink channels and signals. SBCCH along with a synchronisation signal is transmitted with a fixed periodicity of 40ms. When the UE is in network coverage, the contents of SBCCH are derived from the parameters signalled by the eNB. When the UE is out of coverage, if the UE selects another UE as a synchronisation reference, then the content of SBCCH is derived from the received SBCCH; otherwise UE uses pre-configured parameters. SIB18 provides the resource information for synchronisation signal and SBCCH transmission. There are two pre-configured subframes every 40ms for out of coverage operation. UE receives synchronisation signal and SBCCH in one subframe and transmit synchronisation signal and SBCCH on another subframe if UE becomes synchronisation source based on defined criterion, as specified in [16].\nUE performs sidelink communication on subframes defined over the duration of Sidelink Control period.

One-to-one and one-to-many sidelink communications are used between the Remote UE(s) and the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. For both Remote UE and Relay UE only one single carrier (i.e., Public Safety ProSe Carrier) operation is supported (i.e., Uu and PC5 should be same carrier for Relay/ Remote UE). The Remote UE is authorised by upper layers and can be in-coverage of the Public Safety ProSe Carrier or out-of-coverage on any supported carriers including Public Safety ProSe Carrier for UE-to-Network Relay discovery, (re)selection and communication. The ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is always in-coverage of EUTRAN. The ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and the Remote UE perform sidelink communication and sidelink discovery as described in clause 23.10 and 23.11 respectively.\nThe eNB controls whether the UE can act as a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay:\n-\tIf the eNB broadcast any information associated to ProSe UE-to-Network Relay operation, then ProSe UE-to-Network Relay operation is supported in the cell;\n-\tThe eNB may provide:\n-\tTransmission resources for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery using broadcast signalling for RRC_IDLE state and dedicated signalling for RRC_CONNECTED state;\n-\tReception resources for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery using broadcast signalling;\n-\tThe eNB may broadcasts a minimum and/or a maximum Uu link quality (RSRP) threshold(s) that the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay needs to respect before it can initiate a UE-to-Network Relay discovery procedure. In RRC_IDLE, when the eNB broadcasts transmission resource pools, the UE uses the threshold(s) to autonomouslystartor stop the UE-to-Network Relay discovery procedure. In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE uses the threshold(s) to determine if it can indicate to eNB that it is a Relay UE and wants to start ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery;\n-\tIf the eNB does not broadcast transmission resource pools for ProSe-UE-to-Network Relay discovery, then a UE can initiate a request for ProSe-UE-to-Network Relay discovery resources by dedicated signalling, respecting these broadcasted threshold(s).\n-\tIf the ProSe-UE-to-Network Relay is initiated by broadcast signalling, it can perform ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery when in RRC_IDLE. If the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is initiated by dedicated signalling, it can perform relay discovery as long as it is in RRC_CONNECTED.\nA ProSe UE-to-Network Relay performing sidelink communication for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay operation has to be in RRC_CONNECTED. After receiving a layer-2 link establishment request or TMGI monitoring request (upper layer message), as specified in TS 23.303 [62], from the Remote UE, the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay indicates to the eNB that it is a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and intends to perform ProSe UE-to-Network Relay sidelink communication. The eNB may provide resources for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay communication.\nThe remote UE can decide when to start monitoring for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery. The Remote UE can transmit ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery solicitation messages while in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_CONNECTED depending on the configuration of resources for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery. The eNB may broadcast a threshold, which is used by the Remote UE to determine if it can transmit ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery solicitation messages, to connect or communicate with ProSe UE-to-Network Relay UE. The RRC_CONNECTED Remote UE, uses the broadcasted threshold to determine if it can indicate to eNB that it is a Remote UE and wants to participate in ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery and/or communication. The eNB may provide, transmission resources using broadcast or dedicated signalling and reception resources using broadcast signalling for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Operation. The Remote UE stops using ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery and communication resources when RSRP goes above the broadcasted threshold.\nNOTE:\tExact time of traffic switching from Uu to PC5 or vice versa is up to higher layer.\nThe Remote UE performs radio measurements at PC5 interface and uses them for ProSe UE-to-Network Relay selection and reselection along with higher layer criterion, as specified in TS 23.303 [62]. A ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is considered suitable in terms of radio criteria if the PC5 link quality exceeds configured threshold (pre-configured or provided by eNB). The Remote UE selects the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, which satisfies higher layer criterion and has best PC5 link quality among all suitable ProSe UE-to-Network Relays.\nThe Remote UE triggers ProSe UE-to-Network Relay reselection when:\n-\tPC5 signal strength of current ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is below configured signal strength threshold;\n-\tIt receives a layer-2 link release message (upper layer message), as specified in TS 23.303 [62], from ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\n",

Sidelink discovery is supported both when UE is served by EUTRAN and when UE is out of EUTRA coverage. Only ProSe-enabled Public safety UE can perform sidelink discovery when it is out of EUTRA coverage. For public safety sidelink discovery the allowed frequency is pre-configured in the UE, and is used even when UE is out of coverage of EUTRA in that frequency. The pre-configured frequency is the same frequency as the Public Safety ProSe Carrier.\nThe figure depicts a PC5 interface for sidelink discovery, which is a crucial component in the network architecture. It shows the PC5 interface, which is a part of the PC5 protocol, used for discovering sidelink connections. The figure also includes the TS 23.303 standard, which provides guidelines for the PC5 protocol, and the reference to the PC5 protocol itself, which is a standard for discovering sidelink connections in a network.\nFigure 23.11.1-1: PC5 interface for sidelink discovery (see TS 23.303 [62])\nUpper layer handles authorization for announcement and monitoring of discovery message.\nContent of discovery message is transparent to Access Stratum (AS) and no distinction in AS is made for sidelink discovery models and types of sidelink discovery, as specified in TS 23.303 [62]. However higher layer informs whether the sidelink discovery announcement is related to public safety or non-Public safety discovery. Higher layer also informs whether the discovery announcement/monitoring is related to ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery or other public safety discovery.\nNOTE:\tThe ProSe Protocol ensures that only valid discovery messages are delivered to AS for announcement.\nThe UE can participate in announcing and monitoring of discovery message in both RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED states as per eNB configuration. The UE announces and monitors its discovery message subject to the half-duplex constraint.\nThe UE that participates in announcing and monitoring of discovery messages maintains the current UTC time. The UE that participates in announcing transmits the discovery message, which is generated by the ProSe Protocol taking into account the UTC time upon transmission of the discovery message. In the monitoring UE, the ProSe Protocol provides the message to be verified together with the UTC time upon reception of the message to the ProSe Function.\nNOTE:\tUE may obtain UTC time from the RAN via SIB16 or from other sources such as NITZ, NTP, and GNSS depending on their availability.\nIn order to perform synchronisation UE(s) participating in announcing of discovery messages may act as a synchronisation source by transmitting SBCCH and a synchronisation signal based on the resource information for synchronisation signals provided in SIB19.\nThere are three range classes. Upper layer authorisation provides applicable range class of the UE. Maximum allowed transmission power for each range class is signalled in SIB19. UE uses the applicable maximum allowed transmission power corresponding to its authorised range class. This puts an upper limit on the determined transmit power based on open loop power control parameters.\n",

The eNB can configure the UE to report the complete UE geographical location information based on periodic reporting via the existing measurement report signaling.\nGeographical zones can be configured by the eNB or pre-configured. When zones are (pre)configured, the world is divided into geographical zones using a single fixed reference point (i.e. geographical coordinates (0, 0)), length and width. The UE determines the zone identity by means of modulo operation using length and width of each zone, number of zones in length, number of zones in width, the single fixed reference point and the geographical coordinates of the UE's current location. The length and width of each zone, number of zones in length and number of zones in width are provided by the eNB when the UE is in coverage and pre-configured when the UE is out of coverage. The zone is configurable for both in coverage and out of coverage.\nFor in coverage UE, when the UE uses UE autonomous resource selection, the eNB can provide the mapping between zone(s) and V2X sidelink transmission resource pools in RRC signalling. For out of coverage UEs, the mapping between the zone(s) and V2X sidelink transmission resource pools can be pre-configured. If a mapping between zone(s) and V2X sidelink transmission resource pool is (pre-)configured, the UE selects transmission sidelink resources from the resource pool corresponding to the zone where it is currently located. The zone concept is not applied to exceptional V2X sidelink transmission pools as well as reception pools. Resource pools for V2X sidelink communication are not configured based on priority.\nFor V2X sidelink transmission, during handover, transmission resource pool configurations including exceptional transmission resource pool for the target cell can be signaled in the handover command to reduce the transmission interruption. In this way, the UE may use the V2X sidelink transmission resource pools of the target cell before the handover is completed as long as either synchronization is performed with the target cell in case eNB is configured as synchronization source or synchronization is performed with GNSS in case GNSS is configured as synchronization source. If the exceptional transmission resource pool is included in the handover command, the UE uses randomly selected resources from the exceptional transmission resource pool, starting from the reception of handover command. If the UE is configured with scheduled resource allocation in the handover command, the UE continues to use the exceptional transmission resource pool while the timer associated with handover is running. If the UE is configured with autonomous resource selection in the target cell the UE continues to use the exceptional transmission resource pool until the sensing results on the transmission resource pools for autonomous resource selection are available. For exceptional cases (e.g. during RLF, during transition from RRC IDLE to RRC CONNECTED or during change of dedicated V2X sidelink resource pools within a cell), the UE may select resources in the exceptional pool provided in serving cell's SIB21 or in dedicated signalling based on random selection, and uses them temporarily. During cell reselection, the RRC_IDLE UE may use the randomly selected resources from the exceptional transmission resource pool of the reselected cell until the sensing results on the transmission resource pools for autonomous resource selection are available.\nIn order to avoid interruption time in receiving V2X messages due to delay in acquiring reception pools broadcasted from the target cell, synchronisation configuration and reception resource pool configuration for the target cell can be signaled to RRC_CONNECTED UEs in the handover command. For RRC_IDLE UE, it is up to UE implementation to minimize V2X sidelink transmission/reception interruption time associated with acquisition of SIB21 of the target cell.\nA UE is considered in-coverage on the carrier used for V2X sidelink communication whenever it detects a cell on that carrier as per criteria specified in TS 36.331 [16]. If the UE that is authorized for V2X sidelink communication is in-coverage on the frequency used for V2X sidelink communication or if the eNB provides V2X sidelink configuration for that frequency (including the case where UE is out of coverage on that frequency), the UE uses the scheduled resource allocation or UE autonomous resource selection as per eNB configuration. When the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for V2X sidelink communication and if the eNB does not provide V2X sidelink configuration for that frequency, the UE may use a set of transmission and reception resource pools pre-configured in the UE. V2X sidelink communication resources are not shared with other non-V2X data transmitted over sidelink.\nAn RRC_CONNECTED UE may send a Sidelink UE Information message to the serving cell if it is interested in V2X sidelink communication transmission in order to request sidelink resources.\nIf the UE is configured by upper layers to receive V2X sidelink communication and V2X sidelink reception resource pools are provided, the UE receives on those provided resources.\nReception of V2X sidelink communication in different carriers/PLMNs can be supported by having multiple receiver chains in the UE.\nFor sidelink SPS, maximum 8 SPS configurations with different parameters can be configured by eNB and all SPS configurations can be active at the same time. The activation/deactivation of SPS configuration is signalled via PDCCH by eNB. The existing logical channel prioritization based on PPPP is used for sidelink SPS.\nUE assistance information can be provided to eNB. Reporting of UE assistance information is configured by eNB for V2X sidelink communication. The UE assistance information used for V2X sidelink communication includes traffic characteristic parameters (e.g. a set of preferred SPS interval, timing offset with respect to subframe 0 of the SFN 0, PPPP, PPPR, Destination Layer-2 ID, and maximum TB size based on observed traffic pattern) related to the SPS configuration. The UE assistance information can be reported in case either SPS is already configured or not. Triggering of UE assistance information transmission is left to UE implementation. For instance, the UE is allowed to report UE assistance information when change in estimated periodicity and/or timing offset of packet arrival occurs. SR mask per traffic type is not supported for V2X sidelink communication.\nThe serving cell can provide synchronization configuration for the carrier used for V2X sidelink communication. In this case, the UE follows the synchronization configuration received from serving cell. In case there is no cell detected on the carrier used for V2X sidelink communication and the UE does not receive synchronization configuration from serving cell, the UE follows preconfigured synchronization configuration. There are three types of synchronization reference, namely eNB, UE and GNSS. In case GNSS is configured as synchronization source, the UE utilizes the UTC time and (pre)configured DFN offset to calculate direct frame number and subframe number. In case eNB timing is configured as synchronization reference to the UE, for synchronization and DL measurements, the UE follows the cell associated with the concerned frequency (when in-coverage on this frequency), or the PCell or the serving cell (when out of coverage on the concerned frequency). UE can indicate the current synchronization reference type it is using to the eNB. One transmission pool for scheduled resource allocation is configured, taking into account the synchronization reference of the UE.\nFor controlling channel utilization, the network is able to indicate how the UE adapts its transmission parameters for each transmission pool depending on the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR). The UE measures all the configured transmission pools including exceptional pool. If a pool is (pre)configured such that a UE shall always transmit PSCCH and PSSCH in adjacent resource blocks the UE measures PSCCH and PSSCH resources together. If a pool is (pre)configured such that a UE may transmit PSCCH and the corresponding PSSCH in non-adjacent resource blocks in a subframe then PSSCH pool and PSCCH pool are measured separately.\nA UE in RRC_CONNECTED can be configured to report CBR measurement results. For CBR reporting, periodic reporting and event triggered reporting are supported. Two reporting events are introduced for event-triggered CBR reporting. In case PSSCH and PSCCH resources are placed non-adjacently, only PSSCH pool measurement is used for event-triggered CBR reporting. In case PSSCH and PSCCH resources are placed adjacently, CBR measurement of both the PSSCH and PSCCH resources is used for event-triggered CBR reporting. Event-triggered CBR reporting is triggered by overloaded threshold and/or less-loaded threshold. The network can configure which of the transmission pools the UE needs to report.\nA UE (regardless of its RRC state) performs transmission parameter adaptation based on the CBR. In case PSSCH and PSCCH resources are placed non-adjacently, only PSSCH pool measurement is used for transmission parameter adaptation. In case PSSCH and PSCCH resources are placed adjacently, CBR measurement of both the PSSCH and PSCCH resources is used for transmission parameter adaptation. When CBR measurements are not available, the default transmission parameters are used. The exemplary adapted transmission parameters include maximum transmission power, range of the number of retransmission per TB, range of PSSCH RB number, range of MCS, maximum limit on channel occupancy ratio. The transmission parameter adaption applies to all transmission pools including exceptional pool.\nA UE using scheduled resource allocation may be configured to perform sensing and periodically report the sensing result. The UE performs sensing only in the V2X sidelink transmission resource pool(s) for which reporting is configured.\nFor V2X sidelink communication, sidelink transmission and/or reception resources including exceptional pool for different frequencies for scheduled resource allocation and UE autonomous resource selection may be provided. The sidelink resources for different frequencies can be provided via dedicated signalling, SIB21 and/or preconfiguration. The serving cell may indicate to the UE only the frequency on which the UE may acquire the resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication. If multiple frequencies and associated resource information are provided, it is up to UE implementation to select the frequency among the provided frequencies. The UE shall not use preconfigured transmission resource if the UE detects a cell providing resource configuration or inter-carrier resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication. Frequencies which may provide V2X sidelink communication resource configuration or cross-carrier configuration can be signalled in SIB21 or pre-configured in the UE. The RRC_IDLE UE may prioritize the frequency that provides cross-carrier resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication during cell reselection.\nIf the UE supports multiple transmission chains, it may simultaneously transmit on multiple carriers via PC5. For the case where multiple frequencies for V2X are supported, a mapping between V2X service types and V2X frequencies is configured by upper layers. The UE should ensure a V2X service to be transmitted on the corresponding frequency. For scheduled resource allocation, the eNB can schedule a V2X transmission on a frequency based on the Sidelink BSR, as specified in TS 36.321 [13], in which the UE includes the Destination Index uniquely associated with a frequency reported by the UE to the eNB in Sidelink UE Information message as specified in TS 36.331 [16].\nCarrier aggregation (CA) in sidelink is supported for V2X sidelink communication. It applies to both in coverage UEs and out of coverage UEs. For CA in sidelink, neither primary component carrier nor secondary component carriers are defined. Each resource pool (pre)configured for V2X sidelink communication transmission or reception is associated to a single carrier. When a UE supporting CA in sidelink uses autonomous resource selection, it performs carrier selection and may select one or more carriers used for V2X sidelink communication transmission. The carrier selection is performed at MAC layer, depending on the CBR of the (pre)configured carriers for V2X sidelink communication and the PPPP(s) of the V2X messages to be transmitted. The carrier reselection may be performed when resource reselection is triggered and is triggered for each sidelink process. In order to avoid frequent switching across different carriers, the UE may keep using a carrier already selected for transmission, if the measured CBR on this carrier is lower than a (pre)configured threshold. All selected carriers should have the same synchronization reference or the same synchronization priority configuration. For a UE using autonomous resource selection, logical channel prioritization is performed for a sidelink resource on a carrier depending on the CBR measured on the carrier and the PPPP of the sidelink logical channels as specified in TS 36.321 [13].\nSidelink packet duplication is supported for V2X sidelink communication and is performed at PDCP layer of the UE. For sidelink packet duplication for transmission, a PDCP PDU is duplicated at the PDCP entity. The duplicated PDCP PDUs of the same PDCP entity are submitted to two different RLC entities and associated to two different sidelink logical channels respectively. The duplicated PDCP PDUs of the same PDCP entity are only allowed to be transmitted on different sidelink carriers. A UE can activate or deactivate sidelink packet duplication based on (pre)configuration. Sidelink packet duplication does not apply to transmission with Rel-14 transmit profile (TS 23.285 [72]). The PPPR value(s) for which sidelink packet duplication is supported can be (pre)configured via a PPPR threshold. For UE autonomous resource selection and scheduled resource allocation, the UE shall perform sidelink packet duplication for the data with the configured PPPR value(s) until packet duplication is deconfigured for these PPPR value(s). For scheduled resource allocation, the UE reports the amount of data associated with one or more PPPR values, and the destination(s) to which the data belongs via sidelink BSR(s). A mapping of PPPR values to logical channel groups can be configured by the eNB, and the PPPR value(s) are reflected by the associated logical channel group ID included in the sidelink BSR(s). A list of PPPR value(s) may be reported in Sidelink UE information by an RRC_CONNECTED UE.\nFor a UE using scheduled resource allocation, two non-overlapped sets of carriers are configured by the eNB per Destination reported by the UE to the network, and they apply to all the PPPR(s) that are configured for sidelink packet duplication. The UE then associates two duplicated sidelink logical channels corresponding to the same PDCP entity respectively with the two sets of carriers configured for the Destination of the two sidelink logical channels. The association between the duplicated sidelink logical channel and the carrier set is up to UE implementation. Data of a duplicated sidelink logical channel can only be transmitted on the carrier(s) in the associated carrier set.\nFor V2X sidelink communication reception, packet duplication detection is performed at PDCP layer of the UE. Reordering function is also supported at PDCP layer and how to set the reordering timer at the PDCP layer is up to UE implementation. There are specific logical channel identities which apply to the sidelink logical channel used for sidelink packet duplication exclusively as specified in TS 36.321 [13].\nThe UE may receive the V2X sidelink communication of other PLMNs. The serving cell can indicate to the UE the resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication reception for inter-PLMN operation directly or only the frequency on which the UE may acquire the inter-PLMN resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication reception. V2X sidelink communication transmission in other PLMNs is not allowed.\nWhen UL transmission overlaps in time domain with V2X sidelink transmission in the same frequency, the UE prioritizes the V2X sidelink transmission over the UL transmission if the PPPP of sidelink MAC PDU is lower than a (pre)configured PPPP threshold; otherwise, the UE prioritizes the UL transmission over the V2X sidelink transmission. When UL transmission overlaps in time domain with V2X sidelink transmission in different frequency, the UE may prioritize the V2X sidelink transmission over the UL transmission or reduce UL transmission power if the PPPP of sidelink MAC PDU is lower than a (pre)configured PPPP threshold; otherwise, the UE prioritizes the UL transmission over the V2X sidelink transmission or reduces V2X sidelink transmission power. However, if UL transmission is prioritized by upper layer as specified in TS 24.386 [75] or random access procedure is performed, the UE prioritizes UL transmission over any V2X sidelink transmission (i.e. irrespectively of the sidelink MAC PDU's PPPP).\nResource pool for transmission of pedestrian UE (P-UE) may be overlapped with resources for V2X sidelink communication. For each transmission pool, resource selection mechanism (i.e. random selection, partial sensing based selection or either random selection or partial sensing based selection), which is allowed to be used in this pool, is also configured. If P-UE is configured to use either random selection or partial sensing based selection for one transmission pool, it is up to UE implementation to select a specific resource selection mechanism. If the P-UE is configured to use partial sensing based selection only, the P-UE shall use partial sensing based selection in the pool. The P-UE shall not do random selection in the pool wherein only partial sensing is allowed. If the eNB does not provide a random selection pool, the P-UEs that support only random selection cannot perform sidelink transmission. In exceptional pool, the P-UE uses random selection. The P-UE can send Sidelink UE Information message to indicate that it requests resource pools for P2X-related V2X sidelink communication transmission as specified in TS 36.331 [16].\nIt is not mandatory for P-UE to support zone based resource selection. The P-UE reports whether it supports zone based resource selection as part of UE capability signalling. If the P-UE supports zone based resource selection, the network can provide zone based configuration via only dedicated signalling.\nPower saving of P-UE can be achieved by UE implementation and upper layer mechanisms. P-UE does not perform CBR measurement. However, P-UE adjusts the transmission parameters based on the default transmission parameter configuration, which can be provided to the P-UE via RRC signalling.\nTo support the co-existence of CEN DSRC and V2X sidelink communication, the upper layers of the UE which is performing V2X sidelink communication send an indication to lower layers when the UE is within the proximity of CEN DSRC tolling station(s).\nFor V2X communication in uplink, maximum 8 SPS configurations with different parameters can be configured by eNB and all SPS configurations can be active at the same time. The activation/deactivation of each SPS configuration is signalled via PDCCH by eNB. The existing logical channel prioritization for Uu is used.\nFor V2X communication, UE assistance information can be provided to eNB. Reporting of UE assistance information is configured by eNB. The UE assistance information includes parameters (e.g. a set of preferred SPS interval, timing offset with respect to subframe 0 of the SFN 0, LCID and maximum TB size based on observed traffic pattern) related to the SPS configuration. Triggering of UE assistance information transmission is left to UE implementation. For instance, the UE is allowed to report the UE assistance information when change in estimated periodicity and/or timing offset of packet arrival occurs. For V2X communication via Uu, SR mask as per legacy mechanism can be used.\nFor unicast transmission of V2X messages, the V2X message can be delivered via Non-GBR bearers as well as GBR bearers. In order to meet the QoS requirements for V2X message delivery for V2X services, a Non-GBR QCI value and a GBR QCI value for V2X messages are used as specified in TS 23.285 [72].\nFor broadcasting V2X messages, SC-PTM or MBSFN transmission can be used. In order to reduce SC-PTM/MBSFN latency, shorter (SC-)MCCH repetition period for SC-PTM/MBSFN, modification period for SC-PTM/MBSFN and MCH scheduling period for MBSFN are supported. Reception of downlink broadcast of V2X messages in different carriers/PLMNs can be supported by having multiple receiver chains in the UE. A GBR QCI value is used for the delivery of V2X messages over MBMS bearers as specified in TS 23.285 [72].\n",

The RAN-assisted codec adaptation mechanism supports the uplink/downlink bit rate increase or decrease. For a bearer associated with configuration of MBR greater than GBR (see clauses 11.4 and 13.2), the recommended uplink/downlink bit rate is within boundaries set by the MBR and GBR of the concerned bearer.\nFor uplink or downlink bit rate adaptation, eNB may send a recommended bit rate to the UE to inform the UE on the currently recommended transport bit rate on the local uplink or downlink, which the UE may use in combination with other information to adapt the bit rate, e.g. the UE may send a bit rate request to the peer UE via application layer messages as specified in TS 26.114 [74], which the peer UE may use in combination with other information to adapt the codec bit rate. The recommended bit rate is in kbps at the physical layer at the time when the decision is made.\nThe recommended bit rate for UL and DL is conveyed as a MAC Control Element (CE) from the eNB to the UE as outlined in Figure 23.15.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a chart with two axes, one labeled \"UL Bit Rate\" and the other \"DL Bit Rate,\" indicating the bit rate recommendations for both Uplink and Downlink (UL) and Downlink (DL) transmissions, respectively. The chart shows a range of bit rates from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps, with a clear visual representation of the relationship between bit rate and the corresponding bit rate recommendation. This figure is crucial for network planning and design, as it helps in determining the optimal transmission rates for different applications and network conditions.\nFigure 23.15.1-1: UL or DL bit rate recommendation\nBased on the recommended bit rate from the eNB, a UE may initiate an end-to-end bit rate adaptation with its peer (UE or MGW). The UE may also send a query message to its local eNB to check if a bit rate recommended by its peer can be provided by the eNB.

In the PUSCH enhancement mode, the PUSCH maximum bandwidth is 20MHz. The UE transition between normal mode and PUSCH enhancement mode is controlled and triggered by RRC signalling, As part of the transition procedure, the UL HARQ operation switches between synchronous (normal mode) and asynchronous (PUSCH enhancement mode), with a partial MAC reset.\nPUSCH coverage enhancement requires that air interface delay budget can be relaxed to increase the robustness of the transmission. Such relaxation may be achieved when a UE in good coverage indicates a preference to the eNB to reduce the local air interface delay by sending a UEAssistanceInformation message with delayBudgetReport set to type1 to decrease the DRX cycle length, so that the E2E delay and jitter can be reduced. The peer UE in bad coverage can send a UEAssistanceInformation message with delayBudgetReport set to type2 to its eNB to indicate a preference on Uu air interface delay adjustments, see TS 36.331 [16], TS 36.211 [4] and TS 36.213 [6]. Based on the UE report and other information, the E-UTRAN may configure the UE with coverage enhancement techniques.

It may be provided by the network when downlink and uplink frame timing are not aligned at eNB. The  is also used in the random access procedure, to determine the start time of random access response window after a random access preamble transmission (see TS 36.213 [6]).\nThe Service link RTT, Feeder link RTT, the RP, the Common TA,  and TTA (see clause 23.21.2.2) are illustrated in Figure 23.21.2.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a timing relationship between an eNB and a NTN Gateway, illustrating the synchronization of their clocks. This is crucial for ensuring accurate time synchronization in a 5G network, as it enables the efficient transmission of time-sensitive data.\nFigure 23.21.2.1-1: Illustration of timing relationship (for collocated eNB and NTN Gateway)\nThe network may configure the HARQ operation as follows:\n-\tFor downlink, HARQ feedback can be enabled or disabled per HARQ process (by dedicated RRC signalling and/or DCI based indication). Disabling HARQ feedback allows scheduling a HARQ process before one HARQ RTT has elapsed since last scheduled;\n-\tFor uplink, HARQ mode (i.e. HARQ mode A or HARQ mode B) can be configured per HARQ process (as specified in clause 5.4.3.1 and clause 5.7 of TS 36.321 [13]). HARQ mode B allows scheduling a HARQ process before one HARQ RTT has elapsed since last scheduled. HARQ mode configuration is not applicable for PUR transmissions.\nNOTE:\tFor the HARQ processes configured with HARQ feedback enabled/disabled, it is up to network implementation to ensure a proper configuration of HARQ feedback (e.g., either all enabled or all disabled) for HARQ processes used by a downlink SPS configuration. For the HARQ processes configured with HARQ mode, it is up to network implementation to ensure a proper configuration of HARQ mode (e.g., either all HARQ mode A or all HARQ mode B) for HARQ processes used by an uplink SPS configuration.\nFor the serving cell, the network broadcast ephemeris information and common Timing Advance (common TA) parameters.\nThe UE shall have valid GNSS position as well as the ephemeris and common TA before connecting to an NTN cell. To achieve synchronisation, before and during connection to a cell, the UE shall pre-compensate the Timing Advance (TTA, see TS 36.211 [4] clause 8.1), see Figure 23.21.2.2-1, by considering the common TA, UE position and the NTN payload position through the ephemeris.\nThe UE computes the frequency Doppler shift of the service link, and pre-compensates for it in the uplink transmissions, by considering UE position and the ephemeris. If the UE does not have valid ephemeris and Common TA, it shall not transmit until they are regained. If the GNSS position becomes out-dated, it shall not transmit unless configured with uplink transmissions extension that is active.\nIn connected mode, the UE shall continuously update the Timing Advance and frequency pre-compensation. The UE can be triggered to perform, or configured to autonomously perform, GNSS acquisition. In connected mode, upon outdated ephemeris and common Timing Advance, the UE shall acquire the broadcasted parameters. Upon failed GNSS acquisition, the UE shall move to idle mode if the GNSS position is outdated and uplink transmission extension is not active. Upon outdated GNSS position the UE shall move to idle mode, unless GNSS acquisition was triggered or uplink transmission extension is active. Upon completing the GNSS acquisition, the UE shall trigger remaining validity duration reporting (see TS 36.321 [13]).\nNOTE:\tThe AS operations (e.g. RLM related timers, dataInactivityTimer, CHO execution, neighbour cell measurement, RACH, SR, and BSR) are suspended when UE is performing GNSS acquisition and resumed when the GNSS acquisition is completed.\nThe UEs may be configured to report Timing Advance at initial access or in connected mode. In connected mode, event-triggered reporting of the Timing Advance is supported.\nThe figure depicts a Uplink/Downlink radio frame timing at the UE, illustrating the timing of the radio signal transmission and reception. The timing is crucial for ensuring reliable communication, as it determines the accuracy of the received signal. The figure shows the timing of the radio signal in relation to the time of day, which can affect the signal quality. The timing is also affected by the distance between the transmitter and receiver, as well as the presence of obstacles such as buildings or trees. The figure is important for understanding the timing of radio signals in a 5G network, which is crucial for ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 23.21.2.2-1: Illustration of Uplink/Downlink Radio Frame Timing at the UE\nWhile the pre-compensation of the instantaneous Doppler shift experienced on the service link is to be performed by the UE, the management of Doppler shift experienced over the feeder link and transponder frequency error, whether introduced in Downlink or Uplink, is left to network implementation.\n",

            "description": "\n\n\n\n\nEach radio access technology has defined specific \"classes\" of terminals in terms of radio capabilities. E.g. in GPRS the \"multislot classes\" are defined, in UMTS R'99 different dedicated bearer classes are defined and for HSDPA and HSUPA 12 respectively 6 physical layer categories are defined. The definition of UMTS R'99 UE classes lead to 7 DL classes and 7 UL classes for FDD out of which only 2 DL and 3 UL classes were commercially realized. Furthermore the lower end classes (e.g. 64 UL and 64 DL) disappeared from the market with commercialization of the UMTS networks quite soon. Besides these class definitions a huge number of possible parameter combinations (to achieve certain data rates) exist with UMTS R'99 which lead to the huge number of RAB and RB combinations defined. Further activities in the early phase of UMTS standardization aimed to reduce the number of possible combinations significantly.\nFor HSDPA two \"simple\" DL categories (11 & 12) with lowered complexity were defined with the intent to speed up commercialization of HSDPA. Originally those categories should have been removed for Rel-6. Out of the 12 defined categories only approx. 4 will be realized in commercial HSDPA platform products. A similar situation is likely for HSUPA as well as for the combinations of HSDPA/HSUPA.\nGenerally the aim to mandate certain essential functions/requirements can help to simplify the system definition as well as the realization options (e.g. mandating 20 MHz of DL reception as well as 20 MHz UL transmission bandwidth significantly reduced the E-UTRAN system complexity). Especially mandating certain terminal functions could be useful for the system design if a defined subset of parameter combinations are also supported by the systems, e.g. the eNB scheduler. However, there is also a risk that not all the defined E-UTRA features are deployed in the networks at the time when terminals are made commercially available on the market place. Some features are likely to be rather large and complex, which further increases the risk of interoperability problems unless these features have undergone sufficient interoperability testing (IOT) on real network equipment, and preferably with more than one network in order to improve the confidence of the UE implementation. Thus, avoiding unnecessary UE mandatory features but instead defining a limited set of UE radio classes allows simplification for the interoperability testing.\nGiven the discussion above, it seems beneficial for the introduction of E-UTRAN to limit the combination of radio capabilities to a clearly defined subset and ensure that a given set of parameters is supported by certain UE classes as well as networks for rapid E-UTRAN deployment. It seems unrealistic to mandate only one single UE class which always mandates the maximum capability.\nIn order to address the different market requirements (low end, medium and high end), the definition of the following UE classes are proposed:\nTable G-1: E-UTRAN UE Classes\n\nNOTE:\tFor simplification reasons, the table only depict the UE capabilities in terms of uplink and downlink peak data rates supported. However, it should be noted that further discussion on other features is expected once the work progresses.\nIt may require further discussion whether there be a need for an additional terminal class between 2 Mbps and 50 Mbps classes. It might make sense, since up to 5 MHz band allocations may be rather common in real deployments for several years. This would point to bit rate class of 25 Mbps in DL and 10 Mbps in UL.\nThe above given data rates are indicative and should be subject for further discussions in 3GPP RAN working groups. Depending on the different solutions to reach those data rates, the target should be to define [3..4] UE classes in different data rate ranges, and other parameters affecting device complexity and cost. The definition of the required parameters/features is for further study for each of the classes. For instance, half-duplex UEs form a specific category that may be frequency band specific.\nNOTE:\tthe support of half-duplex UEs is mandatory for the eNB where such a category is allowed in the frequency band supported by the eNB.\nThe aim is to ensure on the one hand that high end E-UTRAN UEs, supporting data rates representing state of the art level and competitive with other radio technologies are defined, while the medium and lower data rates aim to reduce implementation cost for chipset/terminal vendors and allow adoption of most cost efficient solutions for different market segments. It is expected that the support of the high end data rate terminals is ensured from the very beginning.\nAnother clear exception from this exercise is that on the low end very cheap product implementation is possible (e.g. for the machine-to-machine market or the voice and very low data rate only segment – to substitute GSM in the medium term) while top end performance is needed for data applications in notebooks, wireless gateways (\"wireless DSL\"), etc.\nAnother important aspect that must be ensured is that a higher capability UE can be treated in exactly the same way as for a lower capability UE, if the network wishes to do so, e.g., in case the network does not support some higher capability features. In HSDPA, there have been problems in this respect due to 2-stage rate matching in HARQ. Such problems should be avoided in E-UTRAN, and E-UTRAN UE capabilities should provide the compatibility to ease implementation and interoperability testing.\n\nThis Annex defines two ranges of SPID (Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency Priority) values, respectively Operator Specific and Reference values. The mapping at eNB of Reference SPID values to cell reselection and inter-RAT/inter frequency handover priorities is defined.\n",

It provides control data, e.g. Ephemeris, to the non-NTN infrastructure eNB functions of the eNB.\nProvision of NTN control data to the eNB is out of 3GPP scope.\nNOTE:\tThe transport of Uu protocol between the NTN Service Link provisioning system and the non-NTN infrastructure eNB functions is out of 3GPP scope.\nAt least the following NTN related parameters are expected to be provided by O&M to the eNB for its operation.\na) Earth fixed beams: for each beam provided by a given NTN-payload:\n-\tThe Cell identifier (S1 and Uu) mapped to the beam;\n-\tThe Cell's reference location (e.g. cell's center and range).\nb) Quasi Earth fixed beams: for each beam provided by a given NTN-payload:\n-\tThe Cell identifier (S1 and Uu) and time window mapped to a beam;\n-\tThe Cell's/beam's reference location (e.g. cell's center and range);\n-\tThe time window of the successive switchovers (feeder link, service link);\n-\tThe identifier and time window of all serving NTN payloads and NTN-Gateways.\nc) Earth moving beams: for each beam provided by a given NTN-payload:\n-\tThe Uu Cell identifier mapped to a beam and mapping information to fixed geographical areas reported on NG, including information about the beams direction and motion of the beam's foot print on Earth;\n-\tIts elevation with regard to NTN-payload;\n-\tSchedule of successive serving NTN-Gateways/eNBs;\n-\tSchedule of successive switchovers (feeder link, service link).\n\n\n\nNOTE:\tThe CR number, 0616 in RP-140876 was renumbered into 0616a in CR database since the CR number was double allocated in RP-140351 at RAN #63 and in RP-140876 at RAN#64.\n",
