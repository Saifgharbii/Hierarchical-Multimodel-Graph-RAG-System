            "description": "Considering public safety users specifically, different scenarios of public safety broadband wireless communications systems deployments will emerge, but some requirements remain common. In international or multi agency collaboration scenarios public safety MCX Service Users are required to roam or migrate from one system to another, need to use MCX Services or be included in specific communication events in a Partner MCX Service System on a temporary basis.\nPublic safety may also deploy their own mobile, local, countrywide or national broadband communications systems. In order to grant visiting MCX Service Users access to a Partner MCX Service System and its services, a mechanism is required which allows the request and/or transmission of administrative configuration data, to be exchanged between connected MCX Service Systems. This type of administrative configuration data is used for adding MCX Service Users into a Partner MCX Service System’s user database and for enabling or disabling certain services. Relevant information can be exchanged prior to the visiting MCX Service Users arriving from a Partner MCX Service System or dynamically during events for example.\nSuch mechanism can be realised with the administrative configuration data and information exchange concept, discussed in this study.\n",

The Dutch control centre contacts the German MCX Service System via the High Level Protocol and announces that a police officer with Dutch and German language skills is available at the scene of the accident and requests the ability to participate in the local police incident communications.\nThe relevant German command and control room receives the support offer and approves the request.

Calls from the public to report the incident reach the relevant Belgian, Dutch and German command and control centres. As the relevant PPDR organizations in the region have bi-lateral incidence support agreements in place, the Belgian and Dutch PPDR organizations immediately offer resources to the relevant German authorities.\nAdministrative information is transmitted in a pre-agreed format to the relevant German command and control centre and includes capability information, such as what type of rescue equipment can be made available or what type of hazardous materials can be dealt with, as well as the MCX user IDs of the first responder able to operate the relevant equipment. The information transmitted includes an estimated time to reach the incident site.\nSince the accident involves trains and rail equipment, the relevant rail authorities and support groups need to be contacted and brought into the rescue efforts.\nIn order to ensure operational safety of the first responders on-site and a quick response to on-site emergency calls, their respective MCX Service UE’s emergency call communication is reconfigured to be routed to a specific mobile on-site emergency call centre.\nThe relevant German command and control centre analyses the information received and requests the resources that are deemed necessary to support the rescue efforts. Information such as configuration data and authorizations are then transmitted back to the relevant Belgian and Dutch control centres and rail emergency command and control centre authorized user(s) to allow the relevant MCX UEs to affiliate with the relevant German MCX Service System talk groups.\nThis allows the multi-agency rescue and first response efforts to be coordinated efficiently and ensures communication is possible with all resources involved in the incident.\n",
