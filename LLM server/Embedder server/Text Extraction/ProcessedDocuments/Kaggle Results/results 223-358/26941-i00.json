According to the supported features, functionalities and different groups of UEs, the multiple Network Slices can be deployed by the operator. More specifically, the network slice can support different functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), different performance requirements (e.g., latency, data rates), or different targeted users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or MVNO hosting users). For example, based on the operator’s needs, there can be one network slice for MIoT services, one for supporting eMBB UEs and another one for V2X services.\nA Network Slice instance is a set of Network Function instances and the required resources (e.g. compute, storage and networking resources) which form a deployed Network Slice. A slice instance includes both core network control plane and user plane network functions as defined in clause 4.15.1 of [7].\nA UE can access multiple Network Slices simultaneously. Figure 4.2.1-1 below shows some illustrative scenarios. The occurrence of PDU Session Establishment in a Network Slice instance to a DN allows data transmission in that Network Slice instance.\nNOTE:\tIn the context of 5G Media Streaming, PDU Sessions of type IPv4 or IPv6 are the primary focus.\nThe Network Slice Selection policies in the UE are used to associate an application with a specific network slice during PDU Session Establishment. A PDU Session belongs to one and only one specific Network Slice instance per PLMN. Therefore, different Network Slice instances do not share a PDU Session. But multiple PDU Sessions in different Network Slice instances may be associated with the same Data Network, identified by the same DNN.\nFigure 4.2.1-1: Mapping of PDU Sessions to Data Network Names and Network Slice instances\nIn addition, enhancements to interworking between the EPC and the 5GC have been made to the 5G System, and network slice-specific authentication and authorization are also supported. For each network slice that is subject to Network Slice Admission Control, the monitoring and control of the number of registered UEs, the number of PDU Sessions and the slice-maximum bit rate are defined in order to ensure that the maximum resource of the network slice is not exceeded.\n",

                            "text_content": "Before application services are allowed to access specific network slices, a third-party Application Service Provider can negotiate with the MNO and the MNO may create or allocate the network slices based on the service requirements. For example, a cloud gaming service provider may interact with the MNO to reserve specific network slices supporting low latency, and high computing resources.\nAfterwards, the Application Function, on behalf of the Application Service Provider, informs the 5GC that the target application service can use the specific network slices, i.e., by providing application guidance for UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) determination as defined in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502 [15]. Depending on the nature of the application guidance, the operator may update the Network Slice Selection policies in the URSP accordingly. As a consequence, the application service may be migrated to the new network slice/DNN duple based on the updated URSP rule.\nThe URSP rules in the UE, which are used to associate applications with usage of particular network slices, may be pre-configured or provided by the PCF as defined in TS 23.503 [16]. Each URSP rule is expressed as a traffic descriptor for application detection, e.g. IP descriptors, application descriptors, domain descriptors.\nNOTE:\tThere is no restriction on which part of UE should (re-)evaluate the URSP rules. This may be done by either the Operating System or the modem layer.\nOnce an application is started or detected on the UE, the following procedure is followed:\n1.\tThe UE evaluates its URSP rules in the order of Rule Precedence and determines whether the application matches the Traffic descriptor of any URSP rule.\na.\tWhen a URSP rule is determined to be applicable for a given application, the UE derives the suitable network slices based on the applicable URSP rule.\nb.\tIf the UE determines that there is more than one existing PDU Session which matches a given URSP rule, it is up to UE implementation (Operating System or modem layer) to select one of them to use. Otherwise, the UE tries to establish a new PDU Session using the derived network slices.\n2.\tIf there is no matching URSP rule (except the “match all” rule), the UE uses its own local configuration (if any) to determine which PDU Session to use.\nNOTE:\tThe UE local configuration in this context is information about the associated application, such as application-specific parameters to set up a PDU Session or end user configuration for specific applications. This can be provisioned in the UE via the application layer, e.g. following interaction between the Edge Enabler Client (EEC) and the Edge Configuration Server (ECS), as defined in TS 23.558 [24].\n3.\tWhen URSP rules are updated, or when a particular URSP rule’s validity changes, the association of existing applications to PDU Sessions may need to be re-evaluated.\n4.\tDepending on UE implementation, the associations between applications and PDU Sessions may also be re-evaluated periodically, independent of any changes to URSP rules.\nIn the case where a network slice becomes unavailable (e.g. due to overload), the AMF is triggered, either by local configuration (e.g. trigger from OAM) or by a notification from the Access and Mobility Management PCF (AM PCF) or by the NSSF [26], to replace the current S-NSSAI with a previously chosen Alternative S-NSSAI. Using a suitable NAS procedure (e.g. UE Configuration Update) the AMF informs the UE about the Alternative S-NSSAI as well as providing the mapping between S-NSSAI(s) and Alternative S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed NSSAI and/or in the Configured NSSAI.\n1.\tIn the case where there is no existing PDU Session in the unavailable slice and the UE is trying to establish a new one to support a 5G Media Streaming session, the UE may provide both the Alternative S-NSSAI and the current S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Establishment message, in which case the AMF provides both S-NSSAI values to the SMF for the PDU Session establishment. The SMF proceeds with the PDU Session Establishment using the Alternative S-NSSAI. As a result, the new PDU Session is established over the Alternative S-NSSAI with a new IP address.\n2.\tIn the case where an ongoing 5G Media Streaming session is already being carried over the PDU Session associated with the unavailable slice, the AMF informs the SMF responsible for the PDU Session that it is to be transferred to the Alternative S-NSSAI. Then, depending on the Session and Service Continuity (SSC) mode of the existing PDU Session, either:\n-\tSSC mode 1: The SMF further updates the network slices in the UE/RAN/UPF via the PDU Session Modification procedure. In this case, the IP address of the PDU Session remains the same.\n-\tSSC mode 2 or 3: The SMF triggers the modification/release of the PDU Session and re-establishment of the PDU Session in the Alternative S-NSSAI. In this case, a new IP address is allocated during the PDU Session re-establishment procedure and the ongoing 5G Media Streaming session at reference point M4 and M5 needs to be migrated to the new PDU Session.\nEditor's note:\tthe above descriptions of Network Slice Replacement will be updated to aligned with SA2’s conclusion.\n",

One of the issues relating to service-level specifications documented in clause 6.3.2 of [25] is the issue of network slice load analysis, described as follows:\n\nFrom the above, it is understood that a Network Slice can become overloaded from time to time, and that consequently the slice cannot satisfy the traffic requirements, and therefore may fail to meet its SLA.\nClause 5.1 of TR 23700-41 [26] describes a related key issue \"Key Issue#1: Support of Network Slice Service Continuity\" in terms similar to the issue described above in [25] above. Specifically, aspects related to service continuity are being studied for two scenarios - a \"no mobility\" scenario and an \"inter-RA mobility\" scenario - in the case when a Network Slice or Network Slice instance in the Core Network (CN) or target CN is overloaded or undergoing planned maintenance (e.g., Network Slice termination), and the network performance of the Network Slice cannot meet the SLA.\nAs described in clause 4.2.2 of the present document, SA2 is in the process of specifying a method where an alternative slice is identified in advance, with the aim of migrating application traffic from the PDU Session in the current slice to the existing PDU Session or a new one in that alternative slice.\nThe 5G System provides generic support for moving application flows to different slices. As described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501 [7] on determining whether ongoing traffic can be routed over existing PDU Sessions in other Network Slices:\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that either the URSP rules delivered to the UE or the UE local configuration determine how ongoing application traffic can be routed over existing PDU Sessions belonging to other Network Slices.\nClause 4.2.2 of the present document describes how the URSP rules are used to route application traffic through appropriate network slices.\nFor UE Local Configuration, clause 6.1.2.2.1 of [16] describes UE policy control, and specifies that among the four policy objects - Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP), UE Route Selection Policy (URSP), V2X Policy (V2XP), and ProSe Policy (ProSeP) - only ANDSP and URSP may be pre-configured in the UE.\n",

                    "text_content": "TS 28.530 [3] and TS 28.531 [4] specify general concepts related to network slicing and slice life cycle management including specification of roles related to network slicing such as the CSC, CSP, NOP, NSC, and NSP. A network operator can perform both the roles of a CSP and NSP. A request from a CSC or NSC to the CSP or the NSP respectively for setting up a network slice is in the form of a set of slice attributes that represents the service requirements for the service that the customer intends to provide to its users.\nThe GSM Association describes a GST template [5] which specifies a set of attributes that characterize a given type of network slice/service. The slice customer prepares a NEST based on GST attributes and forwards it to the NSP for slice orchestration. A NEST is a GST filled with values. A study on GST attributes is specified in TR 23.700-40 [6], and a reference to GST attributes is included in clause 5.15.2.2 of TS 23.501 [7]. GST attributes and NEST are also discussed in study on network slice capability exposure for application enablement (NSCALE) in TR 23.700-99 [8]. The normative specification for this work is being specified in TS 23.435 [9].\nGST attributes, as defined in [5], are categorized into two types:\n-\tCharacter attributes: These attributes typically characterize a slice (e.g., throughput, latency, APIs etc.). The character attributes can be further classified as relating to performance, function, or control and management\n-\tScalability attributes: These attributes provide information about the scalability of a slice (e.g., number of UEs)\nThe CSP/NSP translates the NEST to service requirements for a set of subnets (e.g., core, transport network, RAN) using the slice NRM as described in TS 28.530 [3], TS 28.541 [10], TS 28.542 [11]. Based on individual slice subnet requirements, slice subnet resources are provisioned using slice orchestration operations for creating and managing NSI and NSSI resources as defined in TS 28.531 [4]. Such operations include:\n-\tCreation/modification/termination of NSI instances.\n-\tCreation/modification/termination of NSSI instances.\n-\tCreation/modification/termination of 3GPP NF instances.\nManagement and orchestration concepts such as provisioning management services, fault supervision management services, and performance assurance management services in addition to management service specification on the above slice resources are specified in TS 28.532 [12]. TS 28.545 [13] and TS 28.546 [14] describe fault supervision aspects of management and orchestration of networks and network slicing.\nTS 23.501 [7] and TS 23.502 [15] specify control plane architecture and procedures on enabling the connection of the UE to the above provisioned network slices including establishment of PDU sessions through those slices to the intended DNN. TS 23.503 [16] describes the data model for URSP rules and NSSP policies that enable UE application traffic to be routed through the provisioned network slices to the respective DNNs.\nIn addition, a study on network slice capability exposure for application layer enablement is described in TR 23.700-99 [8]. The application layer enablement architecture in [8] is based on the Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL) whose functional architecture and information flows are specified in TS 23.434 [17].\nOne of the key issues under study in [8] is whether a more concise approach to managing the lifecycle of network slices exposed to the application layer with additional functionality for verticals can be defined. One of the solutions being studied in clause 6.1.1 of [8] is to interface the network slice capability enablement server with the 5G system in order to perform all the network slice lifecycle management operations defined in [3] and [4]. With this capability, applications of different verticals can interface with the network slice capability enablement server for all network slice related operations.\nTS 27.007 [18], in clause 10.1, describes how via AT commands the UE is able to set network slice preferences.\n",

A customer intending to provide a service to its users with differentiated quality of service or experience, requests that the operator sets up communication services in a network slice through which its users can access the customer’s service. The customer does not have any information about the slice internals, and completely relies on the operator to set up the resources requested by the customer in a network slice and make the service accessible to that customer’s users in that slice.\nThe customer and the operator negotiate a set of service requirements based on the expectation of the service that the customer intends to provide to its users. One way of negotiating service requirements is the use of GST attributes specified by GSM Association in [5]. Some of the performance-related GST attributes resemble the QoS service requirements specified in TS 26.501 [20] and TS 26.512 [21] as part of the M1d reference point specification.\nNOTE:\tA detailed mapping between the GST attributes and the QoS attributes specified in [20] and [21] is for future study.\nIn this scenario, an Application Service Provider, as a customer of the operator providing a network slice, can negotiate service parameters to be provided in a network slice. Based on the negotiated service requirements, the operator provisions necessary control and management functions to enable the setting up of an end-to-end network slice spanning different slice domains (e.g., RAN, Core, Transport etc.). The operator-provided management functions manage the end-to-end operation of the network slice and guarantee the availability of application functions that are deployed in that slice. TS 28.545 [13], TS 28.546 [14], TS 28.552 [22], TS 28.554 [23] define fault management and performance management capabilities which can be used to measure and assure the health of different slice resources.\nBy delegating these functions to the Mobile Network Operator, a media Application Service Provider can focus on media service delivery, using the 5G Media Streaming capabilities defined in TS 26.501 [20] and TS 26.512 [21], by interacting with the application functions provisioned in the network slice.\n",

The operator creates a network slice and hands over the network slice to the third-party entity. This mode of operation is specified in [3] and is referred to as NSaaS. Once the slice is handed over, the third-party entity can enhance the network slice e.g., by adding custom network functions, modifying slice configuration etc.\nA method for negotiating requirements for NSaaS service is the use of GST attributes specified by the GSM Association [5]. In addition to the performance-related character attributes, a number of scalability-related attributes can be used to describe the requirements of the slice to be provisioned in the 5G System.\nThe third-party entity can then provide the network slice resources to its customers. As described in the previous scenario, customers of the third-party entity can then negotiate with the third-party entity to set up communication services in that network slice. The users of the customers will then be able to access the customer’s service using the provisioned network slice.\nAn Application Service Provider can function as the third-party entity in this scenario and can receive a provisioned network slice as a service from the Mobile Network Operator. In this case, the Application Service Provider may, in addition to the capabilities described in [20] and [21], also have additional facilities to control and manage the resources of the network slice.\nNOTE:\tIt is for future study to identify how the capabilities available as a NSaaS consumer specified in [3] benefit an Application Service Provider whose role is specified in [20] and [21]. This scenario is therefore not considered further in the present document.\nEditor's note:\t[8] and [9] are to be monitored for specification related to the interface capabilities between the third-party entity and the NSCE server for control of network slices.\n",

Some of these [31][32][33] have information about possible ways network slicing could be used. Based on literature study, and related standard specification in 3GPP and other SDOs, we can discuss network slicing scenarios from the following perspective.\nClause 5.15.2 of TS 23.501 [7] describes the identification of network slice using NSSAI, and specifies the following:\n\nTable 5.15.2.2-1 of TS 23.501 [7] specifies standardized SST values. [36][30][37] shed light on usage of the SD value as a way to describe services, customer information and slice priority. Of particular interest amongst these three types of information is the customer information (or the tenancy information) which indicates the slice allocated to a specific customer/tenant, and the service information (to identify a service/application).\nBased on the above NSSAI identification, different network slicing scenarios are possible:\n1.\tA slice allocated for a specific customer/tenant. For example, a network slice allocated by the MNO for a specific enterprise. In this scenario, all applications of every UE in the enterprise use the allocated network slice. The SD field of the S-NSSAI is used to indicate the customer/tenant.\n-\tBoth the Android [38] and iOS [39] mobile Operating Systems have recently started supporting 5G network slicing in mobile devices for enterprise users. Android 12 onwards supports network slicing with a separate enterprise slice and slicing based on user profiles, while Android 13 onwards supports network slicing with multiple enterprise slices [38].\n2.\tA slice allocated for a specific customer/tenant for a specific service/application. For example, a network slice allocated by the MNO for a specific enterprise and application. In this scenario, the application in every UE in the enterprise uses the allocated enterprise network slice; all other applications in enterprise UEs use a different (possibly default) network slice. The SD field of the S-NSSAI is used to indicate the customer/tenant and the service information.\n3.\tA slice allocated for a specific service/application: For example, a slice optimized for 5G Media Streaming. In this scenario, the optimized slice is shared between all UEs, specifically for 5G Media Streaming application; the UEs use a different (possibly default) slice for other applications/services. The SD field of the S-NSSAI is used to indicate the service/application.\n-\tThe GSM Association specifies application-based network slicing [35], in which different network slices are provisioned for different applications.\n4.\tA slice leased by MNO to a virtual operator.

The network slicing feature allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as bandwidth and processing power, to different applications based on their requirements. This enables the efficient use of network resources and supports the delivery of high-quality media streaming services to users.\nFigure 5.4.1.2-1: Downlink media streaming with AF and AS in an external Data Network (OTT)\nwith Network Slicing\nThe 5GMSd Application Provider may negotiate with the MNO for the creation of a network slice as described in clause 4.2.2.

All M4d and M5d interactions happen through a PDU Session established within the provisioned network slice.\nThis collaboration scenario shown in figure 5.4.1.3-1 represents a multi-MNO distribution scenario where an external CDN (5GMSd AS) is used to deliver content to multiple UEs connected to different 5GMSd-capable PLMNs, as described in clause A.8 of TS 26.501 [20], but delivered using network slices on those PLMNs.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where downlink media streaming is performed in two trusted Data Networks sharing an AS in an external Data Network with Network Slicing.

An external CDN (5GMSd AS) is accessed by the UE via this Data Network.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where downlink media streaming is performed using an AS in an external Data Network accessible through two different network slices. The AS is located in the external Data Network, which is accessible through two different network slices. This setup allows for efficient and reliable data transmission, as the AS can be accessed from both the internal and external network slices. The figure illustrates the use of the AS to support media streaming, with the media being transmitted over the external Data Network.\nFigure 5.4.2.1-1: Downlink media streaming with AS in external Data Network accessible through two different network slices\nThe 5GMSd Application Provider may negotiate with the MNO to setup two different network slices with different SLAs as described in clause 4.3. After the SLA negotiation, the operator may provision two network slices, and provide connectivity services to the external Data Network through both the slices.\nThe 5GMSd Application Provider may deliver Service Access Information through reference point M8d. The Service Access Information delivered to the 5GMSd-Aware Application may have information about different Service Operation Points accessible through each of the network slices. Upon receiving the Service Access Information, the 5GMSd-Aware Application passes this information to the 5GMSd Client. The 5GMSd Client selects the Service Operation Point of interest, and requests media streaming session establishment over the PDU Session in the network slice that provides the required Service Operation Point. Media streaming (M4d) thus happens through the selected network slice.\nThe other network slice may be used to fetch other media streaming assets (depending on criticality and SLA availability considerations), or serves as an alternate network slice in case the first slice becomes unavailable, as discussed in clause 6.3.\nNOTE:\tThe usage of multiple network slices simultaneously by the same application is currently not supported by either Android or iOS. This collaboration scenario is unlikely to be deployed.\nThis collaboration scenario shown in figure 5.4.2.2-1 represents the case of accessing two different Data Networks using the same network slice as shown in figure 4.2.1-1. A CDN server (5GMSd AS) is either deployed in each of the trusted Data Networks, or presents a multi-homed interface at reference point M4d through each of the trusted DNs.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an AS (Application Service) is deployed in multiple trusted Data Networks, enabling media streaming services. The network is designed to ensure high availability and reliability, with redundant paths and failover mechanisms.\nFigure 5.4.2.2-1: Downlink media streaming with AS deployed in multiple trusted Data Networks\nThe 5GMSd Application Provider may negotiate with the MNO to provision a network slice as described in clause 4.3. The operator provisions the network slice, and provides connectivity services to both the DNs through the slice.\nThe 5GMSd Application Provider may deliver Service Access Information through reference point M8d. The Service Access Information delivered to the 5GMSd-Aware Application may have information about different Service Operation Points accessible through each of the DNs. For example, an enterprise may utilize an enterprise-specific CDN (e.g., hosting enterprise-related video tutorials). 5G Media Streaming sessions for enterprise-related video tutorials use the PDU Session terminating in the enterprise-specific CDN, while some other video tutorial requests are sent through PDU Sessions terminating in a different CDN. Alternatively, a DN may act as a back-up CDN, utilized by the 5GMSd Client if the primary CDN is inaccessible or unavailable for any reason.\nIn a variant of this scenario, the second CDN may be a CDN edge with optional media processing.\nIn another variation of the above scenario shown in figure 5.4.2.2-1, a common 5GMS AS may serve traffic via two trusted Data Networks down the separate PDU Sessions, as shown in figure 5.4.2.2-2.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a single AS (Application Service) is serving traffic through multiple Data Networks, illustrating the concept of multi-path communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.4.2.2-2: Downlink media streaming with single AS serving traffic\nthrough multiple Data Networks\n",

The traffic belonging to the 5GMSd-Aware Applications of all users is sent through this network slice, while the traffic of other applications is sent through a default network slice (e.g., eMBB).\nThe figure depicts a network slice for a specific application, with all users represented by different colors and layers. The network slice is divided into three main layers: the core network, the application layer, and the user layer. The application layer is highlighted with different colors, indicating different applications or services.

The flow includes the initiation of a new application, the creation of a new network slice, and the deployment of the application on the new slice. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 6.7.2.1-1: Call flow for bootstrapping application invocation on a Network Slice\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.\tThe 5GMS-Aware Application is installed on the UE, and and is programmed to invoke an OS-specific network connection API using a pre-defined OS App Id supported by the UE operating system.\n2.\tThe 5GMS Application Provider provisions the media streaming session in the 5GMS AF with one or more network slices at reference point M1. The provisioning information may include application information such as the ProvisioningSession.externalApplicationId specified in clause 7.2.3.1 of TS 26.512 [21]. The 5GMS AF uses this information to infer application traffic descriptor information used for application guidance, as specified in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502 [15].\n3.\tThe 5GMS AF uses the Nnef_ServiceParameter service defined in clause 5.2.6.1 of TS 23.502 [15] to provide application guidance for URSP determination via the NEF as described in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502 [15], which is eventually delivered to the UE as described in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [15].\nNOTE 1:\tURSP rules may also be configured in the UE as described in clause 4.2.2 of this present document.\n4.

            "description": "Network slicing is one of the key features of 5G which allows Mobile Network Operators to provision logical networks to serve a specific service or service category, or to serve customers with specific service requirements. Network slicing standardization has progressed in various different 3GPP Working Groups. Specification related to this feature includes architecture, orchestration and management, network resource models, capability management and exposure. The Key Issues studied in the present document point to a need to extend the 5GMS architecture in order to take advantage of network slicing when delivering 5G Media Streaming services.\nThe present document provides an overview of network slicing architecture and aspects related to slice orchestration and management as well as network slice capability exposure. It briefly describes different network slice management options such as operator-managed network slicing and third-party-managed network slicing. The present document also collects a set of use cases for running 5G Media Streaming services in one or more network slices, and describes a number of collaboration scenarios for exploiting network slicing capabilities within the 5GMS architecture. It also documents key issues and candidate solutions related to service provisioning, moving media flows to other network slices, and bootstrapping application invocation on a network slice.\nIt is recommended that:\n1.\tThe use cases and collaboration scenarios for network slicing documented in clauses 5.3 and 5.4 respectively be included in an informative annex to TS 26.501 [20].\n2.\tThe changes to the PolicyTemplate resource data model definition described in clause 6.1.2.1 be implemented into TS 26.510 [42] to support Policy Template provisioning for a plurality of Network Slices and/or Data Networks.\n3.\tThe Key Issue description and corresponding candidate solution on bootstrapping application invocation on a Network Slice documented in clause 6.7 of the present document be included as an informative clause or annex to TS 26.501 [20] as guidance for implementations.\n\n",
