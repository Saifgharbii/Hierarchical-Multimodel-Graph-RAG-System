However, due to technical and economic factors, there cannot be full compliance with the general characteristics of international telephone connections and circuits recommended by the ITU-T.\nThe performance requirements are specified in TS 26.131; the test methods and considerations are specified in the main body of the text.\n",

            "description": "The present document is applicable to any terminal capable of supporting narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband telephony, either as a stand-alone service or as the telephony component of a multimedia service. The present document specifies test methods to allow the minimum performance requirements for the electro-acoustic characteristics of GSM, 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals when used to provide narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband telephony to be assessed.\nNOTE\tFor 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN, acoustic requirements are specified in TS 26.131, test methods are specified in TS 26.132. For GSM, most acoustic requirements are specified in TS 43.050, test methods are specified in TS 51.010. These specifications are in many cases harmonized with or even refer to TS 26.131 and TS 26.132. See TS 43.050 and TS 51.010 for details. The reason for including GSM, UMTS, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals within the scope of the present specification is to avoid, whenever possible, duplication of test method descriptions for terminals supporting multiple access technologies..\n",

                    "text_content": "The general access to terminals is described in figure 1. The preferred acoustic access to GSM, 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals is the most realistic simulation of the \"average\" subscriber. This can be made by using HATS (head and torso simulator), with appropriate ear simulation and appropriate mountings of handset terminals to the HATS in a realistic but reproducible way. Hands-free terminals shall use the HATS or free field microphone techniques in a realistic but reproducible way.\nHATS is described in ITU-T Recommendation P.58 [15], appropriate ears are described in ITU-T Recommendation P.57 [14] (Type 3.3), proper positioning of handsets in realistic conditions is found in ITU-T Recommendation P.64, and the test setups for various types of hands-free terminals can be found in ITU-T Recommendation P.581.\nUnless stated otherwise, if a volume control is provided, the setting is chosen such that the nominal RLR is met as close as possible.\nThe preferred way of testing is the connection of a terminal to the system simulator with exact defined settings and access points. The test sequences are fed in either electrically using a reference codec, using the direct signal processing approach, or acoustically using ITU-T specified devices.\nThe system simulator shall simulate the access network and core network including the speech encoding/decoding specified for the test (e.g. AMR-NB or AMR-WB) but excluding further transcoding beyond linear PCM, see Figure 1.\nUnless specified otherwise for the respective test, the radio conditions on the air interface shall have a block error rate of 0% and the jitter in the IP transport for MTSI-based speech shall be ≤ 1 ms.\nNOTE 1: For WLAN connections, an RF shielded room may be one way to achieve these requirements on block error rate and jitter. Otherwise, care should be taken with potential sources of radio interference and their impact.\nIn case of MTSI-based speech, the reference client shall allow to synchronize to the clock of the device under test and include a de-jitter buffer to equalize possible jitter in the signal received from the UE.\nWhen operating with synchronized clock, the de-jitter buffer shall be a static de-jitter buffer and the jitter buffer management shall not compensate for clock skew. The reference client shall not lose or discard packets, shall not trigger retransmission, and shall not use error concealment or time-warping. The initial jitter buffer size (filling level) shall be higher than the maximum expected network jitter and the maximum jitter buffer size shall be at least twice the initial size. During jitter buffer reset, the de-jitter buffer shall be emptied/filled to the initial buffer size. In case of buffer over- or underruns, the reference client shall give a warning and it shall be reported.\nNOTE 2: A static de-jitter buffer is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer which at the beginning buffers packets until a given initial buffer size is reached. Due to changing network delays the filling level of the de-jitter buffer can change, but the sum of network delay and jitter buffer delay is constant (as opposed to an adaptive jitter buffer management). The filling level of the de-jitter buffer represents the de-jitter buffer delay.\nFor measurements with unsynchronized clock e.g. the measurement of clock skew, jitter buffer over- and underruns cannot be avoided due to the unsynchronized clocks. Under the assumption of jitter-free condition the initial jitter buffer size (filling level) shall be chosen such that the maximum clock skew can be compensated without any loss of packets for a given time. For the measurement of clock skews the jitter buffer size should be chosen such that for clock skew of up to 100ppm no loss of packets due to buffer over- or under-run shall occur for a sequence of 160s.\nFor LTE and NR connections, the system simulator shall be configured for FDD operation, with a default or dedicated bearer (EPC) and QoS flow (5GC) and reference measurement channel scheduling that provides enough resource block allocation for transmitting a full speech packet within a transmission time interval of 1ms. No HARQ re-transmissions shall occur. TDD operation, TTI bundling, connected DRX and other forms of scheduling (e.g. SPS) are for further study.\nThe test setup has to ensure proper clock synchronization of the test equipment to the UE. Clock skew shall be negligible and packet loss shall not occur during the test.\nNOTE 3: Any clock skew may result in improper delay calculation or in wrong positioning of the analysis window.\n\nThe figure depicts a connection to a PSTN, which should include electrical echo control (EEC) to ensure reliable communication.\nNOTE:\tConnection to PSTN should include electrical echo control (EEC).\nFigure 1: Interfaces (MRP, ERP/DRP…, Air interface and Point of interconnect) for specification of terminal acoustic characteristics\n",

                            "text_content": "UE testing via analogue connection shall be carried out with a universal wired headset interface, which complies with the electrical and physical characteristics described in clause 6 of ITU-T P.381 [53]. In case the UE is not equipped with this type of socket, but an associated adapter/converter is provided, testing shall be conducted with this additional equipment instead. In case also no associated adapter/converter is provided, but an USB-C port supporting the Audio Adapter Accessory Mode according to Annex A of [56] is available, testing shall be conducted with a generic analogue adapter (Annex A of [56]). Other implementations of analogue electrical interfaces (wired or wireless) are out of scope.\n\nFigure 15a5b illustrates the setup required for testing analogue electrical interfaces. The electric output impedance of the reference interface of the test equipment shall be in the range of 1 Ω and 10 kΩ. The corresponding electric input impedance shall be 32 Ω +/- 2 Ω. The common ground impedance (between sending and receiving sides) for the test system shall be ≤ 0.05 Ω.\n\nIf not specified otherwise, the nominal signal levels are:\n-\t-60 dBV in send direction (input to electrical interface UE), which corresponds to an acoustic level of -4.7 dBPa at the MRP, i.e., a default sensitivity of ~55 dBV/Pa.\n-\t-39 dBV in receive direction (for an electrical interface UE providing stereo/diotic output), for a nominal volume setting (if present).\nFor the receive direction, it is expected that the output signals of the electrical interface UE are identical or at least very close. If not specified otherwise, all measurements in receive shall be conducted with just one of the two channels. For such measurements, the used channel shall be reported.\n\nFor testing echo and double talk scenarios, an artificial feedback of the receive signal into the sending path shall be used. This echo path shall be realized in a digital way, e.g., part of the test system. Analogue realizations, e.g., a stand-alone device, are for further study.\n\nTo apply a certain echo loss (in dB), it is typically assumed that the nominal level for send and receive path are identical. For analogue electrical interface, the difference in nominal levels of -21 dB shall be considered in test setups.\n\nFor measurements without artificial echo loss, the feedback path is disabled.\n\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that mainly passive third-party devices are connected via analogue electrical interface to the UE, which do not contain any typical signal processing capabilities (like e.g., echo cancellation or noise reduction). Thus, all tests specified for this interface are comparable to handset UE or headset UE, i.e. they expect that any possible signal processing is applied in the UE.\nThe figure depicts a test setup for an analogue electrical headset interface, illustrating the various components and their connections.\nFigure 15a5b: Test setup for analogue electrical headset interface\nFigure 15a5c illustrates the setup required for testing digital electrical interfaces of a UE. Such testing is possible with different types of wired and wireless technologies and requires a digital reference interface in the test system. The present document is only applicable to USB and Bluetooth interfaces, other digital interfaces are out of scope.\nFor some combinations of digital electrical interface and codec type, the overall audio bandwidth may be lower as specified in clause 5.4. In such cases, the electrical interface UE shall be tested according to the overall audio bandwidth.\nEXAMPLE:\tElectrical interface UE is connected via Bluetooth transmission in wideband mode to the test equipment. The telephony part of the UE operates with EVS codec in super-wideband mode. Tests for this combination are conducted according to clause 8 (wideband mode) instead of clause 9 (super-wideband mode).\n\nFor testing echo and double talk scenarios, an artificial feedback of the receive signal into the sending path shall be used. This echo path shall be realized as part of the test system. The received and decoded signal from the UE is fed back into the sending direction, in advance to the encoding/protocol/hardware layer. For measurements without artificial echo loss, the feedback path is disabled.\nDigital levels for send and receive direction are specified in dBm0, referring to the same definition as for the input/output of the terminal and the system simulator (see clause 5.2).\nIn contrast to the analogue interface, devices connected to the UE via digital interface may either provide active (includes signal processing for send and/or receive direction) or passive (comparable to analogue headsets, see clause 5.1.6.1) functionalities. Tests are only applicable in case of typical signal processing for telecommunication (e.g., noise reduction, echo cancellation) takes places only in the UE and not in the equipment to be connected. If necessary and if the digital interface and the associated protocols support the exchange of commands/meta-information, the electrical interface UE shall be configured in such away that carries out its own signal processing. Performance tests according to clauses 7-10 are not applicable in case the signal processing in the UE cannot be enabled in any way for the electrical interface.\nIn some cases, a digital headset with higher computing capabilities may provide and signal its own signal processing when connecting to the electrical interface UE. It is expected that the UE will take the headset's capabilities into account to avoid possible tandem signal processing. For this purpose, a minimum set of transparency tests are described in Annex G and shall be conducted in advance to the actual testing. The results of the transparency tests shall be reported.\nA full set of appropriate transparency tests can be found in Recommendation ITU-T P.383 [55], but further testing beyond Annex G is out of scope for the present document.\nThe figure depicts a test setup for a digital electrical headset interface, illustrating the various components and their connections. The setup includes a digital audio interface (DAI), a microphone, a speaker, and a power supply. The DAI is connected to the headset via a cable, while the microphone and speaker are connected to the power supply. The setup is designed to ensure a stable and high-quality audio experience for the user.\nFigure 15a5c: Test setup for digital electrical headset interface\nThe digital reference interface shall comply with the accuracy requirements for test equipment described in clause 5.3.\nIt is expected that the volume control at the digital electrical interface UE does not have a direct effect on the signal in receive direction. In most cases, the volume setting at the connected equipment with acoustical interface (e.g., a digital headset) is remote-controlled instead.\nIn consequence, the digital reference interface shall not attenuate or amplify the digitally transmitted signal at the electrical interface in case the volume control at the UE is changed. On the other hand, test methods are only applicable for a single volume setting. Tests shall be conducted with volume control set to maximum at the UE.\nNOTE:\tFor sake of simplicity and clarity, this single volume setting is regarded as \"nominal volume\" in the test descriptions of the following clauses.\nSince it is expected that the signal level at the electrical interface UE is independent of the type of equipment connected (e.g., monaural, or binaural headset), test methods related to binaural listening generally do not apply.\n",

The measured part of the signal for analysis are integer multiple of 85.333 ms and shall be at least 170.667 ms (which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.\nIt is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during measurement. An appropriate speech or speech-like activation signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 [22] or P.50 [10]. A recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement is defined in figure 16. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation signal is recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level. In practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation signal, as specified by the manufacturer.\nThe ratio of the signal to total distortion power of the signal output of the SS shall be measured with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITU-T Recommendations G.712 [21], O.41 [23] and O.132 [27]). The psophometric filter shall be normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T Recommendation O.41 [23]. The weighting function shall be applied to the total distortion component only (not to the signal component).\n\nFor measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band-stop filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at 0.7071 * fS, and an upper passband starting at 1,4142 * fS, where fS is the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall be ≤ 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band-stop filter at the sine-wave frequency shall be ≥ 60 dB. Alternatively, the described characteristics can be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from an FFT (transformation length 4096, 75% overlap, Hann window). The total distortion component is defined as the measured signal within the frequency range 200 Hz to 4 kHz, after applying psophometric and stop filters (hence no correction for the lost power due to the stop filter, known as \"bandwidth correction\", shall be applied).\nTo improve repeatability, considering the variability introduced by speech coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation signal followed by the test signal) may be contiguously repeated one or more times. The single signal-to-total-distortion power ratios obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The total result shall be 10 * log10 of this average in dB.\nThe figure depicts a recommended activation sequence and test signal for a 5G network, illustrating the various steps involved in the network's operation. The sequence includes the initial activation of the network, the testing of the signal quality, and the final activation of the network. The test signal is shown to be a 20 MHz signal with a 100 dB SNR, demonstrating the network's ability to handle different signal conditions.\nFigure 16: Recommended activation sequence and test signal.\nThe activation signal consists of a \"Bandlimited composite source signal with speech-like power density spectrum\" signal according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] with 48,62 ms voiced part (1), 200 ms unvoiced part (2) and 101,38 ms pause (3), followed by the same signal but polarity inverted (4, 5, 6), followed by the voiced part only (7). The pure test tone is applied and after 50 ms settling time (8), the analysis is made over the following 170,667 ms (9).\nNOTE 1:\tVoid.\nNOTE 2:\tIn order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed, the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the measurement.\nNOTE 3:\tFor hands-free terminals tested in environments defined in subclause 6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable degree, referring to subclause 5.3.\n",

The measurement is corrected by subtracting the system simulator delay TSS to obtain the TS + TR delay.\n5.\tThe delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation envelope is used for the determination.\n\nFor MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of the UE delay with up to 20ms in the respective sending and receiving direction may be expected due to the synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frame on the UE antenna. This synchronization is attributed to the UE delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points. Hence, the UE delay shall be reported as the maximum value from at least 5 separate calls each with a different loopback delay TSS in at least 5 steps of 4ms in the full range from 0 to 16ms. All values shall be reported in the test report.\n",

For better consistency, calls from the UE are used.\nThe test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of 160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in the packet impairment condition.\nConstant delay Tc corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e. the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test phase.\nIn receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and reference point (RP), TTEAP-RP(t) = TR-jitter(t) + TTER, is measured in two successive phases:\n1)\tFirst the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-RP-constant is measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 7.10.2 /7.10.2a/7.10.2b, using the third CSS signal. The constant delay Tc is subtracted from TTEAP-RP-constant to obtain TR-constant.\n2)\tThen the delay with packet impairment TR-jitter(t) is measured continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.\nThe reference point is defined as follows:\n-\tfor handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.\n-\tfor electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the electrical reference interface.\nPacket impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet impairment condition.\nThe start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the reference client.\nNOTE 2: RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss in LTE transmission scenarios are specified in Annex E. These LTE jitter/loss profiles are reused also for tests with WLAN and NR access. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.\nFor the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.\nFor the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2 female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in sequence may be used.\nFor the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value per sentence.\nThe UE delay in the receive direction, TR-jitter(t), is obtained by subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as specified for the respective profile in Annex E) from the first electrical event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, TTER, from the measured TTEAP-DRP(t).\nThe difference DT between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5 individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay TR-constant measured for the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,DT) shall be added to the obtained delay for the speech signal TR-jitter(t).\nFor stationary packet delay variation test conditions (test condition 1 and 2), the first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the jitter buffer management and are discarded from the analysis. The CCVA-adjusted UE delay (TR-CCVA(t) = TR-jitter(t) + CCVA) in the receiving direction shall be reported as the maximum value excluding the two largest values of the remaining sequence of the 38 sentence delay values, i.e. the 95-percentile value of TR-CCVA(t). The TR-CCVA values for all 40 sentences shall be reported in the test report.\nNOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to 20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points The effect of this possible call-to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,DT) value.\n\nFor the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival time variations and packet loss, the test signal described in clause 7.10.4.2 shall be used. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Two 48 kHz recordings are used to produce the speech quality loss metric:\n-\tA recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test signal described in clause 7.10.4.2 (reference condition)\n-\tA recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time variations and packet loss as described in clause 7.10.4.2 (test condition)\nThe speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. For narrowband speech, the method according to Appendix III of P.863 [44] shall be used. Level pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used – see P.863.1 clause 10.2 [45].\nNOTE: \tFor the analysis of acoustical measurements, ITU-T P.863 [44] assumes diffuse-field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are diffuse-field corrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical interface UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied.\nA score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair and averaged to produce a mean MOS-LQO value for the reference and test conditions.\nMOS-LQOREFMOS-LQOREF is a test designed to evaluate the performance of a specific telecommunication system, specifically focusing on the MOS-LQO reference design. The test involves the use of a reference design that includes various components such as the MOS-LQO reference processor, LQO reference module, and reference test equipment. The test aims to assess the system's ability to meet specified performance requirements, such as data rate, latency, and power consumption. The MOS-LQO reference design is a crucial component in the development of advanced telecommunication systems, as it provides a standardized platform for testing and evaluating various components and technologies.\nMOS-LQOTESTMOS-LQOTEST is a speech quality test that evaluates the speech quality requirement for stationary packet delay variations in a test condition. The test is designed to assess the performance of the speech recognition system under non-stationary packet delay variations.\nNOTE: This evaluation of the speech quality requirement is only applicable to test conditions with a stationary statistic of the packet delay variation. Evaluation of the speech quality for a test condition with non-stationary packet delay variations is for further study.\nThe synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.\n",

For better consistency, calls from the UE are used.\nThe test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of 160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in the packet impairment condition.\nConstant delay Tc corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e. the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test phase.\nIn receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the reference point (RP), TTEAP-RP(t) = TR-jitter(t) + TTER, is measured in two successive phases:\n1)\tFirst the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-DRP-constant is measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 7.10.2/7.10.2a/7.10.2b, using the third CSS signal. The constant delay Tc is subtracted from TTEAP-RP to obtain TR-constant.\n2)\tThen the delay with packet impairment TR-jitter(t) is measured continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.\nThe reference point is defined as follows:\n-\tfor handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.\n-\tfor electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the electrical reference interface.\nPacket impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet impairment condition.\nThe start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the reference client.\nNOTE 2: RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss are specified in Annex F. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.\nFor the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.\nFor the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2 female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in sequence may be used.\nFor the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value per sentence.\nThe UE delay in the receive direction, TR-jitter(t), is obtained by subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as specified for the respective profile in Annex F) from the first electrical event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, TTER, from the measured TTEAP-DRP(t).\nThe difference DT between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5 individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay TR-constant measured for the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,DT) shall be added to the obtained delay for the speech signal TR-jitter(t).\nThe UE delay in the receiving direction shall be reported in the form of an histogram covering the range of measured CCVA-adjusted values (TR-CCVA(t) = TR-jitter(t) + CCVA) with a step of 20 ms. The following pseudo code provides an example implementation for the histogram:\nlo=min(floor(TR-CCVA(t=1...40)/20)*20)\nhi=max(ceil(TR-CCVA(t=1...40)/20)*20)\n[n,x]=hist(TR-CCVA(t=1...40),lo:20:hi)\nbar(x,n)\nThe TR-CCVA values for all 40 sentences shall also be reported in the test report.\nNOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to 20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points.  The effect of this possible call-to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,DT) value.\n\n",

The measured part of the signal for analysis are integer multiple of 85.333 ms and shall be at least 170,667 ms (which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.\nIt is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during measurement (see Note 1.).

The electrical interface UE is setup as described in clause 5.1.6.\nThe test signal used is a sine-wave signal with frequencies 315, 408, 510, 816 and 1020 Hz . The signal level shall be -16 dBm0, except for the sine-wave signal with a frequency 1020 Hz that shall be applied at the signal input of the SS at the following levels: 0, -3, -10, -16, -20, -30, -40, -45 dBm0. The test signals have to be applied in this sequence, i.e., from high levels down to low levels.\nThe duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 s. The measured part of the signal shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.\nIt is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 [22] or P.50 [10]. A recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement is defined in figure 19. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation signal is recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level for low and medium test levels. To avoid saturation of the SS speech encoder, it is recommended for high test levels that the activation signal level is adjusted so that its peak level equals the peak level of the test tone.

The filter shall have a lower passband ending at 0,7071 * fS, and an upper passband starting at 1,4142 * fS, where fS is the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall be ≤ 0,2 dB. The attenuation of the band stop filter at the sine-wave frequency shall be ≥ 60 dB.

                            "text_content": "The UE delay in the sending direction, TS, shall be measured in jitter and error free conditions according to clause 8.10.0.\nFor this test it shall be ensured that the call is originated from the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tDifferences have been observed between UE-originated calls and UE-terminated calls. For better consistency, calls from the UE are used.\nThe test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of 160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in the packet impairment condition.\nConstant delay Tc corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e. the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test phase.\nIn receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the reference point (RP), TTEAP-RP(t) = TR-jitter(t) + TTER, is measured in two successive phases:\n1)\tFirst the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-DRP-constant is measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 8.10.2/8.10.2a/8.10.2b, using the third CSS signal. The constant delay Tc is subtracted from TTEAP-RP to obtain TR-constant.\n2)\tThen the delay with packet impairment TR-jitter(t) is measured continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.\nThe reference point is defined as follows:\n-\tfor handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.\n-\tfor electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the electrical reference interface.\nPacket impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet impairment condition.\nThe start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the reference client.\nNOTE 2: \t RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss in LTE transmission scenarios are specified in Annex E. These LTE jitter/loss profiles are reused also for tests with WLAN and NR access. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.\nFor the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.\nFor the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2 female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in sequence may be used.\nFor the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value per sentence.\nThe UE delay in the receive direction, TR-jitter(t), is obtained by subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as specified for the respective profile in Annex E) from the first electrical event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, TTER, from the measured TTEAP-DRP(t).\nThe difference DT between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5 individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay TR-constant measured for the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,DT) shall be added to the obtained delay for the speech signal TR-jitter(t).\nFor stationary packet delay variation test conditions (test condition 1 and 2), the first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the jitter buffer management and are discarded from the analysis. The CCVA-adjusted UE delay (TR-CCVA(t) = TR-jitter(t) + CCVA) in the receiving direction shall be reported as the maximum value excluding the two largest values of the remaining sequence of the 38 sentence delay values, i.e. the 95-percentile value of TR-CCVA(t). The TR-CCVA values for all 40 sentences shall be reported in the test report.\nNOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to 20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points The effect of this possible call-to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,DT) value.\nFor the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival time variations and packet loss, the test signal described in clause 8.10.4.2 shall be used. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Two 48 kHz recordings are used to produce the speech quality loss metric:\n-\tA recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test signal described in clause 8.10.4.2 (reference condition)\n-\tA recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time variations and packet loss as described in clause 8.10.4.2 (test condition)\nThe speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. Level pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used – see P.863.1 clause 10.2 [45].\nNOTE: \tfor the analysis of acoustical measurements, P.863 [44] assumes diffuse-field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are diffuse-fieldcorrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical interface UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied.\nA score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair and averaged to produce a mean MOS-LQO value for the reference and test conditions.\nMOS-LQOREFMOS-LQOREF is a test designed to evaluate the performance of a specific telecommunication system, specifically focusing on the MOS-LQO reference design. The test involves the use of a reference design that includes various components such as the MOS-LQO reference processor, LQO reference module, and reference test equipment. The test aims to assess the system's ability to meet specified performance requirements, such as data rate, latency, and power consumption. The MOS-LQO reference design is a crucial component in the development of advanced telecommunication systems, as it provides a standardized platform for testing and evaluating various components and technologies.\nMOS-LQOTEST MOS-LQOTEST is a speech quality test that evaluates the speech quality requirement for stationary packet delay variations in a test condition. The test is designed to assess the performance of the speech recognition system under non-stationary packet delay variations.\nNOTE: This evaluation of the speech quality requirement is only applicable to test conditions with a stationary statistic of the packet delay variation. Evaluation of the speech quality for a test condition with non-stationary packet delay variations is for further study.\nThe synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.\n",

For better consistency, calls from the UE are used.\nThe test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of 160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in the packet impairment condition.\nConstant delay Tc corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e. the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test phase.\nIn receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the reference point (RP), TTEAP-RP(t) = TR-jitter(t) + TTER, is measured in two successive phases:\n1)\tFirst the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-DRP-constant is measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 8.10.2, 8.10.2a/8.10.2b using the third CSS signal. The constant delay Tc is subtracted from TTEAP-RP to obtain TR-constant.\n2)\tThen the delay with packet impairment TR-jitter(t) is measured continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.\nThe reference point is defined as follows:\n1)\tfor handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.\n2)\tfor electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the electrical reference interface.\nPacket impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet impairment condition.\nThe start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the reference client.\nNOTE 2: \tRTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss are specified in Annex F. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.\nFor the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.\nFor the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2 female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in sequence may be used.\nFor the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value per sentence.\nThe UE delay in the receive direction, TR-jitter(t), is obtained by subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as specified for the respective profile in Annex F) from the first electrical event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, TTER, from the measured TTEAP-DRP(t).\nThe difference DT between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5 individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay TR-constant measured for the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,DT) shall be added to the obtained delay for the speech signal TR-jitter(t).\nThe UE delay in the receiving direction shall be reported in the form of an histogram covering the range of measured CCVA-adjusted values (TR-CCVA(t) = TR-jitter(t) + CCVA) with a step of 20 ms. The following pseudo code provides an example implementation for the histogram:\nlo=min(floor(TR-CCVA(t=1...40)/20)*20)\nhi=max(ceil(TR-CCVA(t=1...40)/20)*20)\n[n,x]=hist(TR-CCVA(t=1...40),lo:20:hi)\nbar(x,n)\nThe TR-CCVA values for all 40 sentences shall also be reported in the test report.\nNOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to 20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points.  The effect of this possible call-to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,DT) value.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "The test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.4.1).\nFor this test it shall be ensured that the call is originated from the UE.\nNOTE 1: Differences have been observed between UE originated call and UE-terminated call. For better consistency calls from the UE are used.\nThe test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of 160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in the packet impairment condition.\nConstant delay Tc corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e. the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test phase.\nIn receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the reference point (RP), TTEAP-RP(t) = TR-jitter(t) + TTER, is measured in two successive phases:\n1\tFirst the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-RP-constant is measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 9.10.2/ 9.10.2a/9.10.2b, using the third CSS signal. The constant delay Tc is subtracted from TTEAP-DRP to obtain TR-constant.\n2\tThen the delay with packet impairment TR-jitter(t) is measured continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.\nThe reference point is defined as follows:\n-\tfor handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.\n-\tfor electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the electrical reference interface.\nPacket impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet impairment condition.\nThe start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the reference client.\nNOTE 2: \tRTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss in LTE transmission scenarios are specified in Annex E. These LTE jitter/loss profiles are reused also for tests with WLAN and NR access. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.\nFor the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.\nFor the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2 female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in sequence may be used.\nFor the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value per sentence.\nThe UE delay in the receive direction, TR-jitter(t), is obtained by subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as specified for the respective profile in Annex E) from the first electrical event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, TTER, from the measured TTEAP-DRP(t).\nThe difference DT between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5 individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay TR-constant measured for the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,DT) shall be added to the obtained delay for the speech signal TR-jitter(t).\nFor stationary packet delay variation test conditions (test condition 1 and 2), the first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the jitter buffer management and are discarded from the analysis. The CCVA-adjusted UE delay (TR-CCVA(t) = TR-jitter(t) + CCVA) in the receiving direction shall be reported as the maximum value excluding the two largest values of the remaining sequence of the 38 sentence delay values, i.e. the 95-percentile value of TR-CCVA(t). The TR-CCVA values for all 40 sentences shall be reported in the test report.\nNOTE 3: \tThe synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to 20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points The effect of this possible call-to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,DT) value.\nThe test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.4.3, observing the test signal properties for super-wideband described in clause 5.4).\n",

For better consistency, calls from UE are used.\nThe test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of 160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in the packet impairment condition.\nConstant delay Tc corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e. the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unnecessary delay jumps between the two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test phase. In receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the reference point (RP), TTEAP-RP(t) = TR-jitter(t) + TTER, is measured in two successive phases:\n1)\tFirst the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-DRP-constant is measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 9.10.2/9.10.2a/9.10.2b, using the third CSS signal. The constant delay Tc is subtracted from TTEAP-RP to obtain TR-constant.\n2)\tThen the delay with packet impairment TR-jitter(t) is measured continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.\nThe reference point is defined as follows:\n- for handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.\n- for electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the electrical reference interface.\nPacket impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet impairment condition.\nThe start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the reference client.\nNOTE 2: \tRTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss are specified in Annex F. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.\nFor the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.\nFor the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2 female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all sentences are centred within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in sequence may be used.\nFor the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value per sentence.\nThe UE delay in the receive direction, TR-jitter(t), is obtained by subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as specified for the respective profile in Annex F) from the first electrical event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, TTER, from the measured TTEAP-DRP(t).\nThe difference DT between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5 individual calls (see clause 9.10.2) and the delay TR-constant measured for the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,DT) shall be added to the obtained delay for the speech signal TR-jitter(t).\nThe UE delay in the receiving direction shall be reported in the form of an histogram covering the range of measured CCVA-adjusted values (TR-CCVA(t) = TR-jitter(t) + CCVA) with a step of 20 ms. The following pseudo code provides an example implementation for the histogram:\nlo=min(floor(TR-CCVA(t=1...40)/20)*20)\nhi=max(ceil(TR-CCVA(t=1...40)/20)*20)\n[n,x]=hist(TR-CCVA(t=1...40),lo:20:hi)\nbar(x,n)\nThe TR-CCVA values for all 40 sentences shall also be reported in the test report.\nNOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to 20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the definition of the UE delay reference points.  The effect of this possible call-to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,DT) value.\n\n",

The training sequence level shall be -16 dBm0 in order to not overload the codec.\nThe test signal is a PN-sequence complying with ITU-T Recommendation P.501 with a length of 4 096 points (for a 48 kHz sampling rate system) and a crest factor of 6 dB instead of 11 dB. The PN-sequence is generated as described in P.501 with W(k) constant within the frequency range 100-20000 Hz and zero outside this range. The duration of the test signal is 250 ms. With an input signal of -3 dBm0, the attenuation from input to output of the system simulator shall be measured under the following conditions:\na)\tThe handset or the headset, with the transmission circuit fully active, shall be positioned on a hard plane surface with at least 400 mm free space in all directions.

The setup includes a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, which are essential for understanding the signal path and mitigating interference. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to improve signal quality and reduce interference.\nFigure C1: Measurement setup\nThe measurement setup consists of an IP reference gateway with USB access connected to an IP logger or a test system with integrated IP-logger, an arbitrary LTE mobile phone and the LTE radio network simulator under test. The LTE radio network simulator has to be equipped with an IP logger (either preinstalled or installed for the test setup). The mobile phone acts as modem and is connected to the reference gateway via USB (tethering mode). The mobile phone is further connected over the air interface to the LTE cell of the radio network simulator equipped with a LTE-compliant antenna. Within the radio network simulator, a loopback mode is used to mirror the incoming packets back via the modem to IP reference gateway.\nAn Ethernet connection via cable is established temporally in parallel between the IP reference gateway and the radio network simulator. This connection is used for synchronization tasks. On both devices, on the IP reference gateway and on the radio tester, in- and outgoing packets are logged via IP logging program.\n",

It must be ensured that this ping event is logged on the reference gateway as well as on the IP logger of the radio tester. The ping event is used to compensate clock offsets between the IP loggers at the end of the procedure. The ping roundtrip delay has to be noted. The roundtrip delay indicates the amount of delay to be added to the monitored RTP packets time stamps in send and receive, assuming that it can be symmetrically allocated to both directions.\n-\tNow the cable-based Ethernet connection is disconnected and the USB tethering connection to the mobile phone is established.\n\nStep 2)\tMeasurement of the Loopback RTP Delay:\n-\tIP logging is still active on the radio tester.\n-\tThe tethering device connected to the reference gateway is activated and routing is selected over the tethering device.\n-\tThe loopback mode is activated at the radio tester.\n-\tAn audio call is established from the reference gateway using AMR-NB, AMR-WB or EVS-SWB encoded RTP packets.\n-\tThe call is stopped after an appropriate amount of averaging time; IP logging is stopped.\n-\tA possible clock offset between the two IP loggers can be corrected by synchronizing the logfiles based on the previously documented ping events to a common time base.\n-\tThe data collected by the two IP loggers are merged into a common table.\n-\tDelays now can be calculated for each packet in sending and the receiving direction separately.\n\nStep 3: Measuring the tethering delay:\n-\tThe device-dependant tethering delay of the modem needs to be determined separately in the following.\n-\tAn IMS-APN is created on the modem device and used for the measurement. QCI 5 (IMS signalling) and QCI 1 (voice data) should be established.\n-\tA ping command is sent from the reference gateway to the IP address of the DHCP server of the tethering device. Half of the resulting round trip delay is used to estimate the tethering delay, again assuming a symmetrically distributed delay. It is assumed that voice data will be delayed in the same way, since the phone utilizes an IMS-APN. The connection should be verified by checking the entries in the system simulator, which should report that channels for QCI=5 (IMS signalling) and QCI=1 (voice data) were established.\n\nStep 4) Correction of the measured results:\n-\tHalf of the ping roundtrip delay is added to send and receive direction.\n-\tHalf of the tethering delay is subtracted from send and receive direction.\nThis Annex describes a method to measure the clock skew between the reference client and the device under test.\n",

When measuring in receiving direction the signal is pre-filtered according to the used bandwith and normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0. When measuring in sending direction the signal is calibrated to an active speech level of -4.7 dBPa at MRP. For electrical interface UE, the active speech level is calibrated to -60 dBV for analogue and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections.. The sequence is centered within a 4.0s time window and repeated 40 times, resulting in a test file of 160.0s length. Alternatively CSS signals may be used with the corresponding adaptation of the step size to 333ms. The test signal used shall be reported.\nNOTE–\tCare should be taken to apply the test procedure to the receive direction, since the measurement could lead to biased results due to jitter buffer adaptation of the DUT during the test.\nThe clock skew is determined as follows:\n-\tThe variable delay per time step is calculated as the time shift of the maximum of the cross correlation between measured and source signal for each time step.\n-\tThe step size of the calculation of the variable delay is 4.0s for the above test signal, which corresponds to one single sentence of the source signal.\n-\tThis analysis provides the output signal Y(tn) consisting of one single delay value for each time step, i.e., for each sentence of the above source signal.\n-\tA median filter of length 3 is applied to the delay vs. time series Y(tn) yielding the time series Ŷ(tn). This smoothes small spikes without soften the delay jumps.\n-\tDelay jumps due to jitter buffer over- or underrun are detected as the time steps where the absolute delay difference abs(Ŷ(tn+1) - Ŷ(tn)) is larger than a threshold ΔYmax, which is appropriate to detect a maximum clock skew of 500 PPM.\n-\tA \"continuous\" delay vs. time series is generated where the delay jumps are eliminated, e.g., by cutting out the delay jumps and \"stitching\" together the jump-free segments.\n-\tThe clock skew is estimated as the regression coefficient β of the \"continuous\" delay vs. time series in parts per million (PPM):\n\nIn case of clock skews higher than 50 PPM the accuracy of the cross-correlation calculation decreases. In such event it is recommended to take a two-step approach. In the first step a coarse skew compensation is performed and the clock of the reference client is adjusted to the PPM derived in the first step. A fine compensation is performed in the second step by applying the same procedure. The final clock skew in PPM is the sum of both clock skews.\n",

The profiles are based on the assumption that one IP packet corresponds to 20ms of the speech sequence. In order to preserve the synchronization of the elements in the profile and the timing of the speech sequence (e.g. the RTP time stamp) when the speech codec does not produce one packet every 20ms, e.g. during speech codec DTX operation, the profiles needs to be sub-sampled in accordance with the rate of production of the packets containg the speech frames.\nThe variation in the packet arrival time and the loss rate of the speech packets experienced by the receiving UE in an LTE connection will vary depending on several parameters and operating conditions of the LTE network. Standardized characteristics with respect to Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Packet Error Loss Rate (PELR) for different QoS Class Identifiers (QCI) for an LTE access network are defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [42]:\n-\tThe PDB of a QCI defines an upper bound for the time that a packet may be delayed between the UE and the PCEF.

Thus, the PELR defines an upper bound for a rate of non congestion related packet losses. The purpose of the PELR is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in E-UTRAN). For a certain QCI the value of the PELR is the same in uplink and downlink.\n\nThe stipulated PDB and PELR as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 for QCI1 intended for Conversational Voice services results in that on each link 99 percent of the packets will be successfully delivered over an LTE air interface with a maximum delay of less than 80ms with a confidence level of 98 percent.\n",

As discussed in Section E.1, several LTE network parameters have a significant impact on the packet delay variations experienced by the UE. This model includes the effect of the DRX cycle, the BLER on the MAC/PHY layer, the HARQ re-transmission and RMC scheduler [46]. In addition, jitter in the EPC and the effect of the mis-alignment of the DRX-cycle between the uplink and downlink eNBs are included.\nThe model is described in Table E.1 and operates on the following input parameters\n-\tUplink and downlink block error rate (BLER), respectively.\n-\tMaximum number of HARQ re-transmissions on uplink and dowblink, respectively.\n-\tDRX cycle length.\n-\tTime differnce between the uplink and the downlink eNB DRX cycle.\n-\tMaximum and minimum network delay between the uplink and the downlink eNB.\nThe random number generator used in the model produces pseudorandom values drawn from the standard uniform distribution on the open interval (0, 1).\nThe model generates packet delay and loss profiles for two different test system configurations of the UE delay:\n-\tWhen the system simulator is transparent in the downlink at the MAC/PHY layer and does not operate in DRX. This approach requires the variations of the delay due to downlink HARQ re-transmissions and mapping to the DRX cycle to be simulated. In this case, the model simulates the delay and jitter profiles for the packets from the antenna of the sending UE to the antenna receiving UE (end-to-end simulation). This is the testing condition used in 3GPP TS 26.132.\n-\tWhen the system simulator is configured for error insertion in the downlink at the MAC/PHY layer and DRX operation, and the system simulator implements the HARQ re-transmissions and the mapping of the packets to the DRX cycle time at the downlink. In this case, the model simulates the delay and loss profiles from the sending UE up to the receiving eNB. This testing condition is currently not used in 3GPP TS 26.132.\nIt should be noted that the model does not fully utilize the PDB for QCI1 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 and does not include temporary variations of the packet arrival time variation and the loss rate that may be experienced during e.g. hand-over or congestion. Hence, the packet delay and loss profiles generated by the model do not fully exercise the conditions that the jitter buffer management of the UE may be exposed to in LTE systems and the profiles generated by the model are only intended for the testing of the UE delay in stationary operating conditions.\nTable E.1: Simulation model for generating packet delay and loss profiles for MTSI-based speech with LTE access\n\n",

In order to preserve the synchronization of the elements in the profile and the timing of the speech sequence (e.g. the RTP time stamp) when the speech codec does not produce one packet every 20ms, e.g. during speech codec DTX operation, the profiles needs to be sub-sampled in accordance with the rate of production of the packets containg the speech frames.\n",

These types of headsets are often equipped with higher signal processing capabilities and the electrical interface UE should then deactivate its noise reduction and echo cancellation functions to avoid possible tandem signal processing.\n\nThe tests described in the following clauses apply only for the electrical interface UE of type Bluetooth. Their intention is to detect the absence/presence of certain signal processing functionalities in the electrical interface UE that are intended to be deactivated in case certain flags and commands are signalled by the reference interface.\n\nFor Bluetooth connections, certain commands and flags are available in the communication protocol stack of the hands-free profile. When a connection between electrical interface UE and reference interface (see clause 5.1.6.2) is established, the following two commands according to [57] shall be configured accordingly by the reference interface:\n\n1)\tAT+BRSF (Bluetooth Retrieve Supported Features): this command may be used from the UE to discover signal processing capabilities of the connected headset or reference interface. The answer to this request shall set bit 0 to 1, which indicates that the connected reference interface provides signal processing capabilities.\n2)\tAT+NREC=0 (Noise Reduction and Echo Canceling): this command shall be executed from the reference interface to the electrical interface UE. According to the Bluetooth specification [57], it is expected that the electrical interface UE disables its own signal processing\n",
