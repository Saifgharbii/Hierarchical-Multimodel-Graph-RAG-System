However, due to technical and economic factors, there cannot be full compliance with the general characteristics of international telephone connections and circuits recommended by the ITU-T.\nThe performance requirements are specified in the main body of the text; the test methods and considerations are described in TS 26.132.\n",

The present document specifies minimum performance requirements for the electro-acoustic characteristics of 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals when used to provide narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband telephony.\nThe set of minimum performance requirements enables a guaranteed level of speech quality while taking possible physical limits of the terminal design into account. Some performance objectives are also defined, if such design limits can be overcome. Care must be taken in applying performance objectives in isolation, not to degrade overall end-user speech quality.\n",

The overload point is defined at 3,14 dBm0 for AMR, AMR-WB and EVS speech codecs.\nA 3GPP softphone is a telephony system running on a general purpose computer or PDA complying with the 3GPP terminal acoustic requirements (TS 26.131 and 26.132).\nFor the purposes of the present document the term clock skew is defined as the difference between the clock of the device under test (CDUT) and the clock of the reference client (CREF). The skew of CDUT relative to CREF is defined in parts per million (PPM) as: (CDUT -CREF).106/ CREF.\nFor the purposes of the present document, the term electrical interface is defined as an analogue or digital access to a UE, which allows injecting and capturing signals electrically instead of through an acoustical interface. The interface can be either analogue (wired) or digital (wired or wireless). The purpose of this interface is to connect a separate device (typically a headset), which provides a receiver and transmitter for telephony.\n",

The limits given below are consistent with the national extension limits and long term objectives in ITU-T Recommendation G.121 [5].\nThe SLR and RLR values for the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network apply up to the POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics of the UE, including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and digital to analogue conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to specify loudness ratings to the Air Interface. For the normal case, where the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network introduces no additional loss between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to the PSTN boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at the Air Interface.

The air-conducted path was not intended to be included in the test setup. A lower STMR limit was specified to avoid annoying effects (e.g. howling, increase of ambient noise level in the ear) of an excessive electrical sidetone. In HATS-based measurements, the air-conducted path cannot be avoided in the test setup. With some UE form factors the air-conducted path can be substantial resulting in low STMR figures also when there are no annoying effects from any excessive electrical sidetone.

Prior to Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.\nConsidering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the previous reference points took into account a UE implementation independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP, instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS requirements with these new reference points remain the same.\nThe UE delays in the send and receive directions are defined for electrical interfaces as:\n-\tThe UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the first electrical event at the input of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) to the last bit of the corresponding speech frame at the UE antenna\n-\tThe UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first electrical event at the output of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) corresponding to that speech frame.\n",

The limits given below are consistent with the national extension limits and long term objectives in ITU-T Recommendation G.121 [5].\nThe SLR and RLR values for the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network apply up to the POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics of the UE, including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and digital to analogue conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to specify loudness ratings to the Air Interface. For the normal case, where the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network introduces no additional loss between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to the PSTN boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at the Air Interface. However, in some cases loss adjustment may be needed for interworking situations in individual countries.\n",

Prior to Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.\nConsidering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the previous reference points took into account a UE implementation independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP, instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS requirements with these new reference points remain the same.\nThe UE delays in the send and receive directions are defined for electrical interfaces as:\n-\tThe UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the first electrical event at the input of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) to the last bit of the corresponding speech frame at the UE antenna\n-\tThe UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first electrical event at the output of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) corresponding to that speech frame.\n",

The limits given below are consistent with the national extension limits and long term objectives in ITU-T Recommendation G.121 [5].\nThe SLR and RLR values for the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network apply up to the POI.

In practice, it is convenient to specify loudness ratings to the Air Interface. For the normal case, where the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network introduces no additional loss between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to the PSTN boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at the Air Interface.

Prior to Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.\nConsidering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the previous reference points took into account a UE implementation independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP, instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS requirements with these new reference points remain the same.\nThe UE delays in the send and receive directions are defined for electrical interfaces as:\n-\tThe UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the first electrical event at the input of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) to the last bit of the corresponding speech frame at the UE antenna\n-\tThe UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first electrical event at the output of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) corresponding to that speech frame.\n\n",

Prior to Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.\nConsidering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the previous reference points took into account a UE implementation independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP, instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS requirements with these new reference points remain the same.\nThe UE delays in the send and receive directions are defined for electrical interfaces as:\n-\tThe UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the first electrical event at the input of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) to the last bit of the corresponding speech frame at the UE antenna\n-\tThe UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first electrical event at the output of the electrical interface (analogue or wired digital connection) or first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna of the wireless digital interface (wireless digital connection) corresponding to that speech frame.\n\n",
