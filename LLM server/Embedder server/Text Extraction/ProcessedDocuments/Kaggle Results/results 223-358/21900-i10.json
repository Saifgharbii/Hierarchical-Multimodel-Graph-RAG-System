Details of the role of the rapporteur are described in clause 4.1.2.\nThe rules for drafting specifications, and the software tools to be used are listed in 3GPP TR 21.801 [1].\nVersions 0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.3.0 etc. should be presented to the responsible Group. Versions 0.i.1, 0.i.2 etc. may be internal to the drafting group.\nFurther drafts may be produced, with appropriate increments in the \"technical\" / \"editorial\" fields of the version number. Every new draft with an incremented \"technical\" version field shall be presented to the responsible Group. Although two or more Groups may have an interest in contributing to the development of a specification, ultimate responsibility vests in a single (responsible) Group. The responsible Group shall ensure that all other Groups which might have an interest are given the opportunity to participate in the drafting. The objectives intended to be provided or decided by a working group with secondary responsibility shall be made clear in a corresponding Work Item Description document, identifying additional rapporteurs from such secondary group(s) if necessary.\nThe Support Team is responsible for allocating specification numbers. As soon as title, scope and some other information on the specification is stable, the Support Team shall assign a specification number according to the provisions of clause 4.0 and shall enter the specification into the Status List of Specifications (see clause 7). The TSG Sub-Group responsible for the specification shall inform its parent TSG that such a new specification is under construction.\nWhen a specification is sufficiently stable (see table 3), it shall be converted to version 1.0.0 (with no technical changes with respect to the previous version 0.y.z) by the Support Team, and presented to the TSG for information. Further drafts bearing version numbers 1.y.z may be produced until the specification is sufficiently stable to be approved by the TSG. At this stage, and until formal approval by the TSG, the specification is, unless it belongs directly to a TSG, under the control of the responsible TSG Sub-Group. The modalities governing the introduction of changes shall be decided on a case by case basis by the WG concerned.\nOnce the responsible Group considers that the draft is sufficiently stable (see table 3) that it is desirable to place it under change control, the latest version 1.y.z shall be converted to version 2.0.0 (with no technical changes with respect to the previous version 1.y.z) by the Support Team and presented for approval at the TSG.\nIf the TSG does not approve the draft, further drafts version 2.y.z may be produced by the responsible Group.\nIf the TSG does approve the draft, the approved version (with no technical changes) shall be converted to version x.0.0 where \"x\" corresponds to the Release identity given in table 4.\nNOTE:\tIt is thus quite normal that a 3GPP specification approved for, say, Release 4, jumps directly from version 2.0.0 to version 4.0.0; there is no Release 1999 document, therefore no version 3.y.z.\nThe specification shall now be under TSG change control. Further changes shall be made by means of formal Change Requests, to be approved by the TSG. On approval of a CR, the middle number shall be incremented and the right-most number reset to 0 (e.g., from 7.2.1 to 7.3.0).\n",

Any technical change which may be identified for inclusion in the specification from this point on shall be accomplished by means of a Change Request (CR).\nA CR may be raised by any individual member and brought to the attention of the responsible Group.\nA Change Request shall relate to a specific version of a specification. A unique (for that specification) reference number shall be allocated to the CR by the 3GPP portal or the Support Team. CR details shall be entered into a CR database maintained by the Support Team and made available on the 3GPP file server. CR numbers shall not be re-used, even if a CR is ultimately rejected by the TSG (see note). A CR may undergo one or more revisions before a final decision is made on it. The database shall show all revisions of each CR.\nNOTE:\tThe CR status \"rejected\", and indeed this status for any other TDoc type has become unacceptable in some groups, and is replaced by \"not pursued\". Unless evident from the context, in the present document, any reference to the status \"rejected\" applies equally to status \"not pursued\".\nThe TSG WG Secretary shall collate all CRs agreed by the WG and shall send them to the parent TSG for approval. For specifications which are directly under the control of a TSG, the CR shall be brought directly to the attention of the TSG.\nFollowing approval at TSG level, the Support Team person responsible for the specification shall edit the original specification to incorporate the changes of all Change Requests approved by the TSG. The new version of the specification shall then be made available on the 3GPP file server.\nThe TSG should approve, reject or postpone a CR in its entirety (after revision, if necessary). That is, the modifications proposed by the CR should either be accepted without change, or unconditionally rejected. For ease of management, a single Change Request should therefore pertain to a single technical topic only. Each topic can thus be cleanly accepted or rejected by the TSG.\nWhere two or more CRs pertain to the same (version of a) specification, the responsible Group shall check for potential interaction amongst those CRs to ensure that, if all are approved by the TSG, each is implementable without contradicting any other.\nThe TSG Secretary shall record the TSG's decisions (see table 9.2-1) on each CR in the meeting report and those decisions shall be reflected in the CR database and on the 3GPP portal.\n",

This cover page has all the relevant metadata already filled in, thus eliminating transcription errors on the part of the author. It is strongly recommended that the author make use of this facility rather than filling in a blank CR cover from the stock template. Tips on how to complete the remaining fields of the CR form can be found at .\nFor reference, the CR database is available from the 3GPP file server (). Alternatively, the CRs for a given specification or from a given meeting can be consulted on the 3GU portal ().\nWhen a CR is presented for approval, the classification into which it falls shall be identified. If this cannot be done then the CR shall be automatically rejected.\nThe CR form bears a field to indicate the Release number to which the CR pertains. This field shall show the Release of the intended resulting specification – that is, the Release of the specification after implementation of the CR. The Release shown on the CR form is not related to the Release of the feature to which the change relates, but to the Release of the specification being changed.\n",

If a CR is not immediately accepted the originator shall update the CR taking into account comments and other guidelines from the relevant groups, including change of reference version if needed, and to re-present it to the Group.\nAll CRs shall be presented in electronic form.\nCR identification:\nDuring the course of its development, a CR may be modified, and the CR's progress shall be indicated by allocation of a revision number: rev. 1, 2, and so on. A given revision of a CR is uniquely defined by\n-\tthe specification to which it belongs, and\n-\tthe CR number (an alphanumeric string) and\n-\tthe revision number (default, i.e. the value if no number is given, is '-', i.e. the original, unrevised, CR).\nA CR number shall be allocated by the 3GPP portal or the Support Team. For a given Specification, CR numbers shall be unique and shall never be reused (see clause 4.6.1). Numbers used for rejected CRs shall not be reused. If a CR is rejected, and the responsible Group considers it useful to bring a modification of the CR to a subsequent TSG for approval, the new CR shall be allocated a new CR number. That is, it shall not be presented as a revision of the same CR number previously rejected.\nImpact on other specifications:\nIf the content of the CR is such that, in isolation, it makes the whole set of approved Specifications inconsistent, corresponding CRs shall also be considered and produced. This should be carried out by the originators of the CR (and their colleagues in other Groups) in advance. The Support Team is co-responsible for identifying and communicating cross-TSG and cross-TSG-WG impacts.\nIf a CR (or set of CRs) causes an inconsistency with an existing/approved test or O&M specification, the corresponding CRs should be presented together with the core specification CR in the same TSG cycle. Otherwise they may follow in a later TSG cycle.\nHandling of the CR in the TSG:\nWhen the TSG WG has agreed to a CR and comments from secondarily responsible Groups (if any) have been taken into account, the Support Team shall ensure that it is correctly formatted and assembled, and shall submit the CR to the primarily responsible TSG for formal approval.\nThe Support Team shall collate agreed CRs in CR packs.\nThe Support Team shall make available to the TSG summary lists of all CRs presented for decision. This list shall be updated to show the decision reached for each and every CR.\nDecisions on CRs, and results:\nThe TSG shall consider and conclude on each CR independently; the verdict on each CR shall be one of the values listed in clause 9.2\nTable 5: (void)\n\nControl and notification of CR decisions:\nAt the end of each TSG meeting, the Support Team shall issue lists containing the detailed result of the CRs presented at the meeting, including information about the consequential new version numbers of the concerned specifications. These lists shall form an annex to the meeting report (and hence are part of a permanent document). These lists, being the evidence of which specifications have changed and how, are important management tools for both TSG delegates and the Support Team since it takes some time before the new versions of the specifications can be compiled and released.\n",

                            "text_content": "It is important that the 3GPP release structure provides a sound basis for implementations and equipment interoperation. Key principles important to ensure this are:\n-\tA Release shall consist of a well-defined, stable and internally consistent set of functions.\n-\tA Release shall be documented in a maintained, consistent stream of specifications.\n-\tEssential corrections to a stable or frozen release shall be included in the applicable Release.\n-\tNew or changed functionality shall be included in a new (rather than retrospectively in an old) Release.\nThese principles will ensure successful interoperability (roaming) amongst different instantiations of 3GPP systems.\nEach release should be consistent and implementable to ensure interworking. This implies that essential corrections become normative parts of the Release as soon as possible. If essential changes to \"old\" functionality are made to a new release, similar corresponding changes shall be made to correct the same error in the specifications pertaining to all previous, non-closed, Releases. This is illustrated in figure A.\nNew functionality shall be included in the latest, non-frozen, Release. New functionality shall not be included in previous, frozen, Releases. To do so would cause incompatibility amongst instantiations of those Releases. This is illustrated in figure A.\n\nFigure A: Introduction and development of new features to the latest Release; and corrections to multiple Releases (example)\nGSM phase 2+ specifications were grouped into annual Releases from 1996 to 1999. The first 3rd generation specifications were grouped into an initial Release 1999.\nSubsequent Releases are not necessarily annual, and shall be referred to as Release 4, Release 5, etc., according to the major field of the version number (see table 4 and clause 4.3).\nDevelopment of the 3GPP system specifications shall be controlled by means of a work plan covering the inclusion of new features (functionality). Target dates for completion of Work Items (see clause 6) shall be estimated by the responsible Groups. Milestones may be defined to monitor the progress of Work Items. Based on the estimated completion of the desired features, a target date for freezing of the specifications pertaining to the next Release can – and shall – be calculated. Feature development should be based around approximately annual Releases.\nThus the work plan shall indicate (a) the estimated freeze date of forthcoming Releases and (b) the functional content of each such Release. The work plan shall show all projected work, regardless of Release; this will ease long term planning and the packaging of features into Releases. Completed Work Items shall be removed from the plan once the Release of which they form a part has been frozen.\n3GPP technical coordination should set target dates for the freezing of each individual stage (cf. clause 4.1) on all currently worked-upon Releases (i.e. non-frozen).. On freezing stage 2 of Release x, TSGs should propose a target freeze date for stages 1, 2 and 3 of Release x+1. It is possible that features of exceptional complexity may span more than one Release (eg new core network architecture, new radio interface).\nThe freezing date for a particular stage of a Release should insofar as is possible be adhered to, even if, due to delays, it is not possible to include all the features originally intended. Features which cannot be completed in time should be held over to the next Release. It will normally be the case that test specifications and O&M specifications will not necessarily be completed until some time after the base specifications; this shall not impede the freezing of the Release as a whole. However, if it becomes evident that, due to delays in a number of important features, a new Release would contain little new functionality, it may be preferable to delay the freezing of the stage of a Release to allow more of the originally intended features to be included.\nThe project plan shall clearly show the progress of each Work Item. When all component Work Items of a feature have been completed, the TSG shall declare the feature to be frozen. The only further development permitted from that point onwards shall be:\n-\tthe essential correction of errors;\n-\tthe completion of the test and O&M specifications; and\n-\tunavoidable adjustments required to cater for interworking with other features in the same Release.\nSee clause 6 for further information on Work Items.\n3GPP may identify certain features as being suitable for \"early implementation\". The selection of \"early implementation\" features shall be performed at the TSG level.\nAdditional documentation is provided for early implementation features (see clause 6.4.4).\nAll documentation for early implementation features is contained in the Release where the feature is introduced. The status or specification of older Releases shall not be changed by the introduction of early implementation features.\n",

The filename of the zipped file shall be the same as that of the contained source file, and it shall bear the file extension \".zip\".\nIf a specification consists of multiple source files - for example, when a very long document is divided into several smaller files for ease of editing and manipulation - , each file should be named with the above convention, but appending a file identifier in the form:\naabbb-xyz(m).eee\nwhere:\nm is the file number using characters from table 6 or 6A.\nWhere a specification has accompanying files - e.g. ASN.1 coding, C programming language code, TTCN test sequences, etc. - it may not be convenient or possible to abide by the last-mentioned rule. Under these circumstances, the associated files shall be contained in a separate zip file, which shall itself abide by the multiple-source-file rule. A \"readme\" text file should be included in that zip file to explain the nature of each other file.\nEXAMPLE 1:\t29341-420.zip is the compressed file of specification 29.341 version 4.2.0.\nEXAMPLE 2:\t31811-m-6g2.doc is the source file of specification 31.811 part 22 version 6.16.2.\nEXAMPLE 3:\t22354-480(1).doc and 22354-480(2).doc are the two files which make up specification 22.354 version 4.8.0 (and which will both be compressed into file 22354-480.zip).\nEXAMPLE 4:\t34101-300(1).doc and 34101-300(2).zip are the source text file and the compressed set of TTCN files respectively which together comprise 34.101 version 3.0.0.\nDraft versions of specifications may be made available in the responsible Groups' directories.

Such files shall never appear in the official specification directories.\nThe foregoing file format using three characters for the version number is valid as long as none of the three version elements (major, technical, editorial) exceeds the value 35, since the characters 0..9, a..z represent a base-36 value. If any one or more of the three version elements exceeds 35 then the file format shall be modified to use two decimal characters in the range 00 to 99 for each element, i.e. six characters in all.\nEXAMPLE 5:\tVersion 15.35.0 of TS 29.341 would have the file name 29341-fz0.\nVersion 15.36.0 of TS 29.341 would have the file name 29341-153600.\n(The file extension is omitted for clarity.)\nFor specification part and sub-part numbers, one or two characters may be used, 0..9 or 00..99.

It is then possible to analyse the steps needed to achieve each goal, starting from the status quo.\nIt will often be desirable to first produce a feasibility report, which is to be undertaken in the context of a Study Item.\nStudy Item:\t\nAn initial study, resulting in a Technical Report, which typically performs a feasibility study for additional functionality.  If the results of the study are positive, one or more subsequent Feature-type Work Items may follow.\nA feasibility study may include commercial as well as technical considerations.  This analysis will naturally lead to defining the new features which it is wished to add to the existing system.\nFeature:\t\nNew, or substantially enhanced functionality which represents added value to the existing system.\nA feature should be more or less self-contained - that is, each feature can be viewed as an optional extra, which can be added or not as a function of market demand. Network operators and equipment manufacturers can decide using commercial considerations whether or not to implement a feature. The description of a feature need not be technically precise, but should represent a concept which can be understood at a service level. It should answer the question: what do I get for my money? A feature should normally embody an improved service to the customer and / or increased revenue generation potential to the supplier.\nThis being the case, most features would be the responsibility of TSG-SA WG1. The ensemble of the features of a particular release of the system represents the difference between that release and the previous release.\nA feature can be considered as a high-level goal for project management purposes. But most features will be quite complex, and will need to be broken down into simpler elements or building blocks for the purpose of specifying precise functionality.\nWork on a study item or feature may be carried out by multiple working groups spanning one or more TSGs. In the case of multi-TSG study items and features, all such TSGs should be shown in the work plan as being responsible for the study item or feature; this should be refined as soon as possible into an identification of the individual working groups responsible.  To allow work to progress, the Work Item Descriptions (see clause 6.1) may be approved by one TSG before formal contribution has been received by other involved TSGs and WGs, which should review the Work Item Description in a timely manner, and provide their own input as soon as possible.\nBuilding block:\nA sub-division of a feature, representing a coherent set of technical functionality which would generally be expected to reside in a single system element.\nA building block shall be defined in technical terms, and its description will require an understanding of the architecture of the overall system. A building block should generally be restricted to a single physical or logical entity or a single protocol such as \"terminal\" or \"call control\". This implies a generic or object-oriented approach. A building block should normally be the responsibility of a single TSG.\nIn the case of very simple features, a single building block may suffice, in which case the feature and its building block are synonymous.\nTo implement a building block it will generally be necessary further to subdivide the functionality into smaller tasks, each representing a closely specified and easily comprehended activity. Such work tasks may not only be divided by technical content, but potentially by phase. So, for example, it is necessary to define service aspects fully (one or more work tasks) before considering functional information flows (one or more work tasks) which in turn will be followed by detailed protocol specification (one or more work tasks).\nWork task:\nA sub-division of a building block, representing a self-contained, well-scoped and well-scheduled item of work.\nIt is at this lowest hierarchical level of breakdown that estimations of work content and thus time scales can be calculated. From the estimated schedules of all work tasks which comprise a building block, and from their inter-dependences, can be derived the overall schedule for the \"parent\" building block. From the schedules of all component building blocks, the time-to-completion of the parent feature can be estimated. A work task will almost certainly be the responsibility of a single Working Group.\nThe output of a work task shall be:\n-\tOne or more new Technical Specifications (or Reports); and / or\n-\tChange Requests to existing TSs / TRs.\nFeatures, building blocks and work tasks are the three specific types of \"Work Item\".\nIn the case of very simple building blocks, a single work task may suffice, in which case the building block and its work task are synonymous.\nWork Item:\nA generic term used to encompass study item, feature, building block and work task.\nAll Work Items, whatever their class (feature, building block or work task) require:\n-\tA precise definition of content (\"scope\");\n-\tAn estimated schedule, with milestones to track progress if possible; (in the case of building blocks and features, the schedule can be derived from those of the component work tasks);\n-\tA named person to act as rapporteur (in effect, the manager of the Work Item);\n-\tAt least four Member Organizations supporting the Work Item and willing to offer active participation in its realization.\n",

Such CRs shall instead refer to the pseudo Work Item 'Technical Enhancements and Improvements'. The CRs relating to this type of modification shall be tagged with the work item code TEI<x> where <x> represents the Release number: e.g. for Release 16, the code would be \"TEI16\".\nTEI Work Item codes shall not be used where an appropriate Work Item code exists.\nTEI Work Item codes should not be used for the definition of new services/features/functions (i.e. Category B CRs).\nTEI Work Item codes should not be used alone for functional modification of existing services/features/functions (i.e. Category C CRs).\nNevertheless, if a feature is functionally modified by a Category C CR using a TEI<x> Work Item code, the code(s) for the Work Item(s) which introduced that feature shall be used, plus the appropriate TEI<x> code for the first Release in which the CR is introduced.\nIf\n-\tit is clear that the modification(s) can be completed within one TSG cycle, and\n-\tthe normal stage 1, 2, 3 sequence of CRs does not require one additional meeting cycle in each affected TSG,\nthen a TEI code may be used. TEI codes shall not be used where the development of modification(s) and interactions with other WGs are likely to prolong the outcome for a period of time greater than this; in such cases, a new specific Work Item shall be created instead.\nFor smaller features that are handled with Category B and/or Category C CRs within one TSG cycle, a provisional Work Item code shall be used before the CR(s) and the companion WID are submitted for approval to the TSG.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of clause 4.10.2, TEI<x> is also to be used in a Category F and any related Category A CR(s) which add to or modify TR/TS content introduced in a Release prior to <x> and where no appropriate Release <x> Work Item exists. In this case the code(s) for the Work Item(s) which introduced the relevant TR/TS content shall be used, plus the appropriate TEI<x> code for the first Release in which the CR is introduced. The same TEI<x> shall be used in all mirror (i.e. Category A) CRs.\nExample:\tTR/TS content is introduced into TS 23.456 under the Release 13 Work Item ABCD by means of a Rel-13 CR. Much later, an error is identified in the TR/TS content introduced by that Rel-13 CR which of course appears in the current Release 13 version of 23.456.\nAccording to the provisions of clause 4.10.0, a category F CR would be introduced into the current Release 13 version tagged with Work Item ABCD, together with category A (mirror) CRs to the Release 14, 15, etc versions of 23.456, each also tagged with code ABCD.\nHowever, it is felt that the seriousness of the error does not warrant taking the correction all the way back to Release 13, and so the category F CR is instead written to the current Release 15 version of 23.456. This is tagged with the Work Item codes ABCD and TEI15. Category A CRs are written to the Release 16, etc versions of 23.456, and these are also tagged with Work Item codes ABCD and TEI15.\nNOTE :\tThe order in which multiple Work Item codes appear on a CR cover sheet is not significant. (Thus in the foregoing example, the CRs could equally well show \"ABCD, TEI15\" or \"TEI15, ABCD\".)\nThe use of a TEI Work Item code alone should be avoided whenever possible, and any use of a TEI Work Item code should be considered very carefully.\nFor the other types of modification, the provisions of clause 6.3 apply.\n",

Occasionally another Group may be given responsibility for the service requirements. In any case, however, it should be a single group and one that reports directly to the TSG.\nSystem/Architectural requirements and implications:\nIn addition, the responsibility for system/architectural requirements should be allocated immediately, even though the implications and requirements normally will be seen only after the study on service/system requirements have been initiated. The responsibility for the system/architectural requirements shall be given to a single body to guarantee the consistency of the adopted solution.\nThe choice of group should not pre-determine the technical choices and in many cases, the responsibility for system and architectural requirement study needs a widening of the competency and a readiness to look at a variety of technical aspects. This can be obtained either by drawing the attraction of the suitable experts (e.g., by setting special meetings or clear meeting dates) or by the organization of joint meetings.\nTSG SA shall maintain the overall consistency of the system architecture despite the numerous modifications due to various Work Items. TSG SA, shall ensure the co-ordination of the development of general architecture concepts and their applications to individual Work Items, and should thus also draw attention and expertise from other Groups.\nProtocol specifications:\nThe responsibility for the elaboration of the protocol specifications cannot, in most cases, be allocated at the early stages since it depends on the technical implementation choices and hence on the results of the study of the service/system requirements as well as on the architectural conclusions.\nThe identification of new protocols to be specified and/or existing protocols to be enhanced shall be derived from the system/architectural requirements. In general, modifications of existing protocols shall be done by the TSG WG in charge of the protocol in question, whilst the responsibility for development of new protocols shall be allocated by the TSG based on proposals from the TSG WG on system/architecture.

It is not the intention to rigorously enforce the usage of the model on all ongoing work, but merely to use it as the common reference model across the TSGs and to structure future work.\nThe description below uses TSG SA as an illustration; it can easily be extended to apply to any TSG (or combination of TSGs).\nTSG SA is, through SA1, responsible for defining the features and services required in the 3GPP specifications. SA1 is responsible of producing the stage 1 descriptions (requirements) for the relevant features and passing them to SA2. SA1 may also forward their considerations on possible architecture and implementation to SA2, but is not responsible for this part of the work.\nSA2 should then define the architecture for the features and the system, and then divide the features into building blocks based on the architectural decisions made in SA2. SA2 shall then forward the building blocks to the relevant TSGs for the detailed work. These proposals shall be reviewed and discussed in an interactive way together with TSGs/WGs, until a common understanding of the required work is reached. During the detailed the work of the TSGs and their Working Groups, SA2 shall be kept informed about the progress.\nThe TSGs and their WGs treat the building block as one or several dedicated work tasks. Typical output of a work task is new specification(s), updated specification(s), technical report(s) or the conclusion that the necessary support is already provided in the existing specifications.\nSA2's role is in co-operation with the TSGs and their WGs to identify if synergy can be obtained by using some of the building blocks for more than one feature. Part of SA2's task is to verify that all required work for a full system specification of the features relevant will take place within 3GPP without overlap between groups. In order for SA2 to be successful, this has to be done in co-operation with other TSGs/WGs.\nThe following guidelines are proposed for project scheduling. SA1 sets a target, SA2 performs a first technical review and comments on the target. SA2 indicates target for time schedule together with allocation of the defined building blocks. The TSGs and their WGs comment back on these targets. SA2 tries if necessary to align the new target amongst the involved parties. SA1 and SA are kept informed of the overall schedule.\nIt is the task of TSG SA, SA1 and SA2 to ensure early involvement of SA3 to ensure that the potential security requirements, service requirements and the architectural requirements are aligned and communicated to the TSGs and their WGs.\nIn order for , GERAN and RAN and their subgroups to plan and perform their horizontal tasks on conformance testing and mobile station capabilities, SA2 should invite those TSGs to evaluate the potential impact of a new feature. If work on horizontal tasks is required, this should be included in the overall work plan.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a 5G network, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. It shows how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.
