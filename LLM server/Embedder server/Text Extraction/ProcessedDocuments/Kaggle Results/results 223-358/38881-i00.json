                            "text_content": "Some common RF assumptions are listed in Table 6.2.1.1-1 below, which are the baseline for the following MSD analysis. Some parameters such as PCB/antenna isolation may be varied to evaluate their effect on the MSD performance. Other parameters related to certain types of MSD are described in the individual sub-sections.\nTable 6.2.1.1-1: Common RF assumptions\n\nThe L-H band combinations such as CA_n20-n40, CA_n28-n40 and CA_n18-n41 are susceptible to harmonic mixing problems. More than 30dB MSD is specified for CA_n28-n40 when the mixing product of the UL in band n40 and the 3rd harmonic of the DL LO in band n28 falls within the receiver channel bandwidth. The MSD requirements reuse those for LTE CA_28-40, which were defined based on the study of several contributions.\nAccording to the analysis, the conductive path from the aggressor band transmitter to the victim band receiver dominates the interference level. And the victim band receiver duplexer/filter rejection at the aggressor frequency is the key factor in addition to the victim band receiver mixer harmonic suppression. Figure 6.2.1.2-1 shows the MSD variation with the optimization of the two key factors.\nThe figure depicts a relationship between the MSD (Maximum Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and the receiver filter rejection, as well as the mixer harmonic rejection, for a specific receiver filter. The PCB isolation of 70 dB is assumed for the receiver.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-1: MSD by harmonic mixing varies with the receiver filter rejection and the mixer harmonic rejection. The PCB isolation of 70 dB is assumed.\n\nAs seen from the REFSENS requirements in TS 38.101-1, the MSD is usually more severe when the source of cross-band isolation interference is “ACLR1” or “ACLR2” (e.g. CA_n18-n28, CA_n5-n28). If the aggressor channel BW is large (e.g. 50/100MHz), the MSD may increase to more than 10 or even above 20 dB (e.g. CA_n1-n3, CA_n1-n40), even if the source is classified as “>ACLR2”. It’s worth noting that the spec requirements target the worst cases, where the aggressor carrier frequency is set as close as possible to that of the victim.\nAs shown by the previous analysis, the PA noise and cross-band isolation are the main factors affecting the MSD when the carrier frequencies and UL RB allocation are fixed.\n\nThe band combination of CA_n3-n78 or DC_3_n78 may suffer from MSD caused by H2 of the UL in band 3/n3 falling into the DL of band n78. All the RF components in the front-end of band 3/n3 could contribute to the generation of H2, including: duplexer, antenna switch, diplexer/triplexer and etc. It was identified that the main factors are:\n-\tPA linearity\n-\tTotal filter attenuation (including Harmonic Trap Filter and B3 duplexer)\n-\tPCB isolation.\nThe filter survey shows that the B3 duplexer attenuation at B42 ranges from 10 to 27 dB, and the discussions indicates that 30 dB is possible for future design. Additionally, the following assumptions were considered optimistic at that time: PA H2 = -35 dBc, HTF = 30dB and PCB isolation (@3.5GHz) = 70dB.\nBy tuning the total filter attenuation and the PCB isolation while fixing the PA H2=-35dBc, the MSD trend is obtained as shown in Figure 6.2.1.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a 4-1 configuration of a 4-port 1000BASE-T switch, with a 4-port 1000BASE-TX switch connected in parallel. The 4-1 configuration allows for the use of a 4-port 1000BASE-TX switch in parallel with a 4-port 1000BASE-T switch, providing a high-speed link between the two. The figure also includes a 4-port 1000BASE-TX switch connected in parallel with a 4-port 1000BASE-T switch, which can be used to provide a high-speed link between the two. The figure also includes a 4-port 1000BASE-TX switch connected in parallel with a 4-port 1000BASE-T switch, which can be used to provide a high-speed link between the two. The figure also includes a 4-port 1000BASE-TX switch connected in parallel with a 4-port 1000BASE-T switch, which can be used to provide a high-speed link between the two. The figure also\nFigure 6.2.1.4-1: MSD by Tx harmonic varies with the Tx filter attenuation and the PCB isolation. The PA H2 is assumed to be -35dBc.\nFigure 6.2.1.4-2 illustrates the combination of carrier frequencies that may suffer from MSD caused by Tx harmonic.\nThe figure depicts a carrier frequency combination matrix for various carrier frequencies, including n3, n78, and n11, which may be affected by the carrier-to-water (CBW) interference caused by the High-Speed Downlink (H2) signal. The matrix shows the carrier frequencies and their corresponding CBW values, providing a comprehensive understanding of the interference patterns in the 4G/5G network.\nFigure 6.2.1.4-2: Illustration of carrier frequency combinations that may be affected by MSD caused by H2. CBW: 10MHz for n3, 20MHz for n78.\n\nWhen both uplinks are active, the DL band n3 of CA_n3-n78 may suffer from IMD2 and IMD4 of the dual-UL. It has been identified that PCB isolation and antenna isolation are the main factors. The MSD trend is reproduced in Figure 6.2.1.5-1 below.\nThe figure depicts the impact of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices on the performance of a 5G communication system. It shows the variation in signal strength caused by metal oxide semiconductor device (MD) induced metal oxide semiconductor (IMD) 2 (IMD2) for different PCB isolation and antenna isolation levels. The 40dB antenna isolation is impractical for small form-factor UEs, but serves as a performance indicator for conductive measurements.\nFigure 6.2.1.5-1: MSD caused by IMD2 for CA_n3-n78 varies with different PCB isolation and antenna isolation. The 40dB antenna isolation is impractical for small form-factor UEs but serves as a performance indicator for conductive measurements.\nIn order for the self-interference to fall within the own receiver, the aggressors’ carrier frequencies and the victims’ carrier frequencies need to satisfy certain mathematical constraints, subject to the order of the IMD. Figure 6.2.1.5-2 indicates the occurrences of IM interferences for CA_n3-n78.\nFigure 6.2.1.5-2: Illustration of the relationship between IMD and the carrier frequencies. The red color indicates that the IM product may fall into the victim Rx channel, assuming CBW: 10MHz for n3, 20MHz for n78.\nIt can be seen that for the majority of the carrier frequency configurations of CA_n3-n78, there’s no self-interference from IMD2 or IMD4 or H2. Furthermore, when MSD from IMD2 happens for a given deployment, MSD from IMD4 does not, or vice visa. Since n78 is a TDD band, the MSD caused by H2 of n3 will not happen at the same time as the MSD caused by IMD2 or IMD4 of the dual UL.\n\nBased on the above discussions, the key contributors for different types of MSDs are summarized in Table below.\nTable 6.2.1.6-1: Key contributors for different MSD types\n\nIt has been shown that the MSD may be improved by optimizing the key contributors listed in Table 6.2.1.6-1. However, it can also be seen that for large MSD values (>20dB) it would be very challenging to reduce them to below 10dB. Furthermore, we can make the following observations:\nObservation 1: Different types of MSDs may have different limiting factors. Which one can be improved for what band combinations are design choices of the UE implementation.\nObservation 2: For large MSD values (>20dB) it’s very challenging to reduce them to below 10dB. The relatively small MSD values (<10 dB) may be further improved depending on UE implementation.\nObservation 3: The antenna isolation plays an important role in MSD performance. However, the effect is not verified by the existing conductive tests.\nObservation 4: For a given band combination, MSD from different sources are unlikely to happen simultaneously, depending on the configuration of carrier frequencies, duplex mode of the component bands, the order of IMD or harmonics and etc.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "There would be multiple ways to improve MSD due to UL harmonics. In order to show a specific example, we assume a following condition captured in Table 6.2.3.1.1-1.\nTable 6.2.3.1.1-1: MSD calculation where PA H2 is 35 dBc.\n\nThe derived MSD is almost the same as that of specified MSD, i.e., 23.9 dB. The further proposed improved MSD value by assuming PA H2 of 48 dBc and the MSD becomes 14.3 dB as shown in Table 6.2.3.1.1-2, which means 10 dB improvement is possible.\nTable 6.2.3.1.1-2: MSD calculation where PA H2 is 48 dBc.\n\nObservation 1: Feasibility of MSD improvement by PA H2 performance improvement was already proposed by a UE vendor in reference contribution, where it showed 10 dB improvement is possible.\nNow the question is what if PA H2 with even better performance is used, whether the amount of MSD is further improved or not. The amount of the MSD improvement by PA H2 performance improvement alone starts to saturate when PA H2 approaches to 50 dBc and the MSD couldn’t be lower than 11.4 dB even if PA H2 was infinite. This is because as the noise in Path 1 becomes lower thanks to PA H2 improvement, the noise from Path 3 appears as the next gating factor since PA H2 doesn’t reduce noise in Path 3 at all. Hence, in order to improve MSD further, the noise from Path 3 must be also reduced.\nNext, we’ll take a look at the amount of MSD improvement by assuming that isolations like PCB in Path 2 and Path 3 alone or PA H2 alone is improved in Figure 1 which shows how much MSD improvement can be obtained by improving PA H2 from 35 dBc to 75 dBc or isolation in Path 2 and Path 3 from 70 to 110 dB. It’s noted that we don’t have an intention to discuss if 75 dBc and 110 dB are feasible or not. They are just used to see the trend of MSD improvement by PA H2 or isolation improvement. Regarding MSD improvement vs PA H2 improvement, as mentioned before, the MSD improvement is saturated at around 50 dBc. With respect to MSD improvement vs isolation improvement, the amount of MSD improvement starts to saturate at around 90 dB and even if isolation was infinity, the MSD couldn’t be lower than 9.4 dB.\nObservation 2: Around 10 dB MSD improvement for CA_n3-n78 2nd UL harmonics is feasible at least e.g., by PA H2 suppression of 48 dBc or isolation like PCB in Path 2 and Path 3 of 85 dB. Single RF component performance improvement alone, however, cannot achieve even better MSD like 20 dB since other gating factor(s) appears in one or two of the three Paths once noise in two or one of the three Paths is improved.\nThe figure depicts the improvement in signal quality by using H2 PA suppression or isolation improvement in Path 2 and Path 3, as indicated by the text \"H2 PA suppression or isolation improvement by the same amount in Path 2&3.\" This improvement is achieved by using a combination of H2 PA suppression and isolation techniques, which helps to reduce the impact of multipath reflections and improve the overall signal quality.\nFigure 6.2.3.1.1-1: MSD improvement by H2 PA suppression or isolation improvement by the same amount in Path 2&3\n\nWith consideration of Observation 2, we take into account multiple components performance improvement impact on combined MSD. Figure 2 shows relation between the combined MSD improvement and improvements due to combinations of PA H2 suppression in Path 1, antenna isolation in DRX Path 1 and an isolation in Path 2 and Path 3.\nThe figure depicts the impact of antenna isolation, PA H2 suppression, and isolation on the combined Mean Square Error (MSE) in Path 2/3. It illustrates the importance of these factors in ensuring accurate and reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 6.2.3.1.2-1: Impact of antenna isolation, PA H2 suppression and isolation in Path 2/3 on combined MSD\nFrom Figure 6.2.3.1.2-1, in order to achieve around 20 dB MSD improvement, in case PA H2 suppression is 48 dBc, around 20 dB isolation improvement for Path 2 and Path 3 is needed. In case PA H2 suppression is 35 dBc, even if antenna isolation is 20 dB, 20 dB MSD is not possible (around 19 dB seems possible) under the assumption of Table 6.2.3.1.1-1.\nObservation 3: In case of PA H2 suppression of 35 dB, 20 dB MSD improvement is not possible even if antenna isolation is 20 dB and isolation improvement of Path 2&3 was infinity if the other assumptions are the same as those in Table 6.2.3.1.1-1.\nObservation 4: In order to achieve 20 dB MSD improvement with PA H2 suppression of 48 dBc, around 25 dB isolation improvement, i.e., 95 dB isolation, for Path 2 &3 is required if the other assumptions are the same as those in Table 6.2.3.1.1-1.\nNext, we discuss the impact of antenna isolation performance improvement on the combined MSD. One of the important aspects of antenna isolation in terms of MSD improvement is that the contribution of it to MSD improvement applies to only MSD for DRX under the UE architecture assumption in reference, which is achieved by reducing the composite H2 level at LNA (and hence MSD) in Path 1 for “DRX”.  It’s noted that even if a UE architecture to enable a UE to obtain antenna isolation for PRX is assumed, the conclusion does not change that much for at least MSD due to UL harmonics since it only improves H2 levels at LNA for PRX and DRX for Path 1 only. Therefore, antenna isolation does not help improve combined MSD if DRX H2 level at LNA for Path 1 is lower than those for Path 2 and 3 and helps improve combined MSD a little if DRX H2 level at LNA for Path 1 is higher than those for Path 2 and 3, though the help can be around 5 dB at maximum with antenna isolation of 20 dB.\nObservation 5: Antenna isolation improvement helps improve combined MSD more when DRX H2 levels at LNA for Paths 2 and 3 are even lower than DRX H2 level at LNA for Path 1 while the amount of maximum improvement by antenna isolation is around 5 dB with antenna isolation of 20 dB.\n\nIn this sub-section, we discuss a way to mitigate the required isolation improvement in Path 2 and 3 by reducing respective MSDs (composite H2 levels) for PRX and DRX in a similar level from the conditions in Table 6.2.3.1.1-1. It is noted that in order to achieve 20 dB improved combined MSD, i.e., MSD = around 4 dB, H2 levels at LNA from each of the paths for both PRX and DRX must be lower than approximately -103 dBm, i.e., values in (j), (l) and (n) must be lower than or equal to -103 dBm except for DRX H2 level at (j) whose value is already -105.2 dBm. A specific example is summarized in Table 6.2.3.1.3-1, where combined MSD is 3.67 dB can be obtained.\nTable 6.2.3.1.3-1: A way to 20 dB MSD improvement with less isolation improvement of Path 2&3 than Figure 2\n\n\nObservation 6: If harmonic filter rejection, HB switch H2 and Triplexer Rejection towards H2 are improved by 8 dB, 8 dB and 5 dB, respectively, all the LNA H2 levels at the three Paths are almost equally lower than or equal to -103 dBm, as shown in Table 3, the required isolation of Path 2 & 3 can be reduced to 83 dB from 95 dB.\n\nIt is not hard to anticipate that achieving MSD improvement of 24 dB, i.e., MSD = 0 dB, even more challenging than achieving that of 20 dB. When MSD improvement of 20 dB is achieved, H2 levels from all the paths for PRX and DRX must be already similar levels or composite H2 level for DRX is even smaller than that for PRX. The former means that even if a component performance is improved and one or some of H2 levels at LNA at Path 1, 2 and/or 3 for PRX and/or DRX are improved, the other H2 levels stay as a gating factor. The latter means that the composite level for PRX must be improved. In any case, multiple components performance must be improved, but cost for MSD improvement becomes higher. For more specific, Figure 3 shows relation between respective H2 levels improvement and combined MSD assuming that H2 levels from the three Paths are improved in the same amount from the condition shown in Table 6.2.3.2-1. For example, 1 dB in the horizontal line means -116 (-115 dBm - 1 dB) dBm for Path 1 DRX and -106 (-105 dBm - 1 dB) dBm for Path 1/2/3 PRX and Path 2/3 DRX and so on.\n\nFigure 6.2.3.1.4-1: Required LNA PRX or DRX H2 levels for all the three path\nFigure 6.2.3.1.4-1 says that to improve MSD from 1 dB to almost 0 dB, the respective H2 levels must be improved by at least 10 dB, which means that an additional 10 dB isolation improvement for path 2 and 3 is needed and H2 levels in path 1 somehow need to be improved by 10 dB, but the options are very limited since triplexer would have challenges in having more attention than 20 dB so that RF components performance prior to the triplexer must be improved.\nObservation 7: Theoretically it is not impossible to achieve MSD = 0dB for CA_n3-n78 for 2nd UL harmonic. However, as MSD approaches 0 dB, it requires more cost, i.e., components performance improvement compared to the cost to improve MSD by 20 dB.\n\nRegarding CA_n3-n77, MSD for this CA band combination has not been specified in 38.101-1 while that for corresponding EN-DC, MSD is defined in 38.101-3. The values for MSD for EN-DC are extracted from Table 7.3B.2.3.2-1 in 38.101-3 as follows.\nTable 6.2.3.2-1: Extract from Table 7.3B.2.3.2-1 in TS38.101-3\n\nA technical analysis to justify MSD = 0 dB for CA_n3-n78 was submitted in a reference contribution, where Tx power at LNA input are summarized in Table 5, where Direct Signal Path corresponds to Path 1 in Section 6.2.3.1.1 and PCB Coupling Path corresponds to Path 2 in Section 6.2.3.1.1, respectively. It should be noted that in case of analysis for harmonic mixing, consideration of Path 3 in Section 6.2.3.1.1 is not necessary since the BB output power is always even lower than that PA output power in Path 2 by PA gain as far as the same PCB isolation is assumed. The contribution shared the fact that there is a mixier with the spur rejection of about 66 dBc for mixing with 2LO and it enables UEs to have MSD = 0 dB. Moreover, the reference contribution implies that MSD = 0 dB for CA_n3-n78 can be achieved with PCB isolation of 84 (70 dB + 14 dB) dB instead of using the mixer with 66 dBc rejection.\nTable 6.2.3.2-2: Extract of Table 1 from [4]\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 3,\" illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network. It demonstrates the multi-path signal propagation, highlighting key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, with key components like the base station, user equipment, and scatterers. The figure also shows the fiber-optic backbone architecture, with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. Redundancy paths are shown in dashed lines, ensuring failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nAs can be seen in Table 6.2.3.2-2, RF components like antenna isolation, filter isolations in Path 1 cannot contribute to improving combined MSD since noise level from Path 2 is higher by 14 dB for PRX and 24 dB for DRX until the noise level in Path 2 approaches close to that in Path 1. 14 dB noise reduction for Path 2 means that PCB isolation must be improved from 70 dB to 84 dB. However, as can be seen in Figure 4, when PCB isolation is 85 dB, combined MSD itself if almost zero dB (Combined MSD is below 1 dB even with mixer spur rejection is 45 dBc) so that there is no room for antenna isolation to contribute to the improvement.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of the MSD relation between PCB isolation and mixer spur rejection for 2nd harmonic mixing in a PCB. The figure illustrates the relationship between the two parameters, highlighting the importance of PCB isolation in ensuring the rejection of mixer spurs, which can cause interference in the system.\nFigure 6.2.3.2-1: MSD relation b/w PCB isolation and Mixer spur rejection for 2nd harmonic mixing\nFigure 6.2.3.2-1 also shares the information that combined MSD is almost the same if the same amount of PCB isolation improvement or Mixer spur rejection improvement is achieved, though Mixer spur rejection improvement can give a little bit lager MSD improvement by PCB isolation improvement (see e.g., the top red horizontal dashed line.  A point where PCB isolation of 70 dB line has 50 dBc(45+5) mixer spur rejection is lower than a point where PCB isolation of 75 dB(70+5) line has 45 dBc mixer spur rejection). This is theoretically valid since mixer spur rejection applies to the composite noise consisting of Path 1 and Path 2 while PCB isolation only improves noise from Path 2. Finally, although MSD = 0 dB is possible, the cost performance becomes worse as the MSD approaches 0 dB. For instance, in order to achieve 5 dB MSD improvement, i.e., MSD = 2 dB, PCB isolation, mixer spur rejection or the sum of both requires around from 8 dB to 12 dB improvement while to achieve 6 dB MSD improvement, i.e., MSD = 1 dB, PCB isolation, mixer spur rejection or the sum of both requires around 12 to 15 dB improvement.\nObservation 8: MSD of 0 dB for CA_n3-n78 harmonic mixing is feasible by PCB isolation improvement, e.g., 84 dB, mixer spur rejection improvement, e.g., 66 dBc or combination of the two RF components performance improvement, e.g., PCB isolation is 75 dB and mixer spur rejection is 60 dBc. Antenna isolation improvement doesn’t help improve MSD for 2nd harmonic mixing for CA_n3-n78.\n\nMSD due to IMD2 for CA_n3-n78 were discussed intensively. Table 6.2.3.3-1 is a summary of IMD2 analysis from a reference, where yellow cells are affected by PCB isolation, aqua cells are affected by antenna isolation, green cells are affected by PCB isolation as well as antenna isolation. Hence, under the conditions in Table 6.2.3.3-1, it is expected that if only PCB isolation is improved, MSD improvement would start to saturate when the PCB isolation approaches to approximately 80 dB, since IMD2 from antenna switch and diplexer stay at -75 dBm in PRX. Antenna isolation improvement can contribute to reduce IMD2 in DRX so that the combined MSD can be improved accordingly. Hence, if both PCB isolation and antenna isolation are improved, the MSD can be further improved. However, even if PCB isolation as well as antenna isolation are improved, IMD2 from antenna switch and diplexer stay at -75 dBm in PRX. Hence, in order to reduce the combined MSD significantly, IP2 for these RF components needs to be improved.\nTable 6.2.3.3-1: IMD2 analysis for CA_n3-n78 from [5]\n\n\nThe figure depicts a complex network of components, including an Antenna switch, Diplexer, and Antenna isolator, all interconnected through a PCB isolation circuit. The diagram illustrates the interconnection of these components, highlighting the importance of PCB isolation in maintaining the integrity of the network.\nFigure 6.2.3.3-1: relation b/w IMD, PCB isolation, Ant Iso and IP2 of Antenna switch & Diplexer\nFrom Figure 6.2.3.3-1, it can be seen that the around 20 dB MSD improvement is possible if IP2 for diplexer and Antenna switch are 125 dBm, PCB isolation is 80 dB and antenna isolation is 20 dB under the conditions of Table 6.2.3.3-2. Theoretically MSD of 0 dB is possible while the cost is significantly high but the gain = “the amount of MSD improvement”/”the amount of RF component improvement” becomes less and less.\nObservation 9: Around 10 dB MSD improvement of IMD2 for CA_n3-n78 is possible if antenna isolation is around 20 dB or PCB isolation is around 80 dB. Around 20 dB improvement is also possible, if IP2 of antenna switch as well as diplexer is around 125 dBm. Further MSD improvement is also possible while the cost and performance = “the amount of MSD improvement”/”the amount of RF component performance improvement” becomes less and less.\nThe below Figure 6.2.3.4-1 shows relation between the amount of the MSD improvements and the amount of PCB isolation improvement for different MSD types. It should be noted that assumed UE RF architecture is basically the same across the MSD evaluations for MSD types while some device performance assumptions, e.g., RF front end loss are different across MSD types so that this can be used only as a guide.\n\nThe figure depicts the relationship between the amount of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) layer improvement and the improvement in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) layer isolation. The improvement in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) layer isolation is shown by the dashed line, while the amount of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) layer improvement is shown by the solid line. The figure illustrates the trade-off between the two improvements, showing that while the improvement in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) layer isolation is significant, the improvement in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) layer is less significant.\nFigure 6.2.3.4-1: The amount of MSD improvement vs PCB isolation improvement\nFrom the Figure 6.2.3.4-1, all the three MSD types has a similar trend when PCB isolation is roughly up to 75 dB. Then, gradually, 2nd UL harmonic starts to show a different trend than the other 2nd harmonic mixing and IMD2 Moreover, grey line is the case that PCB isolation as well as PA H2 improvement for 2nd UL harmonic are considered. The amount of the MSD improvement is quite different from the other MSD types as well as the same MSD type whose PA H2 performance is 35 dBc. Moreover, given that it is not always the case that UE vendors will always use PCB isolation alone to improve MSD, the amount of MSD improvement can be very different from MSD types to types.\nObservation 10: The amount of the MSD improvement is not always the same or similar across MSD types even if one common RF component performance improvement is considered. Provided that it is not always the case that UE vendors will always use one single RF component performance improvement, e.g., only PCB isolation, to improve MSD, the amount of MSD improvement can be very different from MSD types to types.\n\n",

The below table shows the budget for n77 Tx noise falling into n41.\nTable 6.2.4-6: CA-n41_n77 budget for cross band isolation with n41 victim\n\nThe MSD in the current specifications for this combination is only 4.5dB and currently with 15 dB of antenna isolation the MSD is 3.3 dB. Therefore, even with large increases in antenna isolation the maximum MSD reduction that can be achieved is only a further 3.3 dB. The below table gives the variation in MSD with antenna isolation. As the lower MSD feature is meant to address band combinations with large MSDs we think that the low MSD of this band combination does not make it a candidate for this feature.\nTable 6.2.4-7: CA-n41_n77 variation of MSD with antenna isolation for n41 victim\n\nObservation 4: For CA-n41_n77 the MSD due to cross band isolation where n77 Tx noise falls into n41 Rx the following behaviour is observed with antenna isolation:\n\nIn our opinion the low MSD for this band combination does not make it a candidate for the low MSD feature\nFor CA-n28_n40 for the 3rd RX LO harmonic of n28 mixing with n40 Tx and falling in the n28 Rx band we can have the following typical budget.\nTable 6.2.4-8: CA-n28_n40 budget for Rx LO harmonic mixing with n40 Tx falling into n28 Rx\n\nIt is seen that for improvement in PCB and antenna isolation the MSD behaves as indicated in table 6.2.4-8.\nTable 6.2.4-9: CA-n28_n40 MSD for Rx LO harmonic falling into n28 Rx as a function of PCB and antenna isolation\n\nFrom the above table it is observed that the MSD is dominated by the PCB isolation and that the antenna isolation has very little impact.\nObservation 5: For CA-n28_n40 the MSD due to 3rd RX LO harmonic of n28 mixing with n40 Tx and falling into 28 Rx the following behaviour is observed with PCB and antenna isolation:\n\nFor most band combinations that have large MSDs an increase in the PCB and/or antenna isolation will enable a reduction in MSD.\nObservation 6: The band combinations analysed in this study shows that MSD can be lowered by increasing PCB and or antenna isolations\n\n",

Thereby without taking into account the practical implementation feasibility, we have evaluated the MSD improvement over the improved PCB isolation up to 100 dB and antenna isolation up to 20 dB. The result for 5MHz DL channel BW is shown in Figure 6.2.5.3-2.\nBased on the above analysis, it can be seen that even with 20dB antenna isolation and 100 PCB isolation, the improved MSD is still above 25 dB. As a result, it would be rather challenging to improve MSD caused by 3rd order harmonic mixing to below 30 dB based on practical UE implementation.\nObservation 11: It would be rather challenging to improve MSD caused by 3rd order harmonic mixing to below 30 dB based on practical UE implementation.\nThe figure depicts a 3rd order harmonic mixing MSD improvement over an improved PCB and antenna isolation scheme, highlighting the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing signal quality.\nFigure 6.2.5.3-2 3rd order harmonic mixing MSD improvement over improved PCB and antenna isolations\nThough the RF parameter assumptions for MSD analyses may vary among companies, when considering the potential improvement, company shall present their assumptions for link analysis or measurement results instead of only showing the MSD numbers, otherwise, it would not be conceivable for other companies to envision how the MSD had been derived.\n",

                            "text_content": "In this section, we share some analysis on how much MSD can be improved for some of the agreed candidate band combination by using more aggressive values of PCB isolation and antenna isolation.\nActually, there are several methods to improve the MSD. The MSD defined in the specification are largely depends on the calculation, especially for the larger MSD. Of course, few of the companies provided the measurements on some MSD but such MSD values are usually small.\nConsidering the lower MSD issue are somehow triggered by the survey of the commercial UE from some operators that high MSD (more than 20dB) are defined in the specification for some band combinations. Therefore, we think how much the MSD can be improved in practical should be based on the commercial UE measurement.\nObservation 1. How much the MSD can be improved in practical should be based on the commercial UE measurement.\nWithout the commercial UE measurements, some rough analysis can also be done based on the budget calculations which was extensive adopted in the past. Nevertheless, it would be foreseen different companies may use different input parameters, different calculation methods, even with different RF architecture, all of these factors will impact the results.\nIn the following part of the section, we use CA_n3-n78 as an example.\nCA_n3-n78\nAs CA_n1-n3-n78 and fallback combinations were agreed to used as the candidate band combination. For CA_n3-n78, there are IMD2/4 and 2nd harmonic and harmonic mixing issues.\nIMD2/4 MSD\nThe IMD2/4 MSD in TS38.101-1 for CA_n3-n78 are defined as:\n\nHarmonic Trap filter(HTF) is used for n3-n78, so the RF architecture used for calculation is in Figure 6.2.6-1.\nThe figure depicts a network topology with n3-n78 as the primary transmitter and n3-n78 as the primary receiver. The network is designed to support multiple paths for data transmission, with n3-n78 acting as the primary path for data transmission. The figure also includes a diagram of the network's architecture, highlighting the use of redundant paths and the importance of network redundancy in ensuring reliable data transmission.\nFigure 6.2.6-1: n3-n78 primarily Tx/Rx\nAnd the general IPx RF parameters used in calculation are in Table 6.2.6-1.\nTable 6.2.6-1: General IPx parameters\n\nThe IMD2/IMD4 values at the condition of PCB isolation=65dB and antenna isolation = 10dB are calculated as in Table 6.2.6-2 and 6.2.6-3.\nTable 6.2.6-2: IMD2 MSD for n3-n78\n\nTable 6.2.6-3: IMD4 MSD for n3-n78\n\nWith other PCB isolation and antenna isolation values, where the antenna isolation values are [10, 15, 20]dB, and the PCB isolation values are [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90]dB, the IMD2/4 MSD values are summarized in Table 6.2.6-4.\nTable 6.2.6-4: IMD2/4 MSD values with different antenna isolation, and different PCB isolation\n(a). PC3(without CF)\n\n(b). PC2 (without CF)\n\nIf considering CF, the MSD would be smaller than the values in table 6.2.6-4 due to the IMD2/4 product bandwidth will not occupy the whole IMD2/4 frequency range considering the UL/DL IMD MSD test point.\nFor n3-n78 IMD2/4 MSD, the PA non-linear factor is dominated factor when the PCB isolation is about 75dB. However, when PCB isolation is larger than 75dB, the other RF parameters like diplexer/LNA become the domination. So in this case, if PCB isolation continue to increase, the MSD improved is quite limited. It should be noted that the situations are similar for PC2.\nH2 harmonic MSD\nFor H2 harmonic requirements, the MSD values at the condition of PCB isolation=65dB and antenna isolation = 10dB, and HTF isolation equals to 30dB are calculated as in table 6.2.6-5. Note that only MSD test points of channel bandwidth@n78=10MHz and channel bandwidth@n3 =5MHz is considered since it is the worst case compared to the other MSD test points of channel bandwidth@n78=100MHz and channel bandwidth@n3 =10MHz.\nTable 6.2.6-5: H2 MSD for n3-n78\nSimilar as IMD2/4 MSD, using the combinations of different PCB isolation values and different antenna isolation values, the H2 MSD values are summarized in Table 6.2.6-6.\nTable 6.2.6-6: H2 MSD values with different antenna isolation, and different PCB isolation (PC3 and PC2)(without CF)\n\nHarmonic mixing MSD\nIn current 38.101-1 spec, there is no harmonic mixing MSD defined for PC3 n3-n78 inter-band CA but 8.1dB harmonic mixing MSD was defined for PC2 n3-n78 when aggressor UL is PC2 n78.\nNoted that harmonic mixing MSD was defined for ENDC 3-n78, where 5.7dB is defined for 3@5MHz. Actually 5.7dB harmonic mixing MSD was the comprised value from references due to different parameters were used by different companies. Also, it can be found that this values were derided from antenna isolation is 10dB and PCB isolation is 70dB.\nIgnoring the mistakes for PC3 n3-n78 harmonic mixing MSD, here we assume the same PC3 3_n78 harmonic mixing MSD of 5.7dB was reused.\nFor harmonic mixing requirements, the MSD values at the condition of PCB isolation=70dB and antenna isolation = 10dB, are calculated as in Table 6.2.6-7.\nTable 6.2.6-7: Harmonic mixing MSD for n3-n78 (PC3&PC2)\n\nSimilar as above, different combination of antenna isolation and PCB isolation are used to see how much MSD can be improved, as summarized in Table 6.2.6-8.\nTable 6.2.6-8: Harmonic mixing MSD values different antenna isolation, and different PCB isolation (PC3 and PC2)\n\nIn terms of the above, considering the existing MSD minimum requirements defined in the spec, we can observe:\nObservation 2. PCB isolation for harmonic/IMD and harmonic mixing are used to derive the corresponding MSD values are different.\nObservation 3. For IMD2 and H2 MSD, it is difficult to improve 20dB MSD by only increasing PCB isolation or antenna isolation.\nObservation 4. For IMD2 and H2 MSD, to achieve ~10dB MSD value, the antenna isolation needs to better than 20dB associated with PCB isolation better than 85dB.\nObservation 5. For IMD4, the improved MSD is less than 5dB when the antenna isolation is 20dB associated with PCB isolation is 85dB.\nObservation 6. For IMD2/4, H2 and harmonic mixing MSD, the improved MSD is limited when PCB isolation >75dB for a certain antenna isolation.\nCA_n28-n40\nFor n28-n40, harmonic mixing, i.e. n40 DL = 3*n28 UL, should be considered. Actually, the harmonic mixing MSD value for ENDC 28-n40 and NR CA n28-n40 are reused from LTE CA 28-n40, while it seems the MSD value for LTE CA 28-40 are the leverage value from companies.\nThe RF architecture used in the calculation is shown below.\n\nThe Rx 3rd order harmonic rejection = 20dB and n28 Rx filter selectivity at B40 = 60dB, the MSD values at the condition of PCB isolation=70dB and antenna isolation = 10dB, are calculated as in Table 6.2.6-9.\nTable 6.2.6-9: Harmonic mixing MSD for n28-n40(PC3)\nSimilar as above, using the combinations of different PCB isolation values and different antenna isolation values, the H2 MSD values are summarized in Table 6.2.6-10.\nTable 6.2.6-10: Harmonic mixing MSD values with different antenna isolation, and different PCB isolation (PC3)(without CF)\nThe tendency is quite similar as n3-n78 harmonic mixing, where the MSD value is almost keep unchanged when the antenna isolation is increased up to 20dB as antenna isolation pay less role on improving the MSD.\nFor n28-n40 harmonic mixing, although PCB isolation is up to 90dB, the MSD would be still ‘high’. So to further improve the MSD value, some other method may need to be adopted.\nObservation 7. For n28-n40 harmonic mixing, some other method may need to be adopted to further improving the MSD value.\nFor harmonic mixing, no matter for n3-n78 and n28-n40, the MSD value is almost keep unchanged when the antenna isolation is increased up to 20dB, that’s mainly because the aggressor PA output power appears at victim LNA input via PCB path is the dominated factor.\nObservation 8. For harmonic mixing MSD, antenna isolation play less role on improving the MSD.\nSo far, there were no agreements on the antenna isolation and PCB isolation values. Some concerns from UE vendor that higher PCB isolation (>75dB?) is challenge in practice. So it would be better to discuss the achievable PCB isolation/antenna isolation values in practice when companies re-evaluate how much the MSD can be improved. Otherwise, the re-evaluated may big different among companies by using difference assumption.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "On the way to feasibility study on how much MSD improvement to be expected, it was found that it is feasible to reduce drastically MSD, in some cases, it takes a cost, e.g., increasing PCB isolation alone may not be able to achieve MSD to be zero. With this outcome in mind, there were discussion on how many thresholds to be defined for reporting MSD as well as how reported lower MSD value(s) to be utilized by gNB. All the aforementioned discussion is based on MSD in Block A according to a specified test scenario as illustrated in top right in Figure 7.1.1-1, where RAN4 has selected a combination of an aggressor UE channel bandwidth (also # of RBs) and a victim channel bandwidth so as to enable 2nd order harmonic to hit the entire spectrum in Block A as well as most of the power to be contained in Block A.\nThe figure depicts a 1-1-1 test condition for the second harmonic of a 2nd-order nonlinear system, with a 1-1-1-1 configuration. The test is conducted under the MSD (Modified System Design) method, which is a common approach for analyzing the stability of nonlinear systems. The figure provides a visual representation of the test setup, including the number of test points, the number of test points per node, and the number of nodes in the system. The figure also includes a legend to help interpret the data, such as the number of test points and the number of nodes in the system.\nFigure 7.1.1-1: MSD test condition for 2nd UL harmonic\nIt’s noted that with respect to 2nd order harmonic case for at least PC3, it is very likely that MSD in Block C would be zero if lower MSD capability is reported provided that specified MSD for this region would be a few dB. Still, however, MSD at least in Block B remains undefined or unpredicted. It is noted that MSD undefined region is undefined is wider than Block B. When the lower edge frequency of victim channel bandwidth of X MHz is larger than -20 – X/2 + 2*f1 and the higher edge frequency of victim channel bandwidth is less than 20 + X/2 + 2*f1, MSD is undefined, and the value is somewhere between MSD for near-miss and MSD for direct-hit. This is quite an unfortunate situation since even if a lower MSD, e.g., 15 dB is reported, if e.g., RSRP doesn’t reach a threshold, the network may avoid configuring the UE with CA, may try to configure the UE with CA using DL resource in Region C as shown in Case 1 in Figure 7.x.x-1, and/or may try to schedule UL resources in a way to minimize 2nd order harmonic impact on scheduled DL resources, but if there are other users in the same network, it may not be possible for the network to take any measures to the UE. If the network, however, clearly knows that e.g., Block B has no MSD, the UE might get higher possibility to configured with CA using DL resource in Block B and/or C as shown in Case 2 in Figure 7.1.1-1 since the network can have more flexibility in terms of available resources. Hence, clarifying MSD = 0 dB region gives network more flexibility in terms of resource allocation and UE higher possibility in terms of CA configuration as depicted in case 2 in Figure 7.1.1-1.\nObservation 1: Reporting from where MSD = 0 dB with respect to the center of a victim channel bandwidth in the specification(s) provides a network more flexibility to decide CA configuration as well as frequency resource scheduling, and this would increase possibility for the UE to get CA configured with.\nAnother aspect would be there may be cases, e.g., an operator whose band doesn’t have MSD in a way that the entire channel bandwidth is impacted by an MSD root cause, but rather only an upper part of the channel has MSD as can be seen in Figure 7.1.1-2.\nIn this figure, we see a scenario where a part of the victim channel bandwidth is affected by Multi-Scale Distortion (MSD). MSD is a phenomenon that occurs when a signal is distorted by multiple sources of noise, such as reflections, interference, and reflections. This distortion can lead to a loss of signal quality, making it difficult for the receiver to accurately decode the signal. The figure shows how MSD can affect the performance of a communication system, particularly in scenarios where the signal is subject to multiple sources of interference.\nFigure 7.1.1-2: A case where a part of victim channel bandwidth is affected by MSD\nObservation 2: Reporting MSD = 0 dB region can provide NW with more flexibility in terms of resource scheduling even if an operator has MSD in a limited part of their spectrum.\nIf a UE doesn’t have so-called lower MSD capability being discussed, a network may assume that the upper part of the channel bandwidth is affected by the specified MSD, e.g., 30 dB as the worst case. Even if a UE has the lower MSD capability of e.g., 15 dB, still network may consider that the upper part of the operator’s spectrum has 15 dB MSD as the worst case while actually, the UE may not have MSD in the upper part of the operator’s spectrum at all, i.e., MSD = 0 dB. If somehow this information is reported to the network, the operator’s network resource schedule can be released from a restriction due to MSD at least within MSD = 0 dB region.\nObservation 3: Reporting MSD = 0 dB region can provide NW with more flexibility in terms of resource scheduling even if an operator has MSD in a limited part of their spectrum.\nA question may arise that if a noise due to MSD root cause is actually not flat? Figure 7.1.1-3 shows 2nd order harmonic spectrum, where horizontal axis of -1 to +1 is corresponding to a victim channel bandwidth size. It can be seen that the noise due to 2nd order harmonic sharply decrease as the position becomes close to the channel edges from the center. Hence, it would be likely that a UE with lower MSD capability can have wider MSD zero region than the UE without lower MSD capability.\nThe figure depicts H2 spectral data extracted from [3], illustrating the spectral distribution of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere. The data is presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the spectral characteristics of hydrogen gas.\nFigure 7.1.1-3: H2 spectral extracted from [3]\nHence, even if a UE cannot indicate MSD = 0 dB based on the existing MSD test condition, i.e., in the entire Block A in the top in Figure 7.1.1-4, some part of Block B may have MSD = 0 dB as shown in the middle in Figure 7.1.1-4. Or if a UE has better lower MSD capability, the UE may have MSD = 0 dB region even in inside Block A as shown in the bottom in Figure 7.1.1-4.\nThe figure depicts a relationship between the MSD (Maximum Shortest Path) existence region between a specification and a UE with lower MSD. The relationship is represented by a dotted line, indicating that the lower MSD region exists for the UE with lower MSD. This relationship is crucial for understanding the performance of the network and ensuring that the UE with lower MSD has a better signal quality.\nFigure 7.1.1-4: relationship of MSD existence region between specification and a UE with lower MSD\nObservation 4: Even if a UE with better isolation still may have challenges in achieving MSD = 0 dB based on the existing MSD definition, i.e., Block A in Figure 7.1.1-4, but still the UE can extend MSD = 0 dB region with the same isolation.\nThe information that MSD is 0 dB can be easily treated by a network since as far as a network allocates frequency resources to MSD = 0 dB region in the victim channel bandwidth or adjacent channel bandwidth (if CA is possible) on the side of the victim channel bandwidth that is the farthest from MSD non-zero region, the resources are not affected by aggressor’ uplink power(s) in the UE.\nWith respect to test configurations, this approach does not require something special compared to the existing test configurations expect for the position of victim channel bandwidth. As can be seen in Figure 7.1.1-4, the victim channel bandwidth is placed just adjacent to MSD non-zero region (lower, higher or both sides). Under this condition, UE needs to meet reference sensitivity requirements with no MSD allowance.\nObservation 5: The information on where MSD = 0 dB outside a victim channel bandwidth or even inside the victim channel bandwidth can be treated by a network since MSD in this region is not affected by aggressor’s power(s) in a UE.\nConclusion: Reporting distance between the centre of a defined victim channel bandwidth and a starting point of MSD = 0 dB region can be a possible way to enable network to utilize the reported information and to produce a complementary effect with a case that reported MSD is a non-zero value base on existing test configurations.\n",

                            "text_content": "Based on the survey of the existing MSD specifications, the essential MSD information for a band combination includes: the cause of the MSD (such as harmonic interference, intermodulation, cross-band isolation and etc), the aggressor band(s), the victim band and the amount of MSD in dB.\nThe first three pieces of information are correlated. After reducing the redundancy, the basic MSD information unit can be escribed as a 3-tuple of <MSD value, MSD source, Victim band >.\nThe details of the basic MSD information unit are shown in Table 7.1.2.1-1 below. Note that MSD=0dB indicates no degradation of the receiver sensitivity.\nTable 7.1.2.1-1: Basic MSD Information Unit for a band combination\n\nMore explicitly, as per the latest 3GPP specifications, the MSD sources can be summarised in Table 7.1.2.1-2 below. However, not all the details are to be reported in order to reduce the signalling overhead.\nTable 7.1.2.1-2: MSD sources\n\nIn the following, some examples are given to demonstrate the basic MSD information to be reported by a UE. For different types of MSD sources, the MSD information units to be reported are shown in Table 7.1.2.1-3.\nTable 7.1.2.1-3: Examples of MSD information unit.\n\nNote that for the purpose of MSD improvement, a UE should perform better than the minimum requirement in order to claim the low-MSD capability. For example, if the minimum requirement falls into the interval of MSD≤Thi dB, the UE should be able to support at least one-level lower (e.g., MSD≤Thi-1 dB) in order to report the low-MSD capability. If the actual MSD is larger than the maximum threshold ThM-1 (i.e. out of range), the UE cannot report low-MSD capability for this REFSENS exception case\nWhen a UE supports higher order band combinations, 3GPP specifies ΔTIB,c to allow certain relaxation in Tx power requirements as well as ΔRIB,c for relaxation in Rx sensitivity. Both factors can contribute to the relaxation of the MSD requirements for higher order band combinations. Hence, it’s reasonable to assume that higher order band combinations supported by the UE can inherit the low-MSD capabilities from the fall-back band combinations. As a result, a UE only needs to report low-MSD information for the following types of band combinations as shown in Table 7.1.2.2.1-1.\nTable 7.1.2.2.1-1: Band combinations targeted for reporting low-MSD information\n\nThe Tx power can have significant effect on MSD, especially for that caused by high order IMD. Some examples are shown in Table 7.1.2.2.2-1. For example, regarding CA_n1-n78, the MSD for IMD4 on band n1 deteriorates from 8.0dB to 17.8dB when the Tx power class is upgraded from PC3 to PC2.\nTable 7.1.2.2.2-1: Example MSD requirements for different power classes\n\nOne option is to report the low-MSD information for each power class, or for the power class requested by the network. Effectively, a UE may be requested to report low-MSD information for Tx power at 23dBm, 26dBm or 29dBm (i.e., PC3, PC2 or PC1.5).\nSince each power class corresponds to one particular Tx power level, other options have been proposed to support wider range of Tx power. One option is to report the low-MSD information at a given Tx power level which is requested by the network. The Tx power level for the UE is predicted by the network using path loss estimate before a band combination is configured.\nA UE may support a large number of band combinations across a wide frequency range. However, a practical network uses pre-planned frequency resources and may be interested in a very limited number of band combinations. To reduce the unnecessary signalling overhead, one solution is for the network to specify certain filter conditions when enquiring the UE about its low-MSD information, for example via UE-CapabilityReqeustFilterNR or some similar mechanism. The filter conditions may include: frequency band(s), MSD source (such as IMD order), power class, frequency range, [minimum Lower MSD class] and etc.\nThe query of the UE low-MSD information could happen before a band combination is configured, which could help the network scheduler to optimise its resource allocation according to the reported UE capabilities.\n\nFigure 7.1.2.2.3-1: Illustration of network query on low-MSD information\nWhen RAN4 discusses whether an MSD type like IMD falls into a victim band, RAN4 considers the respective bands’ entire UL and DL frequency range(s). More specifically, when IMD2 for CA_n3A-n77A was studied, fn77 – fn3_UL was calculated assuming that 3300 ≤ fn77 ≤ 4200 MHz, 1710 ≤ fn3_UL ≤ 1785 MHz as UL frequency ranges by the two bands. Accordingly, 1515 ≤ fn77 – fn3_UL ≤ 2490 MHz was derived. Since the frequency range of When RAN4 discusses whether an MSD type like IMD falls into a victim band, RAN4 considers the respective bands’ entire UL and DL frequency range(s). More specifically, when IMD2 for CA_n3A-n77A was studied, fn77 – fn3_UL was calculated assuming that 3300 ≤ fn77 ≤ 4200 MHz, 1710 ≤ fn3_UL ≤ 1785 MHz as UL frequency ranges by two bands. Accordingly, 1515 ≤ fn77 – fn3_UL ≤ 2490 MHz was derived. Since the frequency range overlaps with 1805 ≤ fn3_DL ≤ 1880 MHz, MSD due to IMD2 was defined. Each operator, however, has limited frequency range(s) per operating band. Hence, MSD capabilities associated with MSD types and the associated orders that each operator is interested in may be very limited.\nAssume that an operator has following frequency ranges in n3 and n77, respectively.\nTable 7.1.2.2.3.1-1: Hypothetical frequency ranges for an operator with n3 and n77\nAs defined in 38.101-1, CA_n3A-n77A has multiple MSD due to several MSD types and associated orders, i.e.,\n-\t2nd order harmonic:\n-\tIMD2, IMD4 and IMD7\n-\tHarmonic mixing (UL1/DL2)\nHowever, both IMD7 (5*fn3_UL – 2*fn77) and harmonic mixing (UL1/DL2) don’t hit n3 DL if the calculation is conducted with frequency ranges in Table 7.1.2.2.3.1-1.\nFor 2nd order harmonic and IMD2 and IMD4, according to below Figure 7.1.2.2.3.1-1, only IMD2 hits n3 DL. The frequency region to cause IMD2 is enclosed in red lines. It’s noted that 4100 – 4200 MHz is clearly irrelevant so that the range is omitted from the Figure 7.1.2.2.3.1-1. Hence, in the example with Table 7.1.2.2.3.1-1, MSD values and associated information that a UE needs to report can be reduced to only one (IMD2) from five specified MSDs for CA-n3A-n78 per power class.\nThe figure depicts a rough sketch of the Multiple-Sided-Diversity (MSD) regions for specific frequency ranges, illustrating the distribution of different frequency bands within the spectrum. The figure is a visual representation of the various frequency bands and their corresponding regions, aiding in understanding the spectrum management and allocation in a telecommunications network.\nFigure 7.1.2.2.3.1-1: Rough sketch of MSD regions for specific frequency ranges\nIt has already been agreed that the following MSD thresholds would be defined as following in Table 7.1.2.2.3.2-1:\nTable 7.1.2.2.3.2-1: Actual lower MSD capability signalling index\n\nHowever, there are still views that this granularity is much finer than the network really needs, depending on how to use this capability by the network. For example, the network may simply use one MSD value as a threshold to set different scheduling method for a particular band / BC, and some minor refinements such as a few dB in relative higher region, e.g 18dB -> 15 or 12 dB, may not that meaningful for the network. In this case, even the UE may be qualified for “Lower MSD” in a certain scenario including band/MSD type etc, the network may simply treat this UE the same to a UE which only satisfy minimum MSD requirement, and the signalling of Lower MSD for this particular scenario, might actually not be needed by the network.\nIn another word, depending on how the network would utilize Lower MSD capability class, the lower MSD capable UE for a certain scenario may not be differentiated by the network with UE only satisfy minimum MSD requirements, particularly if the lower MSD capability class is relatively large.\nBased on this condition, a network preferred minimum Lower MSD capability class can be considered as another filter parameter for reducing capability reporting. For example, if network would only consider a maximum allowed 6dB MSD for harmonic interference for n3-n78 harmonics interference for n78, it can consider using the lower MSD capability class as a filtering parameter, and set up the maximum allowed report class as III (index 2), which corresponds to a maximum allowed actual MSD of 6dB. In this case, the UE would report the lower MSD class for this scenario if it can satisfy class I or II or III. If the UE support lower MSD but can only achieve lower MSD class larger than III, the UE would not report the capability since anyway the network would treat it the same to UE only support minimum requirements.\nIn this way, the signalling overhead is saved based on network needs. Though the UE may lose the opportunity to report in the condition, those reporting would anyway be meaningless since network would no use it and explicitly indicted. Furthermore, the whole scheme is well controlled by the network.\n",

The lower MSD capability signalling can be specified as per victim band per BC as a 2-tuple of < MSD mechanism/Aggressor power class and its order, MSD value >. This can save 1-tuple signaling overhead on adaptive network signalling approach comparing to 3-tuple signalling element.\nSome examples are given below to demonstrate the improved MSD reporting information for different types of MSD mechanisms. Table 7.1.3.1-1 referred from [3] for ease of understanding. For one mechanism same aggressor power class, order and victim order, only the worst MSD value after improvement is reported to reduce unnecessary signalling overhead. All the MSD in existing specs are within the scope of lower MSD capability reporting. Further, if new MSD type is identified and specified by RAN4 in the future, the new MSD type can also be considered for indicating lower MSD capability\nUE would not be allowed to report the lower MSD capability if there’s no improvement.\nTable 7.1.3.1-1: Information element examples of improved MSD reporting per BC for non-threshold based approach\nAn alternative expression on the information element of low-MSD reporting can also be a few bits index that pointed to some actual MSD values like the examples below,\nTable 7.1.3.1-2: Information element examples of improved MSD reporting per BC for threshold-based approach\nwhere the reported index can be pointed to an agreed MSD values in Table 7.1.2.2.3.2-1.\n\nAs for how to report the lower MSD capability, several promising options for allowing a UE to signal improved lower MSD performance have been discussed [R4-2306590]. It is also agreed that the MSD mechanisms, orders and values in existing specs shall all be considered as starting point. Considering there are many MSD mechanisms and the order of aggressor could be up to 9 in existing specs, if UE need to signal all improved MSD information, the signaling overhead might be quite large. One approach with signaling the essential information as well as the idea to reduce signaling overhead is network can require UE only to report the top K largest MSD values together with its mechanism indexing and improved MSD values. For example K = 1,\nIf K=1, Network scheduling with reference on top largest value of reported lower MSD\n\nFigure 7.1.3.2-1 Example illustration of network query on low-MSD information, K=1\nIf K=2, Network scheduling with reference on top two largest value of reported lower MSD\n\nFigure 7.1.3.2-2 Example illustration of network query on low-MSD information, K=2\nOr alternative low-MSD signaling expression:\nIf K=1, Network scheduling with reference on top largest value of reported lower MSD\n\nFigure 7.1.3.2-3 Example illustration of network query on low-MSD information, K=1\n\nFigure 7.1.3.2-4 Example illustration of network query on low-MSD information, K=2\nWith such adaptive signalling approach, UE does not need to report all low-MSD information over all supported band combinations. UE may also not need to restore all improved low-MSD points, it only needs to restore top K largest low-MSD information which can save the size of UE memory to smaller one. Network also does not need to restore large amount of low-MSD information that only a few of them are interested band combinations.\n\n",
