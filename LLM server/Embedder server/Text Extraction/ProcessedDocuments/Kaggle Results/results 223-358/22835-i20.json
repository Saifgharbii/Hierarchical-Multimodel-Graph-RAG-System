            "description": "The concept of network slice was discussed from the beginning of the study for 5G system. Network slicing supports the flexible use of network resources so that multiple networks customized to the needs of each set of applications can be provided simultaneously over the network resources while ensuring resource isolation and meeting different SLAs. As more diverse industries start to use the capabilities provided by 5G system and various new services are implemented over the 5G system, the expected service requirements on the 5G system vary. To meet these diverse requirements on the network, the use of network slices will increase further as 5G system deployments are expanded.\nWhen configuring network slices within its network, each network operator may consider various factors, such as required QoS of the applications supported over the network slices, the amount of required network resources to support the applications, the expected geographical and time boundary where the network slice services need to be provided, the usable and deployed network resources at the location where the applications are used, the number of users, the type of devices (e.g., IIoT), etc. After considering these factors, a network operator may provide a network slice for different services to users. Similarly, 3rd parties may be authorized by the network operator to configure their own network slices based on these various criteria, within the bounds of an SLA with the network operator.\nHowever, the provisioning of network slices can be complicated, such as when a UE requests the simultaneous use of multiple network slices where the configurations for those network slices may not be compatible, when network slices are deployed over different network resources due to isolation requirements, when location based applications have specific requirements based on time of the day, or when the available networks support different sets of network slices.\n\n",

UE A1, A3 and A4 are served with Slice M, but UE A2 is in limited service state, due to lack of subscription for slice M. Accordingly, the UE A2 needs to minimize power consumption, e.g., that may be caused due to unnecessary monitoring of other cells.\n-\tUE A1, A2, A3 and A4 move toward GB via GC.\n-\tUE A1 and A3 continues to be serviced with Slice M via Frequency F1 at location GC and GB.\n-\tAt location GC, the UE A2 starts searching cells on Frequency F2. After moving to F2, the UE A2 starts to be served with Slice N. This should occur as soon as possible, because the UE A2 was out of service from location GA to location GC.\n-\tSomewhere between location GC and location GB, the UE A4 moves to Frequency F2 and starts to be served with Slice N, because the UE A4 prefers Slice N to Slice M. To minimize impact on the ongoing services over Slice M, when the UE A4 moves to Frequency F2 can be dependent on many other factors such as active applications on each slice.\nFollowing is potential service flow for UE B1, B2, B3 and B4:\n-\tUE B2 and B4 are on Frequency F2 and served with Slice N. UE B1 and B3 are on Frequency F1 and served with Slice M.\n-\tDue to lack of subscription of network slices provided over F1, the UE B2 may be allowed to minimize power consumption that may be caused, e.g., due to monitoring cells of other frequency F1.\n-\tUE B1, B2, B3 and B4 move toward GA via GC.\n-\tUE B1 and B3 are still serviced with Slice M via Frequency F1 from location GC to location GA.\n-\tAs the UE B2 moves across location GC and moves toward GA, the UE B2 will eventually lose connectivity service because there is no available cell on Frequency F2 and there is no allowed network slice on F1 for the UE B2. In this case, it is desirable for the UE B2 to prepare for the sudden loss of connectivity service. Especially, if the service over slice N is kind of URLLC service that is available only within some specific places such as within a smart factory, the sudden loss of connectivity should be avoided as much as possible. Thus, before the UE crosses the location GC, the UE B2 needs to be given with grace time to prepare for the loss of connectivity, e.g. termination of ongoing applications.\n-\tAs the UE B4 approaches location GC, the UE B4 needs to move to Frequency F1. As the UE B4 moved to Frequency F1, the UE starts to be served with Slice M. Because the UE B4 prefers Slice N to Slice M, the transition from F2 to F1 should not occur unnecessarily too early. On the other hand, if the transition from F2 to F1 occurs after the UE B4 crosses the location GC, there is potential loss of connectivity. Thus, the transition from F2 to F1 should occur before crossing location GC. To minimize impact on the ongoing services over Slice N, it may also be better for the UE to be notified in advance of the transition from F2 to F1. This may enable for the UE to do smooth adjustment of services, such as termination of application or relocation of application to one slice to another.\n\nThe figure depicts a 2-3-1 transition in a 5G network, illustrating the signal path from the base station (gNB) to the user equipment (UE) and the network elements such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.

In case of TDD system, the same frequency is used for both UL and DL. However, in case of FDD system, UL frequency is different from DL frequency. Thus, when radio resource restriction scenario is discussed, care should be taken by considering these variations e.g. frequency used for both DL/ UL, UL only or DL only.\nIn addition, 5G system introduces further flexibility in using frequency band. For example, SUL (Supplementary UL) and SDL (Supplementary DL) are frequency band either defined only in DL or only in UL, as described in annex B of TS 38.300 [4]. This spectrum is used to assist other frequency band, e.g. when base frequency band lacks coverage in either DL or UL, then SUL or SDL can be used to replace the base frequency band. If the SUL and/or SDL band is restricted for a certain network slice, some UEs may experience reduced coverage for the network slice.\nAspects related to carrier aggregation also needs to be considered similarly, because it is used to support QoS requirement by using different combination of DL bands and UL bands, e.g. using three DL bands together with one UL bands to boost downlink data rate. If allowed network slices differs for different frequency bands, then operation of CA also needs to take this into account for a network slice.\nDSS (Dynamic Spectrum Sharing) allows use of same frequency band for both NR and E-UTRA, to cater for various deployment scenario of operators. Thus, same frequency band is split in time to support both E-UTRA and NR. Thus, when there is active restriction for a RAT in using a frequency, consideration should be given in which case it is restricted and any potential impact on quality of service.\n\n\n\n",
