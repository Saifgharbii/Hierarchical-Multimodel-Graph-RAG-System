            "title": "4\tMain Requirements and High-Level Principles",
            "description": "The main new requirements for 3GPP system charging and accounting are:\n-\tto provide charging information for all charges incurred and requiring settlement between the different commercial roles;\n-\tto allow fraud control by the Home Environment and the Serving network;\n-\tto allow cost control by the charged party;\n-\tto provide at the beginning of a chargeable event an indication to the charged party (if involved in the chargeable event) of the charges to be levied for this event;\n-\tto allow itemised billing for all services charged to each subscription, including voice and data calls, and services offered by home environments;\n-\tto enable the Home environment to provide a Prepay Service and to enable the serving network to support that Prepay Service for the Home environment’s subscribers;\n-\tto allow interconnect (inter-operator) charging including mobile/fixed operator to mobile/fixed operator (circuit switched & IP), and mobile/fixed operator to IP network provider; and mobile/fixed operator to I-WLAN operator;\n-\tto allow Network operator to 3rd party supplier (e.g. Value-Added Service Provider) charging;\n-\tto provide details required for Customer Care purposes;\n-\tto support the shared network architecture so that end users can be appropriately charged for their usage of the shared network, and network sharing partners can be allocated their share of the costs of the shared network resources.\nThe high-level principles that will guide the charging requirements are summarised as follows:\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge separately for each type of medium used (e.g. voice, video, data) in a session and for each service used (e.g. voice call, streaming video, file download);\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge for different levels of QoS applied for and/or allocated during a session for each type of medium or service used;\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge each \"leg\" of a session separately. This includes the incoming and outgoing legs and any forwarded/redirected legs. (Note: The legs mentioned here are logical legs, i.e. not necessarily identical to actual signal and traffic flow. Even though tromboning may be avoided by optimal routing, the operator should still be able to charge for the ‘virtual legs’ of the call);\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge unsuccessful calls and sessions (e.g. for billing purposes, to provide the user a full documentation of his call attempts);\n-\tThe user can be charged according to the service used irrespective of the technology used to deliver it. (That is, the charge is not derived from whether 2G or 3G is used);\n-\tThe user can be charged according to the technology used to deliver a service. (That is, different charges can be applied on 2G and 3G);\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge a user according to the network resources used. For example, if a large bandwidth is required to use high quality video, the user could be charged accordingly. This is related to charging by QoS;\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge users flexibly for the use of extra resources (in at least the same network) for all legs of the call. For example, if a video component is added to a voice call the use of extra radio resource at both ends of the call could be paid for by each user in the call or totally by the initiating user;\n-\tIt shall be possible to suppress charging for certain types of connection e.g. when a customer receives tones or network announcements or during sessions such as automated pre-pay top-up;\n-\tIt shall be possible to apply different charging based on tariff information provided by a 3rd party. This tariff information may change during the use of the service (e.g. based on menu selection in a voice response menu). In this case the requirement applies both for customer-charging and interconnect-charging;\n-\tIt shall be possible for the home network to charge its customers while roaming in the same ways as when they are at home. For example, if duration-based charging is used for charging for streaming music in the home network, then it shall be possible to apply the same principle when the user is roaming;\n-\tIt shall be possible for operators to have the option to apply charging mechanisms that are used in GSM/GPRS. For example, for duration of a voice call, for the amount of data transmitted (e.g. for streaming, file download, browsing) and for an event (one-off charge);\n-\tIt shall be possible for a network operator to charge its users for activities while roaming so that the home network will get the capability to raise service charges depending on the roamed to network, e.g. because of inter operator charges for the use of service capabilities within the visited network which will in general depend on the serving network. The ability to supply all the necessary information for all the charging options will depend on the capability of the visited network. For service capabilities which are provided by the home network, however, it is required that the charging information is collected to allow to identify the serving network of the served subscriber;\n-\tIt shall be possible for charging to be applied based on location, presence, push services etc.;\n-\tThe network may provide information to the UE so that the UE is able to notify and indicate to the user the LCZs it is in. This allows the user to decide whether to accept/originate the service depending on the LCZs they are in;\n-\tIt shall be possible to charge using pre-pay, post-pay, advice of charge, 3rd party charging techniques;\n-\tIt shall be possible for the home network to apply different tariffs to national calls and short messages established/sent by their subscribers while roaming in their Home PLMN depending on whether or not the called subscriber’s Home PLMN equals the calling subscriber’s Home PLMN, rather than on the called subscriber’s MSISDN;\nNote:\tThis distinction is necessary only in the case, where the called subscriber's MSISDN may have been ported by Mobile Number Portability.\n-\tFor circuit switched interconnection only a capability is required to collect information regarding user rate and user protocol at the interconnection point so that e.g. the identification of CS video telephony at the interconnection point for inter-network accounting purposes becomes possible.\nThese new requirements and principles will allow users more freedom to obtain service when roaming, whilst providing effective cost and credit control for the Home Environment and User.\n",

                            "text_content": "This section describes the options required for the charging of end users. The network operator could charge users directly (retail charging) or charge a 3rd party service provider (wholesale charging). These requirements can therefore apply to retail and wholesale charging. Note that the word \"session\" is used to describe the connection between a user and either another user or a service. This term is used for IP connections rather than the term \"call\" that is normally used for a connection over conventional (circuit switched) systems.\nThe various ways that users can establish sessions and the main components are described. Also, the required charging options are specified.\nA variety of different connection configurations are possible for IP multi-media independently of the components of the session being used. It should be possible to charge for the following types of sessions with the options identified. These charging options should be applicable to each medium separately. Note that not all the charging options need to be used and that some of the options can be used only if the particular party is using the resources of IMS:\nThe table below lists some example session scenarios and describes some of the possible charging options for each scenario. The table does not list all possible session scenarios nor does it list all possible charging options for the scenarios. Rather, the intent of the table is to emphasize the numerous charging options that shall be supported by an IP Multimedia System due to the complexity of sessions possible. The charging options shall adequately account for all session resources used in order to enable the operators to apply flexible billing policies and to satisfy regional and/or national regulatory policies.\nIn general, any session shall allow for the following charging options:\nTo apply the \"Calling Party Pays\" charging principle;\nA 3rd party to be charged for all or part of the session;\nSplit charging between any of the parties, including 3rd parties;\nSession setup and session resources to have different charging rules. Different rules would be applied for example, in a scenario where A calls an advertising number, say B. B could be a web-based toy advertisement number, for example. In this scenario, A could pay for the initiation fee (session setup), and B could pay for the session resource.\nAny party can add another media to the current session in progress and any of the parties (not necessarily the one(s) being charged for the current session) can be charged for the additional media. For example, A calls B and A is paying for the audio; B adds a wireless video image to the call and pays for that portion. The individual resource set-up and usage should be separately identified. This supports the \"Calling Party Pays\" model;\nDuring an active session, media types can change (e.g. audio changed to data) and shall be charged for appropriately. It is thus necessary to be able to detect a change of media during a session so that different rating may be applied.\nIt should also be noted that during a multi-party session, normally if the charged party drops off the session, all components being charged to that party should drop. But it is foreseeable to support a service option that allows the charged party to continue to be charged even if they drop off the session. The charging rules should support this option.\n\n\nA number of different components can comprise a session. These components may be added or dropped from an ongoing session by any participating party. These components should be individually identifiable for charging purposes.\nGenerally, the party that adds a component should be responsible for the payment for the use of the component. However, it should also be possible to charge all users that need an increase in resource to handle the component. An example is 2 users in an audio session where one of the users upgrades the session to videophone session. Both users could be charged extra for the use of the video component as this requires extra resource at both ends.\nPossible components are:\nVoice\nAudio (real time)\nAudio (streaming)\nVideo (real-time)\nVideo (streaming)\nData (download/upload)\nData interactive e.g. web browsing\nMessaging (SMS text type)\nE-mail\nData stream (unspecified content) This is where the network operator acts as a \"bit-pipe\"\nIt shall be possible to charge for each of these components separately in a session with the options shown in the table below.\nIt shall be possible for operators to be able to charge for individual components of sessions even if there is no identificable service. For example, a proprietary codec may be used to set up an \"end-to-end\" speech session where the network operator acts as a \"bit-pipe\". In this case, it should be possible for the operator to charge for this differentially. This type of component is called \"datastream\" in the table below.\nIt might not be possible to apply some of the charging mechanism and type options described below depending on the capability of the networks used.\n\n\nThe user will also be charged for additional activities while in a session, for example downloaded applications or information. The table below shows some of these requirements and the priority. [This section will need to be further developed.]\n\n\n",

For example, a user may be charged by duration for voice sessions made while roaming but the home network may pay the visited network by volume of data used.

This shall be enabled by interworking via trusted third parties. Each Home Environment shall interwork with one or more serving network operators, with whom they would negotiate a commercial roaming agreement and test the interworking. Any user wishing to use the services of a particular serving network would register with that serving network, that would either directly or indirectly interwork with the home environment. Fraud and cost control mechanisms shall be used to ensure that charges incurred for 3GPP services do not exceed the credit limits set. This can be applied for the user and the other roles involved in commercial dealings. In practice, any serving network shall be capable of operating as a roaming broker.\n\n\nFigure 1: Registration and Roaming Process\n",

A number of alternative routes may be possible, and ideally the system should be capable of determining the lowest cost to the end user.\nTypically, smaller networks will only have a limited number of external connections to other networks or clearing houses, but may not know which one to use for an unknown (new) HE.
