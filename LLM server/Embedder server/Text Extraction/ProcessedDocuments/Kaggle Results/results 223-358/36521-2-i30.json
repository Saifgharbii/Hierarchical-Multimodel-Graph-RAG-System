            "description": "The applicability of each individual test is identified in the tables 4.1-1 or 4.2-1. This is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the test case was written.\nThe applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of Boolean expression that are based on parameters (ICS) included in annex A of the present document.\nSelection criteria of tested bands / CA-Configurations for each applicable test is formally expressed using group theory based on parameters (ICS) included in annex A of the present document.\nAdditional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well\nThe columns in tables 4.1-1 / 4.2-1 have the following meaning:\nClause\nThe clause column indicates the clause number in TS 36.521-1 [1] or respectively TS 36.521-3 [2] that contains the test body.\nTitle\nThe title column describes the name of the test and contains the clause title of the clause in TS 36.521-1 [1] or TS 36.521-3 [2] that contains the test body.\nRelease\nThe release column indicates the earliest release from which each test case is applicable. It may also indicate a range of releases or a single release to which a test case is applicable.\nApplicability - Condition\nThe following notations are used for the applicability column:\nR\trecommended - the test case is recommended to all terminals supporting E-UTRA\nO\toptional - the test case is optional\nN/A\tnot applicable - in the given context, the test case is not recommended.\nCi\tconditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\") depending on the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying an unique conditional status expression which is defined immediately following the table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ... THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\" is used to avoid ambiguities.\nApplicability - Comments\nThis comments column contains a verbal description of the condition included in the applicability column.\nTested Bands / CA-Configurations Selection\nThis column defines a set of bands / CA Configurations the test is to be run for, if the test is applicable. If the set is empty, the test is considered as not applicable.\nThe following notations are used in the tested bands selection column:\nDi\tDerive the set based on Band Selection Criteria Di defined in table 4.1-1b.\nEi\tDerive the set based on CA Configurations Selection Criteria Ei defined in table 4.1-1c.\nTBD\tBand selection not defined at this time, in the meantime test all Bands / CA Configurations\nText\tFor more complex selection criteria, or if the criteria are already specified somewhere else in the spec, text reference to the section is given.\nBranch\nThis column contains indication if the test case may perform differently depending on the UE capabilities.\nNOTE 1:\tTo meet the validation requirements from certification bodies then there is a need to uniquely reference the FDD and TDD branch (i.e. different behaviour within one and the same TC) of common FDD and TDD RF test cases in table 4.1-1. The FDD and TDD branches of common FDD and TDD test cases can be referenced by amending a \"FDD\" or \"TDD\" suffix to the test case clause number. For example for test case 6.2.2 the FDD and TDD branches can be identified by \"6.2.2 FDD\" and \"6.2.2 TDD\".\nNOTE 2:\tTo meet the validation requirements from certification bodies then there is a need to uniquely reference the 2Rx (UE supports 2 Rx antenna ports in the tested band) and 4Rx (UE supports 4 Rx antenna ports in the tested band) branch of common 2Rx and 4Rx RRM test cases in table 4.2-1. The 2Rx and 4Rx branches of common 2Rx and 4Rx test cases can be referenced by amending a \"2Rx\" or \"4Rx\" suffix to the test case clause number. For example for test case 4.2.1 the 2Rx and 4Rx branches can be identified by \"4.2.1_2Rx\" and \"4.2.1_4Rx\". When the branch is “2RX, 4RX” or “xxx_2RX, xxx_4RX”, requirements of 2RX are tested for 2RX capability UE and requirements of 4RX are tested for 4RX capability UE.\nNOTE 3:\tTo meet the validation requirements from certification bodies then there is a need to uniquely reference the PC3 (UE supports Power Class 3 in the tested band) and HPUE (UE supports Power Class 1 or Power Class 2 in the tested band) branch of common PC3 and HPUE test cases in Table 4.1-1. The PC3 and HPUE branches of common PC3 and HPUE test cases can be referenced by amending a \"PC3\" or \"HPUE\" suffix to the test case clause number. For example for test case 6.6.2.1 the PC3 and HPUE branches can be identified by \"6.6.2.11_PC3\" and \"6.6.2.1_HPUE\". When the branch is \"PC3, HPUE\" or \"xxx_PC3, xxx_HPUE\", requirements of PC3 are tested for PC3 capability UE and requirements of HPUE are tested for HPUE capability UE.\nAdditional Information\nThis column contains additional information\n",
