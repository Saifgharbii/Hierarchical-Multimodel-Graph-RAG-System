            "description": "Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a 'one size fits all' system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for a variety of different services, different traffic loads, and different end user communities. Various industry white papers, most notably, the NGMN 5G White Paper [2], describe a multi-faceted 5G system capable of simultaneously supporting multiple combinations of reliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and availability. This technology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio interface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network, such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer to the end points.\nA 5G system also supports new business models such as those for IoT and enterprise managed networks. Drivers for the 5G KPIs include services such as Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control, Augmented Reality (AR), and factory automation. Network flexibility enhancements support self-contained enterprise networks, installed and maintained by network operators while being managed by the enterprise. Enhanced connection modes and evolved security facilitate support of massive IoT, expected to include tens of millions of UEs sending and receiving data over the 5G network.\nFlexible network operations are the mainstay of the 5G system. The capabilities to provide this flexibility include network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility. Other network operations requirements address the necessary control and data plane resource efficiencies, as well as network configurations that optimize service delivery by minimizing routing between end users and application servers. Enhanced charging and security mechanisms handle new types of UEs connecting to the network in different ways. The enhanced flexibility of the 5G system also allows to cater to the needs of various verticals. For example, the 5G system introduces the concept of non-public networks providing exclusive access for a specific set of users and specific purpose(s). Non-public networks can, depending on deployment and (national) regulations, support different subsets of 5G functionality. In this specification 5G network requirements apply to both NPNs and PLMNs, unless specified otherwise. Additionally, there are specific requirements dedicated only to NPNs or PLMNs, which are indicated accordingly. More information can be found in Section 6.25.\nMobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs. These pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility, highly variable data rates, deployment, and coverage. High data rates are driven by the increasing use of data for services such as streaming (e.g. video, music, and user generated content), interactive services (e.g. AR), and IoT. These services come with stringent requirements for user experienced data rates as well as associated requirements for latency to meet service requirements. Additionally, increased coverage in densely populated areas such as sports arenas, urban areas, and transportation hubs has become essential for pedestrians and users in urban vehicles. New KPIs on traffic and connection density enable both the transport of high volumes of data traffic per area (traffic density) and transport of data for a high number of connections (e.g. UE density or connection density). Many UEs are expected to support a variety of services which exchange either a very large (e.g. streaming video) or very small (e.g. data burst) amount of data. The 5G system will handle this variability in a resource efficient manner. All of these cases introduce new deployment requirements for indoor and outdoor, local area connectivity, high user density, wide area connectivity, and UEs travelling at high speeds.\nAnother aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various combinations of latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for positioning. These KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and public safety services. On the commercial side, industrial control, industrial automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those services. Services such as UAV control will require more precise positioning information that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in addition to horizontal coordinates.\nSupport for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) brings many new requirements in addition to those for the enhanced KPIs. The expansion of connected things introduces a need for significant improvements in resource efficiency in all system components (e.g. UEs, IoT devices, radio, access network, core network).\nThe 5G system also aims to enhance its capability to meet KPIs that emerging V2X applications require. For these advanced applications, the requirements, such as data rate, reliability, latency, communication range and speed, are made more stringent.\n",

While support for IoT is provided by EPS, there is room for improvement in efficient resource utilization that can be designed into a 5G system whereas they are not easily retrofitted into an existing system. Some of the underlying principles of the potential service and network operation requirements associated with efficient configuration, deployment, and use of UEs in the 5G network include bulk provisioning, resource efficient access, optimization for UE originated data transfer, and efficiencies based on the reduced needs related to mobility management for stationary UEs and UEs with restricted range of movement.\nAs sensors and monitoring UEs are deployed more extensively, the need to support UEs that send data packages ranging in size from a small status update in a few bits to streaming video increases. A similar need exists for smart phones with widely varying amounts of data. Specifically, to support short data bursts, the network should be able to operate in a mode where there is no need for a lengthy and high overhead signalling procedure before and after small amounts of data are sent. The system will, as a result, avoid both a negative impact to battery life for the UE and wasting signalling resources.\nFor small form factor UEs it will be challenging to have more than 1 antenna due to the inability to get good isolation between multiple antennas. Thus, these UEs need to meet the expected performance in a 5G network with only one antenna.\nCloud applications like cloud robotics perform computation in the network rather than in a UE, which requires the system to have high data rate in the uplink and very low round trip latency. Supposed that high density cloud robotics will be deployed in the future, the 5G system need to optimize the resource efficiency for such scenario.\nAdditional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the various KPIs defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be achieved by optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small data transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane resources utilization include in-network caching and application in a Service Hosting Environment closer to the end user. These optimization efforts contribute to achieving lower latency and higher reliability.\nDiverse mobility management related resource efficiencies are covered in clause 6.2.\nSecurity related resource efficiencies are covered in clause 8.8.\n",

Some of these services share common QoS characteristics such as latency and packet loss rate but can have different priority requirements. For example, UAV control and air traffic control can have stringent latency and reliability requirements but not necessarily the same priority requirements. In addition, voice-based services for MPS and Emergency share common QoS characteristics as applicable for normal public voice communications yet can have different priority requirements. The 5G network will need to support mechanisms that enable the decoupling of the priority of a particular communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as latency and reliability to allow flexibility to support different priority services (that need to be configurable to meet operator needs, consistent with operator policies and corresponding national and regional regulatory policies).\nThe network needs to support flexible means to make priority decisions based on the state of the network (e.g. during disaster events and network congestion) recognizing that the priority needs can change during a crisis. The priority of any service can be different for a user of that service based on operational needs and regional or national regulations. Therefore, the 5G system should allow a flexible means to prioritise and enforce prioritisation among the services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, medical, Public Safety) and among the users of these services. The traffic prioritisation can be enforced by adjusting resource utilization or pre-empting lower priority traffic.\nThe network must offer means to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability, latency, and bandwidth) for a service and the ability to prioritize resources when necessary to meet the service requirements. Existing QoS and policy frameworks handle latency and improve reliability by traffic engineering. In order to support 5G service requirements, it is necessary for the 5G network to offer QoS and policy control for reliable communication with latency required for a service and enable the resource adaptations as necessary.\nThe network needs to allow multiple services to coexist, including multiple priority services (e.g. Emergency, MPS and MCS) and must provide means to prevent a single service from consuming or monopolizing all available network resources, or impacting the QoS (e.g. availability) of other services competing for resources on the same network under specific network conditions. For example, it is necessary to prevent certain services (e.g. citizen-to-authority Emergency) sessions from monopolizing all available resources during events such as disaster, emergency, and DDoS attacks from impacting the availability of other priority services such as MPS and MCS.\nAlso, as 5G network is expected to operate in a heterogeneous environment with multiple access technologies, multiple types of UE, etc., it should support a harmonised QoS and policy framework that applies to multiple accesses.\nFurther, for QoS control in EPS only covers RAN and core network, but for 5G network E2E QoS (e.g. RAN, backhaul, core network, network to network interconnect) is needed to achieve the 5G user experience (e.g. ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth).\n",

Platooning applications can allow the vehicles following to be autonomously driven.\nAdvanced Driving enables semi-automated or fully-automated driving. Longer inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity, thus allowing vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. In addition, each vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in proximity. The benefits of this use case group are safer traveling, collision avoidance, and improved traffic efficiency.\nExtended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, Road Site Units, UEs of pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles can enhance the perception of their environment beyond what their own sensors can detect and have a more holistic view of the local situation.\nRemote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive themselves or a remote vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a case where variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as public transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used.

                            "text_content": "The QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F.\nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation and thus financial losses. To that end, automation devices and applications implement diagnosis and error-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive maintenance features.\nDue to their inherent challenges, wireless communication systems are usually under suspicion in case an error occurs in a distributed automation application. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features for 5G systems are required. The 5G system needs to provide sufficient monitoring information as input for such diagnosis features.\nQoS monitoring can be used for the following activities:\n-\tassessing and assuring the dependability of network operation;\n-\tassessing and assuring the dependability of the communication services;\n-\texcluding particular communication errors;\n-\tidentifying communication errors;\n-\tanalysing the location of an error including the geographic location of the involved network component (UE; front-haul component; core node);\n-\tactivation of application-related countermeasures.\nThis section provides requirements for both functionality and service exposure. In addition, the service exposure requirements on QoS monitoring in 22.101 [6], clause 29.2 apply.\n",

In cases such as guided vehicles (e.g. industry, UAVs) and positioning of objects involved in safety-related functions, availability needs to be very high.\nMission Critical Organizations require mission critical services to have accurate positioning such that first responders can be located at all times during normal and critical operations, indoors as well as outdoors. The level of positioning accuracy (and other KPIs) required is much more stringent than that required by local and regional regulatory requirements for commercial 5G users.\n",

Typically, numerous wireless devices such as microphones, in-ear monitoring systems or cameras are used in these scenarios. In the future, the wireless communication service for such devices are expected to be provided by a 5G system. AV production applications require a high degree of confidence, since they are related to the capturing and transmission of data at the beginning of a production chain. This differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that is consuming that content both live and on recorded media. Furthermore, the transmitted data is often post-processed with filters which could actually amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans. Therefore, these applications call for uncompressed or slightly compressed data, and very low probability of errors. These devices will also be used alongside existing technologies which have a high level of performance and so any new technologies will need to match or improve upon the existing workflows to drive adoption of the technology.\nThe 3GPP system already plays an important role in the distribution of AV media content and services. Release 14 contains substantial enhancements to deliver TV services of various kinds, from linear TV programmes for mass audiences to custom-tailored on-demand services for mobile consumption. However, it is expected that also in the domain of AV content and service production, 3GPP systems will become an important tool for a market sector with steadily growing global revenues. There are several areas in which 3GPP networks can help to produce AV content and services in an efficient and flexible manner.\n",

These synchronization references are generated by Primary reference Time Clocks that typically get the timing reference from GNSS receivers and in order to meet the relevant synchronization requirements also during failure conditions, the synchronization network designs typically include means to address potential degradation of the GNSS signal performance. Some deployment of 5G involve applications that themselves can be sensitive to any degradation of the timing signal. In such cases it is beneficial for the 5G system to be enhanced to act as a backup for loss of their GNSS references. In some implementations, timing resiliency enhancements to the 5G system can work in collaboration with different types of time sources (e.g., atomic clock, time service delivered over the fibre) to provide a robust time synchronization.\n5G as a consumer of time synchronization benefits from timing resiliency which enables the support of many critical services within the 5G network even during the event of a loss or degradation of the primary GNSS reference timing. Additionally, for time critical services (e.g. financial sector or smart grid), the 5G system can operate in collaboration with or as backup to other timing solutions. A base of clock synchronization requirements when 5G is providing a time signal, if it is deployed in conjunction with an IEEE TSN network or if it is providing support for IEEE 1588 related protocols, is included in [21] clause 5.6.\nThe enhancements in this clause build on this to add timing resiliency to the 5G system enabling its use as a replacement or backup for other timing sources.\n",

In mobile communications systems, mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, automotive, robots) are increasingly replacing conventional algorithms (e.g. speech recognition, image recognition, video processing) with AI/ML models to enable applications. The 5G system can at least support three types of AI/ML operations:\n-\tAI/ML operation splitting between AI/ML endpoints\nThe AI/ML operation/model is split into multiple parts according to the current task and environment. The intention is to offload the computation-intensive, energy-intensive parts to network endpoints, whereas leave the privacy-sensitive and delay-sensitive parts at the end device. The device executes the operation/model up to a specific part/layer and then sends the intermediate data to the network endpoint. The network endpoint executes the remaining parts/layers and feeds the inference results back to the device.\n-\tAI/ML model/data distribution and sharing over 5G system\nMulti-functional mobile terminals might need to switch the AI/ML model in response to task and environment variations. The condition of adaptive model selection is that the models to be selected are available for the mobile device. However, given the fact that the AI/ML models are becoming increasingly diverse, and with the limited storage resource in a UE, it can be determined to not pre-load all candidate AI/ML models on-board. Online model distribution (i.e. new model downloading) is needed, in which an AI/ML model can be distributed from a NW endpoint to the devices when they need it to adapt to the changed AI/ML tasks and environments. For this purpose, the model performance at the UE needs to be monitored constantly.\n-\tDistributed/Federated Learning over 5G system\nThe cloud server trains a global model by aggregating local models partially-trained by each end devices. Within each training iteration, a UE performs the training based on the model downloaded from the AI server using the local training data. Then the UE reports the interim training results to the cloud server via 5G UL channels. The server aggregates the interim training results from the UEs and updates the global model. The updated global model is then distributed back to the UEs and the UEs can perform the training for the next iteration.\n",

A common, yet flexible, 5G approach to URLLC will enable the 5G system to meet the specific sets of KPIs needed in a given implementation. To provide clear and precise requirements for specific types of services, the corresponding KPI requirements are included in other specifications as follows:\n-\tCyber-physical control applications in vertical domains can be found in 22.104 [21].\n-\tV2X can be found in 22.186 [9].\n-\tRail communications can be found in 22.289 [23].\nSome scenarios requiring very low latency and very high communication service availability are described below:\n-\tMotion control – Conventional motion control is characterised by high requirements on the communications system regarding latency, reliability, and availability. Systems supporting motion control are usually deployed in geographically limited areas but can also be deployed in wider areas (e.g. city- or country-wide networks), access to them can be limited to authorized users, and they can be isolated from networks or network resources used by other cellular customers.\n-\tDiscrete automation – Discrete automation is characterised by high requirements on the communications system regarding reliability and availability. Systems supporting discrete automation are usually deployed in geographically limited areas, access to them can be limited to authorized users, and they can be isolated from networks or network resources used by other cellular customers.\n-\tProcess automation – Automation for (reactive) flows, e.g. refineries and water distribution networks. Process automation is characterized by high requirements on the communications system regarding communication service availability. Systems supporting process automation are usually deployed in geographically limited areas, access to them is usually limited to authorized users, and it will usually be served by non-public networks.\n-\tAutomation for electricity distribution and smart grid (mainly medium and high voltage). Electricity distribution and smart grid are is characterized by high requirements on the communications service availability and security, as well as low latency in some cases. In contrast to the above use cases, electricity distribution and smart grid are deeply immersed into the public space. Since electricity distribution is an essential infrastructure, it is well served by network slices to provide service isolation and security, or by non-public networks.\n-\tWireless road-side infrastructure backhaul in intelligent transport systems – Automation solutions for the infrastructure supporting street-based traffic. This use case addresses the connection of the road-side infrastructure, e.g. roadside units, with other infrastructure, e.g. a traffic guidance system. As is the case for automation electricity, the nodes are deeply immersed into the public space.\n-\tRemote control – Remote control is characterised by a UE being operated remotely by a human or a computer. For example, Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle with no driver or a remote vehicle located in a dangerous environment.\n-\tRail communications (e.g. railway, rail-bound mass transit) have been using 3GPP based mobile communication (e.g. GSM-R) already for some time, while there is still a driver on-board of the train. The next step of the evolution will be providing fully automated train operation that requires highly reliable communication with moderate latencies but at very high speeds of up to 500 km/h.\nFor specific requirements, refer to the specifications noted above [21], [9], [23].\n",

In the use cases like VR and interactive conversation the latency requirements include the latencies at the application layer (e.g. codecs), which could be specified outside of 3GPP.\nTo support VR environments with low motion-to-photon capabilities, the 5G system shall support:\n-\tmotion-to-photon latency in the range of 7 ms to 15ms while maintaining the required resolution of up to 8k giving user data rate of up to [1Gbit/s] and\n-\tmotion-to-sound delay of [< 20 ms].\nNOTE: \tThe motion-to-photon latency is defined as the latency between the physical movement of a user's head and the updated picture in the VR headset. The motion-to-sound latency is the latency between the physical movement of a user's head and updated sound waves from a head mounted speaker reaching their ears.\nTo support interactive task completion during voice conversation, the 5G system shall support low-delay speech coding for interactive conversational services (100 ms, one-way mouth-to-ear).\nDue to the separate handling of the audio and video component, the 5G system will have to cater for the VR audio-video synchronisation in order to avoid having a negative impact on the user experience (i.e. viewers detecting lack of synchronization). To support VR environments the 5G system shall support audio-video synchronisation thresholds:\n-\tin the range of [125 ms to 5 ms] for audio delayed and\n-\tin the range of [45 ms to 5 ms] for audio advanced.\nWhen it comes to implementation of applications containing AR/VR components, the requirements on the 5G network could depend on architectural choices implementing these services. Note 3 in table 7.1-1 above gives an example on such dependences for a VR application in a 5G system. Table 7.6.1-1 below illustrates additional use cases and provides more corresponding requirements on the 5G system.\n-\tCloud/Edge/Split Rendering – Cloud/Edge/Split Rendering is characterised by the transition and exchange of the rendering data between the rendering server and device.\n-\tGaming or Training Data Exchanging – This use case is characterised by the exchange of the gaming or training service data between two 5G connected AR/VR devices.\n-\tConsume VR content via tethered VR headset – This use case involves a tethered VR headset receiving VR content via a connected UE; this approach alleviates some of the computation complexity required at the VR headset, by allowing some or all decoding functionality to run locally at the connected UE. The requirements in the table below refer to the direct wireless link between the tethered VR headset and the corresponding connected UE.\n\nTable 7.6.1-1 KPI Table for additional high data rate and low latency service\n\n",

These drive a need for secure mechanisms to dynamically establish or refresh credentials and subscriptions. New access technologies, including licensed and unlicensed, 3GPP and non-3GPP, drive a need for access-independent security that is seamlessly available while the IoT device is active. High-end smartphones, UAVs, and factory automation drive a need for protection against theft and fraud. A high level of 5G security is essential for critical communication, e.g. in industrial automation, industrial IoT, and the Smart Grid. Expansion into enterprise, vehicular, medical, and public safety markets drive a need for increased end user privacy protection. 5G security addresses all of these new needs while continuing to provide security consistent with prior 3GPP systems.\n",

Many such manufacturing units have to be supported within close proximity within a factory (e.g. up to 100 in automobile assembly line production).\nIn a closed-loop control application, the controller periodically submits instructions to a set of sensor/actuator devices, which return a response within a so-called cycle time. The messages, which are referred to as telegrams, are typically small (≤ 56 bytes). The cycle time can be as low as 2 ms, setting stringent end-to-end latency constraints on telegram forwarding (≤ 1 ms). Additional constraints on isochronous telegram delivery add tight constraints on the lateness (1 s), and the communication service has also to be highly available (99,9999%).\nMulti-robot cooperation is a case in closed-loop control, where a group of robots collaborate to conduct an action, for example, symmetrical welding of a car body to minimize deformation. This requires isochronous operation between all robots. For multi-robot cooperation, the lateness (1 µs) is to be interpreted as the lateness among the command messages of a control event to the group robots.\nTo meet the stringent requirements of closed-loop factory automation, the following considerations have to be taken:\n-\tLimitation to short-range communications.\n-\tUse of direct device connection between the controller and actuators.\n-\tAllocation of licensed spectrum. Licensed spectrum can further be used as a complement to unlicensed spectrum, e.g. to enhance reliability.\n-\tReservation of dedicated radio interface resources for each link.\n-\tCombination of multiple diversity techniques to approach the high reliability target within stringent end-to-end latency constraints (example: frequency, antenna and various forms of spatial diversity, e.g. via relaying)\n-\tUtilizing OTA time synchronization to satisfy latency-variation constraints for isochronous operation.\nA typical industrial closed-loop motion control application is based on individual control events. Each closed-loop control event consists of a downlink transaction followed by a synchronous uplink transaction, both of which are executed within a cycle time. Control events within a manufacturing unit might need to occur isochronously. Factory automation considers application layer transaction cycles between controller devices and sensor/actuator devices. Each transaction cycle consists of (1) a command sent by the controller to the sensor/actuator (downlink), (2) application-layer processing on the sensor/actuator device, and (3) a subsequent response by the sensor/actuator to the controller (uplink). Cycle time includes the entire transaction from the transmission of a command by the controller to the reception of a response by the controller. It includes all lower layer processes and latencies on the radio interface as well the application-layer processing time on the sensor/actuator.\nThe figure depicts a communication path for isochronous control cycles within factory units, illustrating the step-by-step process of data exchange between the controller and the sensor/actuator. The figure includes a red step (Step 1) where the controller requests data from the sensor/actuator, and a blue step (Step 2) where the sensor/actuator sends measurement information to the controller. This illustrates the sequential nature of communication in the control cycle, with the controller receiving data from the sensor/actuator and then sending information back to the controller.\nFigure D.1.0-1: Communication path for isochronous control cycles within factory units. Step 1 (red): controller requests sensor data (or an actuator to conduct actuation) from the sensor/actuator (S/A). Step 2 (blue): sensor sends measurement information (or acknowledges actuation) to controller.\nFigure D.1.0-1 depicts how communication can occur in factory automation. In this use case, communication is confined to local controller-to-sensor/actuator interaction within each manufacturing unit. Repeaters can provide spatial diversity to enhance reliability.\n",

Discrete automation requires communications for supervisory and open-loop control applications, as well as process monitoring and tracking of operations inside an industrial plant. In these applications, a large number of sensors, which are distributed over the plant, forward measurement data to process controllers on a periodic or event-driven base. Traditionally, wireline field bus technologies have been used to interconnect sensors and control equipment. Due to the sizable extension of a plant (up to10 km2), the large number of sensors, rotary joints, and the high deployment complexity of wired infrastructure, wireless solutions have made inroads into industrial process automation.\nThe related use cases require support of a large number of sensor devices per plant, as well as high communication service availability (99,99%). Furthermore, power consumption is relevant since some sensor devices are battery-powered with a targeted battery lifetime of several years (while providing measurement updates every few seconds). Range also becomes a critical factor due to the low transmit power levels of the sensors, the large size of the plant, and the high-reliability requirements on transport. End-to-end latency requirements typically range between 10 ms and 1 s. User-experienced data rates can be rather low since each transaction typically comprises less than 256 bytes. However, there has been a shift from field busses featuring somewhat modest data rates (~ 2 Mbit/s) to those with higher data rates (~ 10 Mbit/s) due to the increasing number of distributed applications and \"data-hungry\" applications. An example for the latter is the visual control of production processes. For this application, the user experienced data rate is typically around 10 Mbit/s and the transmitted packets are much larger than what was stated earlier.\nExisting wireless technologies for factory automation rely on unlicensed bands. Communication is therefore vulnerable to interference caused by other technologies (e.g. WLAN). With the stringent requirements on transport reliability, such interference is detrimental to proper operation.\nThe use of licensed spectrum could overcome the vulnerability to same-band interference and therefore enable higher reliability. Utilization of licensed spectrum can be confined to those events where high interference bursts in unlicensed bands jeopardizes communication service availability and end-to-end latency constraints. This allows sharing the licensed spectrum between process automation and conventional mobile services.\nMulti-hop topologies can provide range extension and mesh topologies can increase reliability through path redundancy. Clock synchronization will be highly beneficial since it enables more power-efficient sensor operation and mesh forwarding.\nThe corresponding industrial communication solutions are referred to as fieldbuses. The related standard suite is IEC 61158.\nA typical discrete automation application supports downstream and upstream data flows between process controllers and sensors/actuators. The communication consists of individual transactions. The process controller resides in the plant network. This network interconnects via base stations to the wireless (mesh-) network which hosts the sensor/actuator devices. Typically, each transaction uses less than 256 bytes. An example of a controller-initiated transaction service flow is:\n1.\tThe process controller requests sensor data (or an actuator to conduct actuation). The request is forwarded via the plant network and the wireless network to the sensors/actuators.\n2.\tThe sensors/actuators process the request and send a replay in upstream direction to the controller. This reply can contain an acknowledgement or a measurement reading.\nAn example of a sensor/actuator device-initiated transaction service flow:\n1.\tThe sensor sends a measurement reading to the process controller. The request is forwarded via the wireless (mesh) network and the plant network.\n2.\tThe process controller can send an acknowledgement in opposite direction.\nFor both controller- and sensor/actuator-initiated service flows, upstream and downstream transactions can occur asynchronously.\nFigure D.2.0-1 depicts how communication can occur in discrete automation. In this use case, communication runs between process controller and sensor/actuator device via the plant network and the wireless (mesh) network. The wireless (mesh) network can also support access for handheld devices for supervisory control or process monitoring purposes.\nThe figure depicts a communication path for service flows between process controllers and sensor/actuator devices. The left-hand side shows the sensor/actuator (S/A) sending a measurement report autonomously, while the right-hand side shows the controller acknowledging the report. The figure illustrates the step-by-step process of data exchange between the two devices.\nFigure D.2.0-1: Communication path for service flows between process controllers and sensor/actuator devices. Left-hand side: Step 1 (red) – the sensor/actuator (S/A) sends measurement report autonomously, Step 2 (blue) controller acknowledges. Right-hand side: Step 1 (red) - controller requests sensor data (or an actuator to conduct actuation), Step 2 (blue): S/A sends measurement information (or acknowledges actuation) to controller.\n",

In this scenario, the locally deployed staff taps into the same real-time data as provided to the control room.

In figure D.4.1.0-1 we depict a medium-voltage ring together with energy-automation use cases that either are already deployed or are anticipated within the near future.\nThe figure depicts a medium-voltage ring with various components such as AMI, circuit breakers, distribution management system, FISR, HEM, and RMU. The diagram illustrates the functional and topological layout of the system, highlighting the importance of fault isolation and system restoration in the context of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).\nFigure D.4.1.0-1: Functional, topological sketch of a medium-voltage ring. AMI: advanced metering infrastructure; CB: circuit breaker; DMS: distribution management system; FISR: fault isolation and system restoration; HEM: home energy manager; PQ: power quality; RMU: ring main unit.\nThe primary substation and the secondary substations are supervised and controlled by a distribution-management system (DMS). If energy-automation devices in the medium-voltage power line ring need to communicate with each other and /or the DMS, a wireless backhaul network needs to be present (orange \"cloud\" in figure D.4.1.0-1).\nA majority of applications in electricity distribution adhere to the communication standard IEC 60870-5-104. However, its modern \"cousin\" IEC 61850 experiences rapidly increasing popularity. The communication requirements for IEC 61850 applications can be found in EC 61850-90-4. Communication in wide-area networks is described in IEC 61850-90-12.\nUsually, power line ring structures have to be open in order to avoid a power-imbalance in the ring (green dot in figure D.4.1.0 1). Examples for energy-automation that already is implemented in medium-voltage grids (albeit in low numbers) are power-quality measurements and the measurement of secondary-substation parameters (temperature, power load, etc.) [13]. Other use cases are demand response and the control of distributed, renewable energy resources (e.g. photovoltaics).\nA use case that could also be realised in the future is fault isolation and system restoration (FISR). «Element.Notes»FISR automates the management of faults in the distribution grid. It supports the localization of the fault, the isolation of the fault, and the restoration of the power delivery. For this kind of automation, the pertinent sensors and actuators broadcast telegrams about their states (e.g., \"emergency closer idle\") and about actions (e.g., \"activating closer\") into the backhaul network. This information is used by the ring main units (RMUs) as input for their decision algorithms. We illustrate this use of automation telegrams for an automated FISR event in figure D.4.1.0-1. Let us assume the distribution lines are cut at the location indicated by the bolt of lightning in the figure. In that case, the RMUs between the bolt and the green load switch (open) will be without power. The RMUs next to the \"bolt\" automatically open their load switches after having sensed the loss of electric connectivity between them. They both broadcast these actions into the backhaul network. Typically, these telegrams are repeated many times while the time between adjacent telegrams increases exponentially. This communication patterns leads to sudden, distributed surges in the consumed communication bandwidth. After the RMUs next to the \"bolt\" have opened their switch, the RMU that so far has kept the power line ring open (green dot in figure D.4.1.0-1) closes the load switch. This event too is broadcasted into the backhaul network. The typical maximum end-to-end latency for this kind of broadcast is 25 ms with a peak experienced data rate of 10 Mbit/s. Note that the distribution system typically subscribes to telegrams from all RMUs in order to keep abreast with the happenings in the distribution grid.\nAutomatic fault handling in the distribution grid shortens outage time and offloads the operators in the distribution control centre for more complicated situations. Therefore, automated FISR can help to improve performance indexes like System Average Interruption Duration Index and System Average Interruption Frequency Index.\nAutomation telegrams are typically distributed via domain multicast. As explained above, the related communication pattern can be \"bursty\", i.e. only few automation telegrams are sent when the distribution network operates nominally (~ 1 kbit/s), but, for instance, a disruption in the power line triggers a short-lived avalanche of telegrams from related applications in the ring (≥ 1 Mbit/s).\nService coverage is only required along the medium-voltage line. In Europe, the line often forms a loop (see figure D.4.1.0-1), while deployments in other countries, e.g. the USA, tend to extend linearly over distances up to ~ 100 km. The vertical dimension of the poles in a medium voltages line is typically less than 40 m. Especially in urban areas, the number of ring main units can be rather large (> 10 km-2), and the number of connections to each ring main unit is expected to increase swiftly once economical, suitable wireless connectivity becomes available. We predict connection densities of up to 1.000 km-2.\nDue to its central role in virtually every country on earth, electricity distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessments for, e.g. deployments in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite [14]. Technical implementations are described in standard suites such as IEC 62351.\n",

The present control actions are not designed for a fast-developing disturbance and can be too slow. Local protection systems are not able to consider the overall system, which can be affected by the disturbance. Wide area disturbance protection is a concept of using system-wide information and sending selected local information to a remote location to counteract propagation of the major disturbances in the power system.\" [15]. Protection actions include, \"among others, changes in demand (e.g. load shedding), changes in generation or system configuration to maintain system stability or integrity and specific actions to maintain or restore acceptable voltage levels.\" [16]. One specific application is phasor measurement for the stabilisation of the alternating-current phase in a transport network. For this, the voltage phase is measured locally and sent to a remote-control centre. There, this information is processed, and automated actions are triggered. One action can be the submission of telegrams to power plants, instructing them to either accelerate or deaccelerate their power generators in order to keep the voltage phase in the transport network stable. A comprehensive overview of this topic can be found elsewhere in the literature [17].\nThis kind of automation requires very low end-to-end latencies (5 ms) [16] and―due to its critical importance for the operation of society―a very high communication service availability (99,9999%).\nAs is the case for medium-voltage distribution networks (see Annex D.4.1), connectivity in high-voltage automation has to be provided mainly along the power line. The distances to be covered can be substantial (hundreds of kilometres in rural settings), while shorter links are prevalent in metropolitan areas. The number of connections in wide-area power system protection is rather low; but―due to the sliver-shaped service area―the connection density can be rather high (1000 km-2).\nDue to its central role in virtually every country on earth, electricity distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessments for, e.g. deployments in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite [14]. Technical implementations are described in standard suites such as IEC 62351.\n",

Over recent years, the emphasis in intelligent vehicle research has turned to co-operative systems, in which the traffic participants (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.) communicate with each other and/or with the infrastructure.\nCooperative ITS is the term used to describe technology that allows vehicles to become connected to each other, and to the infrastructure and other parts of the transport network. In addition to what drivers can immediately see around them, and what vehicle sensors can detect, all parts of the transport system will increasingly be able to share information to improve decision making. Thus, this technology can improve road safety through avoiding collisions, but also assist in reducing congestion and improving traffic flows, and reduce environmental impacts. Once the basic technology is in place as a platform, an array of applications can be developed.\nCooperative ITS can greatly increase the quality and reliability of information available about vehicles, their location and the road environment. In the future, cars will know the location of road works and the switching phases of traffic lights ahead, and they will be able to react accordingly. This will make for safer and more convenient travel and faster arrival at the destination. On-board driver assistance, coupled with two-way communication between vehicles and between vehicles and road infrastructure, can help drivers to better control their vehicle and hence have positive effects in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. An important role in this plays the so-called road side units (RSUs). Vehicles can also function as sensors reporting weather and road conditions including incidents. In this way, cars can be used as information sources for high-quality information services.\nRSUs are connected to the traffic control centre for management and control purposes. They broadcast, e.g., traffic light information (RSU  vehicle) and traffic information from the traffic-control centre (TCC) via the RSU to the vehicles (TCC  RSU  vehicle). RSUs also collect vehicle probe data for the traffic control centre (vehicle  RSU  TCC). For reliable distribution of data, low-latency and high-capacity connections between RSUs (e.g. traffic lights, traffic signs, etc.) and the TCC are required. This type of application comes with rather tight end-to-end latency requirements for the communication service between RSU and TCC (10 ms), since relayed data needs to be processed in the TCC and, if needed, the results are forwarded to neighbouring RSUs. Also, the availability of the communication service has to be very high (99,9999%) in order to compete with existing wired technology and in order to justify the costly deployment and maintenance of RSUs. Furthermore, due to considerably large aggregation areas (see clause D.5.1), considerable amounts of data need to be backhauled to the TCC (up to 10 Mbit/s per RSU).\n",

One reason is that it depends on the placement of the base station relative to the RSUs. Also, the RSUs can, in principle, act as relay nodes for each other.

The connection density can be quite high in case data is relayed between RSUs, i.e. along the road (1000 km-2).\n",

For background information on assurance see [19] and appendix A.3 in [20].\nAssurance consists of four major steps (see Figure F.1-1 and [18]):\n\nCustomer's QoS requirements\nThese state the level of quality required by the customer of a service. This information is divulged to the provider.\nService provider's offerings of QoS (or planned/targeted QoS)\nThis is a statement of the level of quality expected to be offered to the customer by the service provider.\n\nQoS achieved/delivered\nThis is the level of quality achieved and delivered to the customer. Monitoring information is divulged to the customer.\n\nCustomer rating of QoS\nThe customer can compare the QoS achieved by the provider with the QoS requirements (see above) and its own experience of the QoS. This is a crucial step for establishing assurance about the fulfillment of the customer's requirements.\n\nThe figure depicts a QoS monitoring system, illustrating the use of QoS information to ensure network performance. The system includes a set of QoS indicators, such as packet loss, jitter, and delay, which are used to evaluate the quality of service (QoS) of the network. The system's design is based on the principles of Quality of Service (QoS) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), enabling efficient network management and optimization.\nFigure F.1-1: QoS assurance by use of QoS monitoring information\nNOTE: This Figure is based on the trust model in reference [18].\nThe start time and the duration of the QoS monitoring is specified in the parameter observation time interval, which is exchanged between the customer, for instance an application consuming a communication service, and the provider (for instance a private 5G network providing a communication service). The observation time interval is the time interval during which a series of measurements is conducted. In the context of QoS monitoring, these are the measurements necessary for assessing the QoS of communication services, for instance the measurement of end-to-end latencies.\nExamples of parameters to be monitored by the provider are given in annex C in reference [36].\n",
