                    "text_content": "Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS) is a point-to-multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a single source entity to multiple recipients, either to all users in a Broadcast service area, or to users in a multicast group as defined in TS 22.146 [2]. The corresponding types of MBS session are:\n-\tBroadcast MBS session\n-\tMulticast MBS session.\nThe MBS architecture defined in clause 5 follows the 5G System architectural principles as defined in TS 23.501 [5], enabling distribution of the MBS data from the 5GS ingress to NG-RAN node(s) and then to the UE. The MBS architecture provides:\n-\tEfficient usage of RAN and CN resources, with an emphasis on radio interface efficiency;\n-\tEfficient transport for a variety of multicast and broadcast services.\nMulticast/Broadcast Service for roaming is not supported in this release.\nInteraction between Multicast/Broadcast Service and support of deployments topologies with specific SMF Service Areas is not specified in this Release.\nNOTE 1:\tFor broadcast service over multiple MB-SMF Service Areas, mechanism of location dependent broadcast MBS Sessions is assumed to be applied.\nThe collection and reporting of MBS specific charging information are not specified in this Release.\nThe MBS also provides functionalities such as local MBS service and location dependent MBS service, authorization of multicast MBS and QoS differentiation. Refer to clause 6 for more details.\nMBS traffic is delivered from a single data source (e.g. Application Service Provider) to multiple UEs. Depending on many factors, there are several delivery methods which may be used to deliver the MBS traffic in the 5GS.\nNOTE 2:\tFor clarity, delivery methods are not referred to as unicast/multicast/broadcast but as described below. The term \"unicast delivery\" refers to a mechanism by which application data and signalling between the UE and the application server are delivered using PDU Session within the 3GPP network and using individual UE and application server addresses (e.g. IP addresses) between the 3GPP network and the application server. It is not equivalent to 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method defined in this clause.\nBetween 5GC and NG-RAN, there are two possible delivery methods to transmit the MBS data:\n-\t5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method: This method is only applied for multicast MBS sessions. 5GC receives a single copy of MBS data packets and delivers separate copies of those MBS data packets to individual UEs via per-UE PDU sessions, hence for each such UE one PDU session is required to be associated with a Multicast MBS session.\n-\t5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method: This method is applied for both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions. 5GC receives a single copy of MBS data packets and delivers a single copy of those MBS packets to an NG-RAN node, which then delivers the packets to one or multiple UEs.\nThe 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method is required in all MBS deployments. The 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method is required to enable mobility when there is an NG-RAN deployment with non-homogeneous support of MBS.\nFor the Multicast MBS session, a single copy of MBS data packets received by the CN may be delivered via 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method for some UE(s) and via 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method for other UEs.\nBetween the NG-RAN and the UE, two delivery methods are available for the transmission of MBS data packets over radio interface:\n-\tPoint-to-Point (PTP) delivery method:  NG-RAN delivers separate copies of MBS data packets over radio interface to individual UE(s).\n-\tPoint-to-Multipoint (PTM) delivery method: NG-RAN delivers a single copy of MBS data packets over radio interface to multiple UEs.\nNG-RAN may use a combination of PTP/PTM to deliver an MBS data packets to UEs.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PTP and PTM delivery methods are defined in RAN WGs.\nAs depicted in the following figure, 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method (with PTP or PTM delivery) and 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method may be used at the same time for a multicast MBS session.\nThe figure depicts various delivery methods used in the telecommunications industry, including fiber-optic, copper, and satellite. It highlights the importance of redundancy and failover in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 4.1-1: Delivery methods\nFor MBS broadcast communication, only 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method with PTM delivery is applicable.\nFor MBS multicast communication, if the NG-RAN node supports MBS, the network shall use the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method for MBS data transmission.\nNOTE 4:\tThe exception is when the UE moves between NG-RAN node not supporting MBS (with 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method) and NG-RAN node supporting MBS, there is temporary co-existence between 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method and 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method. Refer to clause 6.3 for details.\nFor MBS multicast communication, the switching between 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method and 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method is supported. The UE mobility between RAN nodes both supporting MBS, and between a RAN node supporting MBS and a RAN node not supporting MBS is supported, for details see clause 6.3.\nFor MBS multicast communication, the switching between PTP and PTM delivery methods for 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery shall be supported. NG-RAN is the decision point for switching between PTP and PTM delivery methods.\n",

The figure also includes a legend to explain the different colors and symbols used in the flow chart, which helps to understand the process more easily. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the data provisioning process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 4.2.1-1: Phases of Multicast data provisioning example\nThe following phases are performed for a specific UE:\n-\tUE Session Join: UE Session Join is the process by which a UE joins an MBS Session, i.e. the UE indicates to 5GC that such UE wants to receive Multicast data identified by a specific MBS Session ID.\n-\tUE Session Leave: UE Session Leave is the process by which a UE leaves a MBS Session, i.e. the UE no longer wants to receive Multicast data identified by a specific MBS Session ID.\nThe following phases are performed for a specific service:\n-\tMBS Session Creation: It is the phase that the information of Multicast MBS session is created as described in clause 4.3. This step is optional.\n-\tService announcement: Service announcement is used to distribute information toward UEs about the service required for service reception (e.g. IP multicast address(es)) and possibly other service related parameters (e.g. service start time). This step is optional.\n-\tSession Establishment: It is the phase that Multicast MBS session is established as described in clause 4.3.\n-\tNo data receiving: It is the phase when no multicast data is received by 5GC. This step is optional.\n-\tData transfer: It is the phase when Multicast data are transferred to the UEs.\n-\tSession Release: It is the phase that the resources for Multicast MBS session is released as described in clause 4.3.\n-\tSession Deletion: It is the phase that Multicast MBS session is deleted as described in clause 4.3.\nNOTE:\tAfter session establishment, Multicast MBS session state could be switched between Active and Inactive several times, triggered by AF or User Plane event, see clause 7.2.5. 5GC further updates Multicast MBS session state towards NG-RAN nodes after Session Establishment.\nThe phase of Multicast data provisioning is illustrated with the following example of timeline:\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a multicast service timeline, illustrating the various stages of a multicast service. It includes the sender, the multicast group, the receiver, and the multicast group's members. The timeline is divided into two main sections: the sender and the receiver. The sender is depicted as a single point, while the receiver is shown as a series of points connected by lines. The timeline is color-coded to indicate the status of each stage, with green representing the sender, yellow representing the receiver, and red representing the failed stage. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the multicast service's flow, making it easier to understand the process and identify potential issues.\nFigure 4.2.1-2: Multicast service timeline example\n",

MBS session creation can occur in several steps (e.g. TMGI allocation, provisioning information about MBS session, request to activate the MBS session). The last step of the MBS session creation triggers resource establishment for transmitting the DL Broadcast data between 5GC and NG-RAN.\nNOTE:\tFor broadcast communication, after MBS Session Creation and Session Establishment, the established resources are not only between 5GC and NG-RAN, but also between the AF to 5GC.\n-\tService announcement: Service announcement is used to distribute information towards UEs about the service required for service reception (e.g. IP multicast address(es)) and possibly other service related parameters (e.g. service start time). This step can occur in parallel or after the MBS session configuration. However, TMGI allocation is required before. The information of the service announcement, is defined in clause 6.11.\n-\tData transfer: It is the phase when broadcast data are transferred in the air interface.\n-\tSession Release and Deletion: It is the point at which there will be no more need to transmit Broadcast data.

Only resources at MB-SMF, NEF and MB-UPF are reserved and no multicast data are transmitted. A TMGI can be allocated for the Multicast MBS session. UEs may be allowed to join (subject to authorization check and configuration), but the first accepted UE join request will trigger the Multicast MBS session establishment towards the NG-RAN and the UE, see clause 7.2.1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SMF is not involved in the Multicast MBS session while the Multicast MBS session is in configured state.\nNOTE 2:\tThere may be several interim states in the configured state, e.g. TMGI requested, or information about the Multicast MBS session provided, but these interim states will not be specified in this release.\n-\tActive state: Multicast MBS session is established and MBS data can be transmitted to the UEs that have joined the Multicast MBS session. Radio resources for the Multicast MBS session are established. To receive multicast MBS session data, UEs that joined the Multicast MBS session shall be in CM-CONNECTED state for receiving data of the Multicast MBS session.

Radio resources for the Multicast MBS session are released, and the UEs that joined the Multicast MBS session may be in CM-CONNECTED or CM-IDLE state. UEs are allowed to join the Multicast MBS session (subject to authorization check).\nThe following procedures are defined which result in transition of the Multicast MBS session state:\nMulticast Session Creation: The AF provides information about the Multicast MBS session and optionally requests the allocation of a TMGI, see clause 7.1.1.2 and 7.1.1.3. Alternatively, the information about the Multicast MBS session can be pre-configured in the network. The creation may indicate whether the Multicast MBS session may be established in active or inactive state and when a Multicast MBS session can become active. The AF may perform creation in several steps, e.g. to first request TMGI and then provide full information about the Multicast MBS session and allow it to be established, or to update the information whether the Multicast MBS session is to be in Active or Inactive state after establishment. Multicast MBS session state transitions from \"Start (NULL)\" to Configured state.\nNOTE 4:\tA Multicast MBS session can also be created by the operator via OAM configuration or be established without prior creation.\n-\tMulticast Session Establishment: When the join request of the first UE for the Multicast MBS session is accepted, the Multicast MBS session is established towards the NG-RAN node and the UE, see clause 7.2.1. Multicast session state transitions from \"Start (NULL)\" or Configured state to either Inactive or Active state.\n-\tMulticast Session Activation: See clause 7.2.5.2, Triggered by the 5GC, the radio resources for the Multicast MBS session are established and Multicast MBS session data starts to be transmitted to the UE. UEs in CM-IDLE state and CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state that joined the Multicast MBS session are notified. Activation can be triggered by AF request or data notification from the MB-UPF. Multicast session state transitions from Inactive state to Active state.\nNOTE 5:\tThe AF could not be aware, and the NEF will not be aware, whether a session is in created or established state. An AF may therefore update the session state to request the activation of a session prior to the establishment of the session, and this will determine that the session is subsequently established in Active state when the first UE joins, but will not trigger the Multicast Session Activation state transition.\n-\tMulticast Session Deactivation: See clause 7.2.5.3. Triggered by the 5GC, the radio resources for the Multicast MBS session are released and Multicast MBS session data stops to be transmitted to the UE. Deactivation can be triggered by AF request or no reception of multicast data by the MB-UPF. Multicast session state transitions from Active to Inactive state.\n-\tMulticast Session Release: Triggered by the last UE leaving the Multicast MBS session (see clause 7.2.2.2), or Multicast Session Deletion procedure (7.1.1.4 or 7.1.1.5), the resources for the Multicast MBS session are released in both 5GC nodes and RAN nodes, see clause 7.2.2. Multicast session state transitions from Active or Inactive state to Configured.\n-\tMulticast Session Deletion: All information about the Multicast MBS session is removed from the 5GC, and the TMGI for the Multicast MBS session (if allocated during Multicast Session Configuration) is deallocated, see clause 7.1.1.4 or 7.1.1.5. The deletion may be triggered by an AF request. Multicast session state transitions from Configured, Active or Inactive state to \"End (NULL)\".\nThe figure depicts the various session states and state transitions in a multicast session, illustrating the flow of information and the steps taken to ensure a successful communication.\nFigure 4.3-1: Multicast session states and state transitions\nThe figure depicts the state transitions and session states in MB-SMF, a multicast session management protocol.

The location dependent MBS service enables distribution of different content data to different MBS service areas. The same MBS Session ID is used but a different Area Session ID is used for each MBS service area. The Area Session ID is used, in combination with MBS Session ID, to uniquely identify the service area specific part of the content data of the MBS service within 5GS. The network supports the location dependent content distribution for the location dependent MBS services, while UEs are only aware of the MBS Session ID (i.e. UEs are not required to be aware of the Area Session IDs). When UE moves to a new MBS service area, content data from the new MBS service area shall be delivered to the UE, and the network ceases to deliver the content data from the old MBS service areas to the UE. For multicast MBS service, UEs outside all MBS service areas of the location dependent MBS session are not allowed to join the MBS service. When UE moves out of an MBS service area and there is no other MBS service area for the MBS session, the network ceases to deliver the content data to the UE. Depending on policy, for the multicast MBS service the network may remove UEs outside all MBS service areas of the location dependent MBS Session from the multicast MBS Session Context after a grace period The SMF may subscribe at the AMF to notifications about UE moving in or out of all MBS service areas of the location dependent MBS session.\nFor multicast communication towards an NG-RAN supporting MBS, the NG-RAN node handles mobility of UEs within the MBS session between MBS service areas served by the same NG-RAN without interaction with SMF.\nFor multicast communication, location dependent MBS services may be supported via 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery towards RAN nodes not supporting MBS. If the SMF determines that the UE is in another MBS service area of the Multicast MBS session, the SMF configures the UPF to send multicast data relating to the new MBS service area towards the UE.\nInformation about different MBS service areas for a location dependent MBS service may be provided by one or several AFs or may be configured. The MBS Service Information provided is specified in clause 6.14. Different ingress points for location dependent points for the MBS session are supported for different MBS service area dependent content of the MBS session; different MB-UPF may be assigned for different MBS service areas within the same MB-SMF Service Area for an MBS session.\nFor broadcast communication, if MBS service areas covering different MB-SMF Service Areas are required, different MB-SMFs should be assigned for different MB-SMF service areas for an MBS session, and in this case the MB-SMF involved in the MBS Session should be able to accept TMGI value allocated by other MB-SMF(s).\nThe Area Session ID is allocated by MB-SMF in MBS Session creation procedure. MB-SMF allocates Area Session ID for each MBS services area which is unique within the MBS session.

The MB-UPF receives only one copy of MBS data packets from AF or MBSTF.\nThe user plane between MB-UPF and AF, may use either multicast transport or a unicast tunnel for the MBS session (depending on application and capabilities of control interface). If the transport network does not support multicast transport, the user plane uses a unicast tunnel for the MBS Session. The user plane between MBSTF and AF may use a unicast tunnel, multicast transport or other means (e.g. HTTP download from external CDN). The user plane between MBSTF and MB-UPF uses a unicast tunnel for the MBS session. If a unicast tunnel is used for the MBS Session between MB-UPF and AF or MBSTF, after receiving the downlink MBS data, the MB-UPF forwards the downlink MBS data without the received outer IP header and tunnel header information.\nNOTE 1:\tFor location dependent MBS Session, the user plane towards the MB-UPF can only use unicast tunnel and content to be delivered to different areas are sent to MB-UPF via different tunnels.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the user plane towards the MB-UPF uses a unicast tunnel, all the service data flows for the MBS Session or for an Area Session for a location-dependent MBS session are sent in the same tunnel.\nThe user plane from the MB-UPF to NG-RAN(s) (for 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery) and the user plane from the MB-UPF to UPFs (for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery) may use multicast transport via a common GTP-U tunnel per MBS session, or use unicast transport via separate GTP-U tunnels at NG-RAN or at UPF per MBS session in the following way\n-\tFor 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery (i.e. MB-UPF delivers user plane data to NG-RAN supporting MBS), if the transport network supports IP multicast, the NG-RAN node uses multicast transport via a common GTP-U tunnel per MBS session, otherwise unicast transport via separate GTP-U tunnel per MBS session per NG-RAN node is used.\n-\tFor 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery (i.e. MB-UPF delivers user plane data to UPF), if the transport network supports IP multicast and the UPF supports reception of multicast data over N19mb, UPF use multicast transport via a common GTP-U tunnel per MBS session, otherwise unicast transport via separate GTP-U tunnel per MBS session per UPF is used.\nIf the user plane uses unicast transport, the transport layer destination is the IP address of the NG-RAN or UPF, each NG-RAN or UPF allocates the tunnel separately and multiple GTP-U tunnels are used for the MBS Session. If the user plane uses multicast transport, a common GTP-U tunnel is used for both RAN and UPF nodes. The GTP-U tunnel is identified by a common tunnel ID and an IP multicast address as the transport layer destination, both assigned by 5GC.\nThe above is depicted in Figure 6.7-1. There could be more than one NG-RANs or UPFs that are involved in the MBS traffic delivery.\nFigure 6.7 -1 depicts a schematic illustrating the user plane data transmission in a 5G network. The figure shows the various components involved in the transmission process, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the network slicing. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of SDN principles for network management.\nFigure 6.7-1: Schematic showing user plane data transmission\nThe MB-SMF instructs the MB-UPF to receive packets related to an MBS session.\nMB-UPF transmits the MBS data with the sequence number for each MBS QoS Flow as defined in TS 29.281 [23].\nFor shared delivery, if unicast transport over N3mb applies, the MB-SMF instructs MB-UPF to replicate the received MBS packets and forward them towards multiple RAN nodes via separate GTP tunnel. For shared delivery, if multicast transport over N3mb applies, the MB-SMF instructs the MB-UPF to replicate the received MBS data and forwards the data via a single GTP tunnel.\nFor individual delivery, the MBS data received by the MB-UPF is replicated towards the UPF(s) where individual delivery is performed in the following way:\n-\tThe MB-SMF configures the MB-UPF to receive packets related to an MBS session, to replicate those packets and forward them towards multiple UPFs via GTP tunnels if unicast transport over N19mb is applied, or via a single GTP tunnel if multicast transport over N19mb is applied.\n-\tThe SMF(s) instructs the UPF to receive packets related to a Multicast MBS session from an MB-UPF over N19mb, to replicate those packets and to forward them in multiple PDU sessions.\nFor the MB-SMF and MB-UPF, packet detection, replication and forwarding for an MBS session is realized by using for each MBS session one PDR that detects the incoming MBS packets and points to one FAR that describes the forwarding of the data towards multiple destinations (UPFs or RAN nodes):\n-\tA PFCP session is created when the MBS Session is started, regardless of multicast or unicast transport over N3mb and N19mb.\n-\tFor Multicast transport over N3mb and N19mb, the destination in the FAR contains the MB-UPF IP Multicast Distribution Info.\n-\tFor unicast transport over N3mb and N19mb, the FAR in the PFCP session may contain multiple destinations represented by the NG-RAN N3mb Tunnel Info and UPF N19mb Tunnel Info (if applicable).\nFor the SMF and the UPF (for 5GC individual delivery), packet detection, replication and forwarding for an MBS session is realized by PDR and FAR of the PDU session in which the UE has joined the MBS session:\n-\tThe SMF instructs the UPF to associate the PFCP session of the PDU session with an MBS session.\n-\tA new PDR with Source Interface \"Core\" is used to detect MBS data from N19mb.\nNOTE 3:\tThis PDR is also containing the MBS Session ID to enable a single detection of the incoming MBS data for multiple PDU sessions at the UPF.\n-\tFor unicast transport over N19mb, the SMF requests UPF to allocate N19mb Tunnel Info if not allocated.\n-\tFor multicast transport over N19mb, the SMF includes the low layer source specific multicast address information and C-TEID to UPF.\n-\tIf the SMF wants to maintain the MBS data reception over N19mb but suspends the delivery of the data to the UE's PDU session, the Action of FAR set to \"drop\" (e.g. when the UE is switching from 5GC Individual delivery to 5GC Shared delivery due to the UE moving from MBS non-supporting NG-RAN to MBS supporting NG-RAN). Otherwise the SMF remove the related PDR and FAR.\nSee TS 29.244 [17] for the details of user plane handling.\n",

The MB-SMF provides the security context in the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe response message and in the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify request message.\n-\tIf the UE is authorized to join the Multicast MBS session, the SMF shall provide the multicast session security context to the UE in N1 SM container if it received the multicast session security context from the MB-SMF.\n-\tWhen the MSK needs to be updated, MBSF shall send the updated multicast session security context to the MB-SMF, and then the MB-SMF shall trigger the session update as specified in clause 7.2.6 to provide the updated multicast session security context to the UEs in the related MBS session. The updated multicast session security context shall contain an updated MSK and may contain an updated MTK in addition.\nNOTE 1:\tIf no MSK but only the MTK is to be updated, the session update described in the previous bullet is not triggered and the MTK is updated as defined in TS 33.501 [20].\nNOTE 2:\tInteraction between MBSF and MBSTF will be defined in TS 33.501 [20] and TS 26.502 [18].\nNOTE 3:\tThe additions to the user plane procedure to support the security function for multicast and broadcast can be used as defined in TS 33.501 [20].\n",

For the location dependent MBS session, the existing MBS session identifiers are used to identify multiple broadcast MBS Sessions via different CNs delivering the same content. The MB-SMF should be able to accept MBS session creation with TMGIs without prior allocation of those TMGIs.\nFor a location dependent MBS session (see Clauses 6.2.3), the AF(s) that create the location dependent MBS sessions towards the participating PLMNs shall supply MBS Service Areas mapped to the same shared radio cells (but that may also be mapped to different non-shared radio cells).\nFor location dependent broadcast services, the shared NG-RAN is required to determine that the multiple broadcast MBS Sessions via different CNs deliver the same content for location-dependent MBS session with additionally considering the MBS Service Area.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the association of MBS session identifiers is configured in NG-RAN, there is no requirement on the AF to provide an Associated Session ID.\nNOTE 3:\tThe AFs are configured with TMGIs that are mapped to each other in NG-RAN, and the MB-SMF includes those TMGIs in the NF profile it registers at the NRF, and does not allocate those TMGIs to other MBS services.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to NG-RAN implementation whether an NG-RAN node requests to receive multiple copies of MBS data from the core networks of different operators or only a single copy of MBS data.\nIllustrated in Figure 6.18-1 is an example that the AF creates broadcast MBS Sessions via 5GC Operators A, B and C respectively to deliver the same content and N3mb unicast transport is used from 5GC to the NG-RAN. Based on operator policy, the NG-RAN node decides towards which operator(s)' 5GC(s) to establish N3mb tunnel(s) , i.e. towards only one, some or all operators' 5GC(s). If N3mb multicast transport is used (not shown in Figure 6.18-1), the NG-RAN node decides which multicast group(s) (i.e. LL SSM(s)) to join.. Over the Uu interface, the NG-RAN allocates radio resource for only one of the established broadcast MBS Sessions regardless of the number of N3mb tunnels established to deliver the MBS packets.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where multiple broadcast MBS sessions are sharing the same content, with different CNs (Content Nodes) responsible for delivering the same content. This is achieved through resource sharing across multiple broadcast MBS sessions, which allows for efficient content delivery and reduces the load on the network.\nFigure 6.18-1: Example of Resource sharing across multiple broadcast MBS Sessions via different CNs to deliver the same content during network sharing\n",

The MB-SMF may also defer the configuration to join the corresponding multicast tree e.g. based on information that the session is inactive, service requirements and MBS start/end time until receiving the first query for the MBS session as part of the establishment procedure in clause 7.2.1.3, or until receiving a request to activate the MBS session via the MBS Session Update procedure in clause 7.1.1.6.\n15.\tIf requested, MB-UPF selects an ingress address (IP address and port) and a tunnel endpoint for the outgoing data and provides it to MB-SMF.\n16.\tThe MB-SMF sends an Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Create response ([TMGI], [Allocated ingress address], [Information of area reduction]).\nMB-SMF indicates the possibly allocated ingress address to the NEF/MBSF. MB-SMF may include TMGI if it is allocated in step 11.

If an MBS service area was received in step 11, the MB-SMF updates its NF profile at the NRF with that information.\nNOTE 8:\tIf TMGI is used to represent an MBS Session, MB-SMF does not need to update NRF if the TMGI range(s) supported by an MB-SMF is already included in the MB-SMF profile when MB-SMF register itself into NRF.\n17.\tFor broadcast communication, the MB-SMF continues the procedure towards the AMF and NG-RAN as specified in clause 7.3.1 to request the allocation of resources to for the transmission of the broadcast session.\n18.\t[Optional] If the MBSF decides to use an MBSTF, the NEF/MBSF provides the ingress address received in step 16 towards the MBSTF as DL destination. If the allocation of an ingress transport address was requested in step 8, the MBSF requests the MBSTF to allocate the user plane ingress resources. If the allocation of an ingress transport address was not requested in step 8, the MBSF provides the SSM received as Multicast session ID in step 8 and requests the MBSTF to join the corresponding multicast tree from the content provider.\n19.\t[Conditional on step 19]\tIf requested, the MBSTF selects an ingress address (IP address and port) and provides it to NEF/MBSF.\n20.\tThe NEF/MBSF indicates the possibly allocated ingress address and other parameters (e.g. TMGI) to the AF via an Nnef_MBSSession_Create response ([TMGI], [Allocated ingress address], [Information of area reduction]). If MBS Session ID is not provided in step 8, or the MBS Session ID is SSM, the NEF/MBSF provides the allocated TMGI. If AF requested the allocation of an ingress transport address, the message also includes the allocated ingress address. For broadcast communication, the message also includes any MBS FSA ID(s) received in step 17.\nIf the NEF/MBSF rejects the TMGI allocation in step 10, or receives the result information in step 16 indicating that the MBS service area cannot be covered by the MB-SMF service area of the MB-SMF, the NEF/MBSF includes that result information, and forwards the Information of area reduction.\n21.\tSame as step 7. The AF may also perform a service announcement at this stage.\n22.\tFor multicast communication, depending on configuration UEs can join the MBS Session as specified in clause 7.2.1.\nDeployment of dynamic PCC is optional. This clause describes the procedure when dynamic PCC is deployed.\nThe figure depicts a session creation process for a MBS (Mobile Backhaul System) with a PCC (Physical Carrier Core). The process involves the creation of a session, which is a logical grouping of data packets, and the transmission of the session to the MBS. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the creation of a session, including the selection of the session type, the selection of the session parameters, and the transmission of the session to the MBS. The figure also shows the connection between the MBS and the PCC, which is essential for the successful transmission of the session.\nFigure 7.1.1.3-1: MBS Session Creation with PCC\nSteps 1 to 7 are optional and only applicable if TMGI is used as MBS Session ID and required to be pre-allocated.\n1 to 9:\tSame as in Figure 7.1.1.2-1.\n10.\tThe NEF/MBSF may optionally, based on local configuration, decide to interact with the PCF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the deployment without NEF and MBSF, the AF optionally interacts with PCF in steps 11-18.\nIf the NEF/MBSF decided to interact with the PCF, steps 11 to 19 are performed, and in step 20 the MBS Service Information is not provided to the MB-SMF.\nIf the NEF/MBSF decided not to interact with the PCF, steps 12 to 19 are skipped, and in step 20 the MBS Service Information is provided to the MB-SMF.\n11.\t[Conditional] If the NEF/MBSF did not receive an MBS Session ID from the AF in step 8, the NEF/MBSF sends an Nmbsmf_TMGI_Allocate Request (1) message to the MB-SMF and the MB-SMF allocates a TMGI and returns the TMGI to the NEF/MBSF via the Nmbsmf_TMGI_Allocate response (TMGI, expiration time).\n12.\t[Conditional] If the NEF/MBSF receives the Request for location-dependent session from the AF and if there is a need to select the same PCF for the location dependent MBS Sessions, the NEF/MBSF first uses the BSF Discovery service to discover whether there is a PCF serving the MBS session with the MBS Session ID by using Nbsf_management_Discovery operation. If there is a PCF registered for the MBS Session ID, the NEF/MBSF interacts with that PCF and skips the following step 13.\nNOTE 2:\tThis step is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF.\n13.\t[Conditional] If step 12 was not executed or the interaction with the BSF revealed that no PCF is registered for the MBS Session ID, the NEF/MBSF discovers the PCF candidates by interacting with the NRF and selects a PCF, possibly based on MBS service area.\n14.\tThe NEF/MBSF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicy_Authorization_Create Request (MBS Session ID, [Area Session Policy ID], [Request for location dependent MBS session], MBS Service Information (as defined in clause 6.14)) to the PCF.\n15.\t[Optional] The PCF may retrieve authorization information for the MBS session from the UDR (see clause 6.10.2) and takes it into account for the subsequent authorization and QoS allowance check.\nNOTE 3:\tThis step is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF if authorization data are stored in the PCF.\n16.\tThe PCF determines whether the request is authorized and if the request is authorized, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters based on the received MBS Service Information and determines whether this QoS is allowed. If the required QoS is allowed, the PCF generates the policy information for the MBS session (as defined in clause 6.10) and stores it together with the MBS Session ID.\n17.\tIf the request is authorized and the required QoS is allowed, the PCF registers at the BSF that it handles the MBS session by using Nbsf_management_Register Request (MBS Session ID, PCF ID). It provides an identifier that the policy association is for MBS and the MBS Session ID, its own PCF ID and optionally its PCF set ID.\nNOTE 4:\tThis step is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF.\n18.\tThe PCF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicy_Authorization_Create Response (Result indication, [Area Session Policy ID]) to the NEF/MBSF.\n-\tThe request is authorized for a location dependent MBS Session, the PCF assigns Area Session Policy ID.\n-\tIf the request is not authorized or the required QoS is not allowed, the PCF indicates so in the response to the NEF/MBSF which in turn informs the AF about it (by sending the Nnef_MBSSession_Create Response) and ends this procedure.\n19.\tSame as step 10 in Figure 7.1.1.2-1.\n20.\tSame as step 11 in Figure 7.1.1.2-1 with the following differences:\n-\tIf the optional interaction between AF/NEF/MBSF and PCF has been performed:\n-\tThe MBS Service Information is not present (as it was already provided to the PCF in step 14).\n-\tFor location dependent MBS service, the AF/NEF/MBSF also includes Area Session Policy ID (which is assigned by the PCF in step 18) to the MB-SMF.\n21.\tThe MB-SMF discovers the PCF using NRF.\n22.\tThe MB-SMF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Create Request (MBS Session ID, [Area Session policy ID], [MBS Service Information (as defined in clause 6.14)]) for the MBS session towards the PCF. The MB-SMF forwards the MBS Service Information to the PCF if received from the NEF/MBSF in the previous step 20.\nFor location dependent MBS Session, the MB-SMF also sends Area Session Policy ID to the PCF as follows:\n-\tIf the AF/NEF/MBSF does not include Area Session policy ID, (i.e. the AF/NEF/MBSF has not interacted with PCF), the MB-SMF uses its assigned Area Session ID as Area Session Policy ID.\n-\tIf AF/NEF/MBSF includes Area Session Policy ID (i.e. AF/NEF/MBSF (i.e. the AF/NEF/MBSF has interacted with PCF), the MB-SMF provides that received Area Session Policy ID (received from AF/NEF/MBSF) as Area Session Policy ID.\nIf PCF receives MBS Service Information from the MB-SMF, the PCF performs the subsequent steps 23 to 26. If the PCF does not receive MBS Service Information from the MB-SMF, but has previously determined policy information for the MBS session (see step 16) corresponding to the MBS Session ID (and Area Session Policy ID for location dependent MBS) received from the MB-SMF, the PCF continues with step 27.\n23.\tIf the PCF is not handling the MBS Session ID, the PCF uses the BSF Register service to check whether there is already a PCF serving the MBS session. If so, the PCF skips steps 24 to 26 and indicates in step 27 that the PCF serving the MBS session shall be contacted.\nNOTE 5:\tThis step is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF.\n24.\t[Optional] The PCF may retrieve authorization information for the MBS session from the UDR (see clause 6.10.2) and takes it into account for the subsequent authorization and QoS allowance check.\nNOTE 6:\tThis step is not necessary if authorization data are stored in the PCF.\n25.\tThe PCF determines whether the request is authorized and if the request is authorized, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters based on the received MBS Service Information and determines whether this QoS is allowed. If the required QoS is allowed, the PCF generates the policy information for the MBS session (as defined in clause 6.10) and stores it together with the MBS Session ID.\n26.\tIf the request is authorized and the required QoS is allowed the PCF registers at the BSF that it handles the MBS session by using Nbsf_management_Register Request (MBS Session ID, PCF ID). It provides an identifier that the policy association is for MBS and the MBS Session ID, its own PCF ID and optionally its PCF set ID.\nNOTE 7:\tThis step is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF.\n27.\tThe PCF responds with Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Create Response ([policy information for the MBS session (as defined in clause 6.10)], Result indication).\nIf the request is not authorized or the required QoS is not allowed, the PCF indicates so in the response to the MB-SMF which in turn informs the AF about it (by sending the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Create Response) and ends this procedure.\nIf another PCF is serving the MBS session, the PCF indicates that another PCF serving the MBS session shall be contacted and provides an ID of that other PCF. The MB-SMF then repeats step 22 towards that other PCF.\n28-37:\tSame as steps 14-22 in Figure 7.1.1.2-1.\nNOTE 8:\tSteps 33-36 can be executed in parallel to step 32.\nThis procedure is used by the AF to delete the MBS Session. This procedure may also include TMGI de-allocation. The procedures apply to both multicast and broadcast communications unless otherwise stated. This procedure releases the reserved resources in both 5GC and NG-RAN.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a MBS session is deleted without the presence of a PCC (Physical Circuit Clearance). This deletion is crucial for ensuring network security and preventing unauthorized access. The figure illustrates the process of deleting a session, which involves disconnecting the session from the network and marking it as deleted. The presence of a PCC ensures that the session is not deleted without the user's consent, and the deletion is recorded for future reference.\nFigure 7.1.1.4-1: MBS Session Deletion without PCC\n1.\tAF of content provider may request to delete the MBS session (MBS Session ID).\n2/3.\tIf an MBSTF was inserted into the user plane, the MBSF request the MBSTF to release user plane resources.\n4.\tNEF/MBSF requests MB-SMF to delete resources for the MBS session.\n5.\tFor Broadcast MBS session, the MB-SMF triggers resource release towards the AMFs as specified in clause 7.3.2. For Multicast MBS session, the MB-SMF triggers resource release towards the SMFs as specified in clause 7.2.2.3.\n6/7.\tMB-SMF requests the MB-UPF to release user plane resources.\n8.\t[Conditional] If MB-SMF configured the profile with an MBS Session ID when the MBS session was created, the MB-SMF updates its NF profile at NRF to release the MBS Session ID.\n9.\tMB-SMF responds to the NEF/MBSF.\n10.\tThe NEF/MBSF responds to the AF.\n11.\t[Optional] AF requests NEF/MBSF to de-allocate TMGI(s),\n12.\t[Conditional on step 11] NEF/MBSF forwards request to de-allocate TMGI(s) to MB-SMF.\n13.\t[Conditional on step 12] The MB-SMF responds to the NEF or MBSF by sending a de-allocate TMGI Response message.\n14.\t[Conditional on step 13] NEF or MBSF forwards de-allocate TMGI Response message to AF.\nThis procedure is used by the AF to release the MBS Session. This procedure may also include TMGI de-allocation. The procedures apply to both multicast and broadcast communications unless otherwise stated. This procedure releases the reserved resources in both 5GC and NG-RAN.\nThe figure depicts a session deletion process in a mobile backhaul network, specifically focusing on the deletion of a session between a mobile backhaul node (MBS) and a point-to-point communication (P2P) session. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the deletion process, including the deletion of the session, the deletion of the session's data, and the deletion of the session's metadata. The figure also includes a visual representation of the deletion process, such as the deletion of the session's data and the deletion of the session's metadata.\nFigure 7.1.1.5-1: MBS Session Deletion with PCC\n1-3.\tSame as in Figure 7.1.1.4-1.\nFor the interaction with the PCF in this procedure, the NEF/MBSF applies the same decision that was taken in step 10 in Figure 7.1.1.3-1 during the MBS Session Creation with PCC procedure:\nIf the NEF/MBSF decided to interact with the PCF, steps 4 to 5 are performed.\nIf the NEF/MBSF decided not to interact with the PCF, steps 4 to 5 are skipped.\nNOTE 1:\tIf NEF and MBSF is not deployed, the AF optionally interacts with PCF in steps 4 to 5.\n4.\tThe NEF/MBSF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicyAuthorization_Delete Request to the PCF that handles the MBS Session.\n5.\tThe PCF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicyAuthorization_Delete Response to the NEF/MBSF.\n6.\tSame as step 4 in Figure 7.1.1.4-1.\n7.\tThe MB-SMF sends the Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Delete Request to request the deletion of the SM Policy Association with the PCF.\n8.\tThe PCF sends the Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Delete Response to the MB-SMF.\n9.\tThe PCF de-registers at the BSF that it handles the MBS session.\n10-19.\tSame as steps 5-14 in Figure 7.1.1.4-1.\nThis procedure is used by the AF to update the MBS service area and/or MBS Service Information. Updating MBS Service Information may lead to addition of new MBS QoS Flow(s), removal of existing MBS QoS Flow(s) or update of existing MBS QoS Flow(s). The procedure applies to both multicast and broadcast communications unless otherwise stated.\nIf the MBSF acts as the MBS security function for multicast as defined in TS 33.501 [20], it may use this procedure to provide an MSK for the MBS session via the control plane. In this case the MBSF may initiate this procedure and steps 1, 2 and 10 do not apply.\nNOTE:\tThe procedure is not applicable if no MSK but only the MTK is to be updated.\nFor local multicast services and location dependent multicast services, the AF may perform a Service Announcement towards UEs to update the MBS service area before the MBS Session Update procedure is started or after the MBS Session Update procedure is completed.\nThe figure depicts a session update without PCC (Physical Circuit Check) in a mobile broadband service (MBS) environment. The update involves the transmission of a session key, which is a cryptographic key used for authentication and encryption. The figure shows the MBS session update process, including the transmission of the session key, the reception of the session key by the MBS, and the transmission of the session key to the PCC. The figure also includes the PCC's response to the session key, which is a key used for authentication and encryption. The figure provides a visual representation of the MBS session update process, allowing users to understand the steps involved and the security measures in place.\nFigure 7.1.1.6-1: MBS Session Update without PCC\n1.\tAF of content provider initiates MBS Session Update to a NEF/MBSF, e.g. to update MBS service area and/or update MBS Service Information (as defined in clause 6.14), or to activate or deactivate an MBS session. AF may provide updated information for an MBS session (identified by MBS session ID) by sending an Nnef_MBSSession_Update Request (MBS Session ID, [MBS Service Information], [MBS service area], [MBS session state (active/inactive)]).\nIf geographical area information or civic address information was provided by the AF as MBS service area, NEF/MBSF translates the MBS service area to Cell ID list or TAI list.\n2.\tNEF checks authorization of AF.\n3.\tNEF/MBSF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Update Request to MB-SMF forwarding the updated information received from the AF in step 1. If the MBSF acts as the MBS security function for multicast as defined in TS 33.501 [20], it may provide an updated multicast session security context for the MBS session in the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Update Request.\nIf the MBS service area is not covered by the MB-SMF service area of the MB-SMF, the MB-SMF reduces the MBS service area to be within the MB-SMF service area and continues the procedure with the reduced MBS service area.\n4.\tThe MB-SMF derives any updated QoS parameters locally under consideration of the updated MBS Service Information. This may lead to addition of new MBS QoS Flow(s), removal of existing MBS QoS Flow(s) or update of existing MBS QoS Flow(s).\n5-6.\tMB-SMF may need to update MB-UPF, e.g. if new MBS QoS Flow is to be created, or existing MBS QoS Flow is to be deleted.\n7.\tFor broadcast communication, the MB-SMF continues the procedure towards the AMF and NG-RAN as specified in clause 7.3.3. For multicast communication, the MB-SMF continues the procedure towards the AMF and NG-RAN as specified in clause 7.2.5 (for service activation/deactivation), 7.2.6 (for QoS updates and service area updates).\n8.\tIf an MBS service area is being updated, the MB-SMF stores the new service area in its profile at the NRF.\n9.\tMB-SMF responds to the NEF/MBSF with a Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Update Response ([Information of area reduction]).\nIf the MB-SMF reduces the MBS service area in step 3, the MB-SMF includes result information in the response indicating that the MBS service area cannot be covered by the MB-SMF service area of the MB-SMF, and includes the Information of area reduction that relates to the reduced MBS service area.\nNOTE:\tDetails of the Information of area reduction is defined by stage 3.\n10.\tNEF/MBSF responds to the AF with a Nnef_MBSSession_Update Response ([MBS service area information]).\nIf the NEF/MBSF receives the result information in step 9 indicating that the MBS service area cannot be covered by the MB-SMF service area of the MB-SMF, the NEF/MBSF includes that result information, and the Information of area reduction.\nFor local multicast services and location dependent multicast services, the AF may perform a Service Announcement towards UEs to update the MBS service area before the MBS Session Update procedure is started or after the MBS Session Update procedure is completed.\nThe figure depicts a session update with PCC, which is an important aspect of managing the network's performance and ensuring smooth communication.\nFigure 7.1.1.7-1: MBS Session Update with PCC\n1-2.\tSame as in Figure 7.1.1.6-1.\n3.\tFor the interaction with the PCF in this procedure, the NEF/MBSF applies the same decision that was taken in step 10 in Figure 7.1.1.3-1 during the MBS Session Creation with PCC procedure unless the MBS session update only relates to an activation or deactivation of the MBS session and/or an MBS service area update and thus no PCF interactions are required.\nIf the NEF/MBSF decided to interact with the PCF, steps 4 to 6 are performed and in step 7 an indication that the PCF has to be contacted is provided, and MBS Service Information is not provided to the MB-SMF.\nIf the NEF/MBSF decided not to interact with the PCF, steps 4 to 6 are skipped and MBS Service Information is provided to the MB-SMF in step 7.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the deployment without NEF and MBSF, the AF optionally interacts with PCF in steps 4 - 6.\n4.\tNEF/MBSF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicy_Authorization_Update Request (application session context, [MBS Service Information]) to the PCF forwarding the updated information received from the AF in step 1.\n5.\tThe PCF determines whether the update is authorized and if the update is authorized, the PCF derives the update for the QoS parameters based on the received MBS Service Information and determines whether this new QoS is allowed. If the new QoS is allowed, the PCF updates the policy information for the MBS session (as defined in clause 6.10) accordingly. If the policy information for the MBS session has changed, the PCF shall provide an indication that the PCF has to be contacted.\n6.\tThe PCF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicy_Authorization_Update Response (Result indication, [indication that the PCF has to be contacted]) to the NEF/MBSF.\nIf the update is not authorized or the new QoS is not allowed, the PCF indicates so in the response to the NEF/MBSF which in turn informs the AF about it (by sending the Nnef_MBSSession_Update Response) and ends this procedure.\n7.\tThe NEF/MBSF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Update Request to the MB-SMF forwarding the updated information received from the AF in step 1. If the NEF/MBSF has decided not to interact with the PCF, the NEF/MBSF send the indication that the PCF has to be contacted, in addition.\nIf the NEF/MBSF has decided to interact with the PCF and thus provided the updated MBS Service Information to the PCF in step 4, the updated MBS Service Information is not forwarded. The NEF/MBSF forwards the indication that the PCF has to be contacted, if received from the PCF.\n8.\tIf the MB-SMF does not receive the indication that the PCF has to be contacted, the MB-SMF decides whether to interact with the PCF. If it decides not to interact with the PCF, it continues with step 11. Otherwise, the MB-SMF sends an Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Update Request (MBS Policy Association ID, [MBS Service Information]) for the MBS session towards the PCF. The MB-SMF forwards the MBS Service Information to the PCF if received from the NEF/MBSF in the previous step 7.\nIf PCF receives MBS Service Information from the MB-SMF, the PCF performs the subsequent step 9. If the PCF does not receive MBS Service Information from the MB-SMF, the PCF identifies any updated policy information for the MBS session (as defined in clause 6.10) corresponding to the MBS Session ID received from the MB-SMF and continues with step 10.\n9.\tThe PCF determines whether the update is authorized and if the update is authorized, the PCF derives the update for the QoS parameters based on the received MBS Service Information and determines whether this new QoS is allowed.

In addition, when a Multicast MBS session is created and the MBS Session ID is not yet included in the MB-SMF profile, the MB-SMF updates its profile towards the NRF with the MB Session ID (i.e. TMGI or source specific IP multicast address).\nNOTE:\tThe operator can preconfigure MB-SMF for specific source IP multicast address range or TMGI range.\n-\tWhen the UE joins the multicast MBS session via PDU session modification procedures, the SMF serving the PDU session invokes the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request Request including the MBS Session ID for multicast provided by the UE and optionally other information, i.e. the S-NSSAI and the associated NSI ID (if available), DNN, etc. to query the NRF for MB-SMF information. Based on the MBS Session ID and other information for query, the NRF decides whether an MB-SMF serving the MBS session exists (i.e. the NRF decides whether the requested MBS Session ID is in the profile of an MB-SMF, as defined in clause 7.1.1.2 or clause 7.1.1.3 or preconfigured by the operator).

The first accepted UE join request will trigger the multicast MBS session establishment towards the NG-RAN and the UE.\nThe PDU Session associated with Multicast MBS session(s) (i.e. the associated PDU Session) is established using the procedures as specified in TS 23.502 [6] clause 4.3.2.2 with the following differences:\nNOTE 1:\tThe DNN and S-NSSAI are used to establish the PDU session which can carry the operations related to Multicast MBS session(s), i.e. session join/leave, and can be associated with multicast MBS session(s).\n-\tIn step 2, the AMF selects an SMF capable of handling Multicast MBS sessions based on DNN and S-NSSAI, locally configured data or a corresponding SMF profile stored in the NRF. For indirect discovery, the AMF requests the SCP to select an SMF capable of handling Multicast MBS sessions.\n-\tIn step 4, if MBS subscription data for the UE (i.e. corresponding SUPI), DNN and S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN is not available, the SMF retrieves the MBS subscription data using Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, MBS subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN, Serving PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID)) and subscribes to be notified when this subscription data is modified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe (SUPI, MBS subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or SNPN, Serving PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID)). UDM may get this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI, MBS data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN, Serving PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID)) and may subscribe to notifications from UDR for the same data by Nudr_DM_subscribe. The MBS subscription data can also be retrieved along with the Session Management Subscription data, i.e. with additional input parameter for MBS subscription data in the Nudm_SDM services.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this release, roaming is not supported, i.e. HPLMN and Serving PLMN are the same and subscribed SNPN and serving SNPN are same.\nThe following steps are executed before the UE requests to join the MBS session:\n-\tThe MBS Session may have been created in the 5GC (see clause 7.1.1 for details).\n-\tThe UE registers in the PLMN or SNPN and may have established a PDU session that can be associated with multicast session(s).\n-\tThe UE has known at least the MBS Session ID of a multicast group that the UE can join, e.g. via service announcement.\nThe figure depicts a PDU Session modification for a UE joining a Multicast MBS session. It shows the steps involved in modifying the PDU session to accommodate the new UE, including the addition of a new multicast MBS session. The figure illustrates the process of adding a new multicast session to the existing PDU session, which is essential for ensuring efficient communication in a network.\nFigure 7.2.1.3-1: PDU Session modification for UE joining Multicast MBS session\n1.\tTo join a multicast group:\n-\tif there is an existing PDU session that can be used to send the UE join request for the multicast MBS Session, the UE sends a PDU Session Modification Request over that PDU session (i.e. associated PDU Session) which additionally contains one or several MBS Session ID(s) and join request. The MBS Session ID(s) indicate the multicast MBS session(s) that UE wants to join.\n-\tif the UE has no appropriate PDU session established with the DNN and S-NSSAI for the multicast MBS session, the UE joins the multicast MBS session by sending PDU Session Establishment Request for associated PDU session together with one or several MBS Session ID(s) and join request. In that case, before step 2, the network proceeds with establishment of the associated PDU session executing steps 4 to 10 of PDU Session Establishment procedure as specified in TS 23.502 [6] clause 4.3.2.2.\nNOTE 1:\tTo avoid that join requests at the MBS session start time are rejected due to many UEs joining at the same time, UEs can send join requests already before the MBS session start time if provided in service announcement as specified in clause 6.11.\n2.\t[Conditional] Based on the received MBS Session ID and join request, the SMF determines this is MBS Session join request.\nIf SMF has no information about MBS Session Context for the indicated MBS Session ID(s), SMF discovers and selects an MB-SMF for the MBS Session via the NRF as described in clause 7.1.2. If no MB-SMF is assigned for the MBS Session ID (i.e. the NRF provides empty MB-SMF profile), the SMF may select an MB-SMF and request it to configure the multicast MBS session or the SMF may reject the join request and respond to the UE with an appropriate cause value.\nNOTE 2:\tDetails about how the SMF selects an MB-SMF and requests it to configure the multicast MBS session are left to SMF implementation.\n3.\t[Conditional] For each MBS session in step 1, if the SMF has not subscribed to the MBS Session Context, it invokes Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe request (MBS Session ID) towards the MB-SMF to subscribe to events notifications related to the multicast MBS session and to request information about the MBS Session Context. The MB-SMF responds with the information about the indicated multicast MBS session in Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe response (multicast QoS flow information (e.g. QoS profile(s) for the multicast MBS session), [start time], [session state (Active/Inactive)], [Any UE indication], [multicast DL tunnel info], [multicast session security context]).\nIf it is the first time for the MB-SMF to receive Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe request of the indicated MBS Session from any SMF, the MB-SMF learns it is the first UE joining the multicast MBS session. For multicast transport between MB-UPF and content provider, if it is the first UE joining the multicast MBS session, and MB-UPF has not joined the multicast tree in the MBS session creation procedure, described in clause 7.1.1, the MB-SMF requests the MB-UPF to join the multicast tree towards the AF/MBSF, otherwise MB-SMF will not send the request to the MB-UPF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MB-SMF can answer the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe request either based on information received in the MBS session creation procedures in clause 7.1.1 or based on preconfigured information. The pre-configuration also includes information about the MBS session stored in the NRF. If the MB-SMF uses preconfigured information, the pre-configuration also includes MB-UPF configuration.\n4.\tThe SMF determines whether the user is authorized to join the Multicast MBS session taking into account the MBS subscription data received from the UDM and the Any UE indication if received from the MB-SMF. The SMF considers the UE as authorized to the Multicast MBS session if the UE is authorized to use multicast MBS services, and if the MBS Session ID(s) in the PDU Session Modification Request is included in the MBS subscription data or Any UE indication is received. If authorization check fails, the SMF rejects the join request with a cause value. If a UE joins prior to the start time of the multicast MBS session, the SMF may accept the join request and indicate to the UE the start time, or it may reject the join request with an appropriate error cause and optionally a back-off timer. If a UE joins while the multicast MBS session is inactive, the SMF accepts the join request. The MBS subscription data from the UDM may also contain MBS assistance information.\nNOTE 4:\tTo avoid that joins requests at the MBS session start time are rejected due to many UEs joining at the same time, the SMF can accept join requests already before the MBS session start time and indicate to the UE the start time.\n5.\tIf the join request is accepted, the SMF responds to the AMF through Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, MBS Session ID, [updated PDU Session information], [mapping information between unicast QoS flow(s) and multicast QoS flow (s)], [MBS Assistance Information for the MBS session]), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command, [multicast session security context])) to:\n-\tcreate an MBS Session Context for the indicated MBS session in the RAN, if it does not exist in the RAN already; and\n-\tinform the NG-RAN about the relation between the Multicast MBS Session Context and the UE's PDU Session context by including the MBS Session ID and the mapping between the multicast QoS flow(s) and associated QoS flow(s).\nBased on operator policy, the SMF may prepare for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery fall-back. The SMF maps the received QoS information of the multicast QoS Flow into PDU Session's unicast QoS Flow information, and includes the information of the QoS Flows and the mapping information about the QoS Flows (termed \"associated QoS flow information\") in the SM information sent to RAN. The SMF compares the QFIs of the multicast QoS Flows received from the MB-SMF with QFIs in use for the PDU Session and assigns unused QFIs to the PDU Session's unicast QoS Flows corresponding to multicast QoS Flows.\nNOTE 5:\tDetailed information included in N2 SM information will be aligned with by RAN WG3.\nNOTE 6:\tThe SMF uses the same QoS in the received MBS QoS Flow QoS information for the associated QoS Flow in the unicast PDU session.\nIf the MBS session join procedure was triggered by the UE together with PDU Session Establishment procedure for the associated PDU session, the SMF provides the N2 SM information and N1 SM container for the associated PDU session in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation towards the AMF, as described in step 11 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 in TS 23.502 [6]. The N2 SM information also includes the MBS Session ID and, if 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery fall-back is supported, the mapping information between unicast QoS flow(s) and multicast QoS flow(s).\nIf the join request is rejected, the SMF responds to the AMF through Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Reject)) and the message will not contain any MBS Session Context or the N2 SM information for the associated PDU session. The PDU Session Modification Reject message is forwarded to the UE via the NG-RAN, and the following steps are skipped.\nThe SMF may also include the MBS assistance information for the MBS session in N2 SM Information, if the MBS subscription data from the UDM contains the MBS assistance information which includes the ID of the MBS session that the UE requests to join. The MBS assistance information for the MBS session sent to NG-RAN is described in clause 6.17.\n6.\tThe N2 message, which includes the MBS Session ID(s) the UE has joined and, if applicable, associated QoS Flow, is sent to the NG-RAN.\nIf the MBS is supported by NG-RAN, 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery is adopted. If the MBS is not supported by NG-RAN, 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used if the PDU Session's unicast QoS Flow include QoS Flows for the multicast session.\nIf the NG-RAN supports MBS, the NG-RAN uses the MBS Session ID to determine that the PDU Session identified by the PDU Session ID is associated with the indicated multicast MBS session.\nIf the NG-RAN supports MBS, the associated unicast QoS flow information, if provided, is not used to allocate the radio resource and CN resource for corresponding QoS flows.\nNOTE 7:\tUE join request via PDU Session signalling will fail if NG-RAN rejects the PDU Session Resource setup request (e.g. due to the number of UEs reaching a limit).\n7.\t[Conditional] If shared tunnel has not been established for the multicast MBS session towards the NG-RAN node, the procedures in clause 7.2.1.4 for the establishment of shared delivery toward NG-RAN node are executed. This step is executed separately for each multicast MBS session.\n7a.\tIf the MBS Session is active, the NG-RAN configures radio resources for MBS session.\n8.\tIf the MBS Session is active, the NG-RAN node performs AN specific signalling exchange with the UE to configure the UE with radio resources for the multicast MBS session. If the NG-RAN does not support MBS and the MBS Session is active, radio resources are reconfigured for unicast transmission of the MBS data over the associated PDU session. As part of the AN specific signalling exchange, the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command) is provided to the UE.\n9.\tThe NG-RAN node sends the PDU session modification response.\nIf the MBS is not supported by NG-RAN, the accepted unicast QoS flow is included in the N2 SM information. If the MBS is supported by NG-RAN, the N2 SM information further includes the indication of supporting MBS.\n10.\tThe AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request ([N2 SM information]) to the SMF.\nPer the indication of whether the NG-RAN supports MBS, the SMF determines whether 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used for multicast data transmission.\nNOTE 8:\tIf the shared tunnel is used, no interaction with UPF is needed for the indicated multicast MBS session\n[Conditional] This step is used for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery, if the related NG-RAN does not support MBS. If a shared tunnel between the UPF (PSA) and MB-UPF for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery has not yet been established by the SMF for the multicast MBS session, steps 11a to 11d are executed. Step 11e is executed irrespective of that.\n11a.\tThe SMF contacts the UPF to request the creation of a tunnel and provides the MBS Session ID. The UPF indicates to the SMF whether the tunnel for this multicast MBS session is newly allocated (as there can be multiple SMFs interacting with the same UPF for the same multicast MBS Session).\nIf the UPF determines to use unicast transport over N19mb, the UPF allocates a DL N19mb Tunnel endpoint for the multicast MBS session if the SMF request is the first one to allocate DL N19mb Tunnel endpoint for the multicast MBS Session in the UPF. The UPF includes the DL Tunnel Info in the response to the SMF. The DL tunnel info includes the downlink tunnel ID and the UPF address.\nIf the UPF determines to use multicast transport over N19mb, the UPF joins the multicast distribution if the SMF request is the first one for the MBS Session in the UPF. Steps 11b to 11d are skipped.\n11b.\tIf the UPF indicates the DL N19mb Tunnel is newly allocated, the SMF invokes Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate request (MBS Session ID, [DL tunnel info]) towards the MB-SMF for establishing the multicast MBS session transport between MB-UPF and UPF.\n11c.\tIf the DL tunnel info of the UPF is received, the MB-SMF configures the MB-UPF to transmit the multicast MBS session data towards UPF using the possibly received downlink tunnel ID.\n11d.\tThe MB-SMF responds to the SMF through Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate response (MBS Session ID, [multicast DL tunnel info]). If the UPF DL tunnel info for unicast transport is not received by the MB-SMF, multicast transport between MB-UPF and UPF is to be used, and the MB-SMF includes the downlink tunnel information with the low layer transport multicast address for the multicast MBS session.\n11e.\tThe SMF configures the UPF to forward the received multicast MBS session data within the PDU session. (This step may be combined with step 11a).\n12.\tThe SMF responds to the AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response message.\n13.\tThe MB-UPF receives multicast PDUs, either directly from the content provider or via the MBSTF that can manipulate the data.\nSteps 14 to 16 are for 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery:\n14.\tThe MB-UPF sends multicast PDUs in the N3mb tunnel associated to the multicast MBS session to the NG-RAN. There is only one tunnel per multicast MBS session per MBS service area and NG-RAN node, i.e. all the UEs which have joined the multicast MBS session via the NG-RAN node share this tunnel for reception of the multicast MBS session data.\n15.\tVoid.\n16.\tThe NG-RAN transmits the multicast MBS session data to the UE(s) via the MBS Radio Bearer using either PTP or PTM transmission.\nIn this step or at later stage, the NG-RAN may determine to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state for the MBS session, as defined in clause 6.17.\nNOTE 9: Whether and when the NG-RAN determine to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state for the MBS session as defined in clause 6.17 is to be decided by NG-RAN.\nSteps 17 to 19 are for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery:\n17.\tThe MB-UPF sends multicast PDUs in the N19mb tunnel associated to the multicast MBS session to the UPF. There is only one tunnel per multicast MBS session and destination UPF, i.e. all associated PDU sessions served by the destination UPF share this tunnel.\n18.\tThe UPF forwards the multicast data towards the NG-RAN via unicast (i.e. in the N3 tunnel of the associated PDU Session).\n19.\tThe NG-RAN forwards the multicast MBS session data to the UE via unicast (i.e. over the radio bearer(s) corresponding to the associated QoS flow(s) of the associated PDU Session).\nNOTE 10:\tDetails of the DL MBS data transmission are described in clause 6.7.\nNOTE 11:\tWhen the MBSF is involved in the multicast MBS session, the tunnel between MBSTF and MB-UPF has been established in the MBS session creation procedure.\nIn the following cases, the shared tunnel for shared delivery is established between the NG-RAN and MB-UPF:\n-\tThe first UE is included in the context of the MBS session in the NG-RAN.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the multicast MBS session is inactive, if there is at least one UE joining the multicast MBS session is in RRC-CONNECTED state in the NG-RAN, the shared delivery is not released.\nNOTE 2:\tShare delivery establishment procedures are used when MBS supporting NG-RAN node(s) get involved in the multicast MBS session regardless of the state of the multicast MBS session.\n-\tHandover to the target NG-RAN when the shared delivery tunnel is not established in the target RAN node for this multicast MBS session.\nThe figure depicts the establishment of shared delivery toward the 5G New Radio (NR) node, illustrating the network's architecture and the role of the shared delivery mechanism in ensuring efficient communication between the network and the 5G NR node.\nFigure 7.2.1.4-1: Establishment of shared delivery toward NG-RAN node\n1.\tA NG-RAN node decides to establish shared delivery for a multicast MBS session when it serves at least one UE within the multicast MBS session. For location dependent services, the NG-RAN node needs to establish shared delivery for the location dependent contents of a multicast MBS session if it serves at least one UE assigned to an MBS Session ID and Area Session ID.\n2.\tThe NG-RAN sends an N2 MBS Session request message (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID], N2 SM information ([unicast DL tunnel Info])) towards the AMF.\nIf the NG-RAN node is configured to use unicast transport for the shared delivery, it allocates a GTP tunnel endpoint and provides the unicast DL tunnel Info in the request, which includes the GTP tunnel endpoint and NG-RAN node address. For location dependent MBS services, the NG-RAN node also provides the Area Session ID.\n3.\tThe AMF selects the MB-SMF serving the multicast MBS session, e.g. using the NRF discovery service or locally stored information. It invokes Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate request (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID], N2 SM information, NG-RAN Node ID) to the MB-SMF.\nThe AMF stores the information of the NG-RAN nodes (e.g. NG-RAN Node ID) for the subsequent signaling related to the multicast MBS Session.\n4.\t[Conditional] If the MB-SMF receives the unicast DL tunnel Info in step 3 in a deployment where NG-RAN nodes share a common user plane entity, the MB-SMF only establishes the shared tunnel towards the DL GTP tunnel endpoint if the shared tunnel has not yet been established (as determined based on the stored DL GTP Tunnel endpoint(s) for the MBS session). The MB-SMF also stores the received DL GTP Tunnel and corresponding NG-RAN Node ID for the MBS session.\nTo establish the shared tunnel towards the DL GTP tunnel endpoint, the MB-SMF configures the MB-UPF to send multicast data for the multicast MBS session (or location dependent content of the multicast MBS session if an Area Session ID was received) towards that GTP tunnel endpoint via unicast transport.\n5.\tThe MB-SMF stores the information of the AMF (e.g. AMF ID) in the MBS Multicast MBS session context (or location dependent part of the Multicast MBS Session Context if an Area Session ID was received) to enable subsequent signalling towards that AMF.\n6.\tThe MB-SMF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate response (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID], N2 SM information ([TMGI], multicast QoS flow information, session state (Active/Inactive), [multicast DL tunnel Info], [MBS service areas])) to the AMF. If the MB-SMF did not receive unicast DL tunnel Info in step 3, it provides the multicast DL tunnel info that includes transport multicast address (e.g. a LL SSM) and a GTP tunnel endpoint for multicast transport of the shared delivery.\n7.\tThe AMF sends an N2 MBS Session response message (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID], N2 SM information) to the NG-RAN node. If the NG-RAN node receives the multicast DL tunnel Info of the shared delivery, it uses the transport multicast address included in the multicast DL tunnel info to join the multicast transport distribution.\n",

This clause also describes Multicast MBS Session release.\nWhen the UE determines to leave the Multicast MBS session, it shall send PDU session Modification request to inform the 5GC the leaving operation. The Figure 7.2.2.2-1 describes the procedure.\nThe figure depicts a UE initiating a multicast MBS session leave, illustrating the process of a user initiating a session to leave a multicast group. The figure shows the UE's location, the multicast group it is leaving, and the multicast group's location.\nFigure 7.2.2.2-1: UE initiated Multicast MBS Session leave\n1.\tThe UE sends the PDU Session Modification Request when the UE determine to leave the multicast MBS Session. The PDU Session Modification Request carries leave indication and the MBS Session ID which the UE want to leave.\n2.\tThe AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Request)) to the SMF.\n3a.\t[Conditional] If 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery is applied towards the UE, the SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the UPF (PSA). The SMF reconfigures the UPF to terminate the distribution of multicast data via the PDU session.\n3b.\t[Conditional] The UPF (PSA) sends an N4 Session Modification Response to the SMF.\nIf there are no PDU sessions to transmit the multicast MBS session data in the UPF, and unicast transport is used over N19mb, the UPF releases the DL N19mb tunnel endpoint and informs the SMF.\nIf there are no PDU sessions to transmit the multicast MBS session data in the UPF, and multicast transport is used over N19mb, the UPF leaves the multicast distribution tree of MB-UPF.\n4.\t[Conditional] If the UPF indicates the tunnel release (i.e. unicast transport was used), the SMF invokes Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate Request (Release, MBS Session ID, tunnel information) to release the tunnel between UPF and MB-UPF for this multicast MBS session. The MB-SMF determines whether the context update is for tunnel release or create based on whether the tunnel information exists in the multicast MBS Session Context stored in the MB-SMF or not.\n5.\t[Conditional] If the MB-SMF determines the context update is for tunnel release, the MB-SMF request to MB-UPF to release the tunnel between UPF and MB-UPF for the multicast MBS session.\n6.\t[Conditional] The MB-SMF responds to the SMF for step 4.\n7.\tThe SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID, N2 SM information ([MBS Session ID], [leave indication]), N1 SM container) service operation. In the N2 SM information, the MBS Session ID and the leave indication are included for informing the NG-RAN to remove the UE from this MBS session if 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method is used towards the UE. If 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method is used towards the UE, the N2 SM information does not include MBS related information.\nIn the N2 SM information, the SMF also informs the NG-RAN to release the associated QoS Flow(s), which carry or intend to carry the multicast MBS session traffic for 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery.\nThe associated QoS Flow(s) are released as defined in TS 23.502 [6] clause 4.3.3.2.\n8.\tThe AMF send N2 message (N2 SM information, N1 SM container) to the NG-RAN\n9.\tThe NG-RAN node performs the necessary AN-specific resource modification procedure toward the UE and transports the N1 SM container received in step 7 to the UE.\n10.\tThe NG-RAN node removes the UE from this multicast MBS session and sends a N2 message to the AMF.\n11.\tThe AMF transfers the N2 message received in step 9 to the SMF via the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation.\nThe SMF updates the associated PDU session context, e.g. remove the MBS Session ID from the associated PDU session context. In addition, if associated QoS flow is used for the multicast MBS session, the SMF also removes the associated QoS flow information associated with the indicated multicast MBS session from the associated PDU session context.\n12.\t[Conditional] If the UE is the last joined one of the multicast MBS session in the SMF, The SMF also indicates that the last UE served by the SMF leaves the Multicast MBS Session, the SMF unsubscribes the notifications of the MBS Session Context status updates from the MB-SMF by invoking Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusUnsubscribe service operation. The MB-SMF will no longer notify the SMF of the further context status updates of the multicast MBS session (e.g. activation, deactivation, update, release, etc.). For multicast transport between MB-UPF and content provider, if the SMF is the last remaining SMF that is subscribed for the MBS Session notification from the MB-SMF, i.e. if it is the last UE leaving the MBS session, the MB-SMF requests the MB-UPF to stop forwarding the multicast MBS session data and may request the MB-UPF to leave the multicast tree towards the AF/MBSF, if the MB-UPF joins the multicast tree when the first UE joins the MBS session.\n13.\t[Conditional] If the UE is the last UE in this RAN node for this multicast MBS session, the NG-RAN release shared delivery between NG-RAN and MB-UPF as described in clause 7.2.2.4.\nIf release of the PDU Session associated with a multicast MBS session is triggered, corresponding procedures between UE, NG-RAN, AMF, and SMF are performed as described in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [6], and SMF triggers the UE leave the multicast MBS session by performing steps 3-6 in Figure 7.2.2.2-1 for each multicast MBS session(s) associated with the PDU Session, and UE considers as left all the multicast MBS sessions associated with the PDU Session.\nNOTE:\tIf the associated PDU Session is released, the UE leaves MBS Session(s) associated with that PDU session implicitly. To resume the reception of the related MBS service(s), the UE needs to initiate the procedures as defined in clause 7.2.1 to re-join the MBS Session(s).\nIf the UE deregistration procedure is executed, corresponding procedures between UE, NG-RAN, AMF, and SMF are performed as described in clause 4.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 [6], and SMF performs steps 3-6 in Figure 7.2.2.2-1 for all multicast MBS sessions joined by the UE. When the PDU Session Release procedure or UE deregistration procedure is executed, according to the UE context, NG-RAN performs step 10 for each multicast MBS session associated with the released PDU Session(s).\nThis procedure applies to the following scenarios:\n1.\tWhen the MB-SMF decides to release an MBS Session:\n-\tbased on a request from the AF (directly or via the NEF/MBSF);\nIn this scenario, the MB-SMF notifies the SMF of multicast session release, and the SMF initiates procedures to remove all joined UEs from the MBS session.\n2.\tWhen the SMF decides to remove a UE from an MBS session:\n-\tbased on a request from the UDM (subscription change); or\n-\tdue to local and location dependent MBS service is described in clause 7.2.4; or\n-\tdue to network internal reasons.\nFor the active MBS session, to release radio resources as early as possible, the MB-SMF may trigger Multicast Session Deactivation towards the NG-RAN as specified in steps 5-9 of clause 7.2.5.3, prior to or in parallel with triggering MBS Session Release to the SMF.\nThe figure depicts a session release or multicast session leave request by a mobile base station (MBS) in a 5G network. The MBS initiates the session release by sending a request to the network, which then releases the session to the MBS. The figure illustrates the process of session release and multicast session leave requests in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of network management and control in ensuring efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure 7.2.2.3-1: MBS Session Release or Multicast session leave requested by the network\n1a.\tFor MB-SMF triggered MBS session release, the SMF receives Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify (MBS Session ID, multicast session release) from the MB-SMF with MBS Session ID. The SMF checks all joined UEs and perform step 2 to step 9 for each UE.\n1b.\tThe SMF decides to remove a UE from the MBS session without MBS session release (e.g. due to UE moving out of MBS service area for local or location dependent MBS service as described in clause 7.2.4).\n2.\tFor UEs without activated UP, the SMF may perform the same procedure as defined in step 3-7 in clause 7.2.5.2.\nAlternatively, for UEs without activated UP, the SMF does not trigger message to the AMF, instead the SMF marks that the UE is to be informed of the MBS Session release. In this case, the SMF initiates PDU Session Modification to inform the UE of the MBS Session release at next UP activation of the associated PDU Session, if needed.\n3.\tFor the joined UEs with UP activated, the SMF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF. The N1 SM container indicates UE removed from MBS session with appropriate cause (e.g. MBS session release, out of MBS service area, etc.). In N2 SM information, the SMF informs the NG-RAN to remove the UE from the MBS session. If there are associated QoS Flow(s) for individual delivery, the SMF also releases those QoS Flow(s) as specified in TS 23.502 [6] clause 4.3.3.2.\n4.\tThe AMF sends N2 Request to the NG-RAN.\n5.\tThe NG-RAN transports the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (MBS Session ID, UE removed from MBS session with appropriate cause)) to the UE.\n6.\tThe NG-RAN performs radio resource modification. If there are no joined UEs in the MBS session, the NG-RAN releases the radio resources.\n7.\tIf there are no joined UEs in the MBS session, for unicast transport of N3mb, the NG-RAN initiates the DL tunnel release towards MB-UPF via AMF and MB-SMF. For multicast transportation of N3mb, the NG-RAN performs IGMP/MLD Leave for the MBS session. See clause 7.2.2.4 for details.\n8.\tThe NG-RAN sends N2 Response to the AMF. If there are no joined UEs in the MBS session, the MBS Session Context is removed from the NG-RAN.\n9.\tThe AMF transfers the N2 message received in step 8 to the SMF via the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF removes the UE from the MBS Session.\nIn the following case, the shared delivery tunnel may be released between NG-RAN and MB-UPF:\n-\tThe last UE is excluded from the context of the multicast MBS session in the NG-RAN node;\n-\tHandover to the target NG-RAN when the UE is the last UE for this multicast MBS session in the source NG-RAN node during handover preparation phase known by the source NG-RAN node;\n-\tHandover to the target E-UTRAN when the UE is the last UE for this multicast MBS session in the source NG-RAN node;\n-\tMBS session deletion.\nNOTE:\tWhen the multicast MBS session is inactive, the shared delivery is not released if there is at least one UE is in RRC-CONNECTED state for this multicast MBS session.\nThe figure depicts a release of shared delivery toward the RAN node, illustrating the process of data transmission from the core network to the radio access network (RAN). The figure shows the path of the data, with the core network (C-RAN) at the top, the radio access network (RAN) at the bottom, and the RAN node in the middle. The release of shared delivery is a key component of the RAN, allowing for efficient data transmission between the core network and the RAN.\nFigure 7.2.2.4-1: Release of shared delivery toward RAN node\n1.\tA RAN node decides to release shared delivery for a multicast MBS session, e.g. because it no longer serves at least one UE within the multicast MBS session. For location dependent services, the NG-RAN node may release shared delivery for the location dependent contents of a multicast MBS session if it no longer serves at least one UE assigned to an MBS Session ID and Area Session ID.\n2.\tThe NG-RAN node sends N2 MBS Session release request (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID], [N2 SM information ([GTP tunnel info], release indication)])]) to the AMF. For location dependent services, the NG-RAN node also provides the Area Session ID. The RAN node includes the unicast DL tunnel info if unicast transport is used for the shared delivery. If the NG-RAN node was configured to use multicast transport for the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery, the NG-RAN node does not include the N2 SM information in the message.\n3.\t[Conditional] If the N2 SM information is received or it is the last RAN node controlled by the AMF serving the multicast MBS session, the AMF invokes Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate request (MBS Session ID [Area Session ID], [leave indication], [N2 SM information ([DL GTP tunnel endpoint ID])], NG-RAN Node ID) to the MB-SMF corresponding to the MB-SMF ID stored in the AMF for the MBS Session ID. If it is the last RAN node controlled by the AMF serving the multicast MBS session identified by the MBS Session ID or both the MBS Session ID and Area Session ID (if exists), the leave indication is included.\n4.\t[Conditional] If unicast transport was used towards the NG-RAN node, the MB-SMF determines whether the context update is for tunnel release or create based on the release indication in the N2 container. If the MB-SMF determines the context update is for tunnel release, , it performs the following:\nIf the unicast transport was used towards the NG-RAN in a deployment where NG-RAN nodes share a common user plane entity, the MB-SMF removes the received NG-RAN Node ID and possibly DL GTP tunnel endpoint from the stored NG-RAN Node ID(s) for the DL GTP tunnel endpoint for the MBS session, and checks whether the DL GTP tunnel is in use by other NG-RAN nodes based on the stored NG-RAN Node ID(s) for DL GTP tunnel endpoint for the MBS session.\nFor the deployment where NG-RAN nodes do not share a common user plane entity, the DL GTP tunnel will not be used by other NG-RAN nodes.\nIf the related DL GTP tunnel is not in use by other NG-RAN nodes the MB-SMF sends N4mb Session Modification to the MB-UPF to release the N3mb tunnel used for the multicast MBS session (or location dependent content of the multicast MBS session if an Area Session ID was received) towards that NG-RAN node using the received GTP tunnel info.\n5.\t[Conditional] The MB-SMF responses to the AMF with MBS Session ID and Area Session ID if received. If leave indication is received, the MB-SMF also removes the information of the AMF from the context of the multicast MBS session.\n6.\tThe AMF removes the information of the RAN node from the context of the multicast MBS session (or location dependent part of the multicast MBS session if an Area Session ID was received).\n7.\tThe AMF sends an N2 MBS Session release response (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID]) to the RAN node. The NG-RAN node deletes the GTP tunnel info (if unicast transport is used for the shared delivery) or sends IGMP/MLD leave message to leave the multicast distribution tree (if multicast transport is used for the shared delivery). The NG-RAN node releases local resources for the multicast MBS session.\n",

There are various mobility scenarios possible, depending on whether one of the involved NG-RAN nodes supports MBS.\nDuring an active MBS Session, mobility between an NG-RAN supporting MBS and an NG-RAN node not supporting MBS requires the mobility procedure to provide the appropriate MBS traffic delivery method at the target NG-RAN node.\nThis clause describes an Xn based handover with MBS traffic delivered to the UE at the source NG-RAN node supporting MBS.\nThe figure depicts a handover scenario in a 5G network, where a mobile user (MBS) initiates a handover from a base station (BS) to a mobile station (MS). The figure illustrates the handover process, including the handover request from the MBS, the handover request from the MS, and the handover process from the BS to the MS. The figure also shows the handover status, including the handover request status and the handover status of the MS.\nFigure 7.2.3.2-1: Xn based handover with MBS Session\nThe following additions apply compared to clause 4.9.1.2 of TS 23.502 [6]:\nBefore Handover:\nThe source NG RAN has been provided with MBS Session Resource information (including the MBS Session ID and multicast QoS flow information) and the UE Context information contains a mapping information within the PDU Session Resource associated with the MBS Session Resource, e.g. including mapped unicast QoS Flows associated with the multicast QoS flow(s) of the MBS Session Resource.\nHandover Preparation Phase:\nAt Xn handover, the target NG-RAN is provided with MBS session information by the source NG-RAN which causes:\n-\tan MBS non-supporting target NG-RAN node to prepare the unicast resources according to associated QoS flow(s) information.\n‐\tan MBS supporting target NG-RAN node to allocate to the UE shared NG-RAN resources according to the MBS session information.

The Target NG-RAN uses the associated PDU Session information to allocate resource to deliver MBS data. The MBS data are transmitted via the associated QoS flows within the associated PDU Session.\n-\tIf the Target NG-RAN supports MBS, the Target NG-RAN uses the multicast MBS Session related information to allocate RAN resources to deliver the MBS data. If 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery for the indicated multicast MBS session has not been established towards the Target NG-RAN, the Target NG-RAN initiates the shared delivery establishment towards the MB-SMF via AMF as described in clause 7.2.1.4.\n5.\tTarget NG-RAN to T-AMF: The target NG-RAN sends Handover Request Ack to T-AMF.\nThe target NG-RAN node, if MBS-capable, indicates it supports MBS to SMF in N2 SM information. Per the received N2 SM information, the SMF knows whether the target NG-RAN node supports MBS and determines the delivery method, i.e. whether the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery or 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used for MBS data transferring.\n12.\tT-AMF to SMF: The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request towards SMF, the message includes the received N2 SM information received from the target NG-RAN.\n13-14.\tSame as described in steps 3-4 of clause 7.2.3.2.\nThe details of how to perform data forwarding, refers to clause 7.2.3.5.\n15.\tSMF to T-AMF: The SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to the T-AMF.\nWhen the UE has joined the multicast MBS session and the source NG-RAN node does not support MBS, the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method is used for the multicast MBS session data delivery. When the Xn/N2 based handover procedure is triggered, the UE is handed over to the target NG-RAN node per existing Xn /N2 based handover procedure defined in TS 23.502 [6].\nThe following applies for an Xn based handover from an NG-RAN node not supporting 5G MBS:\n-\tThe source NG-RAN node requests the associated QoS Flow(s) in the associated PDU session to be handed over to the target NG-RAN node.\n-\tIn the Path Switch Request message, the target NG-RAN node, if MBS-capable, indicates it supports MBS to the SMF in the N2 SM information.\n-\tAfter successful handover, if the target NG-RAN node supports MBS, the SMF triggers modification of the associated PDU Session at the target NG-RAN node by including the multicast MBS session related information in N2 SM Information as described in step 7 of clause 7.2.1.3, which may trigger the target NG-RAN node to initiate establishment of shared delivery as described in clause 7.2.1.4. NG-RAN provides the response to the request for the modification of the PDU session when the shared delivery of the MBS session data to the related UE (if applicable) is available\n-\tBased on the response of PDU session modification procedure, the SMF changes the MBS session data delivery method from 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method to 5GC shared MBS traffic delivery method, and sends N4 Session modification message to UPF to configure UPF to not forward the received multicast MBS session data via the associated PDU Session. If there are no multicast MBS session data forwarding via the associated PDU session(s) needed, the SMF may also release the shared tunnel between the UPF and MB-UPF.\nThe following applies for an N2 based handover from an NG-RAN node not supporting MBS:\n-\tDuring handover preparation phase, the SMF includes the multicast MBS session related information in N2 SM Information as described in step 7 of clause 7.2.1.3 and sends it to the target NG-RAN. The target NG-RAN, if MBS-capable, indicates it supports MBS to SMF in N2 SM information. If the target NG-RAN node supports MBS, the target NG-RAN node adds the UE into the MBS Session Context. If 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery for the indicated multicast MBS session has not been established towards the target NG-RAN, the target NG-RAN uses the multicast MBS Session related information to allocate RAN resources to deliver the MBS data and initiates the shared delivery establishment towards the MB-SMF as described in clause 7.2.1.4.\n-\tBased on the received MBS support information in N2 SM information from the target NG-RAN, the SMF determines the MBS data delivery method for the multicast MBS session. The SMF configures UPF to not forward the received multicast service data to the associated PDU Session via N4 Session modification message, i.e. SMF changes 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery to 5GC shared MBS traffic delivery. If there are no multicast MBS session data forwarding via the associated PDU session(s), the SMF may also release the shared tunnel between the UPF and MB-UPF.\nTo minimize data loss of a multicast MBS session during the handover procedure the following functions apply:\n-\tFor each MBS QoS flow, the MB-UPF adds a sequence number in each data packet of the MBS session sent by the MB-UPF and forwarded to all related NG-RAN nodes and UPFs via GTP-U tunnel. When the UPF forwards the received MBS data packet, the sequence number shall not be changed.\n-\tIf both the source NG-RAN node and target NG-RAN node support MBS, to minimize data loss of the MBS session either of, or a combination of, the following methods may be applied, as specified in TS 38.300 [9]:\n-\tData may be forwarded from source NG-RAN node to target NG-RAN node. In handover preparation phase, the MBS progress information (i.e. PDCP number) is exchanged between source NG-RAN node and target NG-RAN node.\n-\tNG-RAN nodes share a common user plane entity, denoted as shared NG-U termination in TS 38.300 [9], which allows the allocation of identical PDCP numbers to MBS users data when delivered to UEs in cells served by different NG-RAN nodes.\n-\tIf source NG-RAN node supports MBS and target NG-RAN node does not support MBS, the multicast MBS session data is forwarded from source NG-RAN node to target NG-RAN node via data forwarding tunnels allocated by the target NG-RAN node associated with the mapped unicast QoS flows within the associated PDU session according to the data forwarding mechanism defined in TS 23.502 [6].\n-\tIf source NG-RAN node does not support MBS and target NG-RAN node supports MBS, for Xn/N2 handover, the multicast MBS session data is forwarded to the target NG-RAN node as the data forwarding mechanism defined in TS 23.502 [6]. Directly after the handover the target NG-RAN node thus still receives MBS session data via individual delivery. The UPF forwards multicast MBS session data within the associated PDU session which includes the sequence number received from the MB-UPF to the target NG-RAN node. Shared delivery of MBS data towards the target RAN node is being established as described in clause 7.2.1.4 and the target RAN node receives sequence numbers as part of the MBS data with sequence numbers via shared delivery.\nNOTE:\tFor N2 handover, the detail mechanism of how to transmit the received forwarded multicast MBS session data to UE is defined by RAN WGs.\nIf the MBS session is in Inactive state, the following differences apply as compared to the handover procedures for the MBS session in Active state:\n-\tThe target NG-RAN is provided with the MBS session ID, but is not provided with Active MBS Session Information by the source NG-RAN as specified in TS 38.423 [24] and in TS 38.413 [15].\n-\tFor Xn/N2 based handover, the information that MBS session is Inactive state is implied by the lack of Active MBS Session Information provided from the source RAN node towards the target RAN node.\n-\tFor the MBS supporting NG-RAN node, the target NG-RAN establishes the shared tunnel with the MB-UPF as usual, if it hasn't been established before. However, as the MBS session is in Inactive state, the NG-RAN node will not allocate related radio resource.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MBS Session Inactive state is provided by MB-SMF to NG-RAN in the N2 SM information in step 7 of clause 7.2.1.4.\n-\tAfter a handover to a target NG-RAN node not supporting MBS, the SMF removes the associated QoS flow(s) information.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether the associated QoS Flow(s) are removed from UE, NG-RAN, or only resource in NG-RAN is removed is up to implementation.\nIf an MBS session is in Inactive state, the UE may be in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state. If an MBS Session is in Active state, the UE may also be in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state as specified in clause 16.10.5.2 of TS 38.300 [9].\nThe UE may resume the connection in a different NG-RAN node as specified in clauses 4.8.2.2 and 4.8.2.2a of TS 23.502 [6], with following enhancement when the context retrieval is successful:\n-\tFor an MBS supporting NG-RAN:\n-\tif the UE context retrieved from the last serving NG-RAN includes MBS session information and the NG-RAN node has not yet established the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery for the MBS session, the NG-RAN establishes the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery as specified in clause 7.2.1.4. The NG-RAN then sends Path Switch Request indicating the MBS support information;\n-\tif the UE context retrieved from the last serving NG-RAN does not include MBS session information, Path Switch Request sent from NG-RAN includes the MBS support information. Based on the MBS support information, the SMF, after acknowledging the path switch request, provides the MBS related information and if applicable the associated QoS flow(s) information to the NG-RAN as specified in clause 7.2.1.3. The NG-RAN establishes the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery as specified in clause 7.2.1.4.\n-\tFor an MBS non-supporting NG-RAN, Path Switch Request sent from NG-RAN does not include the MBS support information. If the MBS session is still inactive, the SMF, after acknowledging the path switch request, removes the associated QoS flow(s) information if it was provided before.\nIf the UE context retrieval fails, the UE is moved into RRC IDLE state as per TS 38.300 [9]. The UE initiates the NAS signalling recovery including activating PDU Session(s) (see TS 24.501 [25]). When the associated PDU session(s) is activated during registration procedure (see clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [6]) or service request procedure (see clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [6]), clause 7.2.8 applies.\nNOTE:\tAs specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [6], parts of the service request procedure can also be executed during the Mobility Registration Update procedure.\nThe procedures in clauses 7.2.3.2, 7.2.3.3, 7.2.3.4, 7.2.3.6 and 7.2.3.7 apply with the following additions:\n-\tIf the MBS assistance information is available at the SMF for an MBS session that the UE joined,\n-\tIf there is signalling of MBS session related information from SMF to target RAN node, the SMF includes MBS Assistance Information in the N2 SM information.\n-\tFor N2-based handover, when the SMF provides the MBS session related information as part of the associated PDU Session context data as specified in the existing procedures, the SMF also includes the MBS Assistance Information in the N2 SM information.\n-\tFor Xn-based handover or Connection Resume from a non-MBS supporting source RAN node towards an MBS supporting target RAN node, the SMF provides MBS session related information as part of the associated PDU Session context data as specified in the existing procedures and the SMF also includes the MBS Assistance Information in the N2 SM information.\n-\tFor Xn-based handover or Connection Resume from an MBS supporting source RAN node towards an MBS supporting target RAN node, depending on configuration, the SMF may provide the MBS Assistance Information.\n-\tFor Xn-based handover or Connection Resume, the MBS session information transferred from source NG-RAN towards target NG-RAN also include MBS assistance information for the MBS session if such information is available at the source RAN node as specified in TS 38.300 [9].\nNOTE 1:\tIn deployments where not all the MBS supporting NG RAN nodes support delivery of multicast MBS session data to UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, a source NG-RAN node not supporting delivery of multicast MBS session data to UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state will not provide MBS assistance information for the MBS session to the target NG-RAN node.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is assumed that a RAN node not supporting delivery of multicast MBS session data to UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state ignores the MBS assistance information for the MBS session.\nFor a UE that is receiving multicast MBS data in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state, the scenarios for UE mobility are as follows:\n-\tUE moves to new cell within the RAN Notification Area (RNA).\n-\tUE moves outside the current RAN Notification Area but within the current Registration Area (RA).\n-\tUE moves out of the current Registration Area.\nWhen a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state is receiving ongoing MBS session data and moves to a new cell within the RNA, the UE may receive the MBS session data in RRC_INACTIVE state or resume the connection as specified in TS 38.300 [9].\nWhen a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state is receiving multicast MBS session data, if the UE moves out of the RNA and within the RA, the UE resumes the connection in the same way as specified in clause 7.2.3.7.\nWhen the UE in RRC_INACTIVE receiving multicast MBS session data, if the UE moves out of the RA, the UE initiates the Mobility Registration Update procedure to activate the associated PDU session(s) as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [6]. Hence the shared delivery (if not already established) or the individual delivery can be established towards the NG-RAN node to enable delivery of multicast MBS session data to the UEs.\n",

The AF (or NEF/MBSF if involved) selects MB-SMF for different MBS service areas.\n-\tFor each MBS service area, the AF creates a location dependent component of an MBS session for that service area towards the MB-SMF and provides the service area, which may be via NEF or MBSF. The MB-SMF additionally returns the Area Session ID allocated by MB-SMF in the response to a request to create a location dependent component of a Multicast MBS session, and the NEF forwards this Area Session ID to the AF.

The SMF should provide the TAI where the UE is located as input for the MB-SMF discovery. If the NRF does not have information about service areas for an MBS Session ID in the MB-SMF profile but obtains a TAI in combination with MBS Session ID as query parameter, the NRF ignores the TAI and provides the MB-SMF profile matching the MBS Session ID.If the TAI is not included, but the related MB-SMF include the service area, the NRF return all the MB-SMF associated with that MBS Session ID.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AMF provides the User Location Information of the UE (cell ID and current tracking area ID) towards the SMF within Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request and if the location changed also in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request (as used for the join) as specified in clauses 4.3.2.2.1 and 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [6].\n-\tThe NRF provides information about the MB-SMF(s) serving the Multicast MBS session at the possible indicated location.

The SMF additionally subscribes at the AMF using the Namf_EventExposure service to notifications about UE location changes (e.g. for a small MBS service area), or to notifications about the \"UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\"\" event. In the latter case, the SMF supplies the service area associated with the multicast area session where the UE resides as Area Of Interest. The SMF configures separate ingress terminations at the UPF for each service area and interacts separately for each service area (providing MBS Session ID and Area Session ID) with the MB-SMF to request or terminate the distribution of data for the MBS session and service area towards the UPF.\n\nThe Handover procedure for the UE is performed as defined in clause 7.2.3.2, 7.2.3.3, and 7.2.3.4 with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE is receiving multicast data corresponding to the MBS Session ID and Area Session ID via the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery from cells served by the Source NG-RAN before the handover, for the Xn Handover (comparing with the clause 7.2.3.2), the following applies:\n-\tThe Source RAN node includes MBS Session ID, Area Session ID and MBS service area associated with the cell where the UE resides to the Target RAN node.\nNOTE 1:\tDuring the handover procedure the associated QoS flow is established towards a NG RAN node not supporting MBS regardless whether the UE is still in the MBS service area associated with the original Area Session ID or not\n-\tIf the UE is receiving multicast data corresponding to the MBS Session ID and Area Session ID from cells served by the Source NG-RAN via the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery before the handover, for the N2 Handover (comparing with the clause 7.2.3.3), the following applies:\n-\tThe source RAN node includes MBS session area information (MBS Session ID, Area Session ID and MBS service area associated with the cell where the UE resides) for delivery to the Target RAN node within the Source to Target transparent container in the Handover Required message.\n-\tThe SMF forwards the Source to Target transparent container and may also include MBS session area information (MBS Session ID, Area Session ID and MBS service area) to the Target RAN in Handover request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SMF cannot determine the UE location and a possible new service area at this stage.\n-\tIf the UE is receiving multicast data corresponding to the MBS Session ID and Area Session ID from cells served by the Source NG-RAN via the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery before the Handover, for the Xn/N2 handover procedure (comparing with the clause 7.2.3.4), the following applies:\nNOTE 3:\tDuring the Xn handover procedure, the associated QoS flow is established at Target RAN side regardless whether the UE is still in the MBS service area associated with the original Area Session ID or not.\n-\tFor the N2 handover procedure, the SMF includes MBS session area information (MBS Session ID, Area Session ID, and MBS service area) associated with the last known service area of the UE in N2 SM information to the Target RAN node in Handover Request message.\n-\tIf the target RAN node supports MBS, it determines whether to establish the resources for multicast distribution and data forwarding for the received MBS Session ID and Area Session ID, based on MBS Session ID, Area Session ID, MBS service area provided by the source RAN (if source RAN support MBS) or SMF (if source RAN not support MBS) and the target location of the UE. If UE is not in the MBS service area provided by the source RAN (if source RAN supports MBS) or SMF (if source RAN does not support MBS), the target RAN does not allocate RAN resources, including the resource for data forwarding, for the multicast MBS Session to the UE.\n-\tIf the target RAN node support MBS, when it determines the shared delivery is not established for the multicast session ID and Area Session ID, the target NG-RAN initiates the shared delivery establishment as specified in clause 7.2.1.4 and provides the Area Session ID and tracking area ID(s) concerning the RAN node in addition to MBS Session ID in the request for shared delivery establishment. The MB-SMF provides MBS session area information (Area Session ID(s), MBS service area(s)) associated with the MBS session to the NG-RAN in the shared delivery establishment reply. The MB-SMF may either provide only the service areas concerning the target RAN node or all service areas associated with the MBS session.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the target RAN does not support MBS, the associated QoS flow is established at target RAN side during the handover procedure regardless whether the UE is still in the MBS service area associated with the original Area Session ID or not.\n-\tIf the target RAN supports MBS, but the Source RAN does not support MBS, the SMF configures the UPF to stop sending data related to the Multicast MBS session and service area via the associated PDU session of the UE. The SMF unsubscribes at the AMF using the Namf_EventExposure service to notifications about UE location changes, or to notifications about the \"UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\"\" event (for an individual service area).\nNOTE 5:\tIf the UE is still in the MBS session, the subscription for the UE entering or leaving the complete service area does not need to be changed.\n-\tWhen the AMF receives the User Location Information from target RAN node via the Path Switch Request message or Handover Notify message, the AMF provide it to the SMF. When the SMF get the User Location Information, the SMF determines the MBS service area of the UE camping cell by comparing the User Location Information received from AMF with the MBS service areas received from the NRF. The SMF uses the determined MBS service area and determined user location as follows:\n-\tThe SMF updates the Area Session ID in the locally stored the UE MBS Session Context with the corresponding Area Session ID if the Area Session ID is changed.\n-\tIf the target RAN does not support MBS, the Source RAN supported MBS, and the UE is in a service area of the MBS session, the SMF applies individual delivery towards the UE. The SMF configures the UPF to send data related to the Multicast MBS session and service area via the associated PDU session of the UE. The SMF additionally subscribes at the AMF using the Namf_EventExposure service to notifications about UE location changes, or to notifications about the \"UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\"\" event. In the latter case the SMF supplies the service area of the multicast area session as Area Of Interest. If associated QoS flows are not yet included in the PDU session, the SMF updates the PDU session with associated QoS flows.\n-\tIf the UE has moved to another MBS service area of the MBS session:\n-\tIf the target NG-RAN node support MBS after the completion of the handover procedure, the SMF provides the MBS session related information including the new Area session ID to NG-RAN via the PDU Session Modification procedure. Per the received the MBS session related information, the 5GC shared delivery is established.\n-\tIf the target NG-RAN node does not support MBS, the SMF updates the UPF to forward the MBS data packets which are received from the tunnel associated with the new Area Session ID to the target NG-RAN node. If the SMF did not configure the UPF to receive the MBS data packet from the tunnel associated with the new Area Session ID before, the SMF informs the MB-SMF of the new Area Session ID and UPF DL N19mb Tunnel information. MB-SMF configure the MB-UPF to transmit the Multicast MBS session data towards UPF using the received downlink tunnel ID. If the SMF subscribed to the \"Area Of Interest\" event, the SMF also updates the subscription with the new service area as \"Area Of Interest\".\n-\tIf the UE has moved out of all the MBS service areas of the MBS session:\n-\tIf the target NG-RAN node does not support MBS, the SMF deletes the associated QoS flow from NG-RAN and UPF after the completion of the handover.\n-\tPer operator's policy (e.g. when a local configured timer expires since the UE left the whole MBS service area), the SMF may remove the UE from the MBS session as defined in clause 7.2.2.3. When the UE is removed from the location dependent MBS session, the SMF also unsubscribes to the AMF from the notifications about the \"UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\"\" event.\nWhen the location dependent MBS session is activated, the MBS session is activated in the whole MBS service area of the MBS session. It is not supported that the same MBS session is in Active state in one MBS service area but in Inactive state in another MBS service area.\nNOTE:\tAs an exception, if the MBS session contains service areas served by several different MB-SMFs, the activation is for all service areas served by the MB-SMF.\nWhen the MB-SMF is requested by an AF to activate the MBS session in a service area of the MBS session or the MB-UPF reports detection of data for a service area of the MBS session, the MB-SMF triggers the activation for all service areas of the MBS session that it serves, i.e. whole MBS session is activated.\nFor the location dependent MBS session activation, the differences comparing to the procedure defined in clause 7.2.5.2 are as below:\n-\tThe SMF invokes Namf_MT_EnableGroupReachability service operation to AMF, which includes the whole MBS service area associated with the MBS session, i.e. the sum of all MBS service area associated with the MBS Session ID regardless of the Area Session ID.\n-\tFor the UE in CM-IDLE state, when the AMF triggers the paging, it take the receiving MBS service area information into account. Only the NG-RAN nodes which are included in the MBS service area need to be triggered for paging.\n-\tSMF checks whether the UE is in or out of the MBS service area based on the change notification or UE location information included in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request or Namf_MT_UEReachabilityInfoNotify message. Based on that information, the SMF determines how to activate the MBS session in the same way as the handling defined in clause 7.2.4.2.3\n-\tWhen the SMF provides the MBS session information to the NG-RAN nodes, it includes the MBS service area, and Area Session ID, in the N2 SM information.\nIf UE has moved out of the MBS service area corresponding to the original Area Session ID, the SMF checks whether UE is in MBS service area corresponding to a new Area Session ID within the same MBS session:\n-\tFor the case UE is out of the original MBS service area but in another MBS service area of the MBS session:\n-\tIf the RAN node does not support MBS and the MBS session is active, the SMF updates the UPF to forward the MBS data packets which are received from the tunnel associated with the new Area Session ID to the RAN node. If the SMF did not configure the UPF receiving the MBS data packet from the tunnel associated with the new Area Session ID before, the SMF informs the MB-SMF of the new Area Session ID and UPF DL N19mb Tunnel information. The MB-SMF configure the MB-UPF to transmit the Multicast MBS session data towards UPF using the received downlink tunnel ID.\n-\tThe SMF updates the AMF of the area of interest event subscription by supplying the new MBS service area as Area Of Interest.\n-\tFor the case UE is out of all the MBS service areas of the MBS session:\n-\tIf RAN node does not support MBS, the SMF delete the associated QoS flow from NG-RAN and UPF.\n-\tPer operator's policy (e.g. when a local configured timer expires since the UE left the whole MBS service area), the SMF may remove the UE from the MBS session as defined in clause 7.2.2.3. When the UE is removed from the location dependent MBS session, the SMF also unsubscribes to the AMF from the notifications about the \"UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\"\" event.\n-\tFor the case UE comes back to the MBS service area of the multicast MBS session after moving out of the whole MBS service area of the multicast MBS session, e.g. before the local configured timer expires:\n-\tIf the UE is still in the multicast MBS session, the SMF adds the associated QoS flow at NG-RAN and UPF.\nWhen the SMF receives a notification about a UE location change or is becoming aware of a UE location change (e.g. during handover, Mobility Registration Update and Service Request procedures), the SMF checks whether the new UE location is inside or outside all MBS service areas of the location dependent MBS session:\n-\tFor the case that UE is out of all MBS service area of the location dependent MBS session:\n-\tIf RAN node does not support MBS, the SMF delete the associated QoS flow from the RAN node and the UPF.\n-\tPer operator's policy (e.g. when a local configured timer expires since the UE left the whole MBS service area of the MBS session) the SMF may remove the UE from the multicast MBS session as defined in clause 7.2.2.3. The SMF also unsubscribes to the AMF from the notifications about the \"UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\"\" event.\n-\tFor the case UE comes back to MBS service area of the location dependent MBS session after moving out of the whole MBS service area of the multicast MBS session, e.g. before the local configured timer expires:\n-\tIf the UE is still in the multicast MBS session and the multicast MBS session is in Active state, the SMF tries to activate the multicast MBS session towards the UE.\nWhen the UE moves from one service area to another served by the same NG-RAN, the NG-RAN node that supports MBS handles content switching due to mobility between service areas it serves without interaction with SMF. If it is the first that UE enters a new location area the RAN node requests shared delivery from the MB-SMF for the corresponding Area Session ID. If the last UE leaves a location area the RAN node requests the termination of shared delivery from the MB-SMF for the corresponding Area Session ID.\nUE mobility can happen within the same NG-RAN between cells in or out of all the MBS service areas:\n-\tThe NG-RAN detects whether the UE is IN or OUT of all MBS service areas of a location dependent MBS session. If the UE moves in or out of all MBS service areas of a location dependent MBS session, the NG-RAN notifies the SMF.\nNOTE:\tWhen the UE joins, the SMF subscribes to the \"Area Of Interest\" event, and provides the combination of all MBS service areas of location dependent MBS session as \"Area Of Interest\" (see clause 7.2.4.2.1).\n-\tWhen the SMF knows the UE is IN or OUT of all MBS service area of location dependent MBS session, the SMF behaves as in clause 7.2.4.2.6.\n\nThe Connection Resume procedure for the UE is performed as defined in clause 7.2.3.7 with the following additions:\n-\tFor an MBS-supporting target NG RAN\n-\tThe target RAN node obtains MBS session information including an area session ID from the source RAN node (during the connection retrieval) or the SMF and initiates the shared delivery establishment (if not established yet) as specified in clause 7.2.1.4 providing that area session ID. It obtains information about location areas and related area session IDs during the shared delivery establishment. The target RAN then applies the procedures in clause 7.2.4.2.7.\n-\tFor a non MBS-supporting target NG RAN, the SMF subscribes at the AMF using the Namf_EventExposure service to notifications about UE location changes (if not yet done), and applies the procedures in 7.2.4.2.5.\nFor local multicast services, the MBS service area information is provided to the UE and the 5GC as specified in clauses 7.1.1.2 and 7.1.1.3 with the following differences and clarifications:\n-\tFor the Service Announcement, MBS service area information is included unless it is preconfigured.\n-\tWhen performing the MBS session creation request to the 5GC, the MBS service area information for a Multicast MBS session is provided by the AF unless it is preconfigured.\nFor the case that the multicast service is only available within a limited area, the UEs outside the MBS service area are not allowed to join the multicast service.\nThe Multicast MBS session join and session establishment for multicast service available within a limited area are performed as specified in clause 7.2.1.3 with the following differences and clarifications:\n-\tThe local Multicast MBS session has been created where the AF provided the MBS service area information as specified in clause 7.2.4.3.1.\n-\tThe UE may have information about local multicast service including MBS service area via Service Announcement as specified in clause 7.2.4.3.1.\n-\tIn step 1, if the UE determines that it is in the MBS service area based on the information about local multicast service e.g. obtained via Service Announcement, the UE sends the PDU Session Modification Request (MBS Session ID) or the PDU Session Establishment Request (MBS Session ID) as a Join Request to join the multicast group. If the UE determines that it is outside the MBS service area, the UE does not send the Join Request.\n-\tIn step 3, the SMF obtains the MBS service area (i.e. Cell ID list or TAI list) of the indicated MBS session from the MB-SMF, and the SMF determines the indicated MBS session corresponds to local multicast service based on the MBS service area.\n-\tIn step 5, the SMF checks whether the UE is inside or outside the MBS service area.\n-\tThe SMF determines whether the UE is inside the MBS service area by comparing the User Location Information of the UE received from the AMF with the MBS service area received from the MB-SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AMF provides the User Location Information of the UE (cell ID and current tracking area ID) towards the SMF within Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request and if the location changed also in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request (as used for the join) as specified in clauses 4.3.2.2.1 and 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [6].\n-\tIf the SMF detects that the UE is inside the MBS service area, the SMF continues the process of multicast session join as specified in clause 7.2.1.3 with the following additions:\n-\tThe SMF sends the UE a PDU Session Modification Command or a PDU Session Establishment Accept indicating a Join Accept as a response to the Join Request. The Joint Accept includes the MBS service area (i.e. Cell ID list or TAI list).\n-\tThe Multicast MBS session information sent by the SMF to the NG-RAN includes the MBS service area (i.e. Cell ID list or TAI list).\n-\tIf the RAN node serving the UE does not support MBS the SMF applies individual delivery towards the UE. The SMF configures the UPF to send data related to the Multicast MBS session via individual delivery within a PDU session of the UE.\n-\tIf the SMF detects that the UE is outside the MBS service area, the SMF rejects the multicast session join, so sends a Join Reject to the UE indicating that the MBS join is rejected. The Joint Reject includes the reject reason (outside of local service area) and the MBS service area (i.e. Cell ID list or TAI list).\nIn this case, the MBS Session establishment (i.e. resources establishment for MBS traffic delivery) for the UE is not performed.\nNOTE 2:\tThere may be the case that the UE determines that it is inside the MBS service area based on the geographical area information or civic address information as MBS service area information provided by the AF, so sends a Join Request but the UE is outside the MBS service area.\nNOTE 3:\tWhich SM NAS message is used to deliver the Join Reject (e.g. PDU Session Modification Reject) is defined in stage 3 specifications.\n-\tIf the Join Request from the UE is accepted, the SMF subscribes to the UE mobility event notification from the AMF (e.g. UE moving into or out of Area Of Interest, which is set by MBS service area), by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [6]. The SMF supplies the service area associated with the Multicast MBS session as Area Of Interest.\n-\tFor the UE that received the Join Reject from the SMF, later, if the UE detects that it is inside the MBS service area based on the MBS service area provided in the Join Reject, the UE sends the PDU Session Modification Request (MBS Session ID) to join the multicast group.\nThe Handover procedure for the UE is performed as defined in clause 7.2.3 with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE is camping at the Source RAN node and receiving multicast data corresponding to the MBS Session ID via the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery before the Handover, for Xn based handover in clause 7.2.3.2, the Source RAN node includes MBS Session ID and MBS service area to the Target RAN node during Handover Preparation phase. For N2 based handover in clause 7.2.3.3, this step corresponds to Handover Request and Handover Required message, respectively.\nNOTE:\tDuring the Xn or N2 handover procedures, if the target RAN node does not support MBS, the associated QoS flow is established at the Target RAN side regardless whether the UE is still in the MBS service area.\n-\tIf the UE is camping at the Source RAN node and receiving multicast data corresponding to the MBS Session ID via the 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery before the Handover, for the N2 Handover in clause 7.2.3.4, the SMF includes MBS session area information (MBS Session ID and MBS service area) in N2 SM information to the Target RAN node in Handover request.\n-\tIf the Target RAN node support MBS, it determines whether to establish the resources for multicast distribution and data forwarding for MBS Session ID, based on the received MBS Session ID provided by the source RAN (if source RAN support MBS) or SMF (if source RAN not support MBS), and target location of the UE. If UE is not in the in the MBS service area provided by the source RAN (if source RAN support MBS) or SMF (if source RAN not support MBS), the Target RAN does not allocate RAN resources, including the resource for data forwarding, for the multicast MBS Session to the UE.\n-\tIf the target RAN node support MBS, when it determines that the UE is in the MBS service area and that the shared delivery is not established for the multicast session ID, the target NG-RAN initiates the shared delivery establishment as specified in clause 7.2.1.4.\n-\tWhen the AMF receives the User Location Information from target RAN node via the Path Switch Request message or Handover Notify message, the AMF provide it to the SMF. When the SMF get the User Location Information, the SMF check the MBS service area of UE camping cell by comparing the User Location Information received from AMF with the MBS service area received from the MB-SMF. The SMF uses the determined UE location and MBS service area as follows:\n-\tThe SMF determines whether the UE is outside the MBS service area by comparing the received Cell ID and tracking area ID with the MBS service area received from the MB-SMF.\n-\tIf the UE is inside the MBS service area and target RAN node does not support MBS, the SMF applies individual delivery towards the UE. If associated QoS flows are not yet included in the PDU session, the SMF updates the PDU session with associated QoS flows. If the SMF did not configure the UPF to receive the MBS data packet from the tunnel associated with the Multicast MBS session before, the SMF informs the MB-SMF of the MBS session and UPF DL N19mb Tunnel information. MB-SMF configure the MB-UPF to transmit the Multicast MBS session data towards UPF using the received downlink tunnel ID.\n-\tIf the UE is out of the service area of the MBS session:\n-\tIf the target NG-RAN node does not support MBS, the SMF deletes the associated QoS flow from NG-RAN node and the UPF after the completion of the handover procedure.\n-\tPer operator's policy (e.g. when a local configured timer expires since the UE left the whole MBS service area of the MBS session) the SMF may remove the UE from the MBS session as defined in clause 7.2.2.3.

The multicast session state transits from Inactive to Active after MBS Session activation procedure, see clause 4.3.\nMBS Session deactivation procedure is for multicast only. MBS Session deactivation procedure is triggered by MB-SMF, when it receives the notification from MB-UPF in the case that there is no downlink data to be transmitted for some duration, or when it receives the request directly from AF or via NEF. The MBS Session deactivation procedure is used for deactivating the resources for MBS data at NG-RAN node. The multicast session state transits from Active to Inactive after MBS Session deactivation procedure, see clause 4.3.\nNOTE:\tFor services (e.g. Mission Critical service) that require low latency and zero packet loss even for the first downlink packet(s), periodic keep-alive packets during interruptions of media transmission (e.g. Floor Idle as specified in TS 23.379 [27], referenced by TS 23.289 [21]), which are sent over user plane of an MBS session, can be used in order to prevent a deactivation of the MBS session based on MB-UPF notifications and to keep UEs within the MBS session in a state where they can receive the MBS session data without being paged. It is up to implementation that the periodicity of the keep-alive packets configured in the AF needs to consider NG-RAN's configuration.\nThe following can trigger the MBS session activation procedure:\n-\tAF requests MB-SMF to activate the MBS session;\n-\tMB-UPF receives the multicast data and notifies MB-SMF.\nThe figure depicts the MBS session activation procedure, illustrating the steps taken by the MBS to initiate a session with a user. The figure shows the MBS's interface, the user's device, and the network's infrastructure, including the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network elements such as the MBS, the user's device, and the network's network\nFigure 7.2.5.2-1: MBS session activation procedure\nIn this procedure, steps 11 to 15 are executed if the MB-SMF finds out there are shared tunnel established. Steps 11 to 15, if needed, are executed in parallel with steps 2 to 10.\n1.\tThe procedure may be triggered by the following events:\n-\tWhen the MB-UPF receives downlink data for a multicast MBS session, based on the instruction from the MB-SMF (as described in clause 7.2.5.3), the MB-UPF sends N4mb Notification (N4 Session ID) to the MB-SMF for indicating the arrival of DL MBS data.\n-\tThe AF sends MBS Activation request (TMGI) to the MB-SMF directly or via NEF.\n2.\tMB-SMF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify (MBS Session ID, multicast session state = Active) to SMF(s).\nThe SMF sets the related multicast MBS session state to Active and finds out the list of UEs that joined the multicast MBS session identified by the related TMGI. If the SMF determines the user plane of the associated PDU session(s) of the UE(s) with respect to the TMGI are activated already, steps 3-8a will be skipped for those UE(s), i.e. executed from step 8b.\n3.\tThe SMF invokes Namf_MT_EnableGroupReachability Request (List of UEs, [PDU Session ID of the associated PDU Sessions], TMGI, [UE reachability Notification Address], [most demanding ARP, 5QI of all MBS QoS Flow within MBS session])) to AMF(s). When later UE is reachable, the UE reachability Notification Address is used by the AMF to identify and notify the related SMF.\nAfter receiving the request, for each UE in the list, the AMF determines CM state of the UE: see steps 4 - 7.\n4a.\tIf there are UEs involved in the multicast MBS Session and in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF indicates those UEs to the SMF, using Namf_MT_EnableGroupReachability Response (UE list). Otherwise, the response does not include UE list.\n4b.\tFor each UE in the UE list included in step 4a, if the QoS profile(s) for associated PDU Session has not yet been provided, the SMF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, MBS Session ID, [QoS profile(s) for associated QoS flow(s)], [mapping information between the unicast QoS flow and multicast QoS flow])) to the AMF for the UE which is identified in step 4a. The associated unicast QoS Flow(s) as well as the mapping information between the unicast QoS Flow(s) and multicast QoS Flow(s) are included to support the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery.\nThe SMF may also include the MBS assistance information for the MBS session in N2 SM Information, if the MBS subscription data from the UDM contains the MBS assistance information which includes the ID(s) of the MBS session(s) that the UE joined. The MBS assistance information for MBS session sent to the NG-RAN is described in clause 6.17.\nThe procedure continues at step 9.\n5.\t[Conditional] If AMF determines that there are UEs in CM-IDLE state and involved in the multicast MBS Session, the AMF figures out the paging area covering all the registration areas of those UE(s), which need to be paged. The AMF may apply paging differentiation as specified in clause 6.12. The AMF sends a Multicast Group paging request message to the NG-RAN node(s) belonging to this Multicast Paging Area with the involved UE list and TMGI as the identifier to be paged if the related NG-RAN node(s) support MBS. If the AMF knows that the NG-RAN node(s) do not support MBS based on configuration, the AMF sends Paging message(s) to the NG-RAN node(s) per UE as described in step 4b in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [6].\nNOTE 1:\tIn addition to the paging in clause 6.12, other paging strategies is up to AMF implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tIf NG-RAN performs the Group paging, it can indicate that the MBS session data is allowed to be received in RRC_INACTIVE state. More details of the paging are specified by the RAN WGs.\nNOTE 3:\tCM-IDLE UEs using power saving function are included by the AMF in Group paging as specified in clause 7.2.10.\n6.\tReceiving the paging, the UE(s) in CM-IDLE state sends Service Request message to the AMF, see clause 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 [6].\nNOTE 4:\tStep 6 for a UE can be parallel to step 5 for another UE(s), which has not received any paging yet.\nAfter receiving the Service Request sent by the UE(s),\n-\tEither based on the received PDU Session ID in step 3, the AMF invokes steps 7a/7b to update the related PDU sessions; or:\n-\tBased on the received UE reachability Notification Address in step 3, the AMF identifies and notifies the related SMF of the UE(s), which are reachable now and the Location Information, by using the Namf_MT_UEReachabilityInfoNotify message. In this case, it can be a separated notification or combined with step 8.\n7a/7b.\tBased on the received PDU Session ID in step 3, the AMF identifies the related SMF and invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request. The SMF replies with Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\nThe SMF may also include the MBS assistance information for the MBS session in N2 SM Information, if the MBS subscription data from the UDM contains the MBS assistance information which includes the ID(s) of the MBS session(s) that the UE joined. The MBS assistance information for MBS session sent to the NG-RAN is described in clause 6.16. The procedure then continues at step 9.\n8a.\tFor UE(s) that do not respond to paging, the AMF informs the SMF of the paging failure in Namf_MT_UEReachabilityInfoNotify.\n8b.\tFor UE(s) that is indicated as reachable via the Namf_MT_UEReachabilityInfoNotify message, or user plane of the associated PDU session is activated already but the QoS profile(s) for associated QoS flow(s) needs to be provided for the PDU session, the SMF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (N2 SM information ()) to the AMF same as described in step 4b.\nThe SMF may also include the MBS assistance information for the MBS session in N2 SM Information, if the MBS subscription data from the UDM contains the MBS assistance information which includes the ID(s) of the MBS session(s) that the UE joined. The MBS assistance information for MBS session sent to the NG-RAN is described in clause 6.16.\n9.\tThe AMF sends N2 request message (N2 SM information ()) to the RAN node.\nNOTE 5:\tA joined UE is not able to receive MBS data if NG-RAN rejects the PDU Session Resource setup request (due to implementation specific reasons, e.g. activation of user plane fails due to the number of UEs reaching a limit).\n10a.\tIf the shared tunnel has not been established before, the shared tunnel is established at this step, as defined in clause 7.2.1.4. The NG-RAN configures UE with RRC messages if needed.\nIn this step or at later stage, NG-RAN may determine whether to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state for the MBS session, as defined in clause 6.16.\nNOTE 6:\tWhether and when the NG-RAN determines to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state for the MBS session as defined in clause 6.16 is to be decided by NG-RAN.\n10b.\tSteps 8 to 12 defined in clause 7.2.1.3 are performed. If 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used, the SMF configures the UPF for individual delivery and if necessary, requests the MB-SMF to configure the MB-UPF to send multicast data to the UPF.\n11.\tIf the MB-SMF finds out there are shared tunnel established, step11-15 are performed. The MB-SMF invokes Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer Request (TMGI, N2 SM Information (Activation, TMGI)) to the AMF for those NG-RAN nodes, which have shared tunnel with MB-UPF. This step may be performed in parallel with step 2.\nNOTE 7:\tThe messages in steps 10a, 11 and 12 are MBS-specific and it is possible that the AMF(s) in steps 10a, 11 and 12 are not associate to any UEs involved in the multicast MBS Session.\n12.\tThe AMF sends NGAP activation request message (N2 SM Information ()) to the NG-RAN nodes. For those UEs that have joined in the MBS Session and are in RRC_INACTIVE state, the RAN nodes perform RAN paging as specified in TS 38.300 [9]. If Group paging is triggered, the NG-RAN may indicate that the MBS session data is allowed to be received in RRC_INACTIVE state as specified in clause 6.17.\nNOTE 8:\tUEs in RRC_INACTIVE state are to be considered for RAN paging related to an MBS session even if those UEs are using power saving functions, e.g. MICO (Mobile Initiated Connection Only) mode with Active Time, or extended DRX (Extended Discontinuous Reception) as defined in clause 5.31.7 of TS 23.501 [5].\n13.\tThe NG-RAN nodes responses to AMF by NGAP activation response message. The NG-RAN nodes establish radio resources to transmit multicast MBS session data to the UE(s).\nIn this step or at later stage, NG-RAN may determine whether to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state for the MBS session, as defined in clause 6.16.\nNOTE 9:\tWhether and when the NG-RAN determines to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state for the MBS session as defined in clause 6.16 is to be decided by the NG-RAN.\nIf the NG-RAN determines that a UE receives the multicast MBS data in RRC_CONNECTED state, the NG-RAN shall not release the radio connection of a UE that has joined into the Multicast MBS session only because no unicast traffic is received for the UE.\n14.\tAMF to MB-SMF: Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer Response ().\n15.\tThe MB-SMF sends N4mb Session Modification Request to the MB-UPF to forward the received MBS packets. The MB-UPF responds to the MB-SMF with N4mb Session Modification Response acknowledging the MB-SMF request.\nNOTE 10:\tDepending on implementation, step 15 can be executed after the first successful response in step 14 to shorten the activation time, or buffering at the MB-UPF can be applied sufficiently long for the majority of RAN nodes to activate the MBS session to reduce packet loss.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the MBS session deactivation procedure, illustrating the steps involved in terminating a session. The figure includes a series of steps, such as selecting the session to be deactivated, initiating the deactivation process, and confirming the deactivation. The steps are visually represented by arrows and labels, making it easy to understand the sequence of actions. The figure is a useful tool for understanding the process of deactivating a session in a MBS environment.\nFigure 7.2.5.3-1: MBS session deactivation procedure\nIn this procedure, steps 3 to 4 and steps 5 to 9 are executed in parallel.\n1.\tThe procedure may be triggered by the following events:\n-\tWhen MB-UPF detects there is no data receives for the MBS Session, MB-UPF sends MB-N4 Notification (N4 Session ID) to the MB-SMF for deactivating the MBS session.\n-\tAF sends MBS Deactivation request (TMGI) to the MB-SMF directly or via NEF.\n2.\tThe MB-SMF sends an N4mb Session Modification Request (TMGI, [Buffered Downlink Traffic detection]) to the MB-UPF. The Buffered Downlink Traffic detection is requested by MB-SMF to be informed by the MB-UPF about incoming MBS data. The MB-SMF triggers MBS session activation once informed. If the MBS session is to be activated via the AF request directly, the Buffered Downlink traffic detection is not needed, but the MB-SMF still instructs the MB-UPF to stop forwarding and possibly to buffer MBS data.\nMB-UPF to MB-SMF: N4mb Session Modification Response acknowledging the MB-SMF request.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is up to stage 3 to determine whether MB-UPF keeps the DL F-TEID(s) for N3mb and N19mb interfaces.\n3.\tThe MB-SMF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify request (MBS Session ID) to the SMFs.\nBased on the received MBS Session ID, the SMF sets the indicated multicast MBS session state to Inactive:\n‐\tIf the SMF finds out there are UE(s) that joined the indicated multicast MBS session and use 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery, step 4 is performed for those UE(s).\n‐\tIf SMF find there are no UE(s) that joined the indicated MBS session and use 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery, no further operation for SMF is required.\n4a.\t[Conditional] For UE(s) for which the 5GC individual delivery is used, step 3b and steps 4-8 in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [6] are performed to remove the associated QoS flow(s) related to the multicast MBS session.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether the associated QoS Flow(s) are removed from UE, NG-RAN, or only resource in NG-RAN is removed is up to implementation.\n4b\t[Conditional] For UE(s) for which the 5GC individual delivery is used, the related SMF(s) may keep the shared tunnel that is used for Individual MBS traffic delivery over N19mb interface. If the SMF decides to release the shared tunnel, steps 3 to 6 in clause 7.2.2.2 need to be performed.\n5.\tIf the MB-SMF finds out there are shared tunnel established over N3mb interface, the MB-SMF sends Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer Request (TMGI, N2 SM information (Deactivation, TMGI)) to the AMFs.\n6.\tThe AMF sends NGAP deactivation request message (N2 SM information ()) to the NG-RAN nodes.\n7.\tThe NG-RAN node keeps the multicast MBS Session Context and N3mb shared tunnel for the multicast MBS session.\nIf the MBS Session Context indicates no UE for the multicast MBS session (e.g. due to UE becomes CM-IDLE state), the NG-RAN triggers release of the shared delivery as described in clause 7.2.2.4.\n8.\tNG-RAN acknowledges the NGAP deactivation Response message.\n9.\tThe AMF invokes Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer Response to acknowledge the service for MB-SMF.\nWhen the MBS session is in \"Inactive\" state and handover procedure is triggered, it is defined in clause 7.2.3.6.\nNOTE 3:\tThere is no explicit \"deactivation\" indication to the UE, how the UE is changed to IDLE state is defined in TS 38.300 [9].\n",

The figure includes a flowchart with arrows indicating the sequence of actions, and labels for each step, such as \"Update MBS,\" \"Update MBS,\" and \"Update MBS.\" The figure is a visual representation of the complex process of updating the MBS system, highlighting the importance of communication and coordination in managing the system state.\nFigure 7.2.6-1: Multicast MBS Session update procedure\n1.\tThis procedure is triggered by the MB-SMF receiving the updated service requirement, an updated multicast session security context from the MBSF and/or MBS Service Area for a multicast MBS Session, see clauses 7.1.1.6 and 7.1.1.7.\n2.\tThe AF providing the updated service area may also inform UEs at application level about the new service area via a service announcement.\nNOTE 1:\tIf a UE is located in a cell which was previously outside the service area and is now inside the updated service area, the UE can join the multicast service as specified in clause 7.2.1.3.\nFor QoS updates steps 3 to 7 are performed.\nFor MBS Service Area update steps 3 to 7 may be performed to allow NG-RAN to terminate data transmission in the area which is no longer in the MBS Service Area.\n3.\tThe MB-SMF invokes Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer service operation (MBS Session ID, [Area Session ID], N2 SM message container (TMGI, [QoS profile(s) for multicast MBS session], [MBS Service Area], [Area Session Id])) to the AMF(s).\n4.\tThe involved AMF sends N2 MBS session request (N2 SM message container) to NG-RAN nodes handling the multicast MBS session and possible Area Session ID based on the RAN node IDs stored in the AMF for the MBS session.\n5.\tThe NG-RAN node updates the QoS profile and/or MBS Service Area for the multicast MBS session based on the N2 MBS session request. If only QoS parameters are updated without multicast QoS flows added/removed, the NG-RAN may also update the QoS parameters of the associating PDU Sessions.\nFor MBS Service Area update, the NG-RAN updates the MBS Session Context with the updated MBS Service Area. The NG-RAN stops transmission of the related multicast data in the cell(s) which is within the old MBS Service Area but now outside the updated MBS Service Area. The NG-RAN also configures the UE not to receive the MBS data over the radio interface if the NG-RAN detects the UE(s) was in the previous MBS Service Area but is outside the updated MBS Service Area. If the NG-RAN node no longer serves any cells within the updated MBS service area, it requests to release shared delivery resource as defined in clause 7.2.2.4.\n6.\tThe NG-RAN node(s) acknowledges N2 MBS session request by sending an N2 MBS session Response message to the AMF.\n7.\tThe AMF invokes the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextUpdate () to the MB-SMF.\n8.\tThe MB-SMF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify request (MBS Session ID, [QoS profiles for multicast for MBS session], [MBS Service Area], [Area Session ID], [updated multicast session security context]) to the SMFs. For MBS Service Area updates, if an Area Session ID exists, the MB-SMF provides the MBS Service Area corresponding to the Area Session ID to the SMFs involved in the multicast MBS session. For QoS updates, the MB-SMF notifies SMFs handling all MBS service areas.\n9.\tThe SMF determines the affected UEs it serves based on the multicast MBS Session ID and Area Session ID (if provided) received in the step 8.\nThe subsequent steps 10 to 12 are executed for each affected UE. For QoS updates, steps 10 and 11 are skipped.\n10.\t[Conditional] For an MBS Service Area update, if the SMF previously subscribed at the AMF to notifications about the UE moving in or out of a subscribed \"Area Of Interest\", the SMF updates the subscription with the new MBS Service Area as area of interest.\n11.\t[Optional] When the MBS Service Area is updated, if the SMF does not have the latest UE location, the SMF queries AMF which then query the NG-RAN for the current location of the UE to determine whether the UE is within the updated MBS Service Area.\n12.\t[Conditional] For QoS Updates, if the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used, or if the associated QoS flows is to be added/removed, the SMF triggers PDU Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.502 [6]. If the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used, the SMF may also configure the UPF with the updated QoS and/or updated or removed QoS flows.\nFor MSK updates, the SMF also triggers PDU Session Modification procedure and provides the updated multicast session security context in the N1 SM container.\nFor MBS Service Area update, the SMF triggers the PDU Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.502 [6] with the following enhancement:\n-\tThe SMF also updates the PDU session resources associated to the multicast MBS session with the new MBS service area in an N2 container. The RAN node serving the PDU session starts or terminates transmission of multicast content in cells which are added or removed in the updated service area, respectively, and if necessary, interacts with the MB-SMF to start or terminate the distribution of multicast data to the RAN node.\n-\tTowards the UE, the SMF provides the MBS service area in N1 SM container to the UE. For a UE previously inside the MBS service area but now outside the updated MBS service area of the multicast MBS session, the SMF may alternatively, based on operator policy, inform the UE in the N1 SM container that the UE has been removed from the multicast MBS session.\n-\tTowards the NG-RAN, the SMF provides the updated MBS service area in N2 SM information. For a NG-RAN node supporting MBS, it starts transmission of multicast content in cells which are added in the updated MBS service area if UEs within the Multicast MBS session are within those cells, and if necessary, the NG-RAN interacts with the MB-SMF to start the distribution of multicast data to the RAN node. The RAN node stops transmission of multicast content in cells which are removed from the updated MBS service area, and if necessary, the NG-RAN interacts with the MB-SMF to terminate the distribution of multicast data to the RAN node\n-\tFor Individual delivery and a local Multicast MBS session the following applies: For a UE previously inside the service area but now outside the updated MBS service area, the SMF removes associated unicast QoS flows for the multicast MBS session. For a UE previously outside the service area but now inside the updated service area, the SMF adds associated unicast QoS flows for the multicast MBS session to the PDU session resources.\n",

Whether the UE performs MBS join procedure in advance and stays \"joined\" or every time at activation time is left up to UE implementation.\n-\tIf a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state or in CM-IDLE state or CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state, and reachable (e.g. in active time in MICO or PTW for eDRX), due to other reasons at the start time and the scheduled activation times, the UE follows the related MBS procedures (e.g. clause 7.2.1 for UE join and clause 7.2.5.2 for MBS Session Activation) with the following enhancement:\n-\tAt MBS Session Activation, when the AMF perform group paging, the AMF also includes the CM-IDLE UEs using power saving function(s).\n-\tIf a UE is in CM-IDLE state or CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE and in deep sleep (i.e. unreachable for paging to the network) at the possible start time and the possible scheduled activation times, the UE leaves the deep sleep state at the session start time and the possible scheduled activation times to allow MBS related procedures (e.g. clause 7.2.1 for UE join and clause 7.2.5.2 for MBS Session Activation):\n-\tAt the possible start time, an RRC_IDLE or CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE UE needs to send a request to transition to RRC_CONNECTED state and join the MBS multicast session (if not done before).\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE become reachable in the network for the unicast service as well.\n-\tAt the possible scheduled activation times, an RRC_IDLE UE that already joined the multicast MBS session needs to listen for paging requests and if paged by the network follow the existing procedures in clause 7.2.5.2. How long the device listens to paging is left up to device implementation.\nNOTE 3:\tHow long the UE need to listen to paging is left up to UE implementation.\n-\tWhen the UE is in the middle of an MBS data transfer, and the UE is scheduled to move to deep sleep due to power saving, e.g. end of PTW for extended idle mode DRX, expiration of active time for MICO or the UE transitioning from CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE in the case of MICO with no active time, then the UE does not go to deep sleep during the remainder of the current MBS data transfer.\nNOTE 4:\tIf at the end of the current MBS data transfer the UE knows there is another MBS data transfer scheduled soon, depending on the time between MBS data transfers, the UE can decide to go to sleep between MBS data transfers.\n",

It is possible for AF to allocate TMGI once but create the MBS Session for multiple times. A combined procedure to perform both TMGI allocation and MBS Session Create is available.\nThe TMGI Allocation is used by AF to obtain the TMGI as MBS Session ID (i.e. TMGI) and perform service announcement towards UEs.\nThe MBS Session Create (with MBS service type set to broadcast service) is used by the AF to indicate the impending start of the transmission of MBS data, and to provide the session attributes, so that resources for the MBS Session are set up in the MB-UPF and in the NG-RAN for 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery. The MBS Session Create can be used if TMGI has not been allocated. In this case, MB-SMF will allocate a unique TMGI for the AF and then start the MBS Session.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the multicast transport between NG-RAN and MB-UPF is described below, source specific multicasting is assumed.\nTo receive the data of broadcast communication service, the UE is either preconfigured with needed configuration (see TS 24.575 [26] for UE pre-configuration) for the UE to receive MBS service, or provisioned with the configuration of Broadcast MBS session on application level (service announcement as described in TS 26.502 [18] and TS 26.517 [22]). If the needed configuration is pre-configured, the UE does not need to interact with network.\nThe figure depicts the process of MBS session establishment for broadcast, illustrating the steps taken by the MBS to establish a session with the broadcast network. The figure shows the MBS, the broadcast network, and the broadcast station, with the MBS initiating the session by sending a broadcast request to the broadcast network. The broadcast network then responds with a broadcast request to the MBS, and the MBS sends a broadcast request to the broadcast station. The broadcast station then sends a broadcast request to the MBS, and the MBS sends a broadcast response to the broadcast station. The figure illustrates the flow of data and the steps taken to establish a session between the MBS and the broadcast network.\nFigure 7.3.1-1: MBS Session Establishment for Broadcast\n0\tBased on OAM configuration, RAN nodes announce in SIBs over the radio interface information about the MBS FSA IDs and frequencies of neighbouring cells.\n1.\tTo establish broadcast MBS session, the AF performs TMGI allocation and MBS session creation as specified in clause 7.1.1.2 or 7.1.1.3. The MBS service type indicates to be broadcast service. The MBS FSA ID(s) of a broadcast MBS session are communicated in the service announcement towards the UE. The UE compares those MBS FSA IDs(s) with the MBS FSA ID(s) in SIBs for frequency selection.\n2.\tThe MB-SMF may use NRF to discover the AMF(s) supporting MBS based on the MBS service area and select the appropriate one(s). Then the MB-SMF sends the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate (TMGI, N2 SM information ([LL SSM], 5G QoS Profile), MBS service area, [MBS FSA ID(s)]) messages to the selected AMF(s) in parallel if the service type is broadcast service. The MB-SMF may include a maximum response time in the request.\n3.\tThe AMF transfers the MBS Session Resource Setup Request message, which contains the N2 SM information in the received Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate Request to all NG-RANs which support MBS in the MBS service area. The AMF includes the MBS service area.\n4.\tNG-RAN creates a Broadcast MBS Session Context and stores the TMGI and the QoS Profile in the MBS Session Context. The LL SSM are optional parameters and only provided by MB-SMF to NG-RAN if N3mb multicast transport is configured to be used in the 5GC. If MBS FSA ID(s) were received, the NG-RAN may use those MBS FSA ID(s)s to determine cells/frequencies within the MBS service area to broadcast MBS session data based on OAM configuration about the MBS FSA IDs and related frequencies.\nDepending on the NG-RAN's preference to use multicast or unicast transport over N3mb and the availability of the LL SSM, step 5a or step 5b is executed.\n5a.\tIf NG-RAN prefers to use N3mb multicast transport (and if LL SSM is available in NG-RAN), the NG-RAN joins the multicast group (i.e. LL SSM).\n5b.\tIf NG-RAN prefers to use N3mb unicast transport (or if the LL SSM is not available in NG-RAN) between the NG-RAN and MB-UPF, NG-RAN allocates its N3mb DL Tunnel endpoint to receive downlink MBS session data.\n6.\tThe NG-RAN reports successful establishment of the MBS Session resources (which may include multiple MBS QoS Flows) by sending MBS Session Resource Setup Response (TMGI, N2 SM information ([N3mb DL Tunnel Info])) message(s) to the AMF. If NG-RAN prefers to use N3mb unicast transport (or if the LL SSM is not available in NG-RAN) between the NG-RAN and MB-UPF, NG-RAN provides its N3mb DL Tunnel Info as part of the N2 SM information. For more details, refer to TS 38.413 [15].\n7.\tThe AMF transfers the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate Response () to the MB-SMF. The AMF should respond success when it receives the first success response from the NG-RAN(s). And if all NG-RAN(s) report failure, the AMF should respond failure. The MB-SMF stores the AMF(s) which responds success in the MBS Session Context as the downstream nodes. If the AMF receives the NG-RAN response(s) from all involved NG-RAN(s), the AMF should include an indication of completion of the operation in all NG-RANs. If received from NG-RAN node, the N3mb DL Tunnel Info and NG-RAN ID are included in the response.\n8.\t[Conditional] If N3mb unicast transport is to be used (i.e. N3mb DL Tunnel Info is present in the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate Response message from AMF) in a deployment where NG-RAN nodes share a common user plane entity, the MB-SMF only establishes the shared tunnel towards the DL GTP tunnel endpoint if the shared tunnel has not yet been established (as determined based on the stored DL GTP Tunnel endpoint(s) for the MBS session). The MB-SMF also stores the received DL GTP Tunnel and corresponding NG-RAN Node ID for the MBS session. For the deployment where NG-RAN nodes do not share a common user plane entity, the DL GTP tunnel will not be used by other NG-RAN nodes. In a deployment where NG-RAN nodes do not share a common user plane entity, the MB-SMF always establishes the shared tunnel towards the DL GTP tunnel endpoint.\nTo establish the shared tunnel towards the DL GTP tunnel endpoint, the MB-SMF sends an N4mb Session Modification Request to the MB-UPF to allocate the N3mb unicast transport tunnel for a replicated MBS stream for the MBS Session.\n8a-8b.\tIf the AF subscribed to a Delivery Status Indication (see clause 7.3.5), the MB-SMF notifies the AF as specified in step 2 of clause 7.3.5. The MB-SMF notifies the AF The MB-SMF notifies the AF directly by invoking Nmbsmf_MBSSession_StatusNotify service operation, or the MB-SMF notifies the AF via NEF/MBSF (if deployed) by invoking Nmbsmf_MBSSession_StatusNotify service operation to the NEF/MBSF which then invokes Nnef_MBSSession_StatusNotify service operation to the AF.\n9.\tNG-RAN broadcasts the TMGI representing the MBS service over radio interface. Step 9 can take place in parallel with step 6.\n10.\tAnother NG-RAN may report successful establishment of the MBS Session resources (which may include multiple MBS QoS Flows) by sending MBS Session Resource Setup Response (TMGI, N2 SM information ([N3mb DL Tunnel Info])) message after the AMF transferred the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate Response () to the MB-SMF.\n11.\tThe AMF transfers the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request () to the MB-SMF. When the AMF receives the response from all NG-RAN nodes, the AMF includes an indication of the completion of the operation. If the AMF does not receive responses from all NG-RAN nodes before the maximum response time elapses since the reception of the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate Request, then the AMF should transfer the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request () which indicates partial success or failure.\n12.\t[Conditional] If N3mb unicast transport is to be used (i.e. N3mb DL Tunnel Info is present in the MBS Session Start Response message from AMF), the handling in MB-SMF and MB-UPF is the same as specified in step 8.\n13.\tThe AF starts transmitting the DL media stream to MB-UPF using the N6mb Tunnel, or optionally un-tunnelled i.e. as an IP multicast stream using the HL MC address.\n14.\tThe MB-UPF transmits the media stream to NG-RAN via N3mb multicast transport or unicast transport.\n15.\tThe NG-RAN transmits the received DL media stream using DL PTM resources.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 6-8 and 2-4 are comparable to step 2-5 and 6-7 in clause 7.2.1.4, respectively.\n",

The options are presented in a hierarchical manner, with the most important options at the top and the least important ones at the bottom. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different options and their meanings.\nFigure A-1: Configuration options at Service and/or Application\nThe following characteristics describe each of the Configuration options:\n-\tConfiguration Option 1: No MBSF:\n-\tThis configuration is used for Transport Only Mode (i.e. MBS provides only transport of MBS data in a transparent manner without modifying the data), when the Multicast service or Broadcast service does not require service layer interworking with LTE MBMS.\n-\tThe control plane entry point for the Application Function outside the trusted domain towards 5GC to request establishment of an MBS session is the NEF via N33.\n-\tAn application function within the trusted domain can directly use the N30, N5 and N29mb service based interfaces. In this case some NEF functionality related to PCF and MB-SMF interaction is incorporated in AF.\nNOTE 1:\tApplication function within the trusted domain selects MB-SMF based on e.g. its local configuration, or query NRF based on location, etc.\n-\tThe user plane entry point for the Application Function towards 5GC is the MB-UPF via N6mb.\n-\tConfiguration Option 2: MBSF, N33 towards AF:\n-\tThis configuration may be used for Service Mode (i.e. MBS provides service layer capability, allows to modify the data), or when service layer interworking with LTE MBMS is required, or when the functionalities of MBS security is used (see clause 6.13).\n-\tWhen interworking with LTE MBMS for Transport Only Mode services, N33/Nmb5 and Nmb8 provide the same functionalities as N33/N13mb and N6mb respectively.\n-\tThe control plane entry point from the Application Function to request establishment of an MBS session is the NEF via N33.\n-\tThe user plane entry point for the Application Function towards 5GC is the MBSTF via MB2-U, xMB-U or Nmb8.\n-\tThe NEF and MBSF may be collocated.\n-\tIf the MBSF is not collocated with the NEF, the reference point between the NEF and MBSF is Nmb5.\n-\tAn application function within the trusted domain may be collocated with MBSF.\n-\tConfiguration Option 3: MBSF, MB2-C/xMB-C/Nmb10 towards AF:\n-\tThis configuration may be used for Service Mode (xMB-C or Nmb10), or when interworking with LTE MBMS is required (MB2-C, xMB-C or Nmb10), or when the functionalities of MBS security is used (see clause 6.13).\n-\tWhen interworking with LTE MBMS for Transport Only Mode services, Nmb10 and Nmb8 provide the same functionalities as Nmb13 and N6mb respectively.\n-\tThe control plane entry point from the Application Function to request establishment of an MBS session is the MBSF via MB2-C, xMB-C or Nmb10.\n-\tThe user plane entry point for the Application Function is the MBSTF via MB2-U, xMB-U or Nmb8.\nFor service mode, MBSF shall be used, i.e. either Configuration 2 or Configuration 3 shall be used. In this case, the MBSF instructs the MBSTF to modify the MBS data (e.g. including the FEC or MBS data transcoding).\nFor Configuration Option 2 and Option 3, when interworking with LTE MBMS is used, LTE MBMS and MBS use the same mode (i.e. both use Transport Only Mode or Service Mode).\nFor Transport Only mode:\n-\tIf interworking with LTE MBMS at 5GC is required for the service, MBSF and MBSTF shall be used, i.e. either Configuration 2 or Configuration 3 shall be used.\n-\tIf interworking with LTE MBMS is not required for the service, MBSF and MBSTF are optional.\nNOTE 2:\tInterworking providing by AF is out of scope of this specification.\nMBSTF shall be used when MBSF is used.\nAny particular deployment may support any combination of these configurations.\nThe following service levels for the multicast communication service are defined:\nNOTE 1:\tTransport Only mode and Full-Service mode of operation as defined in TS 23.246 [8] differ from the service levels defined here.\n-\tBasic service level. The following requirements are defined:\n-\tMedia transported transparently through the 5GS.\n-\tInteractions between UE and network for receiving the multicast communication service.\n-\tPacket distribution from the 5GS ingress to NG-RAN node(s).\n-\tData delivery from NG-RAN node(s) to the UE.\n-\tEnhanced service level, with additional requirements on top of basic service level. Different requirements out of the set below may be necessary to address each use case:\n-\tLocal MBS service.\n-\tUser authentication and authorization for Multicast MBS session.\nNOTE 2:\tUser authentication and authorization is an optional feature in 5GS.\n-\tExplicit configuration of Multicast MBS session by AF, including group member information.\n-\tEnhanced QoS support. E.g. to differentiate MBS data flow with different QoS over 5GS.\n\nTo allow the MBS System to interwork with a GCS AS supporting the MB2 interfaces defined in TS 23.468 [10]:\n-\tIn addition to supporting the Nmbsf service-based API at Nmb10 (as defined in clause 5.1) the MBSF shall support interfaces MB2 C.\n-\tIn addition to supporting content ingest interfaces defined in TS 26.502 [18] at Nmb8 (as defined in clause 5.1) the MBSTF shall support interfaces MB2 U.\nTo allow the MBS System to interwork with a Content Provider supporting the xMB interfaces defined in TS 26.348 [11]:\n-\tIn addition to supporting the Nmbsf service-based API at Nmb10 (as defined in clause 5.1) the MBSF shall support interface xMB C.\n-\tIn addition to supporting content ingest interfaces defined in TS 26.502 [18] at Nmb8 (as defined in clause 5.1) the MBSTF shall support interface xMB U.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with GCS (Gigabit Ethernet Carrier) supporting MB2 interfaces and Content Provider supporting xMB interfaces. It illustrates the interworking between these two systems, highlighting the use of MB2 interfaces for data transmission and xMB interfaces for content delivery. The figure also shows the use of GCS for network management and security, as well as the integration of xMB interfaces for content delivery.\nFigure C-1: Interworking with GCS AS supporting MB2 interfaces and with Content Provider supporting xMB interfaces\n\n",
