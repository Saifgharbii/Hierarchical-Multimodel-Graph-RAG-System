            "description": "Many operators around the world both have mobile network and fixed network operations. Operators provide triple-play, combining mobile communication, fixed telephony and broadband Internet, or even quad-play, adding TV, to customers in the consumer / residential market. In this market, operators can distinguish themselves by providing an optimal integration between the different services. Following the trend of wireline/wireless convergence, operators are integrating their fixed and mobile networks into a single core network with fixed and mobile access networks.\nEven for single play mobile network operators optimising 5G residential services is relevant. One of the main benefits that 5G brings to consumers is that it will provide higher bitrates. These higher bitrates will enable or improve eMBB services such as mobile TV, AR/VR, or mobile gaming. Remarkably, to a large extend such 'mobile' services are used by users that are not on the move. Generally hourly patterns for mobile data traffic show that the highest mobile data usage is in the evening, when people are enjoying mobile data services whilst at home.\nThe given telecommunication figure, Figure 4-1, depicts a daily pattern of cellular usage in KPN, illustrating the usage of different types of mobile devices and the corresponding network coverage. The figure shows the usage of different mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, across different time zones and locations. It also highlights the network coverage, with different colors representing different types of mobile devices and their corresponding network coverage. The figure provides a visual representation of the daily pattern of cellular usage in KPN, allowing users to understand the usage patterns and network coverage of different mobile devices.\nFigure 4-1: example daily pattern of cellular usage (source KPN)\nThe pattern of cellular data usage implies that residential environments are very important in 5G usage. The residential environment is where a large portion of 5G traffic will be handled. And the residential environment is not the easiest environment to provide network coverage. With video/TV services and AR/VR gaming, residential users demand high bitrates and with a concentration of media traffic can easily require significant capacities. High bitrates and high capacity are best provided with mmwave frequencies. However, at mmwave frequencies it will be difficult to provide outside-to-inside coverage with operator base stations. Also with indoor base stations, it will not be easy to provide sufficient indoor coverage. Scenarios with a PRAS in every room (e.g. integrated in the light fixture in the centre of the ceiling) may be needed to provide really good in-home coverage. This also requires upgrades to fixed access, residential gateways and in-home cabling. At the same time, it is virtually impossible for an operator to install and manage their own radio access infrastructure in a residential environment. Where in a large office, the operator can provide and manage indoor coverage, in a residential environment the installation of radio equipment, cabling will likely be left to the homeowner (Authorised Administrator).\nCurrently fixed broadband services work on a different premise than mobile services. With mobile services, each individual device is known and identifiable in the mobile network. That implies that services can be provided to individual devices. With fixed broadband services, the operator provides Internet access to a residential gateway. Behind that residential gateway is usually a LAN, but individual devices on that LAN are not known or identifiable in the core network. For an integrated fixed broadband / mobile residential 5G offering, it would be beneficial if devices behind an eRG can also be known and identified in the core network.\nThe trend towards Wireline / Wireless Convergence is already recognised in 3GPP. In collaboration with the BroadBand Forum (BBF), architecture solutions have been specified where a single 5G core network is used to also control fixed broadband access. Also, solutions like 5G LAN and UE relaying have been specified with residential use cases (partly) in mind. Nevertheless, there are still areas where improvements for residential use are needed/useful to achieve the vision of a residential 5G without boundaries between fixed broadband and mobile.\n",

                            "text_content": "In many cases, residential indoor coverage will require the deployment of indoor base stations or access points. Especially for multimedia services like UHD TV, or AR/VR gaming high bitrates are needed. This in turn requires the use of higher frequency bands (e.g. 3.5 GHz or 26/28 GHz for NR or 5 GHz, 6 GHz or 60 GHz for WiFi based radio access). At these frequencies, outdoor to indoor coverage from an outdoor PLMN is challenging. Also indoor penetration throughout a house is problematic, requiring multiple Premises Radio Access Stations (PRASs).\nFor 5G services that require specific QoS (e.g. guaranteed bitrate, latency) or e.g. that rely on edge applications, it is important that the 5G network can differentiate the related service data flows in order to treat them accordingly. This also applies in case a PRAS is connected via an evolved Residential Gateway (eRG) and an indoor infrastructure. In the Wireline Wireless Convergence work between 3GPP and BBF, the eRG is seen as an UE. That way the eRG can request QoS for the fixed access network. Also on the radio interface between the UE and the PRAS, QoS control can work as normal. An issue however is how QoS is provided on the backhaul between the PRAS and the eRG and in the eRG. It is not guaranteed that this backhaul has sufficient QoS. Also prioritization of specific service data flows may be needed to provide the expected QoS. Finally, the eRG may have to request specific QoS for the fixed access network for specific service data flows.\nNote:\tin the use case, we generally refer to PRAS, but the similar requirements apply for e.g. a WiFi6 access point that is connected to the 5G core (non-3GPP access) via an eRG.\n",

The size of that game is over 100 Gbyte so even on 5G it will take a while. Good thing that Scott's parents had PRASs installed in the house. 5G coverage would otherwise have been dismal in the basement and downloading would have taken forever.\nWhile the game is downloading, Oliver and Scott decide to play their favorite multi-user AR/VR game. Each put on a VR headset, get a controller and start gaming. The AR/VR game they play is cloud based with rendering in an edge node. This way they can play the game wherever they want and still have optimal quality of experience. The low latency ensures they have no 'lag' when they move their head or when they try to shoot each other in the game. Good thing also that the 5G system makes sure that the AR/VR game is prioritized over downloading the game. That the download takes a bit more time is not a big issue, but without the usual settings for frames per second and resolution or with additional lag because of the download the game would be 'unplayable'.\n",

Communication for the visitor has to be protected against eavesdropping or manipulation in the residential in-home network and/or evolved residential gateway.

One aspect is that the homeowner may not want to be charged for traffic, services, and applications initiated by the visitor. Another aspect is that the homeowner may not want the visitor to access his private devices in the home (e.g., working PCs, security cameras, etc.) via PRAS and evolved residential gateway.

                            "text_content": "In many residential scenarios, indoor coverage will require deployment of multiple PRASs or WLAN Access Points (APs). It is expected that both 3GPP RATs and non-3GPP RATs (e.g. WLAN) offer wireless connectivity allowing UEs to connect to local or external IP networks via the eRG, thus, as users move through the home, switching of connectivity between different PRASs or APs is required to maintain service quality.\nFor certain services requiring low latency and high throughput such as playing an interactive game on a VR/AR headset UE, there is a need to connect to a dedicated device within the CPN, for example a gaming console or a set-top-box.\nThe gaming console will provide the necessary service experience such as reactiveness when computing and rendering a new AR/VR scene displayed on the VR/AR headset (UE #1). In this use case, the gaming console can either be a 3GPP device, a non-3GPP device or support both RATs (3GPP and non-3GPP). The gaming console is part of the CPN.\nThe VR/AR headset (UE #1) will connect to the gaming console via one of the points of access (PRAS or AP) connected to the eRG.\nTo guarantee the required bandwidth and latency to the participants in the game, an authorized user e.g. the homeowner (Authorised Administrator) can initially, or dynamically via e.g. the gaming console or the eRG, reserve temporary access or capacity to particular UEs accessing particular PRASs and APs in the CPN during the game. Other UEs that generally are provided access to these PRASs and APs in the CPN, will during the game have a restricted or no access to certain PRASs and APs.\nAs a player moves around in the home, there will be a need to handover the VR/AR headset (UE #1) connection from one PRAS or AP to another. Although the VR/AR headset (UE #1) can connect simultaneously to an AP and to a PRAS, the VR/AR headset (UE #1) is not able to take educated decisions on its own with regards to capabilities of alternative accesses in the home, e.g. if a candidate handover access is overloaded. However, a centralized application can distribute accesses with respect to relevant applicative parameters like VR/AR headset, the position and the direction of the UE and buffer level. Besides, the centralized application can know the building map and where (e.g. location) the different players are and where they can be expected to move as the game progress.\nThe game application can also know the overall context for all players and can compute the best path for each UE for connecting to a particular point of access (PRAS or AP). This application can predict and adapt access to each 3GPP RAT or non-3GPP RAT for providing the best global service experience applied to each individual player at each time. The application can also learn from individual service experience resulting from past decisions applied to input parameters to improve access decisions.\nTo optimise the gaming experience, the gaming console can control which particular VR/AR headset (UE #1 or UE #2) connects to a particular point of access (PRAS #1 or PRAS #2 or AP #1 or AP #2) to reach the application. For example, the gaming console can disable a VR/AR headset (UE #1) to connect PRAS (PRAS #2) in order to force this VR/AR headset (UE #1) to connect to PRAS (PRAS #1).\nThe figure depicts a local control system for a PRAS (Point-to-Point Radio Access System) for a UE (User Equipment) to access a CPN (Centralized Peripheral Network) device. The system includes a control unit (CU) and a communication unit (CU), which are connected to the PRAS and CPN devices, respectively. The CU is responsible for controlling the PRAS and the CU is responsible for controlling the CPN device. The figure illustrates the communication between the CU and CU, as well as the communication between the CU and the PRAS.\nFigure 5.12.1-1. Local control of PRASs for UE #1 to access CPN device\n",

When a UE requests to obtain multicast services, it sends an IGMP/MLD Join message to 5GC. When receiving the IGMP/MLD Join message, 5GC checks whether the UE is allowed to join the requested multicast group based on multicast service access control information. If the UE is allowed to join the requested multicast group, 5GC will transmit the corresponding multicast service to the UE. Otherwise, the UE is not allowed to receive the requested multicast service.\nIPTV service, a kind of multicast service, is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/ audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP-based networks managed to support the required level of QoS/QoE, security, interactivity and reliability. Set Top Box (STB) is a legacy device used to obtain IPTV service via an eRG, which is connected to 5GC as shown in Figure 5.x.1-1. Currently, the IPTV network access control granularity is RG level, which means that all STBs behind a RG will share the same access right. If network can perform a more granular multicast service access control when multiple devices connect to an eRG, users might have a better service experience.\nThe figure depicts a residential gateway (RG) in a 15-11 network, which is a 15-11 network.

Cable provides an order magnitude higher speed but Lily has heard sometimes lot of people use the internet in the evenings and it crashes so she chooses for the one with cable access and the additional wireless capability as the wireless service can both compliment the cable and either can act as a backup in case one fails. The IPTV provider also supports the download of a media server onto the eRG to enable localized access to popular contents that Lily and her family watches often but at different times. The contents have an expiration for when it will be removed from the media server, but Lisa has the option to extend the expiration. The media server also supports streaming live high definition pay-per-view events and is able to utilize both wireless and cable accesses to meet the required QoS. Lily also has a home security alarm system. She is able to configure the eRG so the security alarm system can use the cable access as the primary access and the wireless access as the backup access. In addition, she also has IoT devices such as cameras, window and door sensors, humidity and temperature sensors, etc. Some of the IoT devices do not have subscription for cellular access and the wireless operator can configure the eRG to block traffic from those devices from being routed onto the cellular access.\nLily’s friend Lisa owns a small business and also employs an eRG that supports both cable and wireless access connectivity. The eRG not only provides communication path redundancy for the business but also network management services for the devices behind the eRG. Lisa is able to configure the eRG so that the security system uses the cable access as the primary access and the wireless access as the backup access. In addition, Lisa has requested from the wireless operator a firewall function that runs on the eRG to provide network security for the business. Both Lisa and the wireless operator are able to configure the firewall for different aspects of the firewall operations. Lisa is able to configure firewall rules while the wireless operator is able to configure and manage the orchestration and update of the firewall software in the eRG.\n",

The local cloud provides storage services for files, video, and photo album, etc. Dora configures applications/services information and registers to these applications with her user account of the network operator Cannon-Beach for the local cloud storage services hosted on the device behind the eRG in the CPN, by which each application/service is associated to a User Identity and corresponding User Profiles.\nWhen enabling these applications/services in her user account, these services/applications can use strong user authentication from the 5G system to the applications running on the device behind the eRG in the CPN.

Since her UE has been authenticated by the 5G system and she has already been authenticated for the connection to the eRG, there is a high level of confidence regarding her identity. This level of confidence is increased based on Dora’s location and the elapse time from the last authentication of her identity.\nStep4: In the meantime, the application client of photo album on her UE automatically synchronize her photos to the photo album application on the local cloud in the CPN. Since Dora also enabled the strong user authentication by the 5G system for this photo album application, her UE can automatically sign in and upload the photos to the photo album application on the local cloud.\nStep5: The 5G system may request her strong re-authentication so as to ensure that she is still the actual authorized user behind the UE, which is achieved by having Dora re-authenticated by operator Cannon-Beach, e.g. over the biotech sensors (e.g. for face, fingerprint, voice) of the UE.\n",

Outdoor-to-indoor coverage may be an issue at 3.5 GHz and will certainly be difficult at mmwave frequencies. Providing coverage with indoor solutions may be the answer; Premises Radio Access Stations (PRASs) can be connected via fixed access. 3GPP together with BBF has provided Wireline Wireless Convergence architecture solutions where fixed access is considered part of the 5G System.\nMost houses have only one entry network point where the evolved Residential Gateway (eRG) will be installed. Connectivity to the eRG may be fixed access, 5G Fixed Wireless Access, or a hybrid of both.\n\nInHome Scenario: A 1-1 connection is depicted in Figure 6.1, illustrating the setup for a residential home. The diagram shows the connection between the router and the modem, with the router acting as the primary device for data transmission. The modem is connected to the router via a wired Ethernet connection, ensuring a reliable and stable connection. The router is equipped with a firewall and antivirus software to protect the connection from potential threats. The modem is also equipped with a modem-to-router bridge, allowing for seamless switching between the two devices.

At mmwave frequencies, even a PRAS per room (living room, kitchen, bed rooms, attic) may be required as higher frequencies will be blocked significantly by walls, et cetera.\n",

Most other services (e.g. mobile telephony) will not significantly contribute to the traffic load.\nWe assume the house has two UHD TVs, two VR headsets for gaming, and two office settings for working from home (for e.g. multimedia conferencing). Not all devices will be used at the same time. On the other hand, visitors may also bring/use devices. Assumption is that one UHD TV, two VR headsets for gaming and two office settings are used simultaneously, each at the maximum user experienced data rates of 1 Gbit/s DL and 500 Mbit/s UL. This results in an overall capacity for the house of 5 Gbit/s DL (UHD TV is DL only) and 2 Gbits/s UL.\nThe assumption is that different Premises Radio Access Stations (PRASs) are deployed around the house. Not all devices will use the same PRAS. Maximum per PRAS data rates are assumed to be half of that per house.\n",

It is argued that providing an excellent 5G experience in an in-home setting is very important as in-home is where many 5G users will spend a large amount of time, especially when using highly demanding services such as UHD-TV, AR/VR or mobile gaming. Based on the different use cases, requirements have been generated on topics such as Premises Radio Access System, evolved Residential Gateway, service discovery, provisioning, et cetera.\nThere are also some requirements related to 5G-LAN, where the existing 5G-LAN requirements already in [2] are being expanded.\nThe resulting potential requirements have been consolidated in clause 7 of the TR. The content of clause 7 should be considered as the basis of normative Release 18 requirements to support 5G for residential use cases.\n",
