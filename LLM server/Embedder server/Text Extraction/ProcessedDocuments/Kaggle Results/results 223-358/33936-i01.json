                            "text_content": "The definitions of network product class and network product were documented in the TR 33.916 [2]. For implementing 3GPP defined functionalities in network products, some functionalities that relate to the supporting platform (e.g. hardware components, operating system, etc.) also need to be implemented. The platform provides execution environment for 3GPP defined functionalities. For physical network products, the platform and the 3GPP defined functionalities are tightly coupled, while for virtualized network products, the platform and the 3GPP defined functionalities are decoupled. The platform of virtualized network products composes of a hardware layer and a Virtualization layer, and is common for 3GPP defined functionalities. Concept of 3GPP VNF is defined in TS 28.500 [3]. According to the concept in [3], a 3GPP VNF is 3GPP network function(s) that runs on a Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), which is the platform of virtualized network products described above.\nThe realistic deployment scenarios are summarized in ETSI NFV-SEC 001 [4], based on which a 3GPP network operator can deploy 3GPP defined functionalities in three modes:\n-\tMode 1. A network operator purchases 3GPP VNFs from its vendors and deploys it on a third party NFVI.\n-\tMode 2. A network operator purchases 3GPP VNFs and the Virtualization layer (e.g. hypervisor) from its vendors, and deploys them on a third party hardware layer.\n-\tMode 3. A network operator purchases and deploys 3GPP VNFs, the Virtualization layer and the hardware layer from its vendors.\nEach deployment mode requires the different composition of virtualized network products purchased and deployed by a network operator, which are subject to the testing and evaluation in SECAM scheme. Accordingly, the different composition of virtualized network products maps to three types of virtualized network product class as depicted in Figure 1:\n-\tType 1: implement 3GPP defined functionalities only\n-\tType 2: implement 3GPP defined functionalities and Virtualization layer\n-\tType 3: implement 3GPP defined functionalities, Virtualization layer, and hardware layer\nThe figure depicts three types of virtualized network product classes: Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), and Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Each type is represented by a distinct color and a corresponding icon, illustrating their unique characteristics and functionalities. The figure provides a comprehensive overview of the various product classes, enabling network operators to understand the different components and their roles in the network architecture.\nFigure 4.1.1-1: Three types of virtualized network product class\nNOTE: \tConsidering the situation that type 2 and/or type 3 of virtualized product class are dependent of pre-mature specifications from other standard organization, only type 1 of virtualized product class are specified in present document.\n",

With the current SECAM as the basis, the present document aims to identify and address the gaps when applying the current SECAM to 3GPP virtualized network products as defined in clause 4.1.1.\nEditor's note: The text maybe revisited after update of TR33.916[2].\n",

So, it is applicable to all of the network products, regardless of whether the network product is physical network product or virtualized network product. It means, like for physical network products, the actors who perform the SECAM tasks for type 1 of 3GPP virtualized network products should also be accredited by the SECAM Accreditation Body.\nTable 4.4-1: Mapping between SECAM phases and involved party\n\nConsequently, according to table 4.4-1, SECAM can take different forms, depending on who performs security compliance testing and who performs Basic Vulnerability Testing.\nSECAM is intended to enable self-evaluation where the vendors evaluate their network products if they have the proper accreditation for that.\nThe responsibility for writing and managing the accreditation and monitoring rules is taken by a SECAM Accreditation Body. The SECAM Accreditation Body's role also includes the handling of the dispute resolution process.\nThe decision on who takes the role of SECAM Accreditation Body should be made in cooperation with other SDOs such as GSMA, etc. It is recommended to leave accreditation responsibility to GSMA.\nEven if it describes the complete process, including evaluation by accredited actors under SECAM Accreditation Body control and Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS) writing, SECAM does not preclude 3GPP SCAS security requirements and tests cases being used directly by mutual consent between vendors and operators without the accreditation process in place if it so desires. This ensures that the 3GPP SECAM work is not held up by delays in deliverables under the responsibility of external bodies, or by conflicting requirements in different countries (e.g. relating to accreditation).\nThe presence of a SECAM Accreditation Body as defined above is highly desirable in order to ensure a wide recognition of evaluation results and to have a working dispute resolution process available.

So, like GNP in TR 33.916 [2], the countermeasures deemed relevant to threat mitigation will also take the form of either:\n-\tsecurity requirements on the network product with associated test cases; or\n-\toperational environment security assumptions for a given product class.\nFor GVNP, the operational environment security assumptions among different product classes vary greatly, for example some sensitive 3GPP functions may need to be run from special security domain or may need to implement hardware (See clause 4.9 in TR 33.916 [2]) with special security requirement that make it difficult. It may also be necessary to consider such assumptions during testing so that stringent security requirements can be met. Any such consideration should be well-documented as part of both the testing environment so that the validation during product deployment can be carried out and duplicated.\nThe Security Requirements clauses within the pertinent TS contain the security requirements identified according to the threats (see figure 5.2.3.1-1).\nThe figure depicts a process for deriving security requirements in a SCAS document, illustrating the steps involved in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. The figure includes a flowchart with various stages, such as data collection, analysis, and decision-making, which are essential for creating a comprehensive security plan.\nFigure 5.2.3.1-1: Process for deriving security requirements in a SCAS document\nThe security requirements include security functional requirements and hardening requirements. Since SECAM tasks include Basic Vulnerability Testing, basic vulnerability testing requirements are also included in security requirements of a SCAS. The types of the security requirements are same as in TR 33.916 [2].\nThe three types of the levels of detail for security requirements in clause 5.2.3.1.1 of TR 33.916 [2] and the relationship between these levels are generic and are also applicable to describe the level of detail of security requirements for a GVNP.\nAccording to GVNP model and threat analysis, the categories of potential security functional requirements can also include the following category extension to the three categories in clause 5.2.3.2 of TR 33.916 [2]:\n-\tSecurity functional requirements related to virtualization layer, hardware and resource isolation, among others, which may be identified in ETSI specifications etc..\nThe security functional requirements in this category are within scope of SCAS and related test cases will be proposed.\nA SECAM Catalogue of General Security Assurance Requirements and associated test cases is proposed in clause 5.2.3.3 of TR 33.916 [2] to prevent from writing the same security requirements from scratch several times in different network product class SCAS. This generic way is also applied to SECAM of virtualized network product class.\nSince SECAM and SCAS of physical network product class are bases for SECAM and SCAS of virtualized network product class, the security requirements of a virtualized network product class will refer to the security requirements already available in the current SECAM catalogue if possible otherwise select the new ones from the agreed sources and update the Catalogue. The template for a security requirement description of virtualized network product also uses the template in current SECAM which is described in TR 33.916 [2].\nSome general guidelines for writing test cases (e.g. describing test case, verifiability and repeatability of test case etc.) are described in clause 5.2.3.4 of TR 33.916 [2]. These general guidelines are also used to guide writing test case of virtualized network product class.\nNOTE: \tAll the test cases in the present document do not apply to the scenarios where the tested interfaces are not standard compliant, e.g. when the VNF and VNFM are provided by the same vendor who has proprietary implementation on the interface between them.\n",

The vendor will define their own processes and describe them in written format. During an audit, the processes will be evaluated and their application on development activities in practice will be verified. An accreditation will be awarded, if the requirements are met.\nAs described in clause 6.2 of TR 33.916 [2], lifecycle management of virtualized network products also consists of establishing discipline and control in the updates of virtualized network product during its development and maintenance. Lifecycle management controls are important during normal improvement of virtualized network product as well as for vulnerability/security flaw remediation (documentation used to track vulnerability/security flaw, remediation procedure with relation to corrective actions for each identified vulnerability/security flaw…). The vendor accreditation for virtualized network product development and virtualized network product life cycle management processes will provide assurance for these aspects in SECAM.\nIn addition, for type 1 of virtualized network products, a VNF is instantiated through a series of operations, such as parsing VNF package files, parsing VNFD, instantiating VMs, etc, after a type 1 of virtualized network products (i.e. a VNF package and related softwares, etc.) to a operator delivered by a vendor. The VNF instance can be updated, migrated and deleted, scaled-in, scale-down etc., by VNFM. These processes is called VNF life cycle management defined in ETSI GS NFV 003 [12], it is different from the lifecycle management process of virtualized network products. Its audit and accreditation are out of scope in 3GPP.\nThe Vendor virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management processes assessment does not necessarily apply only to a single virtualized network product. Vendors can submit their generic virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management processes or a subset of them for auditing and accreditation. Generic virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management processes are usually used during development of all or some products of the same vendor. As different virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management processes could be utilized within the organization of one vendor, e.g. due to mergers or acquisitions, vendors could obtain and hold accreditation for different generic virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management processes.\nOnce the vendor obtains accreditation and as long as the accreditation has not expired, vendors are allowed to produce development process compliance declarations for the \"virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management processes compliance validation\" task on their own.\nAt the beginning of a SECAM evaluation of a product, the Vendor will have to provide a development process compliance declaration to the compliance tester containing a rationale showing that the generic accredited process was effectively applied in the virtualized network product development and virtualized network product lifecycle management of the virtualized network product under evaluation.\nRequirements and accreditation procedures for vendor development lifecycle process and product lifecycle maintenance process accreditation are specified in [10].\n",

According to the clauses 4.3, 4.5 and 4.6, the content and the process of SECAM evaluation from TR 33.916 [2] apply to GVNP of type 1.\nThe content of the SCAS instantiation evaluation from TR 33.916 [2], in clause 7.2.2.2 is generic and applies to type 1 of virtualized network products.\nIn addition, what the network product description provides is described from TR 33.916 [2], in clause 7.2.2.2.1, a compatibility description (such as which types of virtualization platforms VNF can be deployed on) can also be included in the type 1 of virtualized network product description, to facilitate the preparation of the NFVI supporting environment in the test phase.\nThe process from TR 33.916 [2], in clause 7.2.2.3 applies to type 1 of virtualized network products.\n",
