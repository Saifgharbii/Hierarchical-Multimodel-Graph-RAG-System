The Policy and Charging related 5G architecture and signalling flows are also described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [8].\nThe Policy Event Exposure Service (Npcf_EventExposure) is part of the Npcf service-based interface exhibited by the Policy Control Function (PCF).\nThe known NF service consumers of the Npcf_EventExposure service are the Network Exposure Function (NEF) and the Application Function (AF).\nThe Npcf_EventExposure service is provided by the PCF and consumed by NF service consumers (e.g. NEF, AF), as shown in figure 4.1.2-1 for the SBI representation model and in figure 4.1.2-2 for reference point representation model.\nThe Npcf_EventExposure service architecture, as depicted in Figure 4.1.2-1, illustrates the service's design and components. It includes a Service Broker (SBI), Event Exposer, and Event Exposer Service (EES). The SBI is responsible for managing the service's lifecycle, including event creation, event delivery, and event management. The Event Exposer is responsible for exposing the service's events to the network, while the Event Exposer Service (EES) is responsible for managing the event delivery process. The architecture is designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant, with redundant components to ensure reliability.\nFigure 4.1.2-1: Npcf_EventExposure service Architecture, SBI representation\n\nThe Npcf_EventExposure service architecture, as depicted in Figure 4.1.2-2, is a comprehensive framework that enables efficient and reliable event exposure management in a network. This service is designed to handle the complexities of event-driven applications, ensuring that the network remains resilient and responsive to changing conditions. The architecture is based on a layered design, with key components such as reference points, event sources, and event destinations. This design allows for efficient data flow and ensures that the network can handle a wide range of event types, from simple to complex, with minimal disruption. The service is also designed to be scalable, with the ability to handle large volumes of data and event sources, ensuring that the network can meet the demands of modern applications. Overall, the Npcf_EventExposure service architecture is a powerful tool for managing event exposure in a network, providing a reliable and efficient solution for event-driven applications.\nFigure 4.1.2-2: Npcf_EventExposure service Architecture, reference point representation\nNOTE:\tThe NWDAF and the DCCF can be consumers of the Npcf_EventExposure service to perform data collection. However, there is no data collected from the PCF by the NWDAF or the DCCF defined in this release of the specification.\n",

The user can select the desired plan, and the system will automatically update the subscription plan to reflect the selected options. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different options available for their subscription plan.\nFigure 4.2.2.3-1: Modification of an existing subscription\nTo modify an existing subscription to event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/npcf-eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as request URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step 1, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the subscription correlation ID of the existing subscription.
