This is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the test case was written.\nThe applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of Boolean expressions that are based on parameters (ICS). The parameters (ICS) included in TS 38.508-2 [8] are used in the test case applicability condition without reference. Parameters (ICS) specified in TS 36.521-2 [10] shall be referred with proper reference.\nSelection criteria of tested bands and tested CA configurations for each applicable test is formally expressed using group theory based on parameters (ICS) included in annex A of TS 38.508-2 [8] without reference.\nAdditional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well.\nThe columns in tables 4.1.1-1 / 4.1.2-1 / 4.1.3-1 / 4.1.4-1 / 4.2-1 / 4.2-2 / 4.2-3 / 4.2-4 / 4.2-5 / 4.2-6 / 4.2-7 / 4.2-8 / 4.2-9 / 4.2-10 have the following meaning:\nClause\nThe clause column indicates the clause number in TS 38.521-1 [1], TS 38.521-2 [2], TS 38.521-3 [3], TS 38.521-4 [4] and TS 38.533 [5] that contains the test body.\nTC Title\nThe TC Title column describes the name of the test and contains the clause title of the clause in TS 38.521-1 [1], TS 38.521-2 [2], TS 38.521-3 [3], TS 38.521-4 [4] and TS 38.533 [5] that contains the test body.\nRelease\nThe release column indicates the earliest release from which each test case is applicable. It may also indicate a range of releases or a single release to which a test case is applicable.\nApplicability - Condition\nThe following notations are used for the applicability column:\nR\trecommended - the test case is recommended to all terminals supporting NR\nO\toptional - the test case is optional\nN/A\tnot applicable - in the given context, the test case is not recommended.\nCi\tconditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\") depending on the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying a unique conditional status expression which is defined in Table 4.0-1. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ... THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\" is used to avoid ambiguities.\nApplicability - Comment\nThis comment column contains a verbal description of the condition included in the applicability column.\nTested Bands / CA/DC Configurations Selection\nThis column defines a set of bands / CA/DC Configurations the test is to be run for, if the test is applicable. If the set is empty, the test is considered as not applicable.\nThe following notations are used in the tested bands selection column:\nDi\tDerive the set based on Band Selection Criteria Di defined in table 4.0-2.\nEi\tDerive the set based on CA/DC Configurations Selection Criteria Ei defined in table 4.0-3.\nTBD\tBand selection not defined at this time, in the meantime test all Bands / CA/DC Configurations\nText\tFor more complex selection criteria, or if the criteria are already specified somewhere else in the spec, text reference to the clause is given.\nBranch\nThis column contains indication if the test case may perform differently depending on the UE capabilities.\nNOTE 1:\tVoid.\nNOTE 2:\tVoid.\nAdditional Information\nThis column contains indication if the test case may perform differently depending on the UE capabilities and the measurement execution.\nThis column also contains indication of the completion status of the test case.\n",
