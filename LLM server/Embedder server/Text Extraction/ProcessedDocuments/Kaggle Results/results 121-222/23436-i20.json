Data Collection Coordination is supported by a A-DCCF. ADAE server can send requests for data to the A-DCCF rather than directly to the Data Sources. A-DCCF may also perform data processing/abstraction and data preparation based on the VAL server requirements.\n-\tApplication layer – Analytics and Data Repository Function (A-ADRF) stores historical data and/or analytics, i.e., data and/or analytics related to past time period that has been obtained by the consumer (e.g. ADAE server). After the consumer obtains data and/or analytics, consumer may store historical data and/or analytics in an A-ADRF. Whether the consumer directly contacts the A-ADRF or goes via the A-DCCF is based on configuration.\nFigure 5.3-1 illustrates the generic functional model for ADAE when re-using the 3GPP network data analytics model.\nThe figure depicts the internal functional architecture of the ADAE (Adaptive Beamforming and Diversity Enhancing Antennas) system, highlighting its key components such as the adaptive beamforming, diversity enhancing antennas, and the distributed antenna arrays (DAA). The architecture is designed to optimize signal quality and enhance the overall performance of the system.\nFigure 5.3-1: ADAE internal functional architecture\nIn this model, an A-DCCF is used to fetch data or put data into an application-level entity (e.g. A-ADRF, Data Source). Such A-DCCF coordinates the collection and distribution of data requested by ADAE server (over ADCCF-1, ADAE-X). ADAE server can also directly interact with the Data Sources via ADAE-Y.\nAlso, Application layer – Analytics and Data Repository Function (A-ADRF) can be used to store historical data and/or analytics, i.e., data and/or analytics related to past time period that has been obtained by the ADAE server (via AADRF-1) or other NFs/NWDAF. ADAE server can also fetch historical data from A-ADRF. Whether the ADAE server directly contacts the A-ADRF or goes via the A-DCCF is based on configuration.\nData Sources can be 5GS data sources (5GC, OAM) or enablement layer data sources (SEAL, EEL) or external data sources at the DN side (VAL server/ EAS) and VAL UEs.  A-DCCF and A-ADRF can be used only for interacting with certain data sources (e.g., 5GC, OAM) based on configuration, and can be hidden from the VAL layer.\nNOTE:\tIf the Data Source is the VAL UE, then the data collection mechanism shall reuse the SA4 mechanism based on EVEX study (TS 26.531 [3]).\n",

It illustrates the various components and their interactions, such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the network slicing system. ADAES enables efficient data access and edge services, ensuring high-speed data transmission and efficient resource utilization.\nFigure 8.3.2-1: ADAES support for slice-related performance analytics\n1.\tThe consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends a subscription request to ADAES and provides the analytics event ID e.g. \"slice perf prediction\", the target S-NSSAI, DNN, NSI ID, the time validity of the request, the required confidence level, whether offline and/or online analytics are needed, area and time horizon, etc.\n2.\tThe ADAES sends a subscription response as an ACK to the consumer.\n3.\tThe ADAES subscribes to the Data Sources with the respective Data Collection Event ID and the requirement for data collection related to the request slice(s). Such requests may be towards:\n-\tOAM for providing PM data related to the requested slice / NSI. Alternatively, if the interaction to OAM happens via NSCE layer (see TS 23.435 [6]), such subscription can be performed to NSCE (where ADAES is acting as VAL server).\n-\tNWDAF for providing slice related analytics for the given area and time horizon (indicated in step 1). Such analytics can be the slice load level related network data analytics, or the service experience related network data analytics for a given slice\n4.\tThe ADAES based on subscription, receives PM data notification from OAM or from NSCE server (via OAM APIs or NSCE-S APIs)\n5.\tThe ADAES based on subscription, receives the requested NWDAF analytics outputs. Such analytics can be:\n-\tnetwork slice or NSI statistics or predictions (clause 6.3.3A of TS 23.288 [4])\n-\tper slice instance service experience stats or predictions (clause 6.4.3 of TS 23.288 [4])\n6.\tThe ADAES can also provide analytics on the VAL session performance (based on the procedure of clause 8.2.2 step 11 or clause 8.2.3 step 12) and filters the analytics only for the sessions which are connected to that requested slice for the area of interest.\n7.\tThe ADAES abstracts or correlates the data/analytics from steps 4-6 and provides analytics on the slice or NSI performance for the target VAL application/server. For example, such analytics can be about the min/average/max predicted RTT / end to end latency for the VAL application/server if this server uses a given slice/NSI (or for a list of given slices) within an area of interest.\n8.\tThe ADAES sends the analytics to the consumer, as a slice-specific performance analytics notification message.\n\n",

The figure illustrates the process of collecting data, processing it, and presenting the results in a structured format.\nFigure 8.6.2 -1: Service API analytics procedure\n1.\tThe subscribing entity (VAL server / API invoker, API provider) sends a service API event subscription request to the ADAE server to receive analytics for one or more service APIs.\n2.\tUpon receiving the event subscription request from the subscribing entity, the ADAE server checks for the relevant authorization for the event subscription. If the authorization is successful, the ADAE server stores the subscription information.\n3.\tThe ADAE server sends a service API event subscription response indicating successful subscription\n4.\tUpon sending the subscription response, the ADAE server requests to collect API logs to be used to derive analytics and triggers API invocation log pull request towards the CAPIF core function. The API invocation log fetch request indicates the API (or list of APIs) for which logs are required. Based on the ADAE server deployment, this can be a Query service API log request which is performed via CAPIF_Auditing API as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].\n5.\tThe CCF authorizes the request and fetches the API logs from the storage unit.

The exposure level can be known based on pre-configuration by the OAM or based on the subscription and type of invoker. The ADAE server then derives analytics on the target service API(s) based on the logs received from the CCF. Such analytics are predictions/stats for the API status based on the analytics event.\n9.\tThe ADAE server sends the analytics as event notifications to all the subscribing entities that have subscribed for the event matching the criteria.

ADAES and ADAEC have discovered available data producers and their data producer profiles.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of ADAES (Admission-Based Edge Analytics Support), a technology that enables edge analytics in 5G networks. It illustrates the architecture of the system, including the role of the edge analytics server (EAS), the edge analytics controller (EAC), and the edge analytics network (EAN). The figure highlights the importance of edge analytics in enabling real-time data processing and decision-making at the edge of the network, contributing to improved network performance and efficiency.\nFigure 8.8.2.1-1: ADAES support for edge analytics\n1.\tThe consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends an edge analytics subscription request to ADAES.\n2.\tThe ADAES sends an edge analytics subscription response as an ACK to the analytics consumer.\n3.\tThe ADAES maps the analytics event ID to a list of data collection event identifiers, and a list of data producer IDs. Such mapping may be preconfigured by OAM or may be determined by ADAES based on the analytics event ID and/or data producer profile (Table 8.2.4.8-1). Such Data Producers can be EASs onboarded to EDN, EESs, A-ADRF, as well as MEC Platform services.\n4.\tThe ADAES sends a subscription request to the Data Producers (EASs onboarded to EDN, EESs, A-ADRF, ADAEC) or the A-DCCF with the respective Data Collection Event ID and the requirement for data collection.\n5.\tThe Data Producers (e.g., EASs onboarded to EDN, EESs, A-ADRF, ADAEC) or the A-DCCF send a subscription response as a positive or negative acknowledgement to the ADAES.\n6.\tThe ADAES based on subscription receive offline stats/data on the edge DN load based on the analytics/data collection event ID from A-ADRF. Such stats can be about the load in terms of number of EAS or EES connections for a given area or time window, or the average edge computational resource usage or usage ratio based on the EDN total resource availability, EDN overload/high load indication events, probability of EAS/EES unavailability due to high load, etc.\n7.\tThe Data Producers at the edge start collecting data from the data generating entities. Such data can be measurements or analytics based on the data source/producer, as follows:\n-\tfrom OAM or EAS/ASP (for EAS load info): Per EAS/EES computational resource load, number of connections per EES/EAS\n-\tfrom N6 endpoint: N6 load\n-\tfrom 5GC / NWDAF: DN performance analytics\n-\tfrom OAM / MDAS: UPF load analytics (per DNAI)\n-\tfrom MEC platform services (e.g., RNIS): per cell radio conditions / load for all cells within EDN coverage\nNOTE 1: How the ADAES obtains the EAS load information from EAS/ASP is up to implementation.\nNOTE 2: Steps 6 and 7 are not necessarily sequential and can be performed in parallel or in different order.\n8.\tIf in step 4 ADAES sent a subscription request to ADAEC as Data Producer, data collection is initiated by ADAEC from UE data generating entities.\nNOTE 3:\tData collection at the UE reuses the SA4 mechanism based on EVEX study (TS 26.531 [3]).\n9.\tThe edge Data Producers (targets of the subscription requests in step 4) send the data to the ADAES (based on step 7 measurements or analytics) as a data notification message. Such data can be about the load in terms of number of EAS or EES connections for a given area or time window, or the average edge computational resource usage or usage ratio based on the EDN total resource availability, EDN overload/high load indication events, probability of EAS/EES unavailability due to high load, etc.\n10.\t ADAEC sends data (periodically or if a threshold is reached based on configuration) about the edge load as collected at the UE, e.g. in terms of number of AC or EEC connections for a given UE in a given time window, number of edge service sessions, etc.\n11.\tThe ADAES derives edge analytics on EDN / DNAI load or per EES/EAS load, based on the analytics ID and type of request. The analytics are derived based on the performance analytics received per DN or load analytics per DNAI/UPF; as well as considering measurements on the computational or RAN resource load or number of connections for the EES/EASs which are active at the EDN.\n12.\tThe ADAES sends the edge analytics to the consumer, based on the request and the derived analytics in step 9. Such analytics indicate a prediction of the EDN load considering inputs from both 5GS as well as from edge platform services. Such prediction can also be in form of a recommendation for triggering an EAS relocation to a different platform.\nFigure 8.8.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the analytics consumer to request analytics data of the application server(s) from the ADAE server.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of ADAES (Admission-based Adaptive Edge Computing) support for edge analytics. It illustrates the architecture of an edge analytics system, highlighting the role of the edge computing unit (ECU) in providing adaptive and adaptive computing capabilities. The figure includes various components such as the ECU, edge analytics engine, and edge analytics service, all interconnected to provide efficient and scalable edge analytics services.\nFigure 8.8.2.2-1: ADAES support for edge analytics\n1.\tThe analytics consumer sends a request message to the ADAE server to receive analytics data for one or more application servers. The request message includes the identity of the analytics consumer, security credential(s) for authorization and verification, identity of all the application server for which analytics data is requested, type of analytics data, time duration since when analytics data is required.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the ADAE server authenticates and authorizes the analytics consumer. If the analytics consumer is authorized, the ADAE server may get the analytics data by performing step 3 to 10 of clause 8.8.2.1. The ADAE server sends a response message including the statistical and predictive analytics data of the application servers for the requested duration period (if the time duration is available).\n",

ADAE server can use this information from the clients alone, for the predictions and share with the consumer of the analytics. This clause provides a mechanism for the ADAE client to send service experience report to the ADAE server. ADAE server upon receiving the service experience information from the UE side entities can use it for predictions of application performance analytics.\nNOTE:\tIn this solution, ADAE server uses data collection and reporting mechanisms as defined in 3GPP TS 26.531 [3], where the ADAE client acts as a UE application and ADAE server acts as an AF from Application service provider.\nEditor’s note: If the data collection mechanisms, necessary to meet the requirements to specify solution#5 of the TR 23.700-36, are not supported by 3GPP TS 26.531 [3], such mechanisms will be defined in this version of the specification based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-36.\n",

                            "text_content": "The ADAE client determines the service experience information based on information received from the VAL client. The service experience information includes application specific performance measurements like end-to-end response time, connection bandwidth, request rate, server availability time, etc. On request VAL client or any other trigger conditions, the ADAE client sends the service experience report about a VAL server to the ADAE server using the mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 26.531 [3]. The information elements as defined in clause 8.9.3.1 are used by ADAE client to send the request and clause 8.9.3.2 are used by ADAE server to send the response.\nFor direct reporting, if data reporting session is not available, the ADAE client creates data reporting session as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [3]. Once data reporting session is available, the ADAE client (acting as a UE client) sends reports to ADAE server using direct reporting method as specified in clause 5.5 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [3].\nThe ADAE server may take further actions based on the analysis of the report as shared by the ADAE client. A service experience information from certain UEs, can trigger the ADAE server to fetch further service experience information other UEs. Use the service experience information report from other UEs, to determine/predict analytics.\n-\tIf most of the UE side entities report a similar service experience, then it could be the application server problem across globally.\n-\tIf only some UEs report a bad service experience, the problem could be localized among a group of UEs.\n-\tIf the bad service experience from only a UE, the problem is localized to the UE.\nThe procedure can be initiated by the ADAE server upon receiving a service experience from an ADAE client, to fetch service experience information other ADAE clients or upon receiving VAL server performance analytics request from application service provider (application server) or any other event that requires the ADAE server to determine the service experience data.\nThe figure depicts a user interface (UI) for a telecommunication service, specifically a mobile application. The UI includes a pull-down menu with various options for service information, such as the type of service, the duration of the service, and the cost of the service. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear labels and icons for each option. The figure also includes a progress bar that shows the user's progress in selecting the desired service. Overall, the figure illustrates the design and functionality of a mobile application for telecommunication services.\nFigure 8.9.2.2-1: Pull service experience information from UE\n1.\tThe ADAE server sends Pull service experience request to the ADAE client. The request contains identity of the specific VAL server and VAL service ID, for which the service experience report is required, as mentioned in Table 8.9.3.3-1.\n2.\tUpon receiving the Pull service experience request from the ADAE server, the ADAE client may take user consent to send the report if the user consent is not available already.\n3.\tThe ADAE client sends the Pull service experience response to the ADAE server. The ADAE client instructs the Direct Data Collection Client to prioritise immediate delivery of a UE data report to the Data Collection AF as specified in clause 5.5 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [3]. The service experience contains parameters as specified in Table 8.9.3.4-1.\n4.\tThe ADAE server uses the service experience report for derivation of VAL server performance analytics.\nThe ADAE server configures triggers to the ADAE client to send the service experience report using the mechanism defined in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [3].\nThe procedure can be initiated by the ADAE server upon receiving VAL server performance analytics request from application service provider (application server). The information elements as defined in clause 8.9.3.5 are used by ADAE server to send the request and clause 8.9.3.6 are used by ADAE client to send the response.\n",

Such analytics can be about the edge load or the EAS performance and can be provided to consumers within EDN.\nIn this deployment the interaction between edge deployed ADAES is possible for exchanging edge/application analytics for application mobility scenarios or for cases when ADAES #1 and #2 service areas have overlapping coverage.\n\nThe figure depicts an E-dge deployed with ADAES (Adhesive Adhesive Electrodes) on the surface of the device.

Such coordinated deployments allow the local – global analytics derivation (which may be needed for improving the analytics confidence level). The centrally deployed ADAES can also act as ADAE analytics aggregator entity and configures the edge deployed ADAES to derive analytics on different sub-areas.\nOne example is the use of analytics for the EDN#1 or EDN#2 load which will help predicting the VAL server performance at a centrally located ADAES. Such deployment is also applicable for ML-based analytics methods, like supervised learning, where the centrally located ADAES acts as ML model training entity, and the edge located ADAESs can act as ML model inference entities (using edge data to improve the prediction accuracy).\nThe statistics/predictions that the edge deployed ADAES correspond to the ADAES service areas (as shown in the example in Fig A.4-1), which is equivalent to the EES/EAS service areas. The central ADAE server covers all PLMN area and is used to coordinate or jointly perform analytics with the distributed ADAES. Such analytics services can be provided to consumers at the central DN, like the VAL servers or SEAL services or even at the PLMN side (e.g. NWDAF consuming service experience analytics).\nThe figure depicts a coordinated deployment of ADAES (Admission-Based Access Edge Servers) in a 5G network. ADAES are designed to provide high-speed access to the network, with each serving as a gateway to the network. The figure shows the deployment of ADAES in various locations, ensuring optimal coverage and performance.\nFigure A.4-1: Coordinated deployment of ADAES\n\n",
