The characteristics of the Hand Phantom and Head Phantom are specified in Annex D.\nTalk mode is used to simulate user cases where the DUT is placed into a hand phantom, which is holding the DUT against the SAM head phantom, presenting a realistic voice call operation of the DUT. Same as Browsing mode, the DUT for talk mode shall also be mounted in a suitable hand phantom:\n-\tWide Grip Hand for UE with Width >72mm and ≤92mm\n-\tPDA Grip Hand for UE with Width ≥56mm and ≤72mm\nIn this section, the procedure provides the guideline on how to place the DUT+hand against the head phantom. The detailed DUT positioning into hand phantom for talk mode is defined in section 6.3.2 and 6.3.3.\nFor talk mode, the DUT is attached to the head phantom in “cheek” position. The DUT performance is measured on both left and right side of the head. Three points as shown in Figure 6.3.1-1 define the reference plane: centre of the right ear piece (RE), centre of the left ear piece (LE) and centre of mouth (M).\nDefinition of the ‘Cheek’ position:\n1. Align the ear piece of the phone (see Figure 6.3.1-1) at the line RE-LE. Then, position the DUT beside the phantom so that the vertical line (see Figure 6.3.1-3) is parallel to the reference plane in Figure 6.3.1-2 and is aligned with the line M-RE on the reference plane (see Figure 6.3.1-3).\n2. Position the DUT so that the ear piece of the DUT touches the ear piece of the phantom head on the line RE-LE. Tilt the DUT chassis towards the cheek of the phantom having the vertical line aligned with the reference plane until any point on the front side of the DUT is in contact with the cheek or until the contact with the ear is lost.\nNOTE:\tA holder fixture made of e.g. plastic may be used to position the handset against the phantom.\nThe figure depicts a reference plane on a head phantom, providing a front view of the reference plane. It is used to visualize the reference plane's position and orientation relative to the head phantom. The reference plane is essential for accurate head positioning during head-mounted imaging.\nFigure 6.3.1-1: Reference plane on head phantom, front view\n\nThe figure depicts a reference plane on a head phantom, showing a side view of the reference plane and its corresponding side view. The reference plane is a crucial component in the head phantom, providing a reference for the patient's head during the surgical procedure. The side view of the reference plane allows for a more detailed examination of the patient's head anatomy, helping surgeons to plan and execute the procedure accurately.\nFigure 6.3.1-2: Reference plane on head phantom, side view\nThe figure depicts reference lines at a mobile handset, illustrating the various components and connections involved in the communication process.\nFigure 6.3.1-3: Reference lines at a mobile handset.\nIn addition, 6°tilt angle from the cheek is being used instead of having direct contact between the cheek and DUT. A mask may be used to help configuration of cheek + 6° tilt angle. The mask is a 32 mm wide conformal strip, created by sweeping the surface of the head phantom through a 6º rotation about the ear. Direct DUT contact against the mask thus establishes the required 6º spacing away from the cheek, regardless of DUT form factor. The material for the head phantom mask spacer shall have dielectric constant of less than 1.3 and a loss tangent of less than 0.003. Material additions can be used to help fixing of the mask spacer onto the head phantom.\nIn summary, for head + hand phantom, keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in clause 6.2, while place the DUT and the hand phantom against the head phantom in such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt angle as described above.\n",

By rotating an omnidirectional antenna through the test volume as illustrated by the red line, this volumetric ripple may be probed to obtain an estimate of the measurement uncertainty due to this volumetric error. Note, however, that the volumetric ripple caused by multipath reflections is related to the wavelength and the relative path lengths of the direct and reflected paths to the measurement antenna, and is not inherently a function of the test volume. As illustrated in Figure 7.6.2-1(left), when the wavelength is relatively large compared to the test volume, it may not be possible to probe the entire range of errors that may actually exist within the test volume. Doing so would require probing an area larger than the test volume in order to accurately estimate the error within the test volume. Even when the test volume is several wavelengths in size, a given evaluation of the ripple may not completely caliper the worst-case error conditions within the test volume (Figure 7.6.2-1 (right)).\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a volumetric ripple and 20cm Phi axis cut, illustrating the process of creating a 3D model of a structure. The figure is used to analyze the structural integrity and stability of the object, as well as to understand the cutting process and the resulting shape.\nFigure 7.6.2-1: Volumetric ripple and 20cm Phi axis cut\nConversely, field non-uniformities in the test volume caused by amplitude taper of the measurement antenna and shadowing of portions of the test volume by support structure are geometric in nature and relate directly to the size of the test volume and the related factors of the measurement antenna and support structure. This test procedure attempts to capture the impact of these effects to within the practical limits of the available test volume and test equipment expected in the lab.\nThe quiet zone ripple test covers two cylindrical test volumes, one for handsets and smaller devices, with or without head and/or hand phantoms, and a larger volume for testing up to notebook PC sized devices.  The smaller cylinder is 30 cm in diameter, concentric to the phi axis, and 30 cm tall along the phi axis, centered on the intersection of the theta and phi axes.  The larger cylinder is 50 cm in diameter, concentric to the phi axis, with the base of the cylinder coincident with that of the smaller cylinder and a height of 36 cm along the phi axis.  The test consists of a set of individual ripple tests about the phi- and theta-axes utilizing both electric dipoles and magnetic loop dipoles to generate uniform omnidirectional dipole-like patterns about the axis of rotation. Data is measured on the co-polarized measurement antenna element for each corresponding test.\nFor the phi-axis ripple test, each reference antenna is oriented with its axis parallel to the phi axis at a total of three positions, offset 15 cm perpendicular to the phi axis with 0 cm and ±15 cm offsets parallel to the phi axis. At each position, the phi axis is rotated 360° to record the ripple. Each position is labeled by its radial and axial offset from the center position, (R, Z). See Figure 7.6.2-2 for additional information.\nThe figure depicts a test geometry for the Phi-axis, a key component in the design of a 5G network. The geometry includes a 5G base station (gNB), a user equipment (UE), and a set of scatterers. The figure illustrates the importance of this component in ensuring signal quality and reliability in a 5G network.\nFigure 7.6.2-2: Phi-axis test geometry\nFor the notebook sized test volume, three additional test positions are added to the phi-axis test in order to cover the larger test cylinder.  These positions are offset 25 cm perpendicular to the phi axis with -15, 0, and +21 cm offsets parallel to the phi axis, as shown in Figure 7.6.2-3.\nThe figure depicts a test geometry for a notebook-sized test volume, illustrating the Phi-axis test setup. The geometry includes a 3D printed test volume with a 10x10x10 grid, a 10x10x10 grid for the test volume, and a 10x10 grid for the test volume. The test volume is surrounded by a 10x10 grid for the test volume, and a 10x10 grid for the test volume.

Defining Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z) with the Z-axis along the phi-axis, the Y-axis along the theta-axis, and the measurement antenna moving in the XZ plane relative to the reference antenna used for the ripple test, the test positions are given as (±15 cm, 0, ±15 cm) and (0, ±15 cm, ±15 cm), relative to the center of the test volume as shown in Figure 7.6.2-4.  At each position, the theta axis is rotated over as much of 360° as supported by the system to record the ripple (e.g. ±165°).  For systems that can only move theta in the range of 0-180° or less, the phi axis may be rotated 180° and a second cut measured to meet or exceed the ±165° range.  Each position is labeled by its (X, Y, Z) offset from the center position.\n\nThe figure depicts a test geometry for the theta-axis test, which is used to measure the angular velocity of a pendulum. The geometry includes a pendulum, a pivot point, and a reference point, with the pendulum being the pivot point. The figure shows the angular velocity of the pendulum as a function of time, with the reference point at the pivot point. The theta-axis test is used to measure the angular velocity of a pendulum in a rotating frame, and the figure provides a visual representation of the test geometry.\nFigure 7.6.2-4: Theta-axis test geometry\nFor the notebook sized test volume, eight additional test positions are added to the theta-axis test in order to cover the larger test cylinder.  These positions are given as (±25 cm, 0, -15 cm), (±25 cm, 0, +21 cm), (0, ±25 cm, 0, -15 cm), and (0, ±25 cm, +21 cm), as shown in Figure 7.6.2-5.\nThe figure depicts a test geometry for the theta-axis test, which is used to measure the stress distribution in a material. The test volume is shown in a notebook-sized format, with the test geometry and stress distribution clearly labeled. The figure provides valuable information for engineers and researchers to understand the behavior of materials under stress and to design more efficient and reliable structures.\nFigure 7.6.2-5: Theta-axis test geometry for the notebook sized test volume\nFor each polarization and band, repeat the following steps:\nFor the phi-axis ripple test:\n1. Place the measurement antenna and any associated theta-axis positioner at theta = 90° such that the measurement antenna is boresight with the center of the quiet zone.  The measurement antenna should be at the same separation distance to be used for actual pattern measurements. This distance must be at least the minimum measurement distance away from the center of the quiet zone as defined in clause 7.7.  Select the polarization of the measurement antenna to correspond to the polarization (theta or phi) to be tested.\n2. Mount the reference antenna to the phi-axis positioner using a low permittivity dielectric support. Use the sleeve dipole for the theta polarization and the loop for the phi polarization. At each of the specified offset positions, ensure that the axis of the reference antenna is parallel to the phi axis of rotation.\n3. Attach a signal source to a coaxial cable feeding the measurement antenna and set the frequency to the appropriate channel. Set the amplitude to a level appropriate for the measurement receiver. Connect a measurement receiver to the reference antenna. The received signal during the ripple test measurement should be at least 40 dB above the noise floor or noise errors greater than 0.1 dB will result. Ensure that all coaxial cables are dressed to minimize effects upon the measurement results.\n4. Rotate the reference antenna about the phi axis and record the signal received by the measurement antenna at resolution sufficient to ensure smoothly varying curves for a total of 360°.\n5. Record the measurement results in a format suitable for calculating the ripple test metric.\n6. Record test parameters including: (a) the distance between the measurement and reference antennas, (b) cable losses and other losses associated with the measurement setup, (c) the power of the signal source at the reference antenna connector, and (d) the noise level of the receiver with no signal applied.\n7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 above for each reference antenna (polarization and band) for each of the required test positions.  In order to accommodate reference positioning in the lower portion of the quiet zone, support materials with a dielectric constant less than 1.2 may be removed to a maximum distance of 25 cm outside the quiet zone for the tests that require additional clearance.\n\nFor the theta-axis ripple test:\n1. Place the measurement antenna such that it is boresight with the center of the quiet zone.  The measurement antenna should be at the same separation distance to be used for actual pattern measurements. This distance must be at least the minimum measurement distance away from the center of the quiet zone as defined in clause 7.7. Select the polarization of the measurement antenna to correspond to the polarization (theta or phi) to be tested.\n2. Mount the reference antenna in the quiet zone using a low permittivity dielectric support and such that rotating the theta positioner will cause the measurement antenna to rotate relative to the reference antenna. Use the sleeve dipole for the phi polarization and the loop for the theta polarization. At each of the specified offset positions, ensure that the axis of the reference antenna is parallel to the theta axis of rotation.\n3. Attach a signal source to a coaxial cable feeding the measurement antenna and set the frequency to the appropriate channel. Set the amplitude to a level appropriate for the measurement receiver. Connect a measurement receiver to the reference antenna. The received signal during the ripple test measurement should be at least 40 dB above the noise floor or noise errors greater than 0.1 dB will result. Ensure that all coaxial cables are dressed to minimize effects upon the measurement results.\n4. Rotate the reference antenna about the theta axis and record the signal received by the measurement antenna at resolution sufficient to ensure smoothly varying curves for a total of at least ±165° or the equivalent (e.g. 0-360°).  For systems that are unable to rotate a full ±165°, the reference antenna may be mounted to the phi axis and two separate theta cuts from 0 to165° may be taken, after rotating the phi axis 180° between the first and second cut.\n5. Record the measurement results in a format suitable for calculating the ripple test metric.\n6. Record test parameters including: (a) the distance between the measurement and reference antennas, (b) cable losses and other losses associated with the measurement setup, (c) the power of the signal source at the reference antenna connector, and (d) the noise level of the receiver with no signal applied.\n7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 above for each reference antenna (polarization and band) for each of the required test positions.

The spatial uniformity test defines this working volume as the valid test zone of the chamber which must be large enough to contain the entire DUT plus any test scenario elements such as phantom fixtures. If DUT size is not known at the time of chamber validation, the minimum test zones described in the reference method [24] of 30cm × 30cm or 50cm × 36cm can be used in order to enable the same device size applicability. The test positions T describing this working volume need to maintain the same distance requirements as the calibration antennas throughout the procedure, i.e. reference antenna or DUT shall maintain a distance of more than 0.7 wavelengths from chamber loading and more than 0.5 wavelengths from reflective surfaces.\nThe value of the uncertainty contribution is determined by repeated calibration measurements fordifferent positions and orientations of the calibration antenna to determine the statistical variation as a function of frequency, or at least at the frequencies at which the chamber is to be used. It can be assumed that this uncertainty contribution value is normally distributed.\nThe T calibration configurations refer to T reference antenna positions. The operator should select these positions depending on whether or not a turntable is present in the chamber. The following instructions and explanation will assist the operator to perform the measurements.\nIf there is a turntable in the RC:\n-    Assume a cylindrical working volume by selecting two positions on the turntable (the outermost and innermost radial positions of the turntable are recommended). Then select two elevations (the highest and lowest possible are recommended, but far enough away from absorbent and metallic objects, if any). The cylindrical volume would become a toroid with rectangular cross-section if Rmin is non-zero due to proximity effects, as described in [22]. The role of the turntable is to stir the source to obtain more independent samples.\nIf there is no turntable in the RC:\n-    Choose eight positions as corners of an imaginary cubic volume. This means the recommended heights are the highest and lowest possible, but far enough away from absorbing and metallic objects.\nThe test steps are as follows.\n(a) Choose either a cylindrical or a cubic working volume if there is or is not a turntable in the reverberation chamber. As shown by the red dots in Figure 2, use either the 4 corners of the imaginary rectangle that would form the cylindrical working volume or the 8 corners of the cubic working volume as locations for the measurement. For each location, point the antenna at three different angles, preferably at three orthogonal orientations (e.g., 45 degrees, -45 degrees, and horizontal plane). This results in a number of 12 or 24 measurements i.e., T=12 or T=24.\n(b) Measure transmission coefficient  for all 12 or 24 in a complete mode stirring sequence.\n(c) Calculate the power  for all 12 or 24 positions. In this way, is the reference power transfer function for position  of the calibration antenna.\n(d) Calculate the average of power transfer function  over the calibration positions, i.e. or  using the following relation:\n\n(e) Calculate the standard deviation of the power transfer function over T different calibration antenna positions by\n\n(f) Calculate  in dB by\n\n(g) Repeat steps (a) through (f) for at least [25] frequency points evenly distributed across the NR FR1 bands.\n(h) Steps (a) through (g) are repeated for various chamber loading configurations, e.g. using absorbers or similar materials, to meet specific coherence bandwidth requirements.\n\nThe figure depicts a working volume with two distinct types of volumes: cylindrical and cubic. The cylindrical volume is represented by a circle with a radius, while the cubic volume is represented by a cube with a side length. The figure illustrates the relationship between the volume and its dimensions, highlighting the concept of volume in the context of a working space.The figure depicts a working volume with two distinct types of volumes: cylindrical and cubic.

                            "text_content": "This procedure to measure S-parameters through the reverberation chamber must be performed for each measurement setup in which the loading of the chamber has been changed. Examples of objects that change the loading are phantoms, absorbers, antennas, etc. The calibration procedure must be repeated for each frequency range as defined above. Therefore, it is advantageous if the vector network analyzer can be configured to a frequency sweep covering the defined frequencies, so that all frequencies of interest can be measured with a minimal number of measurements runs. Place all objects into the RC which will be used during TRP or TRS measurements, including a head phantom, hand phantom and fixture for the UE. This ensures that the loss in the chamber, which determines the average power transfer level, is the same during both calibration and test measurements, e.g., TRP and TRS measurements.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for the S-parameter in a Radio Channel (RC) using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The setup includes a vector network analyzer (VNA) and a signal generator, with the VNA capturing the signal and the signal generator generating the desired signal. The S-parameter is a key parameter in radio frequency (RF) systems, and this setup allows for accurate measurement of the S-parameter in the RC.\nFigure 8.4.1-1 S-parameter measurement setup in the RC, using a vector network analyzer\nStep-1: Place the calibration antenna in the chamber. The calibration antenna should be mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture (i.e., loss tangent less than 0.05), to avoid effects from the fixture itself which may affect the UE’s radiation efficiency and mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed in the chamber in such a way that it is far enough from any reflective and/or absorbing material such as walls, mode-stirrers, head phantom, or other object. This is to ensure that the environment for the calibration antenna (taken over the complete stirring sequence) resembles a free space environment. “Far enough away” depends on the type of calibration antenna used. For low gain nearly omni-directional antennas like dipoles, it is normally sufficient to ensure that this spacing is larger than 0.5 wavelengths from reflective objects and 0.7 wavelengths from absorbing objects at the lowest operating frequency. More directive calibration antennas should be oriented towards the center of the chamber. The calibration antenna should remain in the chamber during the TRP/TRS measurements.\nStep-2: Calibrate the vector network analyzer with a full 2-port calibration in such a way that the vector complex S-parameters between the ports of the fixed measurement antenna and the calibration antenna can be accurately measured. Preferably, the vector network analyzer is set to perform a frequency sweep at each stirrer position. This will enable calibration of several frequency points during the same stirring sequence, thereby reducing calibration time. This will also enable frequency stirring, i.e., averaging the measured power transfer function over a small frequency bandwidth around each measured frequency point (moving frequency window). This will increase accuracy at the expense of (lower) frequency resolution.\nStep-3: Place the calibration antenna in the chamber and connect it through the cables. The same procedure should be done for measurement antenna, if necessary. Measure the S-parameters for each fixed measurement antenna. The number of stirrer positions i.e. the number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point, should be chosen in such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable statistical contribution to the total measurement uncertainty. To this aim, at least 250 uncorrelated samples shall be used as defined in TR 37.941 clause 7.8.1 [18].\n",

The steps followed for the analyses are outlined and visualized in Table 9.2-1.\nFor the TRP analyses, a total of 10,000 rotation angles were applied and analysed. In order to apply uniform rotation vectors to the antenna pattern, the rotation angle around the y axis needed to be scaled. The rotations around the z axis were therefore handled in a completely random fashion, e.g., 360*rand(10000,1), while the distribution of rotations around the z axis needed to be scaled by sin(). The histograms of these two rotation angles are illustrated in Figure 9.2-12, while the uniform rotation vectors are illustrated in 3D in Figure 9.2-13.\nThe given figure, labeled as \"Figure 9.2-12,\" depicts a histogram of random distribution around the z and y axes. This figure is commonly used in data analysis to visualize the distribution of data points in a two-dimensional space. The histogram provides a visual representation of the frequency of occurrence of different data values, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of the data. The figure is particularly useful for understanding the distribution of data points in a specific context, such as a dataset from a scientific experiment or a dataset from a computer science project.\nFigure 9.2-12: Histogram of random distribution around the z and y axes.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of 10k random rotation vectors, illustrating their distribution and arrangement in a 3D space. The vectors are shown in a 3D coordinate system, with axes representing the x, y, and z-coordinates. The figure provides a visual representation of the random rotation patterns, which can be used to understand the distribution and arrangement of these vectors in a 3D space.\nFigure 9.2-13: Illustration of 10k random rotation vectors.\n\n\nTable 9.2-1: Overview of the various steps for the TRP measurement grid analyses including overview for sample constant-step size measurement grids and pattern.\n\nVarious constant-step size grids were analysed for two TRP quadratures, i.e., sin(theta), the legacy quadrature, and the Clenshaw-Curtis approach. Both are currently permissible for TRP/TRS testing. The calculated standard deviations and mean errors for both quadratures are tabulated in Table 9.2.-2 for below 3 GHz and in Table 9.2-3 for beyond 3 GHz. The last column includes a background colour with the following formatting\n-\tNo coloured background means the std. deviation is less than 0.05dB, i.e., that this grid could be used without any additional MU impact\n-\tyellow means the std. deviation is between 0.05dB and 0.25dB, i.e., this grid could be used with a small impact in MU\n-\tred means the std. deviation is beyond 0.25dB, i.e., these grids should not be considered any further.\nThe mean error column includes similar formatting where grids that yield an absolute value mean error between 0.05 and 0.25 dB are highlighted in yellow. These measurement grids might require a new MU element, or the mean error is included in the TIS calculation somehow. Grids with a red highlight have an absolute value of the mean error of greater than 0.25 dB and should be avoided.\nClearly, the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature has lower uncertainties compared to the sin(theta) quadrature, especially for very coarse grids.\nTable 9.2-2: Standard deviations and mean errors of TRPs after applying 10k rotations for various constant-step size measurement grids for below 3 GHz\n\nTable 9.2-3: Standard deviations and mean errors of TRPs after applying 10k rotations for various constant-step size measurement grids for beyond 3 GHz\n\nAnother important set of analyses was performed for the constant-step size grids beyond 3 GHz where the EIRP at the pole of  = 180° was either set to a very small number/null (due to a potential blockage due to the positioner /pedestal), extrapolated from the second to last cut (mean of all EIRPs), or extrapolated from two neighbouring points 15° off the pole, i.e., EIRP(=165°, =0°) and EIRP(=165°, =180°). Those results for the standard deviations and the mean errors summarized in Table 9.2-4 and 9.2-5, respectively. From the standard deviations in 9.2-4, it can be observed that the impact of how the EIRP at  = 180° is treated has little effect for measurement grids as coarse as 26 grid points while a small increase in standard uncertainty can be seen for the coarsest grid with 14 points regardless of whether the final grid point does not yield a reasonable measurement or whether it is extrapolated from the second to last cut. When the pole point is not measured and considered to be a deep null, unacceptable mean errors are observed for very coarse grids. The mean errors in Table 9.2-5 show that the averaging of the pole from the 2nd to last cut or the extrapolation of the two point 15° off the pole yield very good agreement with the previous simulations that assume the grid point at the pole can be measured without any obstruction/blockage. Those two approaches are illustrated in Figure 9.2-14 for a measurement grid using the ==45° grid where the grid point at=180° (shown in blue) is extrapolated either using 8 existing measurements at=135° (shown in red) on the left or with two new grid points at=165° (shown in red) on the right. The advantage of the more extrapolation approach using two new grid points at =165° becomes more evident when considering the coarsest measurement grid presented here, i.e., ==60°, which could be considered for IoT or RedCap devices in the future. The extrapolation approach of the grid point at=180° that relies on either on the existing 8 measurements at =135° or the two close neighbours at =165° is considered necessary for above 3 GHz TRP measurement grids for the most accurate extrapolation and lowest MUs.\nThe figure depicts a grid of 14 points, each marked with a letter and a corresponding number. The grid is divided into two equal halves, with the top half containing 9 points and the bottom half containing 5 points. The points are arranged in a 45-degree angle, with the top half of the grid being 45 degrees and the bottom half being 90 degrees. The figure illustrates the concept of extrapolation, which is a method used to estimate the value of a function at a point that is not in the domain of the function. The figure provides a visual representation of the grid and the 45-degree angle, which is used to calculate the value of the function at each point.The figure depicts a grid of 14 points, each marked with a letter and a corresponding number.

            "description": "Individual uncertainty contributions in the TRP and TRS measurements are discussed and evaluated in this Annex. A technique for calculating the total measurement uncertainty is also presented.\nAn important part of a standard measurement procedure is the identification of uncertainty sources and the evaluation of the overall measurement uncertainty. There are various individual uncertainty sources in the measurement procedure that introduce a certain uncertainty contribution to the final measurement result. The approach in this standard test procedure is that the test laboratories are not limited to using some specific instruments and antenna positioners, for example.\nThe TRP/TRS measurement procedure can be considered to include two stages. In Stage 1 the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute gain/radiation efficiency is known at the frequencies of interest. In Stage 2 the actual measurement of the 3-D pattern of the Device Under Test (DUT) is performed. The uncertainty contributions are analysed in clause B.2 while the uncertainty budget and example tables related to TRP and TRS are listed in clauses B.4 and B.5 respectively.\nThe calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement [10]. Each individual uncertainty is expressed by its Standard Deviation (termed here as ‘standard uncertainty’) and represented by symbol U. The uncertainty contributions can be classified to two categories: Type-A uncertainties, which are statistically determined e.g. by repeated measurements, and Type-B uncertainties, which are derived from existing data e.g. data sheets. Several individual uncertainties are common in Stage 1 and Stage 2 and therefore cancel.\nThe procedure of forming the uncertainty budget is:\n1)\tCompile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for TRP or TRS measurement in both Stage 1 and Stage 2.\n2)\tDetermine the standard uncertainty of each contribution by\na)\tDetermining the distribution of the uncertainty (Actual, U-shaped, rectangular, normal, etc.)\nb)\tDetermining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the distribution is Actual)\nc)\tCalculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by  if the distribution is U-shaped, by  if the distribution is rectangular, and by 2 if the distribution is normal.\n3)\tConvert the units (if necessary) of each uncertainty element into the chose unit, i.e. dB.\n4)\tCombine all the standard uncertainties by the root-sum-squares (RSS) method to derive the ‘combined standard uncertainty’.\n5)\tMultiply the result by an expansion factor of 1.96 to derive expanded uncertainty at 95% confidence level: .\n6)\tSystematic errors, commonly either DUT or test system dependent, captured in the MU budget are added to the expanded uncertainty to derive the ‘total expanded uncertainty’, i.e.,\n\nNOTE 1: The standard deviation from a data set of N samples is defined as\n\nWhere  are the the respective sample results and  the mean of all N samples. For an uncertainty  in dB, the dB values (instead of the linear powers) of  and  are used.\nThe combination of uncertainties is performed using dB values for simplicity. It has been shown that using dB uncertainty values gives a slightly worse combined uncertainty result than using linear values for the uncertainties. The analysis method therefore errs on the safe side.\n\n",

This data consists of single-axis pattern cuts that represent the sum of direct and reflected rays from a highly symmetrical omnidirectional radiation pattern measured at various points throughout the test volume. The data must be measured in sufficient spatial or angular resolution to accurately capture the peaks and nulls of the pattern to within a small fraction of the overall ripple contribution. In general, the worst-case peak-to-null ripple will reflect the potential error in a peak EIRP or EIS measurement for an omnidirectional DUT pattern located anywhere within the test volume. Note however that nulls in the pattern can exhibit considerably larger errors due to reflected signals being stronger than the line-of-sight signal from the null.\nWhen measuring the range path loss in Stage 1 using a dipole pattern, the associated measurement uncertainty may be determined from the peak-to-null ripple, after relative path loss compensation, of a single radial offset ripple test, where the range is configured as for range calibration (e.g. with any extraneous support structure removed) using a rectangular distribution.\nFor spherically integrated quantities such as TRP and TRS, the peak-to-null ripple would overestimate the measurement uncertainty due to the inherent averaging of the various peaks and nulls as the spherical pattern is integrated. In this case, the surface standard deviation (SSD) [15] is used to obtain a statistical representation of the expected impact of ripple on the integrated power from an isotropic radiator placed anywhere within the test volume. Due to the impracticality of maintaining a constant path loss reference between individual ripple test cuts, each resultant pattern is treated individually and then the worst case SSD result is chosen as the standard uncertainty of the quiet zone.\nFor the phi-axis ripple tests, the pattern can be considered an equatorial (theta = 90°) cut of the isotropic pattern where every point has equal weighting on an evenly spaced spherical surface.  Thus, the standard deviation of the single cut should be equivalent to the standard deviation of the entire spherical surface.  Defining  as the th ripple measurement point in linear power units , and  as the average of all   values in the associated ripple test, then the standard deviation of the corresponding cut is given by:\n\nOn the theta-axis ripple test each ripple test cut can be considered as a great circle cut through an isotropic pattern with the symmetrical distortions that would be produced by revolving the pattern about the phi (0-180°) axis. Thus, it becomes apparent that ripple near the poles impacts a smaller total surface area on the sphere than that near theta = 90 and 270°. In this case, sin(theta) weighting is used to generate the spherical surface weighted standard deviation as:\n\nNote that this equation simplifies to the previous equation when theta = 90°, so the two formulations are in fact the same, regardless of which orientation of the ripple test is used.\nThe standard uncertainty for the quiet zone ripple contribution to the TRP/TRS measurement is then given by the maximum SSD from all of the ripple test measurements.\n",

This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT’s positioning against the SAM phantom and hand phantoms varies from the specified testing positions. It is noted that the uncertainty of the phone positioning depends on the phone holder and the measurement operator and is in fact difficult to distinguish from random uncertainty. Some uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of the DUT plugged into the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, as the DUT may not be plugged into the USB connector and positioned exactly in the same way every time. This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT’s position plugged into the Laptop Ground Plane phantom varies from the specified plug-in position. Therefore, the positioning uncertainty is included in random uncertainty.\nTo estimate this uncertainty for the SAM phantom, it is suggested to perform at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS whereby the device shall be dismounted and newly positioned with a fully charged battery before each test. This measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of lowest and highest frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least three phones with different type of mechanical design. The values have to be normalized by the mean for each measurement set. As a result, the uncertainty contribution entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the maximum and minimum normalized values.\nWith head and hand phantoms, random uncertainty evaluation may be done separately for each measurement configuration i.e. head only, browsing mode or speech mode. A speech mode random uncertainty evaluation, were both head and hand phantoms are used, can reasonably be considered to be the worst-case scenario and thus random uncertainties in other configurations to be less.\nTo estimate this uncertainty for the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, it is suggested to perform at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS for the plug-in position whereby the device shall be dismounted and newly positioned before each test.

The value deviates over 1.5*MU from all the other lab’s results should be identified as apparent outlier.\n-\tPass/fail limit for lab alignment should be defined as ±0.75*MU (i.e., 1.34dB for TRP, and 1.65dB for TRS) as baseline. MU value is the expanded MU in TR38.834, i.e., 1.78dB for TRP and 2.20dB for TRS.\n-\tThe pass/fail limit and reference value shall be considered together if further update identified based on more data input\n-\tThe summation form for TRP and TRS lab alignment should keep consistent during the calculation process of TRP TRS lab alignment from each company, i.e., sin weights approach or Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature integral approximation. Only traditional approach should be used during lab alignment activity to reduce unnecessary uncertainty.\n-\tHow to treat late submission results and confirm the alignment:\n-\tThe reference value and pass/fail limit should be defined in RAN4#103-e meeting. The late submission deadline for phase 2 is Tdoc submission deadline of RAN4#104-e meeting.\n-\tAn offline RAN4 conference call may be needed to review lab alignment data to tentatively confirm the pass or fail of late-submitted labs. Final endorsement will happen during RAN4#104e.\n-\tOnly measurement results from aligned labs in RAN4#104-e meeting are considered as TRP TRS Performance data pool to define final requirements.\nTest lab procedures:\n-\tLAD delivery scheme\n-\tDecide LAD delivery scheme after all the test lab and LAD information being confirmed.\n-\tThe available LADs can be split among labs to multiplex the testing effort\n-\tLAD measurement time in each test lab: finalize LAD measurement within 5 workdays, and deliver to next lab ASAP with LAD delivery In/Out information shared in reflector.\n-\tEncourage test labs to share resulting combined MU based on their own systems\n\n",
