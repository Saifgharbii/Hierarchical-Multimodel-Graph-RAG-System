The high-risk area can be static (e.g. a school during arrival and leaving times), or dynamic (e.g. a school bus or mobile ice-cream vendor). Dedicated roadside infrastructure could play a vital role in disseminating warning messages to VRUs and vehicles as well.\nOne issue at the scenario of the VRU high risk zone areas is how to configure the communication for the zones (which can include different types of interfaces and transmission modes) and how to translate the zone configurations (which are application driven) to network requirements and zone specific provisioning parameters considering both static and dynamic zones. Furthermore, another issue is how to assist the provisioning of zone specific parameters to the devices which can be potential VRUs and V2X-UEs and are expected to enter the zone.So, the key issue will study:\n-\tWhether and how to enhance VAE layer capabilities to support configuring the communication parameters for the zones.\n-\tWhether and how to enhance VAE layer capabilities to translate the zone configurations to network requirements and zone specific provisioning parameters.\n-\tWhether and how to assist the provisioning of zone specific parameters to the devices which can be potential VRUs and V2X-UEs.\n",

One of the key V2P applications is the Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) as specified in ETSI TS 103 300-2 [13]. VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users, e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation. In VRUP, multiple V2X messages need to be exchanged between the pedestrian and the vehicular UEs, originating by one or more applications. Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power efficiency. A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as well as transmission/reception schedules.\nThe VAE layer may provide support functionality for enabling V2P applications, by consolidating the V2P application requirements and aligning the communication traffic pattern with the PC5 QoS setting and the AS layer configurations (e.g. DRX cycles).\nSo, the key issue will study:\n-\tWhether and how the VAE layer can support the V2P communications considering the UE situation (e.g. low battery power, weak radio signals)?\n-\tWhether and how the VAE layer can coordinate the alignment of the communication traffic patterns with the PC5 QoS setting and the AS layer configurations (e.g. DRX cycles)?\n",

A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as well as transmission/reception schedules.\nThe VAE layer may provide support functionality for enabling V2P applications, by consolidating the V2P application requirements and aligning the communication traffic pattern with the PC5 QoS setting and the AS layer configurations (e.g. DRX cycles). Such alignment may be in the form of triggering the update of QoS / AS layer configuration based on application requirement (procedure is shown in clause 6.1.1.2.1 for client-triggered alignment and in clause 6.1.1.2.2 for VAE-server triggered alignment).\nThe different procedures correspond to different solution variants to address different use cases.\nClause 6.1.1.2.1 provides a VAE-client enabled V2P communication schedule configuration which could be applicable to off-network deployments and could be triggered by the application of the V2X UE (e.g. if UE battery drops while the V2P session is ongoing) based on prior configuration from the VAE server.\nOn the other hand, clause 6.1.1.2.2 provides a VAE server enabled V2P communication schedule configuration, which could be applicable to use cases where the VAE server after receiving the VASS requirement, it configures/aligns the schedules for the V2X UEs (e.g. can be used within VRU zones to avoid flooding/interference by continuous sending/receiving V2X messages).\nThis subclause describes the procedures for V2P communication schedule configuration and update support by the VAE layer. This includes an off-network (VAE client enabled) and on-network (VAE server enabled) procedures for V2P communication schedule configuration.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAE client configures the traffic schedule for V2P communications based on application requirement; and triggers the translation to an AS layer/ QoS configurations update.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tVASS or VASC has subscribed to VAE layer to provide support for V2P communication.\n2.\tVAE client 1 has been configured by the VAE server to configure the communication schedule for V2P communications.\n3.\tV2X UE #1 and V2X UE#2 have discovered each other based upon V2P service and established a unicast connection using the V2X Service oriented Layer-2 link establishment procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [7] clause 6.3.3.1\nThe figure depicts a V2P communication schedule configuration for a VAE client, enabling V2P communication. The schedule includes the VAE client's V2P communication schedule, which is enabled, and the V2P communication schedule of the VAE client's V2P communication partner. The schedule is configured to ensure efficient and reliable communication between the VAE client and its V2P communication partner.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.1-1: VAE client - enabled V2P communication schedule configuration\n1.\tOn V2X UE #1, the V2X application specific client 1 and 2 provide the V2X application requirements to the VAE client, including delay requirements, etc., for the PC5 communication. Here, this V2X Application specific client 1 may be requesting a groupcast communication and V2X Application specific client 2 may be requesting a unicast communication.\n2.\tV2X UE #1's VAE client consolidates requirements from both applications and generates a UE level transmission schedule, so that the off-duration is maximized. The determination of the transmission schedule can be determined based on the configuration on the UE (energy efficiency target) and the service KPIs.\n3.\tV2X UE #1's VAE client sends a V2P communication schedule update message which includes the generated UE level transmission schedule to other VAE client 2 (in vicinity, or in service-based group), in order to negotiate the optimal transmission pattern or inform on the expected reception pattern.\n4.\tV2X UE #2's VAE client either accepts or provides its transmission cycle or negotiates the traffic pattern.\n5.\tVAE clients of V2X UE #2 may optionally send a V2P communication schedule update message indicating the expected/generated UE #2 transmission pattern.\n6.\tV2X UE #1's and V2X UE #2's VAE clients (VAE clients are deployed at V2X application layer), provide the updated traffic pattern as V2X Application Requirements to V2X layer, also including QoS requirements such as delay requirements, priority, etc., for the PC5 communication for both applications, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [7] clause 5.4.1.1. VAE client may also indicate the transmission mode (unicast, groupcast) per application. The V2X/AS layer of UE #1 and #2 applies/configures the DRX schedule for the corresponding V2X communication, based on the updated traffic pattern per cast type and/or destination Layer ID (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [7] clause 5.9).\nEditor's Note: It is FFS to identify possible dependencies to RAN2/SA2 for the consideration of the Tx Profile which may impact the details of step 6.\n7.\tVAE clients of V2X UEs #1 and #2 may send a notification to the V2X application specific client(s) to inform on the communication traffic pattern.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAE server configures the traffic schedule for V2P communications based on application requirement; and communicates with the VAE clients to trigger the translation to an AS layer/ QoS configurations update.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tVASS has subscribed to VAE server to provide support for V2P communication.\n2.\tVAE client of V2X UE #1 and V2X UE #2 are registered with VAE server.\nThe figure depicts a VAE server-enabled V2P communication schedule configuration, illustrating the scheduling of V2P communication between VAE servers. The configuration includes the VAE server, V2P communication, and VAE server-to-server communication. The figure highlights the importance of V2P communication in VAE systems, as it enables efficient and reliable communication between VAE servers.\nFigure 6.1.1.2.2-1: VAE server - enabled V2P communication schedule configuration\n1.\tOne or more V2X application specific servers provide the V2X application requirements to the VAE server, including application QoS requirements for the V2P applications and provisioning policies and parameters for the PC5 communication.\n2.\tThe VAE server generates a communication schedule for one or more involved V2X UEs, so that the off duration is maximized. The determination of the transmission schedule can be determined based on the V2P service KPIs.

The VAL server is triggered by a VRU zone creation event, which is a crucial step in the VRU system's operation. The figure shows the server's interface, including the VRU zone creation process, the VRU zone, and the VRU zone's status. The VAL server is responsible for managing the VRU zone and ensuring that the VRU zone is properly created and functioning.\nFigure 6.2.1.1-1: VAL server - triggered VRU zone creation\n1.\tThe V2X application specific server sends a subscription request to manage the creation and configuration of a new high-risk area zone, and requires the VAE server support to translate it to a network-related zone configuration and provisioning to the UEs within the requested area. The subscription request consists of the Requestor ID (VASS ID or App ID), the VRU zone type (based on the scenario, which type of UEs are to be considered), geographical area, time validity and initiation trigger, types of supported messages and requirements (e.g. requirements for VAM messages), application QoS requirement dedicated for the VRU zone (e.g. URLLC like), whether it is a dynamic or static zone, etc.\nNOTE:\tIf the zone is dynamically changing based on an event (e.g. school bus mobility / route), such mobility/route information will be provided to the VAE server, or the VASS needs to provide new configuration every time the configuration changes.\n2.\tThe VAE server processes the request and stores the subscription. The processing includes the translation of the zone requirement of step 1 and determines a set of network-related zone parameters which indicates the configuration parameters for example: the topological area for the zone (cell IDs, TAs), the QoS requirements within the zone, the exposure requirements within the zone, the value added services required within the zone (e.g. location tracking, V2X message bundling), the transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast) within the applications within the zone, the interface selection within the zone (Uu, PC5), the use of application relaying or not, whether the zone is dynamic or not, and if it is dynamic to take into account the configuration adaptation every time the configuration changes or to provide the planning (e.g. based on a school bus route) to allow the network to adapt the configuration.\n3.\tThe VAE sever sends a VRU zone creation subscription response to VASS.\n4.\tThe VAE server initiates the SEAL LMS service for location tracking both for static location and dynamically changing location for all UEs within the VRU zone area. VAE server obtains and initiates tracking the V2X UEs location from the location management server 1 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 (clause 9.3.12).\n5.\tThe VAE server sends a notification message including the VRU zone configuration parameters. Parameters can be based on the parameters provided in step 2. This configuration will be provided to the V2X-UEs (and pedestrians) within the area that will be covered by the VRU zone, and will also indication when the zone will be activated, for how much time and if the zone configuration will be dynamically changing (e.g. where a school bus moves) and parameters related to the dynamicity (as discussed in steps 1, 2).\n6.\tThe VAE server keeps monitoring the VRU zone area based on monitoring SEAL LMS events. This includes events on whether a UE (e.g. UE1) is moving in or out a target area of interest.\nThe VAE server translates the UE1 mobility event to an expected entrance to a VRU high risk zone, and based on the configuration of the zone, it identifies when an action needs to be taken and when to communicate this with the involved application entities.\n7.\tThe VAE server alerts the VASS that the UE1 is expected to move to the VRU zone area in X time and provides also information on its mobility as well as the UE1 capabilities (e.g. VRU capable). The notification / alert message may include the UE ID (GPSI, or external ID), the group ID (if it is a group of UEs), an expected start time of VRUP, an expected duration, expected mobility/speed/direction, etc. Alternatively, when UE is leaving the zone, a message can be sent to VASS to notify that the UE1 is expected to leave this area and the VRUP is no longer needed.\n8.\tThe VAE server may also alert the VAE client (if deployed at the UE1) that it is expected to enter the VRU zone and requests the confirmation for allowing the push of VRU messages within the zone. Such notification / request will include zone area information and configuration parameters. Alternatively, when UE is leaving the zone, a message can be sent to VAE client to notify that the UE1 is expected to leave this area and the VRUP is no longer needed.\n",

The figure illustrates the process of the UE making the request, with the network responding to the request and providing necessary information to the UE. This process is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of the 5G network.\nFigure 6.4.1.2-1: UE request for protection zone\n1.\tOptionally, an application client on a cyclist UE makes a request to the VAE client to create a protection zone.\n2.\tA VAE client sends a request to a VAE server to create a protection zone.

The response includes the status of the authorization, the protection zone type, geographical area, time validity and initiation trigger, types of supported messages and requirements (e.g. requirements for VAM messages), application QoS requirement dedicated for the protection zone (e.g. URLLC like), whether it is a dynamic or static zone, an expiration for the protection zone, V2P communication configuration information, etc.\n6.\tThe VAE server configures subscriptions to obtain UE location from the 5G system. Sources of UE mobility information may come from SEAL LMS servers, EES, an analytics function (e.g. from ADAES or NWDAF), and the 5G core network. For V2X UEs location obtained from the location management server, the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 (clause 9.3.12) apply.\n7.\tThe VAE server sends a response message to the cyclist UE with a status for the request, the information of the protection zone, and updated V2P communication configuration.

The cyclist UE and vehicular UE may also provide application context information to the VAE server, such as battery level, user activity, active applications, and routing information from a navigation app. The battery level of the UE may help the VAE server determine the V2P communication configuration to provide to UEs in the protection zone. For example, if the battery level of a cyclist UE is low, the VAE server may provide V2P communication configurations to vehicular UEs to align with when the cyclist UE is able to receive V2P communication. Alternatively, the VAE server can provide V2P communication parameters to vehicular UEs to communicate with nearby UEs instead.\n10.\tThe VAE server updates the protection zone based on information the VAE server has obtained about the cyclist UE. For example, the protection zone may be updated due to a change in UE location. In addition, the VAE server may broadcast the new protection zone information to all the UEs in the protection zone.\n11.\tThe VAE server detects that a vehicular UE is now in the updated protection zone and sends a notification alert to the vehicular UE and includes the V2P communication configuration for use by the vehicular UE to communicate directly with the cyclist UE.\n6.4.2\tSolution evaluation\nThis solution addresses KI #1 and aspects of KI #2 and provides a procedure for a VAL client on a cyclist UE to request the creation of a dynamic protection zone via the VAE client. The VAE server checks with a VASS to authorize the request and if authorized, the VASS creates a protection zone based on the information provided by the VAE client. After the creation of the protection zone, the VAE server monitors the UE’s mobility information and updates the protection zone accordingly. If the VAE server detects the presence of other vehicular UEs in the updated protection zone, the VAE server sends a notification alert to the vehicular UE and includes V2P communication configuration information.\nFurther agreement is needed for the scenario of this solution where UEs can initiate VRU protection zone creation.\n",
