Once the UE has downloaded the binary, the time when the UE performs the upgrade is left for the UE implementation, with possibly UE implementations seeking user input. If UEs cannot execute the event (e.g. the storage capacity or the battery level are insufficient), they may delay execution of the event. These UEs become unavailable (i.e. cannot interact with the 5G System) in the order of minutes whenever such operations are performed. As UEs become unavailable without prior knowledge from the core network and/or application function, it can impact critical operations of an application server if it depends on availability of the UE during the unavailability period (i.e. a period of time during which the UE is not available).\nThe present key issue shall study:\na)\tWhether and how an unavailability period is determined in 5GS for a specific UE.\nb)\tStudy the expected UE and/or network actions (if any) based on determined unavailability period.\n",

This then avoids that the network considers the UE de-registered while the UE is not in a situation where it could perform periodic registration update (because of the UE being unavailable).\nAfter the unavailability period and when the UE comes back, the UE issues a new Registration Request without MICO mode indication, reusing the stored MM context, and re-establishes PDU sessions that are still required.\n",

Once requested, the UE-requested unavailability period can be delayed by the 5GC with a backoff timer, if necessary.\nThe UE and network undergo capability negotiation wherein the UE indicates its capability to support Unavailability period and the network indicates its capability to support and use the Unavailability period in 5GS as part of the initial registration procedure.\nThe UE may download software, patches and other updates from AF. When the UE determines the appropriate time to become unavailable, UE initiates the Registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update. The UE indicates the duration for which it may become unavailable, and the network may accept the unavailability duration indicated by the UE or indicate a different value.\nThe AMF may also reject the UE request to become unavailable if it is currently not appropriate for the UE to become unavailable. The AMF may optionally provide a backoff timer to the UE, if it is appropriate for the UE to become unavailable after a certain duration. If the UE receives a backoff timer, the UE starts the backoff timer and delays becoming unavailable for doing internal updates. While the backoff timer is running the UE is available and normal operation continues.\nOnce the backoff timer expires, the UE initiates De-registration procedure and becomes unavailable. The AMF stores the UE context and starts an internal timer for the duration that the UE is unavailable. Once the internal updates are completed, the UE restarts and initiates the initial Registration procedure. The AMF seamlessly restores the UE context and registers the UE.\nAlternatively, UE may re-use some of the MUSIM features defined in Rel-17 for the purpose of this solution and indicate capabilities for Connection Release (clause 5.38.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) and Paging Restriction (clause 5.38.5 of TS 23.501 [2]). In addition, UE also indicates capability for \"Expected Leaving Duration\" that was discussed in the context of MUSIM in Rel-17 but eventually not adopted for MUSIM.\nWhen the UE determines the appropriate time to become unavailable, the UE can initiate either a Service Request procedure or a registration procedure and include the Release Request indication and the Paging Restriction Information as specified for MUSIM. As part of the Connection Release, the UE can request Expected Leaving Duration, that specifies the length of the unavailability period. Expected Leaving Duration can only be used in combination of the Connection Release feature. The backoff timer mechanism remains the same as described above, but with the use of the MUSIM Connection Release feature, the UE does not need to de-register from the network.\n",

The UP is an important metric that helps in managing network resources and ensuring smooth operation. The figure shows a step-by-step process for identifying the UP, including the identification of the network's critical components, the identification of the network's critical events, and the identification of the network's critical resources. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network's topology, which helps in understanding the network's structure and identifying potential issues. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive guide for determining the UP in a telecommunications network.\nFigure 6.3.3-1: Procedure for determining Unavailability Period\nFigure 6.3.3-1 represents the high-level procedure for determining the Unavailability period.\n1)\tThe UE indicates its capability to support Unavailability period in 5GMM Core Network Capability in Registration Request message as part of initial registration procedure.\n2)\tThe AMF indicates its capability to support and use the Unavailability period in 5GMM network feature support in Registration Accept message as part of registration procedure.\n3)\tThe UE may download software, patches and other updates from the AF. Once the updates are locally available the UE may determine a suitable time to install these updates and indicate the duration for which it may become unavailable to 5GC.\n4)\tThe UE requests the network to become unavailable for a duration of Unavailable time requested by sending the Registration Request message (for mobility and periodic registration update).\n5)\tThe AMF evaluates the UE request to become unavailable for a duration of Unavailable time requested. The AMF indicates if the network accepts the UE becoming unavailable or the network rejects the UE request to become unavailable if it is currently not appropriate for the UE to become unavailable in the Registration Accept message. The AMF may accept the unavailability duration indicated by the UE or indicate a different value in Unavailable time accepted. The AMF may optionally provide a backoff timer to the UE, if it is appropriate for the UE to become unavailable after a certain duration. If the UE receives a backoff timer, the UE starts the backoff timer and delays becoming unavailable for doing internal updates equivalent to the value of backoff timer. While the backoff timer is running the UE is available and normal operation continues.\n6)\tIf the UE has received the backoff timer, the UE waits until the backoff timer expires. The UE initiates De-registration procedure to become unavailable. The UE shall indicate the type of de-registration. The UE may optionally indicate that de-registration is for software update.\n7)\tThe AMF accepts the de-registration request and sends a De-registration Accept message. If the UE has indicated that de-registration is for software update, the AMF may store the UE context and start an internal timer for duration of Unavailable time accepted.\n8)\tOnce the internal updates are completed and the UE has re-started, the UE registers with the network by sending the Registration Request message for initial registration.\n9)\tIf the UE restarts and initiates registration within the Unavailable time accepted time duration, by initiating the registration procedure, the AMF seamlessly restores the UE context and registers the UE.\nThe UE follows similar steps as above in this case as well. The key differences in the alternative approach are as follows:\n1)\tThe UE indicates its capability to support the Connection Release and Paging Restriction features as per existing registration procedure defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3] with the exception that support for these features is not restricted to Multi-USIM UEs. The UE also indicates support for Expected Leaving Duration.\n2)\tThe AMF indicates its capability to support the Connection Release and Paging Restriction features as per existing registration procedure defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3] based on network capability and preference by the network (i.e. based on local network policy). The AMF only indicates Expected Leaving Duration Supported together with Connection Release Supported.\n3)\tThe UE initiates either a Service Request procedure or a Registration procedure as defined for MUSIM. The UE includes the Release Request indication, the Paging Restriction Information and the Expected Leaving Duration in the Service Request message, if the UE intends to leave CM-CONNECTED state, as defined in clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The UE includes the Release Request indication, the Paging Restriction Information and the Expected Leaving Duration in the Registration Request message over 3GPP access, if the UE intends to leave CM-IDLE state (or CM-CONNECTED state and the UE needs to perform Registration Update at the same time), as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. In addition, the UE sets the Paging Restriction Information to \"all paging is restricted\" (according to clause 5.38.5 of TS 23.501 [2]). The Expected Leaving Duration indicates the requested unavailability period in seconds.\n4)\tWhen using the MUSIM Connection Release feature, the UE does not need to de-register from the network.\n",

Based on the unavailability period, AMF may choose to not initiate procedures which can force UE to enter deregistered state.\n2c)\tPCF uses the UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy delivery as described in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3] to configure the unavailability period parameter into the UE.\nNOTE:\tThe AF configures the unavailability period parameter which is acceptable to 5GC .i.e. based on negotiation between 5GC and AF.\nThe unavailability period parameter is the time slot which indicates the time in which UE is allowed to perform deregistration procedure to execute events described in clause 6.6.2. The unavailability period parameter can have multiple time slots for example 10:00-12:00 UTC, 14:00 - 18:00 UTC, 22:00-23:59 UTC etc. If UE is not able to execute the events for example due to the less storage capacity or insufficient battery level in the first time slot then UE should wait for the next time slot to execute the events.\nThe network takes unavailability period parameter into account to execute Device reboot upon Modem setting changes via OMA-DM procedures.\nIf UE have a user interface, how UE indicates the unavailability period to the user and take his consent to execute the events during unavailability period is outside the scope of this study as agreed in clause 2.\nThe unavailability period is configured by the HPLMN, based on agreements with the AF and operator policy, into the UE.\n",

                    "text_content": "During Registration procedure, the UE provides indication of support of \"Unavailability Period\" in Registration Request message, and the AMF indicates the support of the \"Unavailability Period\" in Registration Accept message.\nIf UE and network support \"Unavailability Period\" and an event is triggered in the UE that would make the UE unavailable for a certain period of time (e.g. for OS upgrade or device reboot), the UE may store its MM context in USIM or Non Volatile memory to be able to reuse it after its unavailability period. When the UE is ready to execute the event, the UE triggers mobility registration or deregistration procedure including the unavailability period. The AMF may provide Periodic Registration Update timer based on unavailability period indicated by the UE, e.g. the AMF may provide a Periodic Registration Update time larger than unavailability period. If the UE is not deregistered, the AMF stores the information that the UE is unavailable in UE context, and considers the UE is unreachable until the unavailability period has passed or the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state. While the UE is unreachable, all high latency communication solutions (see clause 5.31.8 of TS 23.501 [2]) may apply if supported, e.g. extended data buffering, downlink data buffering status report, etc. If there is \"Loss of Connectivity\" event subscription for the UE by AF, the AMF triggers \"Loss of Connectivity\" event report and includes unavailability period towards the NEF and the unavailability period is reported to the respective subscribed AF.\nWhen the UE is ready to execute the event (e.g. for OS upgrade or device reboot), the UE may choose to store the UE contexts (MM and SM context).\nNOTE 1:\tHow the UE stores the context depends upon the UE implementation. The UE may store some or all of the UE contexts in the USIM using existing USIM functionality.\nOnce the event which makes the UE unavailable is completed in the UE or the event is delayed to a future time or cancelled in the UE (e.g. due to insufficient storage capacity, insufficient battery level or the event which makes the UE unavailable is completed), the UE triggers registration procedure to resume regular service. The UE does not include the Unavailability Period in the Registration Request message. Depending on the state the UE ends up after the event, the registration procedure can be Initial Registration procedure or Mobility Registration Update procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe actual event execution in the UE, including user interaction, is out of the scope of this feature.\nNOTE 3:\tExact names for the parameters exchanged between UE and Network can be decided during normative work.\n\n",
