In this KPI variant, data volume and latency are two factors considered for evaluating the performance of network slice. This KPI is applicable for the cases where, for example, the URLLC network slice is deployed and operators want to evaluate the Energy Efficiency of the slice at different periods of time, such as the busy hours in the morning and the idle hours in the mid night,  in which both latency performance and the data volume performance can vary.\n\nwhere\n\n\nwN3 and wN9 are the weight for DVN3 and DVN9 respectively. wN3 and wN9 can be decided according to the deployment of PSA UPF.

The main reason for this is that, if the traffic is counted more than once, it will increase artificially the EEURLLC,DV,Latency KPI.\nThe 3GPP management system in charge of collecting the data volume measurements listed here above shall consider them only once in case of redundant transmission over the N3/N9 interface.\na) EEMIoT,RegSubs\nb) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type MIoT.

The KPI is very useful for the industry customer’s Park area and N4 interface decouping deployment for operrators. And this KPI is mainly focusing on network view.\n",

In some scenarios (e.g. uRLLC), if end-to-end reliability is insufficient, the 5G network customer cannot obtain guaranteed network performance provided by the network operator. So it is necessary to assess end-to-end reliability of network utilizing the packet delivery success rate measurements defined in clauses 6.8.2,6.8.3,6.8.4 and 6.8.5.The same can be used to determine the end to end reliability of a slice.\n",
