The network slice capability management service in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2] only provides capability of network slice adaptation between NSCE server and the NSCE client. However, for such capability both control plane and management plane interactions need to be considered since there is close coupling between the per UE session and the per slice related actions. For example, the SEAL/NSCE layer may need to be aware of the slice provisioning parameters (NSI/NSSI configuration) which can be provided by the slice management system. Furthermore, NSI/NSSI performance monitoring from management system (e.g. NSI/ NSSI status) may be useful to be known at the enabler layer, since this may affect the application to slice re-mapping triggering (e.g. to re-map to the least congested slice); and may also impact other SEAL provided functionalities (e.g. QoS/resource control, group management etc).\nOpen issues:\n-\tWhether and which enhancement to SEAL network slice capability management service is required having in mind SA2 and SA5 slice related exposure?\n-\tWhether a potential enhancement to SEAL network slice capability management functional model is required?\n-\tWhether new or enhanced APIs are needed to support the potential SEAL enhancements?\n-\tHow the network slice capability (such as management service (MnS)) consumption may trigger and impact the value-add services provided by the SEAL layer?\n",

As an example, a mobile network operator has provisioned a set of network slices (Slice#1, Slice#2, Slice#3) which may be used by different ASPs (e.g. Slice#1 for online video services, Slice#2 for gaming.  Slice#3 for eMBB or IOT service). Different ASPs may use these slices (or a subset of them) for different services that they offer. Furthermore, when an application changes the network slices to be accessed, it should be agnostic to the UEs accessing the service and should be performed automatically.\nThe vertical enablement layer (SEAL, vertical-specific enablers) supports the exposure of telco provided services to the vertical / application service provider (ASP). Such telco-provided services traditionally covered the 3GPP control plane services (provided by SA2); however, these can be extended to 3GPP management domain services (provided by SA5) which may be useful for allowing the ASP to monitor and manage the slices used by the UEs. The enabler layer can be seen as a trusted application entity that interacts with the management system on behalf of ASP to allow the exposure of management services related to the offered slices. It can be used to trigger dynamic slice-related actions and also reduce complexity at the ASP side.\nIn this extended notion of vertical enablement (to cover the 3GPP management service exposure), the vertical/ slice customer needs to be able to 1) discover the relevant Network Slice Instances and the respective capabilities such as coverage offered, RAT/ frequencies, to 2) discover the management services (based on TS 28.533 [6]) which can be exposed as part of the offered slices, and 3) register to the 3GPP management domain via the vertical enabler layer for consuming the management services.\nThis study needs to investigate:\n-\tWhether and how SEAL needs to be enhanced to support the discovery of the offered slices and the offered management services related to these slices, to the vertical/ASP;\n-\tWhether and how SEAL needs to be enhanced to support the registration of the vertical applications to the 3GPP management domain.\n",

This includes data of the physical connection as well as of logical links and sub-networks. Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters ensures a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying network connectivity, performance and other related problems.\nNetwork diagnostic information needs to be generated automatically and, in case of a hosted or virtual network deployment, be made available to the tenant of the network via a suitable API.\nThe alarm data can be used to help the third-party to diagnose the fault problem of the services, locate the fault causes, and to be aware of the potential fault. In TS 28.545 [10], the fault supervision management services are standardized by which the alarm of the network slice instance from network resource aspects can be subscribed and reported. This alarm information together with the application function's fault report and communication service related knowledge can be utilized by the SEAL/NSCE to diagnose and locate the cause of the service performance deterioration and the fault of the communication services, and then exposed the fault report to the third-party. For example, if the status of the required communication is not correct, the SEAL/NSCE derives this alarm information from application functions. In this case, it is the SEAL/NSCE's responsibility to detect whether this fault is caused by the 5GS network or not and exposed the fault report to the third-party. If it is, then the SEAL/NSCE may inform the management functions the location of the fault and ask for the maintenance of the managed functions to clear the fault.\nIn addition, the two business relationships of network slice as a service and network slice as NOP internals may considered separately for the capabilities exposed in each scenarios.

For example, for the performance related requirements, the live video streaming cares more on bandwidth while V2X cares more on latency and jitters. For the capabilities related requirements, V2X may requests the positioning while future factory may request the self-control and management. To satisfy the requirements, vertical has to interact with several 5GS entities and understand the specific network parameters, such as the attributes in the service profile as defined in TS 28.541 [14]. Slice enabler layer could act as a mediator between the vertical customer and the 5GS to decompose and translate the requirements.\nBesides, the verticals are more focused on the KQI or QoE of the applications and services. For example, in a scenario of future factory, the robots are used to enable the intelligent delivering, the third-parties have a requirement on the application latency between the robots and the robots control system, the slice enabler may decompose this application latency requirement to 5GS network latency requirement (e.g., the network latency requirements specified in TS 28.541[14] as packet transmission latency (millisecond) through the RAN, CN, and TN part of 5G network or the UL/DL packet delay measurement between UE and PSA UPF for a QoS Flow defined in TS 23.501[3]) and forward it to the 5GS systems. Another example is that to support the service of the imaging for professional applications as defined in TS 22.261[7], the imaging system latency of the application as defined in TS 22.263[x] is required which may not only depends on the 5GS network transmission latency but also will be influenced by the network throughput and network bandwidth. The NSCE are responsible for the translation from the vertical's KQI/QoE requirements to 5GS network requirements based on the knowledge of the industry profiles and 5G network (the definition of the KQI/OoE is service and application specific and is out the scope of this study).\nHowever, to cope with the various requirements, it is needed to specify the operations and procedure on how to translate them more efficiently, such as in the unified manner with unified format/model/template. In such way, the slice enabler layer is capable of translating requirements from the vertical, to service consumption or service API invocation and configurations to the respective 5GS domains. The service could be provided from control plane, management plane and SA6 slice enabler layer itself, or the combinations of services above.\nThere are two main aspects in requirements translation: 1) one is how the vertical requirements could be collected, whether and how the template is needed? 2) The other is how to transfer the requirements into actions, whether and how API translation is needed?\nThis key issue aims to discuss how to configure and translate the requirements to service consumption and configuration in a way that the slice capability exposure is 1) agnostic to the underlying telecom infrastructure, 2) hides the complexity of telecom infrastructure, 3) doesn't impact/restrict the level of exposure to the vertical and 4) that is resilient to dynamic changes that may happen due to application portability or telco-provided API status changes.\nTherefore, the open issues include:\n-\tWhether and how the vertical requirements could be collected at the slice enabler to allow the translation to network service consumption and configuration,\n-\tWhether and how API translation is needed to support the requirements translation.\n",

This happens since 5GC is not aware of the relevant application information e.g. contract qualities level of the UE making the registration request.\nThe third party application needs to provide high priority to the higher level of contract qualities and so it needs to manage such connections.\nIt is also specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [7] that the 5G system shall support a mechanism to optimize resources of network slices (e.g., due to operator deploying different frequency to offer different network slices) based on network slice usage patterns and policy (e.g., application preference) of a UE or group of UEs.\nIn particular, this KI will address:\n-\tWhether and how the AF can provide application policy information to the operator's Service Hosting Environment to enable automatic management of application resources?\n-\tWhat application policy information needs to be specified by the trusted third-party AF that can be automatically evaluated by the operator's Service Hosting Environment?\n-\tWhether and how the AF can manage use of the application resources in the operator's Service Hosting Environment on a per user characteristic?\n",

Initially, they may translate the communication service parameters to slice parameters (serviceProfile provided to OAM as defined SA5) and order a slice with certain slice requirements parameters and their values.\nThe verticals will put their best effort into slice requirements translation. However, they are not able to guarantee that all the potential factors will be considered to generate the optimal slice requirements parameters on the first try. After the service is executed on the required slice, the slice may not fully match the service real-time running conditions, for example, maybe only 60% of the slice resource is used to support the service, and rest of the slice resource is always idle, or the slice resource is insufficient due to under-provisioning. Or in some cases, there may be some unforeseen exceptions (e.g., unexpected traffic changes) and the current configured slice requirements parameters are not able to fulfil the requirements, for example, more resources are required to address the exceptions.\nIn order to achieve the maximum return of investment and ensure the slice/service self-management, the verticals expect a more optimal service profile which contains the exact value of those slice requirements parameters to support to the executing services' demands, i.e., by monitoring the network performance statistics to align the slice requirements between verticals and network providers. Furthermore, the action of alignment is not triggered by a single event but considers the statistics of the network performance during a certain time period. From the management perspective, third-party is able to modify the slice requirements (serviceProfile defined in TS 28.541[14]) by perform the operation of modifyMOIAttributes listed in table 6.1-1 in TS 28.531[5] to support the slice requirements alignment.\nThis key issue is to study how to enable better alignment between the vertical needs and the slice requirements parameters.\nNOTE:\tAll the potential changes to the slice are based on existing SA2 and SA5 service/capability.\nOpen issues:\n-\tWhether and How the SEAL network slice capability management service supports better alignment between vertical needs and slice requirements parameters for initial service requirements and ongoing service conditions?\n-\tHow does the SEAL network slice capability management service determine and indicate that VAL server policy (e.g., requirements provided when adding or changing slices) requests or actions result in suggested changes to the NSCE service provider policy (e.g., allowed NS profile operations or parameter ranges) or to VAL policies?\n\n",

This involves implementing preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of future faults and ensuring that the network is always in a good state.\n\n7. **Fault Mitigation\nFigure 6.2.1.2-1: Network slice fault management process\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to request for the fault diagnosis of the applications and networks when it detected a fault in the application layer, the services and the network slices. This request may be triggered by the errors of the applications detected by the VAL server itself, or the VAL server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report subscribing to the network slice fault management capability. The fault information of applications may be included in this request. For example, the Service Availability Failure Events e.g, described as Fallback events carried out by the Dual SIM cellular device.\n2.\tOn receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server retrieves the performance data of network slice from 5GS.

For example, the RAN function of the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application, for a certain time duration, the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by Service Availability Failure Events, and in the RAN function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time duration, then the environment fault may be the root cause of the Service Availability Failure and should be prioritized to be solved. The fault may be identified with \"critical\", \"major\", \"minor\", \"ignore\" to show its prioritization.\n7.\tNSCE server response to VAL server with the reports of fault diagnostic result to indicate the causes of the failures of the applications or services. If there is no problem within the 5GS network, the VAL server may be requested to check the application layer itself again.\n8.\tIf the NSCE server detects that the application/service error is caused by the 5GS, the VAL server may send the fault diagnosis report to OAM system to indicate the server fault which causes the application/service failure by utilizing the NSCE-OAM interface.\nNOTE: The APIs utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to OAM will re-utilize the fault management services in TS 28.532[8] exposed by EGMF as defined in TS 28.533[6].\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 8.\nThis contribution provides a solution for the API configuration and translation and proposes the translation of the service API as invoked by the end applications to slice APIs based on the API configuration and application to slice mapping. Slice APIs can be defined as customized/tailored sets of service APIs (which can be either NEF northbound APIs or OAM provided APIs or enabler layer/SEAL provided APIs) and can be mapped to particular slice instances. The slice APIs can be a bundled or combined API comprising of different types of APIs, which will be used to expose the telco (5GS/SEAL)-provided services as needed by the applications of the slice customer. Each slice API may be configured per network slice instance.\nThis solution provides a support functionality to the vertical application specific layer and configures the exposure of APIs in a slice-tailored manner. It is assumed that the VAL server is not initially aware of the all the API exposure capabilities and information which will be needed for the given slice based on the SLA, and NSCE plays a vital role in configuring and translating the slice API based on the per slice requirements to service APIs.\nThis solution has two procedures:\n-\ta procedure on the slice API configuration\n-\ta procedure on the slice API translation\nIn this procedure, the VAL server initially provides an application requirement to enabler server including the service KPIs and the subscribed/preferred slices. Then, the slice enabler configures the mapping of the VAL application to a slice API which is a combination/bundling of northbound APIs (from both management and control plane). In particular, a slice API (or SDK) consists of telco-provided/platform dependent service APIs (e.g. NEF, OAM, SEAl, etc), and provides an abstraction/simplification on top of them. The procedure also covers the scenario where a trigger event occurs (e.g. QoS degradation, slice load) and the mapping configuration or the slice API configuration needs to change. In this scenario, the slice enabler updates the configuration of the API and provides a notification to the VAL server.\nFigure 6.3.1.2-1 illustrates a solution for the slice API configuration.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has registered to receive network slice capability enablement services\nThe figure depicts a slice API configuration for a 3G network, illustrating the various parameters and settings that can be customized to optimize network performance.\nFigure 6.3.1.2-1: Slice API configuration\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a VAL application requirement request to the network slice capability enablement server. This request provides the service requirements / KPIs, the capability exposure requirements and a preferred/subscribed slice identification (e.g. S-NSSAI or ENSI)\n2.\tThe network slice capability enablement server maps the VAL application requirement to a slice API which includes a list of APIs which are needed to be consumed as part of this service capability exposure (such APIs can be NEF APIs as specified in TS 29.522 clause 5 e.g. related to network monitoring, slice status, analytics exposure, SEAL APIs as specified in TS 23.434, OAM provided APIs). Such mapping can be determined at the network slice capability enablement server based on the VAL application exposure requirements or can be pre-configured per slice instance. The criteria for the mapping are the capability exposure requirement per slice (based on GST parameters, or from service/slice profile] as well as the capability exposure permissions/authorization for the API invoker.\nThe network slice capability enablement server may also store the mapping of the slice API to the service API list and per service API information (e.g. data encoding, transport technology, API protocol and versions)\nNOTE: For OAM provided APIs, the consumption of the network slice management service related procedures are specified in TS 28.531[5].\n3.\tThe network slice capability enablement server subscribes/registers to consume the corresponding APIs from the 5GS (NEF and OAM) and SEAL service producers. For example, network slice capability enablement server may subscribe to consume NEF monitoring events, or SLA monitoring from OAM.\n4.\tThe network slice capability enablement server sends a VAL application requirement response to notify on the result of the request and indicate whether configuration of the slice API can be possible or not.\n5.\tThe network slice capability enablement server sends the slice API information and optionally the slice to service API mapping to the VAL server.\n6.\tA trigger event is captured by the service/API providers (e.g. control plane, management plane, SEAL) or the VAL server side (application server relocation to different EDN/DN, UE mobility to different EDN, application change of behaviour) or any other API related event captured by the network slice capability enablement server (e.g. failure, unavailability, high load).\n7.\tThe network slice capability enablement server processes the trigger event and checks and updates the mapping of service APIs to the slice APIs. The objective is to keep the slice APIs unchanged, so the VAL server is not aware of any change (if not triggered by VAL server). To accomplish this, the service APIs may need to be updated accordingly. For example, if one service API changes (e.g. due to high load, unavailability,  ..) the mapping to service APIs should be updated (e.g. if service API is a Location API which is provided by 5GC in the first place, the update would trigger the remapping to a Location API from SEAL LMS) to avoid affecting the slice API.\n8.\tThe network slice capability enablement server updates the subscription/registration to the underlying 5GS and SEAL service producers, if an update on the service APIs (e.g. NEF APIs, SEAL APIs, OAM provided APIs) is needed.\n9.\tThe network slice capability enablement server optionally notifies the VAL server on the slice/service API related updates.\nThis procedure follows the 6.3.1.2 and aims to describe how the slice API invocation request is translated to service API invocations after the slice API configuration mapping. In this procedure, the network slice capability enablement server initially receives a slice API invocation request from the vertical application based on step 5 of 6.3.1.2. Then, the network slice capability enablement server based on the slice API request fetches the service APIs to be invoked based on the slice API configuration and performs invocation requests to the corresponding service API providers.\nAs example, a slice API is requested for an IIOT slice. This may translate to: NSI Monitoring from Management Domain #1, NSSI Monitoring from Management Domain #2, network/QoS monitoring from NEF#1, Location monitoring from SEAL LMS, slice-related analytics from NWDAF (via NEF). Such translation could be based on the slice API configuration mapping of 6.3.1.2.\nFigure 6.3.1.3-1 illustrates a solution for the slice API translation based on the configuration.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has registered to receive network slice capability enablement services.\n2.\tThe slice API mapping to the VAL server has been performed based on 6.3.1.2 step 2 and the slice API information is provided to the VAL server based on 6.3.1.2 step 5.\nThe figure depicts a slice API translation, illustrating the process of converting a slice API into a format that can be used by the network. The translation involves converting the slice API into a format that can be understood by the network, ensuring that the network can effectively utilize the slice API for its intended purpose.\nFigure 6.3.1.3-1: Slice API translation\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a slice API invocation request to the network slice capability enablement server. This request provides slice API information (name, type, communication methods, protocols,..),  based on the received information in step 5 of 6.3.1.2. Service APIs are indicated above can be NEF APIs as specified in TS 29.522, SEAL APIs as specified in TS 23.434, OAM provided APIs)\nNOTE 1: For OAM provided APIs, the consumption of the network slice management service related procedures are specified in TS 28.531[5].\n2.\tAfter receiving the request, the network slice capability enablement server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the slice API invocation and maps the requested slice API to a service APIs (based on the VAL server ID / slice ID and procedure in clause 6.6.1.2).\nNOTE 2:\tIf CAPIF is used, the network slice capability enablement server acts as AEF, and the authorization is obtained by CCF.\n3.\tThe network slice capability enablement server generates a trigger for service API invocation requests to all the service APIs within the slice API.\n4.\tThe network slice capability enablement server sends a service API invocation request to the producers of the service APIs within the slice API. This may include the originated service API invoker identity information (VAL server) as well as the direct API invoker information, authorization information, service API and slice API identification.\n5.\tThe service API provider authenticates the API invoker and authorizes the request.\nNOTE 3:\tIf CAPIF is used, the requests are sent to the corresponding AEFs of the API provider's domain, and the authorization is obtained by CCF.\n6.\tThe network slice capability enablement server receives the service API invocation response as a result of the service API invocation.\n7.\tThe network slice capability enablement server sends to the VAL server a slice API invocation response as a result of the slice API invocation.\n",

This solution also addresses partially Key Issue #13, and in particular the point on \"Whether and how management domain capabilities (e.g. MnS) corresponding to the network slice need to be delivered via the NSCE server?\"\nTo be able to utilise capabilities/features of the management system the applications must be made aware of existence of such features and capabilities. All management domain (MD) features/capabilities come with a pre-configured exposure, where this can be configured by the operator for a given slice. This exposure is used to decide which application can see which information regarding the capability/feature. Exposure refers to the permissions that the 3rd party entity has gained over its use of the management service, e.g., the ability to read, or execute or modify or delete can be considered as different sorts of exposure.\nA MD feature/capability is anything of use offered by the management system to the 3rd party application. Therefore, a new feature could be a managed entity, a MnS or management API, any software, hardware, or other functionality – for example, new technology support, new coverage area, new network slice type or instance, new NFs or new network slice subnet type or instance.\nThis solution provides a mechanism which is aligned with SA5 ongoing work related to the MnS registry exposure for external discovery (see TR 28.824 clauses 5.4 and 7.1), which enables the initial discovery of MnS for a given slice based on VAL server request, and the discovery of new/modified MnS.\nIn this procedure, the VAL server initially requests the new MnS which are supported by a target slice and based on this request the NSCE server requests from the OAM the MnS discovery (via EGMF). Then, the OAM/MnS registry derives the details to be exposed based on the NSCE server/VAL server permissions and provides the list of MnS for the given slice and the access details via the NSCE server to the VAL server. This procedure also includes the case when a new/modified MnS is deployed at the MD for the given slice, and the OAM/MnS registry provides this information directly to VAL server via EGMF (assuming that VAL server has registered to the MD).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services\n2.\tThe NSCE server is trusted by the 3GPP MD.\n3.\tMnS registry at OAM is aware of the allowed MnS and the exposure levels for a given slice\nFigure 6.8.1.2-1 illustrates a solution for the MnS discovery support.\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the MnS discovery support, which is a crucial component in the 8.1.2-1 version of the software. It illustrates the process of discovering and identifying the MnS (Molecule-Specific) features in a molecular structure. The figure includes various elements such as the molecular structure, the discovery support interface, and the user interface elements. The figure is designed to be easily understandable and provides a clear visual representation of the MnS discovery process.\nFigure 6.8.1.2-1: MnS discovery support\nThe steps of this embodiment are as follows:\n1.\tThe VAL server requests from NSCE server the expected exposure capability type and the related exposure level for a target slice or for a given VAL application, using the VAL application ID, the MD ID and optionally the slice ID.\n2.\tThe NSCE server translates the expected exposure capability type in to MnS exposure requirement.\n3.\tThe NSCE server coordinates with the 5GS and discovers the related network service(s), by triggering the MnS service discovery as specified in TS 28.533[6], clause5.1.1 and 6.1.1. The 5GS, acting as the discovery service producer, sends the discovery result including related exposure information such as management service identifier, management service information and management service producer information to the NSCE server.\n4.\tThe NSCE server sends the service/management data based on step 3, including the list of MnS and the corresponding exposure details to the VAL server. Here to mention that based on exposure level, the exposure details may be different.\n5.\tVAL server registers to NSCE server for the management domain capability exposure for the subscribed slice.\nThe registration procedure of the VAL server to NSCE server for management capability exposure is based on Solution #7.\n6.\tThe MnS registry discovers new or modified MnS in the 3GPP MD. The MnS registry derives the details to be exposed to the VAL server (via the NSCE server), based on the exposure level configured by the new or modified MnS and the exposure levels of registered VAL applications and NSCE server. The MnS change could be triggered due to changes on:\n- New/modified management service producers\n- New/modified managed entities – such as new radio, new technology or new NFs\n- New/modified technical support – such as support in a new geography or coverage area\n- Availability of new management data – e.g. related to slice performance\n7.\tThe MnS registry sends to the NSCE server the new / modified MnS, as discovered in step 6.\n8.\tThe information on the discovered new/modified MnS is sent from the NSCE server to VAL server.\n",

The network slice is a virtual network element that can be adapted to different network conditions, such as network congestion or network failure. The figure shows the steps involved in adapting the network slice, including the selection of the appropriate network slice, the configuration of the network slice, and the deployment of the network slice. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network slice, such as the network slice's location and the network slice's status. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the network slice adaptation process for the VAL application.\nFigure 16.3.2.4-1: Network slice adaptation for VAL application\n1.\tThe VAL client provides a new application requirement to the NSCE client, indicating a new service profile for the VAL application.

This trigger may be in the form of exact requested network slice (and optionally DNN) for the VAL UE of the VAL application; or indication that the VAL application needs to be remapped to a different network slice (and optionally DNN). The trigger may also include additional parameters based on the step 1 request, including requested location criteria, time window, access type preference, associated group id or UE IP address preservation indicator.\nNOTE 1：How the requested network slice is known by the NSCE client is out of scope of this release.\n3.\tThe NSCE server processes the request and triggers the network slice configuration per VAL UE within the VAL Application.\nNOTE 2: How the NSCE server decides to trigger the network slice configuration is implementation dependent.\nNOTE 3：Whether and how the NSCE server triggers the network slice adaptation for all the VAL UEs within the VAL Application is out of scope of this release.\n4.\tThe NSCE server acting as AF provides the updated S-NSSAI, location criteria, time window, access type preference, associated group id or UE IP address preservation indicator and DNN per VAL UE.

The subscription is designed to be flexible and can be easily updated to accommodate new network conditions. This feature is essential for ensuring the network's reliability and performance.\nFigure 16.3.2.X-1: VAL UE network slice adaptation subscription\n1.\tThe NSCE client sends a network slice adaptation subscription request to the NSCE server to subscribe to network slice adaptations. The subscription request includes identifiers of the VAL UE, VAL application, network slice and a notification target address.\n2.\tThe NSCE server processes the request by checking if the NSCE client is authorized to initiate the network slice adaptation subscription request. Further, the NSCE server acting as an AF may subscribe via the NEF to receive network slice adaptation notifications (i.e., changes to URSP rules) applicable to the VAL UE.\n3.\tThe NSCE server replies with a network slice adaptation subscription response to the NSCE client indicating the subscription status.\n16.3.2.X\tProcedure for VAL UE network slice adaptation notification\nFigure 16.3.2.X-1 illustrates the VAL UE network slice adaptation notification procedure.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe NSCE client has connected to the NSCE server;\nThe figure depicts a VAL UE network slice adaptation notification, which is a crucial step in ensuring network stability and reliability.

Whether and how could the NSCE server interact with other NSCE server?\n-\tWhether and how does SEAL need to be enhanced to support NSCE client to interact with NSCE server in the EDN and NSCE server outside the EDN?\nThis scenario targets mainly deployments where the slice enabler is deployed at the edge and the migration to different DN will require that the ongoing slice is supported at the target area to ensure meeting the application session requirements. The slice parameters monitoring at the target area (e.g. for per NSI/NSSI resource situation) need to be known at the server NSCE server to allow for pro-active slice (or slice subnet) modification trigger to avoid degradation of the application service performance.\nIn this procedure, the NSCE server initially receives an expected/predicted UE location/mobility change request outside an EDN service area for one or more UEs within the VAL application session (e.g. such session can be an indirect V2V session or a multiplayer gaming session). Then, service or target NSCE server checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC) whether the serving slice is available and can offer the same performance at the target EDN. Thereafter, NSCE server evaluates the need for a slice modification (e.g. a slice lifecycle related trigger change) e.g. a slice subnet resource adaptation to allow for optimizing the application performance at the target area. Based on this decision/recommendation, it provides the action to the OAM and supports the re-mapping of NSCE server for the NSCE client proactively, before UE mobility happens.\nFigure 6.21.1.2-1 illustrates the solution to Key Issue #12 on network slice capability exposure in the edge data network to allow for slice modification when a vertical application migrates to a different EDN supported by different NSCE server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability enablement server\n2.\tInitially, VAL client of VAL UE is mapped to Slice#1, and NSCE client of VAL UE has established a connection to NSCE server#1 (S-NSCE server).\n3.\tThe S-NSCE server has already discovered the T-NSCE server and its area of coverage.\n\nThe figure depicts a network slicing system, showing how slices can be modified in real-time to adapt to changing network conditions. The system uses a distributed NSCE server to manage slices, with a predictive slice modification feature that allows for quick and efficient changes to slice configurations. This feature is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of network services and maintaining network reliability.\nFigure 6.21.1.2-1: Support for predictive slice modification in distributed NSCE server deployments\n1a/1b. The VAL server sends to S-NSCE server a VAL application service continuity requirement due to predicted/expected UE or group UE mobility to an area covered by a different EDN. Such UE predicted mobility can be based on analytics received by NWDAF or ADAES or can be predicted by the VAL layer (VAL server or VAL UE).\n2.\tS-NSCE server acting as AF, may interact with 5GC to query the UE specific information (location, UE connection capabilities) as well as network conditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288).\n3.\tS-NSCE server may also interact with OAM to query on the up to data configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531[5], 5.1.12) at the target area and measurements for the slice at the target area.\n4.\tS-NSCE server checks whether new NSCE service area supports slice #1 and if slice #1 offers similar performance in target area. Here we assume that the S-NSCE is aware of the per application QoS requirements / KPIs (or has acquired this information from the VAL server).\nIf the current slice doesn't fulfil these requirements, S-NSCE interacts with T-NSCE server (by sending the VAL application service continuity requirement and optionally a proposed action) to negotiate and jointly determine the need for a slice lifecycle change at the target area and translates this to a trigger action towards OAM (slice provisioning MnS producer). This trigger action can be the outcome of the negotiation and can be a requested slice modification or the slice #1 creation/instantiation at the target area (this may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and use slice #1, so it may be beneficial to create slice #1 at the target area). Such trigger action can be generated by either the S-NSCE server or the T-NSCE server based on the deployment.\n5a/b.Then, S- or T-NSCE server may send the trigger action to the slice provisioning MnS at OAM (e.g. slice modification for network slice) based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group mobility. Following the MnS provides a response with a positive or negative result.\n6.\tAfter the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in 5b), if the NSCE client needs to be remapped to different NSCE server (due to the expected change of UE location), the NSCE client establishes a new connection with T-NSCE and terminates the one with S-NSCE (in case of subscription-based interaction), or in case of request-based interaction, it updates the mapping at the client side, and maintains the new NSCE server address / ID and may also request for report configuration information for the target NSCE area.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution addresses the KI 11 bullet on resolving misalignments between VAL server policy (e.g., requirements provided when adding or changing slice) and the NSCE service provider policy (NSPP).\nThe VAL server policy can be in the form of a profile or configuration which the VAL server requests to be applied or maintained by NSCE, e.g., a profile including the configuration of several services using the same network slice. Alternatively, the VAL server policy can be provided together with the request for an action, e.g., adding a network slice. When the action requested also includes a VAL server policy to be applied, it needs to be aligned with the existing network slice policies available at NSCE i.e., NSPPs.\nFigure 6.22.1.2 illustrates the procedure for slice lice policy and configuration alignment\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE service provider policy (NSPP) is available at the NSCE Server.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is assumed that NSPP includes ranges of NS capabilities which can be adapted via NSCE, along with conditions under which such adaptations are allowed. This policy is used by NSCE also in other TR solutions to determine whether parameters in NS management operations are within allowed ranges, e.g., clause 6.10.2.1 step 10, fig 6.11.1.2-1 steps 2 and/or 3, fig 6.11.1.2-2 steps 2 and/or 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.17.1.2 step 5., clause 6.19.1.2 step 5., etc.\n2.\tThe VAL server is authorized to receive NSCE services.\nThe figure depicts a policy alignment diagram, illustrating the alignment of different policy components within a network. The diagram includes various policy elements such as network policies, security policies, and service policies, each represented by different colored lines and shapes. The alignment is visually represented by the positioning of these elements, with the policy components being aligned horizontally and vertically, ensuring that they are consistent and easily identifiable. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the policy alignment process, making it easier to understand and manage the policies within the network.\nFigure 6.22.1.2: Policy alignment\n1.\tVAL server sends a provisioning or action request to NSCE server. The request contains the VAL policy.\nNOTE 2:\tThe request in this step is described generically and can correspond to one or more requests to be defined in the normative phase to support other solutions. For example, the request corresponds to clause 6.1.1.2 step 1, clause 6.9.1.2 step 1, clause 6.10.1.2 step 8, clause 6.11.1.1 step 1, clause 6.11.1.2 step 1, clause 6.13.1.2 step 2, clause 6.17.1.2 step 1 etc. The response in step 3 is to be defined in a complementary manner.\n2.\tThe NSCE server checks whether the provided VAL policy conflicts with the NSCE service provider policy. If not, the action requested, if any, is performed.\nIf the VAL policy conflicts with the NSCE service provider policy, the NSCE server can determine parameters harmonizing the two configurations. The NSCE server determines parameters harmonizing the configurations if previously authorized.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the normative phase, this step can be implemented, for example, as part of the following: clause 6.1.1.2 steps 2, 6 or 9, clause 6.10.2.1 step 10, fig 6.11.1.2-1 steps 2 and/or 3, fig 6.11.1.2-2 steps 2 and/or 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.17.1.2 step 5., clause 6.19.1.2 step 5., etc.\n3.\tNSCE server sends the VAL server a response indicating whether the VAL policy conforms with NSPP. If the policies conflicted, the NSCE server provides optional parameters values that allow the policies to be harmonized. If the policies did not conflict, the response indicates that there is alignment. If an action was also requested in step 1, the result of the action can be provided in the response.\n4.\tThe NSCE Server can provide a notification to 5GS with the result of the compare and harmonize procedure.\nNOTE 4:\tIn the normative phase the specification of this step is to be aligned with SA5 specifications\n\n",

Alternatively, this solution can be implemented as a stand-alone process similar to the one described in clause 6.19., with the slice requirement updates resulting mainly from interactions between VAL Server and NSCE Server (not from interactions between NSCE and EGMF, as captured in the clause 6.19. solution),\nThe solution in this clause can be used to enhance request/response messaging and procedural steps specified within the scope of other solutions.

For this scenario, if the edge/NPN deployed NSCE wants to access the NEF/NWDAF/NSACF services or to receive policies from OAM, it needs to interact to the global NSCE.\nA further use case could be that some NSCE services (e.g. MnS discovery) are locally provided to edge -native VAL servers (for example as a micro-service), whereas other capabilities are provided for the whole PLMN area. So, the edge/NPN NSCE includes a subset of capabilities which are edge native.

Designs, builds and operates its communication services. The CSP provided communication service can be built with or without network slice.\n-\tCommunication Service Customer (CSC): Uses communication services.\n-\tNetwork Operator (NOP): Designs, builds and operates networks and provides related services, including network services and network slices.\nAlso, according to TS 28.530: \"In case of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) (cf. clause 4.1.6), the Communication Service Provider (CSP) role can be refined into NSaaS Provider (NSaaSP) role – or, in short, Network Slice Provider (NSP) - and the Communication Service Customer (CSC) role can be refined into NSaaS Customer (NSaaSC) role – or, in short, Network Slice Customer (NSC). A NSC can, in turn, offer its own communication services to its own customers, being thus CSP at the same time. A tenant might take the role of a NSC.\"\nFigure 4.1.6.1 of TS 28.530 illustrates some examples on how network slices can be utilized to deliver communication services, including network slice as a Service. For simplicity this figure omits the details of how NFs are being managed and does not show their groupings into network slice subnet:\na)\tA Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) is provided to CSC-A by CSP-A. Unlike the communication service delivered to end customers, in NSaaS, the offered service is the actual network slice.\nb)\tCSC-A can use the network slice obtained from CSP-A to support own Communication Services or may add additional network functions to the obtained NSaaS and offer the resulting combination as a new network slice to CSP-B. In this case, CSC-A plays the role of NOP-B and builds his own network. The network slice obtained by CSC-A from CSP-A becomes a \"building block\" or a network slice subnet of CSC-A in its role of NOP-B. The NOP-B (a.k.a. CSC-A) combines this network slice subnet with other network slice subnets and offers the new network slice subnet as network slice to CSP-B.\nc) \tCSP-B can use the network slice obtained from CSC-A / NOP-B to deliver communication services to its end customers (as CSC-B).\n\nThe figure depicts various network slices as a service (NSaaS) examples, illustrating how communication services are delivered to end customers. These slices are designed to provide flexibility and scalability, enabling service providers to offer a wide range of communication services to their customers. The figure includes examples of different types of network slices, such as voice, video, and data, as well as their respective services. The use of NSaaS is a key trend in the telecommunications industry, as it allows service providers to offer a wide range of communication services to their customers, while also providing a platform for innovation and cost-effectiveness.\nFigure 4.1.6.1: Examples of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) being utilized to deliver communication services to end customers [TS 28.530]\n\n[Observation B.1-1] For the NSaaS model, NSCE can be defined as an NSC of the NSP, which in turn offers its own communication services to its own customers, being thus CSP at the same time.\n[Observation B.1-2] A Network Slice in NSaaS model can be combined with additional functions, and a new slice can be provided by the CSC-A which acts as NOP-B. In such model, the NSCE server can provide enablement services for the new slice provided by the NOP-A customer.\n[Observation B.1-3] It is not necessary that the NOP-B \"slice parameters\" are the same as the NOP-A \"slice parameters\"; hence the slice areas for the resulting slice can be different from the slice area provided by NOP-B/CSC-A.\nTS 28.530 also specifies the \"network slices as NOP internals\" model. In this model, the network slices are not part of the NOP service offering and hence are not visible to its customers. However, the NOP, to provide support to communication services, may decide to deploy network slices, e.g. for internal network optimization purposes. This model allows CSC to use the network as the end user or optionally allows CSC to monitor the service status (assurance of the SLA associated with the internally offered network slice). The CSP should be able to provide the service status information (e.g. service performance, fault information, traffic data, etc) to CSC via the management exposure interface.\nThe figure depicts various network slices, including network protocol (NOP) internals, as well as examples of network slices as NOP internals. This figure is crucial for understanding the internal structure of network protocols and their internals.\nFigure 4.1.7.1: Examples of network slice as NOP internals [TS 28.530]\n\n[Observation B.1-4] For the network slices as NOP internals model, the NSCE server can be only defined as part of NOP to translate the slice specific requirements to communication service requirements and vice versa.\n",

The variety of services and the deployment aspects depend on the different assumptions for the slice owner / provider, the slice customer and the enablement service provider. With respect to NSCALE, the NSCE server can play different roles based on the business models. For example, NSCE server can be:\n-\tdeployed by NOP / MNO\n-\tdeployed by an Edge / Cloud Provider, as a trusted 3rd party\n-\tdeployed by a vertical industry, which can be the end slice customer\nFrom business perspective, if the NSCE server is not part of vertical or MNO, the following business model apply. In Figure X.2-1, the different interactions among all the involved entities are provided. More specifically, in this model the end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the vertical/ASP and can have app-level service agreement with vertical/ASP(s). The end user/UE also has a PLMN subscription arrangement with the MNO. The UE used by the end user is allowed to be registered on the MNO's network. MNO (via OAM) can have a slice SLA with the vertical / ASP, which is optional when vertical customer is the NSC. In addition, due to the involvement of a NSCE service provider, additional agreements can be possible between the NSCE server and VAL/ASP layer and the NOP/MNO(s):\n-\tthe enablement service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service provider include the agreement on the value-added services, which in case on NSaaS these are services related to the consumed slice from NOP. So, the end customer (VAL) subscribes to NSCE server for receiving additional services for optimizing the slice utilization. In case that the NSCE server is a NSP towards VAL customer, then such agreement can relate to slice SLA (for the slice provided by the NSCE server).\n-\tthe service agreement between MNO and NSCE service provider is for consuming 5GS services (and being also authorized and trusted to provide additional services on top). Such agreement could be also a slice SLA for the scenarios when NSCE server is the NSC of the MNO (in NSaaS model).\nThe figure depicts a network diagram with various business relationships represented by different colored lines and symbols.
