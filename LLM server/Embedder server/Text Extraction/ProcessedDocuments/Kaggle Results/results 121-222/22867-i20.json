            "description": "Communication infrastructure is essential to the successes of smart energy, generally termed the 'Smart Grid'. A power grid consists of four building blocks: power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption. These different phases require different services, and these services have distinct communication requirements. Examples of communication include data collection, control and ongoing regulation, though these are functions of diverse services – e.g. SCADA applications for the Energy Management System (EMS) or Distribution Management System (DMS). Smart Grid communication infrastructure, overcomes different challenges in order to provide:\n-\tDistributed power generation, increasingly including 'renewable' or 'clean' energy sources\n-\tSafe & highly efficient power transforming & transmission\n-\tFlexible & reliable power distribution\n-\tEfficient & available power consumption\n-\tCyber security & resilience/redundancy\nSmart Grid services today rely upon a range of telecommunications services, delivered through a blend of private networks and commercially provided services. As the energy system goes through changes, becoming more pervasive (in territorial terms,) complex and sophisticated to meet the above goals, there is a distinct opportunity for 5G to meet more of the utility communication sector's needs and thereby become increasingly relevant to this vertical, addressing existing shortcomings, as it builds out further capacity and enhances existing infrastructure. Many of these grid services are standardized by other standards bodies, e.g. IEC60870, IEC61850 and IEEE.\nIn summary, it is considered beneficial for 3GPP specifications in addressing 5G system support of different use cases and service requirements for Smart Grid.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Distributed energy includes various forms such as solar energy, wind energy, fuel cell and gas combined. It is generally distributed in the user site, or near locations to realize energy generation, storage and supply. Distributed energy system has the characteristics of flexible location and decentralization, which adapts well to decentralized energy demand, and has reduced the huge investment required for upgrading the transmission and distribution power grid. It also works as a backup for the large power grid to improve reliability of whole energy supply. In storms, ice and snow weather, when the large power grid is severely damaged, distributed energy sources can form islands or microgrids on their own to provide emergency energy to important users such as hospitals, transportation hubs, radio and television.\nBut the distributed energy system has brought new technical problems and challenges to the power grid operation. When the distributed energy is connected to the large power grid, the energy flow on the distributed power grid becomes more complicated for that the user is becoming both the electricity user and the generator, and the current presents two-way flow and real-time dynamic changes. To improve the reliability, flexibility and efficiency of the distributed power grid, the communication system with a low latency, high reliability, massive connections and a high data rate is considered.\n\n\nFigure 5.1.1-1: Example of Distributed Energy Storage grid architecture\nSeeing Figure 5.1.1-1, it is one example of Distributed Energy storage grid architecture. The distributed power grid which is comprised of residential, commercial and light storage users, requires to exchange information among the Distributed Energy Storage Management Platform (DESMP) and the diverse Distributed Energy Devices (DED). The information exchanged in the distributed energy grid is not only to collect energy related data, but also to coordinate working flows of the distributed energy storage equipment, to change the equivalent load characteristics, and to realize flexible energy grid through load interaction etc.\nThe DED is plug-and-play and periodically collects the operating information, such as battery energy, charge and discharge energy, alarm information, etc., and transfers them to DESMP. The DESMP regularly maintains connections with the DED and determines the online status and issue instructions to the DED to control the switch of the device and set the energy etc. Further, it obtains the electricity, energy, load and other information of the grid-connected users in the area from the DED to support the decision-making of flexible interaction between the distributed energy storage and the large power grid, or to analyze the user's electricity habits to guide the operation of distributed energy storage.\n",

                            "text_content": "Every time after the DED and the DESMP establish a communication connection, the DED reports its configuration data to DESMP. For reliability, in general, the communications between DESMP and DED should be supported by multiple connections and backup each other.\nThe heartbeat data is always transmitted between the DESMP and DED to maintain a normal connection.\nIn the process of general service flow, there are three kinds of data exchange:\nCommand delivering: DESMP sends control commands to the DED. It always requires <10ms latency with 99.9% reliability communication service for control frequency, power etc.\nData reporting: equipment normal operation information, mainly including energy storage battery, energy storage converter, AC and DC charging and discharging equipment and other current operating data. It always requires <1s latency.\nOther data: For example, the DED actively requests data, such as requesting the electricity price information from DESMP, and the AC/DC charging and discharging facility sends relevant information about the current charging and discharging under abnormal conditions.\nBased on the general service flow, in different scenarios, the data collection requirement is different. The following lists two typical scenarios in distributed energy storage service (NOTE: these data are from CEPRI).\nCase 1: data collection for energy storage in rural area\nIn the typical scenario of energy storage in rural area, it is always a large energy storage in one location. Considering the data collection, taking 100Ah lithium iron phosphate batteries as an example, the integration of a 2MWh energy storage container requires 6,250 batteries. So there are 6250 voltage and temperature collection points, and 780 current collection points, plus other 12-bit data e.g. alarms, internal auxiliary equipment such as air-conditioning, environmental monitoring and video. The collection data for the 2 MWh energy storage container is about 20,000 16-bit data and among them, the current related collection points is about 800, which need implement collection every millisecond and report every 10 ms, other 13000 points need implement collection and report every second.\nThus, there are at least two traffic models (except video) in the typical 100MWh energy storage station which is constructed by 50 2MWh energy storage containers. One is for current flow with (800*50=40000) collection 16-bit data per millisecond, and every 10ms, the UL reported data volume is (40000*2*10=800 kbyte/10ms) which data rate is 640Mbit/s. The others are (13000*50=650000) collection 16-bit data per second, and every second, the UL reported data volume is (650000*2=1300 kbyte/s) which data rate is 10.4 Mbit/s.\nBesides above, the surveillance video is the third kind of collected data. In every storage container, the typical video data is 12.5 Mbytes for every second. And in one energy storage station, there need 50 storage containers. Thus, the UL data rate per storage station is up to 12.5 Mbytes/s * 50(containers) * 8 = 5 Gbit/s.\nCase 2: data collection for distributed energy storage in urban area\nVirtual energy storage (VES) is a new type of energy storage system formed by the aggregation of user side power loads (such as air conditioning, refrigeration, heating, electric vehicles, etc.) with certain adjustment capabilities. [2]\nIn urban area scenario, electric vehicle is one type of VES element. It is a trend that the DED will be installed in the electric vehicle not only in the charging pole.\nFor electric vehicle, it is generally installed with about 7000 batteries which requires 7000 voltages, about 1000 current & temperature collection points at least. Further considering other collected data such as electronic control, charging and vehicle-grid interaction, for one electric vehicle, there is total about 10,000 16-bit data and among them, the current related collection data is more than 1000 16-bit data which need to be collected every millisecond and reported every 10ms, the others is more than 8000 16-bit data which need to be collected and reported every second.\nSo, there are also at least two traffic models in this case, one is the current model, every 10 ms, the UL reported data volume is (1000*2*10=20 kbytes) which data rate is 16 Mbit/s. The other is reported every second and the data volume is (8000*2=16 kbytes/s) which data rate is 128 kbit/s.\n",

In this way, the Power Enterprise based on the analysis of the user's power consumption behavior give users more scientific and reasonable power consumption suggestions, to develop users' power consumption and energy-saving habits. This is also a possible usage of AMI.\nAdvanced Metering utilizes AMI (Advanced Meter Infrastructure) system to collect, count, analyze, distribute and manage abnormal electrical energy data in the generation, transmission, distribution and using stages. It can collect real-time data of user power, monitor line loss, and power outage, real-time identify the change of household, calculate of three-phase imbalance, and monitor station voltage.\nNOTE:\tThe information obtained from smart appliances are never considered accurate nor guaranteed by certification authorities. This information is useful to customers to understand and influence their consumption patterns.\nThe AMI is usually comprised of smart meter, concentrator, two-way communication network, measurement data management system (MDMS), and an optional user indoor network (HAN). See Figure 5.2.1-1.\n\nThe figure depicts an AMI (Application-Independent Media Interface) architecture, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The diagram includes a base station (BS), a media gateway (MG), and a network interface controller (NIC). The BS serves as the central hub for the network, while the MG provides a virtualized environment for the media services. The NIC facilitates the communication between the BS and the media gateway, ensuring efficient data transfer. The figure highlights the importance of network virtualization and the role of the NIC in managing the network's resources.\nFigure 5.2.1-1: AMI example architecture\nIn general, the electric smart meter co-works with MDMS to deliver and perform control command for measuring instruments. The electric smart meters monitor relevant user energy status and deliver these data through concentrator to MDMS. The MDMS sends control commands according to its policy and status data collected. The remote commands from the MDMS include: tripping, closing permission, alarm, alarm release, power protection, power protection release.\nAccurate Fee control is one of the basic service of advanced metering, when the user owes the fee or there is an emergency, it should be able to cut off or restore power supply in time, as the operation involves the safety& QoE of power users, a real-time response is required.\nFor the advanced metering application, the application layer through the communication protocol to encrypt and protect these key data, in order to protect all data, at least logical isolation is required, physical isolation is better.\nNOTE:\tBilling may or may not be correlated with use of MDMS service, as in many geographies the DSO is a distinct business entity from the Retailer, who has the direct business relationship with the customer. In such a case, the smart meter information will not be correlated with any billing information and cannot therefore provide feedback to customers concerning the billing impact of their energy usage.\nDue to massive electricity meter boxes and household appliances keep online at the same time, the amount of connections the mobile network maintains simultaneously is so enormous that challenging to the mobile network capacity. It is estimated that the increased connections will up to 50-100 times.\n",

Its characteristic lies in the distributed sinking of the processing logic of the original master station to the intelligent power distribution terminal. Through the 5G communication among the intelligent power distribution terminals and distributed master station, intelligent judgment, analysis, fault location, fault isolation and non-fault area power supply restoration operations can be realized.\nIn this way, the fault handling process can be fully automated, the fault scope can be restricted and fault handling time of the distribution network can be decreased from seconds to milliseconds.\nAs illustrated in the Figure 5.3.1-1, the distributed feeder automation system is mainly composed of distributed master station, distribution monitoring terminal and the communication system. The distribution master station is mainly used for information gathering and human-computer interaction, and the distributed terminal is used for feeder status information collection, judgment, fault location, isolation and power supply restoration. The implementation result will be reported to the distribution master station. The communication system is to provide the communication link among the distribution terminals.\nThe distribution master station is usually connected with the 5G system via wired or LAN which is out of 3GPP scope. Distribution master station manages multiple distributed terminals.\nEach distributed terminal here is served by 5G UE to exchange the collected data with other distributed terminals. And from application aspect, the communication between distributed terminals is peer-to-peer. The connection between the distributed terminal and the 5G UE is out of 3GPP scope.\nThe 5G communication here should have high reliability. Therefore at least two communication links are usually deployed for hot standby or transmitting data synchronously between two distributed monitoring terminals. And it has the same condition between one distributed terminal and the distributed master station.\nThe figure depicts a distributed feeder automation architecture, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The diagram includes a central control unit (CCU), distributed control units (DCUs), and distributed load controllers (DLCs). The CCU manages the overall system, while the DCUs and DLCs control the distribution of power to individual loads. The architecture is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for easy expansion and integration with other systems.\nFigure 5.3.1-1: Example of distributed feeder automation architecture\nGOOSE protocol is a burst-based transmission application protocol used in Smart Grid. During the feeder system normal working phase, the heartbeat packet is periodic transmitted with 1s. When a fault occurs, it performs incremental periodic transmission with 2ms, 2ms, 4ms or 8ms time interval. After there is no sudden change in collected data, the heartbeat packet transmission of 1s is restored.\nIn general, the feeder distributed terminals can be deployed along the overhead line or integrated in one power distribution cabinet per one square kilometre. These two topologies will require different communication density.\nAssumption of one CBD of a national sub provincial city, by calculating the load of various types of electricity consumption, it can be estimated the future power load in this area. Table 5.3.1-1 illustrates the typical estimated power load now and future in the area.\nTable 5.3.1-1: the typical power load estimated in the CBD\n\nGenerally, one single urban medium voltage distribution line should not be separated exceed 4 segments, and the load of each segment should not exceed 1MW. So, for one single circuit 10kV distribution line, the line load should not be higher than 4MW (1MW*4 = 4MW). In the medium level listed in the above table, the load density of the CBD area is about 20MW / km2, the number of 10kV lines per square kilometre can be calculated as follows:\nN = 20mV / 4MW = 5.\nAccording to the distribution network reliability configuration principle, one backup is required and the N will be 6.\nConsidering the switches per segment and additional switches on the high voltage side, the number of required distribution terminal n can be calculated as follow:\n-\tOverhead line scenario: n = 6 * (5+4) = 54.\nNOTE: \t\"6\" represents the number of 10kV lines per square kilometre, \"5\" is switches number per line, \"4\" is the number of the boundary switch which is installed on the high voltage side of the distribution transformer of each segment of the line.\n-\tPower distribution cabinets scenario: n = 6 * (4 * 3 + 1) = 78.\nNOTE: \t\"6\" represents the number of 10kV lines, \"4\" means the number of distribution cabinet in one 10kV line. \"3\" is the number of switch including the boundary switch in each power distribution cabinet, \"1\" means every line end has a switch to monitor the line.\nIn the future, when the power load density increases, or with differential protection utilized in the Feeder automation, more distribution terminals (e.g. more than 100) need to be considered.\n",

The upstream power distribution terminal of the node will continue to send status information, while the downstream power distribution terminal will not report the fault signal.

According to this feature, when a feeder fault occurs, every distributed terminal could judge its position relative to the fault location.\n3)\tFault isolation: When the fault node is determined, according to the preconfigured action order, all switches around the faulty node will be open to realize effective identification and isolation of the faulty area.\n4)\tFault restoration: For the restoration of power supply in non-fault area, it is necessary to clarify the number and wiring of the switches it tied to, e.g. when a fault occurs in the cabinet of the one-in-two-out ring main unit, if two outgoing lines have isolated power-loss area.

                            "text_content": "Line current differential protection (defined as 87L in IEEE C37.2-2008 [3]) has been widely used in electrical transmission systems to protect High-Voltage (HV) transmission lines. As a proven protection mechanism, it is also deployed for power distribution networks to protect (Medium-Voltage) MV distribution lines where applicable. The popularity of line current differential protection comes from the fast protection mechanism, reliability and the absolute selectivity of protected zones. Therefore, for Low-Voltage (LV) and MV power lines (both underground and overhead), current differential protection could be deployed easily with cellular technology without having to lay dedicated communication cables, either in refurbishment or new distribution substation construction projects.\nThe mechanism of line current differential protection follows the Kirchhoff's current law, which is that the sum of currents at a junction of a circuit equals to zero. As illustrated in Figure 5.4.1-1, two protection relays deployed at two substations form the protection zone, within which the power line is protected from incidents such as short circuit. Each protection relay continuously measures its local current and transmits it towards the other. Each protection relay compares the locally measured current and the current received from the remote relay to calculate the differential current at a specific instant of time. Figure 5.4.1-1 shows two communication channels (illustrated as dashed arrow boxes) between the two protection relays. Here in this contribution the \"communication channel\" refers to the channel used for transferring the phase segregated current value data between the two protection relays. The current phasors from the two protection relays, deployed geographically apart from each other, should be aligned in time for the current differential algorithm to execute correctly. For Relay_a, at a given moment the local current is I_a'_Tx, and the time-aligned remote current from Relay_b is I_b'_Rx. Using them as input, the protection algorithm in Relay_a derives the differential current. The same mechanism functions in Relay_b. Whenever the differential current exceeds the threshold values as determined by the relay restraint characteristics, the relay will send a trip command to the circuit breaker (XCBR) to open the circuit, thus protecting the power line from being burnt down and any secondary damages a fireball blaze on the power line can cause.\nThe figure depicts a line current differential protection system, showing two protection relays (Relay_a and Relay_b) deployed in two substations. The system utilizes two protection relays to ensure line current protection in the event of a fault in one relay. The relay configuration and the substation locations are clearly labeled, providing a clear understanding of the system's components and their interconnections.\nFigure 5.4.1-1: Line Current Differential Protection by two protection relays (Relay_a and Relay_b), deployed in two substations\nThe protection function of the protection relay depends on three things:\nSampling, buffering and transferring local current.\nReceiving the sampled current values from the remote protection relay.\nTime synchronization of the two protection relays - performing time-alignment of the locally buffered current samples with received remote samples.\nIn terms of sampling, a protection relay needs to sample the local current periodically, and transfers sampled data within a pre-defined time period T. In other words, the communication latency should not exceed T. Max of T is specified in IEC 61850-90-1 [4] to be between 5ms and 10ms, which infers the latency requirement for this use case. Secondly, once the buffered samples pertinent to the same instant in time are available, the relay must align them in time. As a relay needs to perform correct alignment of local and received data before calculating the differential current, the relay needs to know well enough when the remote relay transmits a specific data packet. Current clock synchronization is realized by relays attaching timestamps to measurement samples before transmission. A modern relay with an Ethernet interface normally needs to resort to IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol [5] for synchronization, since the relay assumes the Ethernet network to be non-deterministic.\nRegarding time alignment of local and received remote data, two methods exist, namely the method to use external time source such as GNSS, or \"channel-based\" alignment method. Due to various reasons in some smaller substations a GNSS receiver is not available. Even for a substation installed with a GNSS receiver, relays shall fall back to channel-based alignment for time synchronization, should GNSS become unavailable. For this reason, support of the \"channel-based alignment\" is the focus of the proposed use case.\nDifferent from GNSS-based alignment that is not adversely affected by communication channel asymmetry, the channel-based alignment is critically dependent on channel symmetry – near equal latency in transmission and reception directions between two protection relays respectively. Currently in the Smart Grid automation market, the max communication channel asymmetry is dependent on the chosen type of differential protection relay and is vendor-specific. For instance, an old-fashioned TDM-based differential protection relay is more sensitive to asymmetry than a modern type differential protection relay with an Ethernet interface. The latter can deal with asymmetry till 3ms, above which the relay will enter blocking mode. According to the IEEE C37.243 Guide [6], the asymmetry in terms of communication channel latency is around 2ms. From here on, focus is on how to satisfy channel-based alignment requirements using services from 5G system.\nOption 1:\nPer existing protection relay algorithm implementation, channel-based alignment presumes the delay in each communication direction to be (nearly) half of the RTT. If 5G system provides this condition, existing relay algorithm can be reused. According to IEEE C37.243 Guide, 2ms can be required as the max communication channel latency asymmetry between the two protection relays. Below are some additional details how protection relays performs channel-based alignment:\nRelay_a attaches a timestamp to the transmitted measurement data, Relay_b receives the timestamp from Relay_a and re-attaches the same timestamp to the next out-going data packet towards Relay_a. By receiving the original timestamp in return packet, Relay_a determines the RRT by subtracting the present local time with the returned timestamp. Halving the RTT, Relay_a obtains the amount of time shift/alignment it shall apply to the current samples received from Relay_b. Therefore, it is required that the communication channel from Relay_a to Relay_b incurs near-equal latency as the channel from Relay_b to Relay_a. Following this approach, excessive communication channel asymmetry between Relay_a and Relay_b will lead to misalignment of currents (such as the I_b'_Tx and I_a'_Rx at Relay_b in Figure 5.4.1-1), manifesting in phase shift. This will result in increase or decrease of the apparent differential current, causing blocking of the protection or in the worst case a false trip and further negatively impact Smart Grid availability and reliability.\nOption 2:\nAlternatively, instead of requiring the communication channels (from Relay_a to Relay_b, and from Relay_b to Relay_a) to be highly symmetrical regarding latency, a different approach could be proposed as a new 5G service to improve protection relay design by the Smart Grid OEMs. To achieve the same goal as for Relay_a to know how much it needs to time shift the received current samples from Relay_b to align with its local current, it is sufficient if the 5G system could provide such a protection relay with the latency of the relevant communication channel (latency from Relay_b to Relay_a for Relay_a, and latency from Relay_a to Relay_b for Relay_b) with good confidence/precision. This provided latency value could either be estimated or assigned by the 5G system. In this way, the channel latency information is directly provided to relays by the 5G system, a protection relay does not need to carry out its own estimation. This could open new possibilities for the protection relay manufacturers to design new and possibly simpler time-alignment algorithms.\nOption 3:\nUsing the existing IEEE 1588 time master of the NG-RAN. In this case, the complexity could be the use of the IEEE 1588 power/utility profile (a.k.a. IEC 61850-9-3 [7]) instead of using the telecom profile.\n",

                            "text_content": "Energy infrastructure deployment occurs within a context where there is an expectation regarding service lifetime. The process of creating civic infrastructure requires significant oversight and consideration, and aims at long term solutions. This is true for all components of the energy system – generation, transport, distribution and customer premises components. The energy system is vast, so serviceability has to be considered so that the overall components require as little manual repair and maintenance as possible. Electrical infrastructure as a whole is meant to serve for multiple decades. Like physical civic infrastructure, utilities are mandated to target long term stable communication infrastructure that serve the public interest over an extended period of time. The service lifetime of diverse components are so long that newly deployed equipment must always consider interworking with legacy deployments.\nCommunication components of the energy system are no exception. Some communication services were deployed decades ago and continue operation (e.g. legacy teleprotection using copper wires as telecommunication.) In general, energy system communication services are defined at the application layer (e.g. by IEC). The role of the communication service is to carry these protocols with sufficient performance (throughput, reliability, maximum latency, jitter etc.) While it is possible to change communication infrastructure while maintaining the same services, this is done gradually. The communication infrastructure components are deployed with the intention that they will serve for an extended period of time – often decades, the same time scales as the energy system components expected lifetime. If more communication capacity is needed, this is added incrementally for new services, with attention paid to reduce change for existing components operation as much as possible.\nThe telecommunications system standardized by 3GPP supports backwards compatibility. There is a very strong commitment to support of legacy terminals. Cell phones from the mid-90s can still operate today. At the same time, the standard moves quite quickly (from an energy system perspective) with new 'generations' every decade – using different spectrum, radio protocols and networks. With 5G, service continuity and interworking with 2G and 3G has been discontinued, except for a few capabilities (e.g. 5G to 3G service continuity.) For energy infrastructure planning purposes, the 3GPP system needs to support long (e.g. 30-40 year) service lifetimes, in which terminals will be in continuous operation. The percentage of M2M-type operational services over 4G today is very low today, compared with the use of 2G and 3G.\nSome features have been developed in 3GPP to facilitate backwards compatibility at different layers of the system. For example Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) in 5G allows different 3GPP RATs to coexist in the same carrier. This can facilitate migration or preservation of legacy radio technology.\nThe 'deployment' use case below considers these aspects from the perspective of a utility system operator. Unlike many use cases, this takes place over years.\n",

Requirements for industrial automation and URLLC (e.g. in TS 22.104) are extremely high and appropriate for connectivity for Smart Energy. However, network incidents could happen and the scenario in use case below may mitigate the impact of such a failure to further increase the system reliability.\nIt is important to emphasize that this use case is not theoretical. There are many substations around the world that use 3GPP access for communication services in more or less ad hoc fashion (where management interfaces between the 3GPP system and the DSO are not standardized.) This use case focusses on how 5G can provide service to DSOs as well.\nA DSO has many, e.g. 100s to 10,000s of substations. These substations are managed from operation centers typically referred to as control centers.\nThe figure depicts a remote DSO management system for Smart Energy, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. It includes a central server, a network of distributed substations, and a communication network for remote monitoring and control. The system is designed to ensure seamless connectivity and efficient management of Smart Energy infrastructure.\nFigure 5.7.1-1: Remote DSO management of connectivity for Smart Energy\nWithin the substation there are many services (shown here remote metering, automation, MV supervision, LV supervision, etc.) In addition, there are power line communication links beyond, to customer premises equipment, that increasingly will spread the reach of IP services up to the smart meters. The thick red line represents the termination of communication outside the substation. For 3GPP telecommunication services supporting the DSO, the model of the interface between the switch and the network can be considered a 5GLAN service.\nThe actual topology between substations is more complex than shown, since there may be several communication services (back up links to provide greater reliability, etc.) For the purposes of this use case this is not considered further.\nThe traffic from the diverse services in the substation is aggregated before it leaves the switch and may be encrypted – the 5G system will not see the individual service flows. Of particular importance to the DSO is the interface exposed by the switch. Information about this from the mobile network that has proved very important in the past.\nPrevious generations of 3GPP systems, as deployed, did not effectively achieve high availability.\nThere are different alternatives to achieve high availability that a DSO might choose. This use case focuses on of the alternatives: closely monitoring actual performance. This is a way to enable DSOs to respond to possible future problems proactively. DSOs can troubleshoot more effectively. DSOs can continue service in the case of reductions in performance due to a number of factors. To identify these problems proactively, obtaining sufficient information about configuration and radio operation has been the key to identifying 'communication health' by the DSO, so as to identify patterns that result in poor performance and be able to react in a timely manner before communications performance declined to an inadequate level, e.g. by activating alternative access options to the 3GPP access whose performance shows signs of decline.\nIt is important to note that for the purpose of this use case, the UE that is considered is the devices that connects the substation network to the DSO's network, not any UE (e.g. a smart phone, or IoT device.) Nevertheless, it is seen by the 5G system as a UE.\nSpecific information that is required includes UE information, Connectivity status including QoS parameters, and session status information including user plane performance and fault information. Specific events should trigger a notification to the DSO from the MNO in a timely manner. Utilities (DSOs) can choose to rely on 3GPP technologies to enable telecommunications connectivity for mission critical services and sites. These technologies are used to connect endpoints (Substations) and a set of different Smart Grid traffic flows by means of a device with cellular WAN access.\n\nAs with any other type of telecommunications networks, the connectivity status and performance management information must be available.\nIn the event of an incident affecting the MNO's network, utilities need to be notified in a timely manner regarding the potential communication performance failure, so that a DSO can take proactive measures such as switching to an 'alternative' connection. This information could be predicted future events related to possible communication service degradation (derived from information exposed by an operator's network analytics), or it would be some additional information identified in close correlation with communication service degradation. The latter is the approach described further. This use case shows how an interface could deliver this information that could provide network management information to be accessible to utilities in a manageable way.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "A DSO \"U\" has a service contract with a MNO \"A\" and MNO \"B\" to provide telecommunication service to U's substations. (U has more than one service contract in order to increase the redundancy and to achieve greater coverage, as a means of achieving higher availability.\nThe requirements described in clause 5.7.6 below do not depend on there being 2 USIM contracts. There is no interaction or communication between the two MNOs (A and B) implied by this use case.\nU has shared parameters for delivery of information (e.g. monitoring and alarms) with A and B in advance from a standard set of them grouped in a SNMP MIB or any similar standard artefact offering the needed functionality, and established standard communication interfaces (e.g. APIs) that allow secure and highly available exchange of management data between U and A and B. The parameters and the communication interface must be standard for all MNOs and DSOs be able to receive a consistent service in the different world regions independently of the service provider.\nIn the following text IT management is discussed to motivate the management requirements and to explain the need. There is no intention however to require IT management at the process level be supported by 3GPP standards. Nor does this use case imply exposure or integration of IT management processes of the DSO or MNO.\nThe smart energy applications motivating this use case are distribution automation and distribution / substation automation applications involving supervision, control and data acquisition in order to recover from or avoid communication problems in substations. Though the availability requirements of these applications can be met by the 5G system, taken as an aggregate of several applications in a substation with critical importance to the energy system, the availability has to be extremely high. This is because the consequence of failure is severe – in terms of loss of business productivity and even risk of human life in a power outage. A DSO faces severe regulatory penalties in the event of outages that could be prevented.\nThe following IT processes are in place in U's network. Specific IT management objectives require timely and sufficiently detailed input. The processes that most concern this use case are Incident Management, Change Management and Service Configuration Management. These services are defined in [12]. The processes discussed in this section occur within the DSO network. Though there is no doubt a parallel set of processes within the MNO network, these are (aside from incident reporting and management data acquisition by the DSO network) out of scope. This may surprise the reader, but the reasons are the following.\n1)\tIt is the IT process requirements of the DSO that motivate the exposure of information by the MNO.\n2)\tThough the details of the IT processes of both DSO and MNO are not matters of standardization, the interface between the two must be considered. If the DSO needs to employ different management standards with each communications provider, this increases complexity and the lack of standards based management interfaces constitutes a significant drawback when considering whether to employ and integrate services over a particular communication system.\nIncident Management [13] is a process that can be triggered by a customer upon reporting an issue or raised automatically by an event monitoring system. Incident records correspond to the reported or raised event. It is vital to link incident management records to link them to Configuration Items (maintained in a database by means of the Configuration Management process [14].) A set of incidents may also motivate a Change, according to the Service Asset and Change Management Process [15].\nConfiguration Management is particularly important for the DSO, since they must track the total configuration of all essential systems, especially any change that occurs to components that could cause a system failure. Each item in the IT system is identified and has a controlled configuration that can be verified and audited. This allows other processes to be automated and the complete IT status to be taken into consideration in real-time, e.g. during an incident. If some components of the IT system are outside of the control of the DSO, the configuration of these must however remain constantly known. Any change to the configuration of these components requires notification to the DSO as it could possibly trigger an incompatibility with other configuration.\nChange Management provides a process with significant oversight (record keeping and authorization), ability to undo the change if required through the linked process of Release Management, and an evaluation of the consequences of the change. It is particularly important that it is unacceptable under the Change Management regime that changes occur without passing through the process. For example, if a UE were to change the terms of its contract and service, or its SIM card and its configurations without going through the Change Management process this would be considered an Incident, resulting in immediate actions by DSO, and possibly further interactions with MNO.\nThe delivery of relevant information would be part of the service level agreement between the DSO and MNO. The information required by the relevant interfaces are listed below at a high level. A further analysis of the details of these requirements and how to fulfil them is out of scope of stage 1 specification.\nIn a DSO network operation center for U' s distribution services, a technician \"Fred\" observes a number of substation local area networks, ready to detect and resolve any sign of trouble that arises. Supplementing the DSO's network management information, the MNO exposes management data to enable Fred to properly respond to failures in the DSO network.\nU uses a Dual SIM router which is configured to use MNO A as primary in normal conditions, failover mechanism to B is enabled so that standby connection can be triggered in the event of complete loss of connection or quality of connection below thresholds.\nUtility DSO U's NOC (Network Operating Center) will perform efficient and effective monitoring of Smart Grid assets connectivity and incident resolution if it can rely on trustworthy information coming from the following sources:\n-\tHealth Check platform to monitor availability of the connection\n-\tPerformance Check procedures to monitor that performance levels are above required thresholds\nNOTE 1:\tFailure of the Health Check or Performance Check will trigger the Incident Management process.\n-\tAccurate and updated Inventory to geographically locate the Cellular connection (USIM) at a specific Smart Grid asset (typically Substation)\n-\tReal time Access to MNO's SIM card Management and operation platforms (lifecycle control, i.e. whether the subscription is active, suspended, in ‘test’ mode, deactivated, etc. APN configuration,)\n- \tInformation provided by the MNO on a timely manner and related to radio access, for example RAT type and CellID.\nNOTE 2: \tThe timeliness requirements for monitoring depend upon the circumstances of the deployment. An example granularity for monitoring information is once per minute. This has proven sufficient in many deployments, but others with greater observed variation in performance could require greater granularity, e.g. every 30 seconds.\nNOTE 3:\tThe information provided for inventory, SIM platform configuration and cellular control plan operational parameters could be required for the Configuration Management process.\nThe usage of this data as a combined input to a single utility-owned \"Monitoring and Management\" (M&M) platform are instrumental for the DSO to make decisions and start actions that will impact the availability of the Smart Grid and, thus, the final service delivered to its customers. The utility DSO counts on a dashboard to represent the most relevant KPIs to the connectivity health status of the Substation switches and routers, to monitor the stability of the connection and the quality of the service delivered by the MNO.\nThe figure depicts a DSO-MNO management model, illustrating the interconnection of different entities such as DSO (Distribution Service Operator), MNO (Mobile Network Operator), and other stakeholders. The model outlines the roles and responsibilities of each entity, as well as the communication protocols and technologies used to facilitate the exchange of information. The figure provides a visual representation of the complex network of relationships and interactions within the telecommunications industry.\nFigure 5.7.2-1: A DSO-MNO Management Model\nThe elements in this model are explained below.\nThe KPI Dashboard in the figure above contains information regarding the\n-\tConnectivity status of the UEs and their status with respect to their service with the MNOs A and B. Inputs: volume of data consumption per substation and MNO A. Output: check whether expected traffic levels persist. If there is a massive failure to achieve KPIs, Fred (U) can switch to use the other MNO B. This permits detection of failure in a way that avoids massive incidents (part of the Incident Management process.)\n-\tStability of service of the UEs in terms of their mobile telecommunication service.\nNOTE 4: \tDetermination of which specific parameters should be exposed is out of scope of the present document.\nConfiguration is another aspect of stability. Any change to the service configuration (as agreed between U and MNOs A and B) needs to be reported. In addition, U needs to be able to request the configuration information. (This is an essential part of the Configuration Management process.)\n-\tPerformance determines if the mobile telecommunication network continues to perform as expected. U checks the performance by means of network tools, based on ping packets being sent (this increases traffic used over the connection with A and B.) This information is combined with AAA events (e.g. registration and deregistration with networks.) Output: Information on average performance indicators is obtained, including latency, packet loss rates, per technology. (This is an essential part of the Service Level Management process, not considered further in this use case.)\nNOTE 5: \tQoS performance that becomes acutely inadequate constitutes a service failure incident. This is dealt with in a separate use case.\nReport Generation\nReports from U are provided to A and B on a monthly basis. U expects a certain quality of service delivered by A and B. The achieved service levels are tracked and presented in the report. If A or B do not comply with the service level agreement, actions are specified in the SLA (and these are out of scope of this study.)\nA DSO might request the following to be included in the report:\n(1) \tNetwork performance (latency and packet loss above threshold),\n(2) \tNetwork stability (the connection remains stable over time), (3) Accumulated alarms arising due to the MNOs network (e.g. massive or isolated RAN issues.)\nNOTE 6:\tThe list above is an example only. The specifics of report generation of is out of scope of the present document.\nAlarms Panel\nAlarms can be triggered so that incident's responsible parties are informed in real time and the remediation actions and/or escalation processes can be initiated. Alarms are reported by U to A and B as part of the Incident Management process. Incidents may be of the following forms (this is not an exclusive list):\n- \tMassive incident where all UEs connectivity is affected whose SIM cards are provided by A or B.\nNOTE 7: \tAn incident reported by U to A or B could be caused (at least in part) by incidents in a single access point.\n",

At the same time at \"Alarms\" panel there is an incoming alarm informing of a Massive event. An automatic ticket is created to MNO A and the counter of massive events is updated to be reflected in the next SLA monthly report to track MNO A's quality of service.\n2)\tFred tries to remotely perform a firmware upgrade to the Substation Automation unit and, after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, notices that the firmware upgrade cannot be fully completed because the connection is unstable. Fred checks the Stability graph on \"KPI Dashboard\" for this particular Substation code and confirms that there is a recurring cell roaming of MNO A's SIM card during the last 12 hours. Fred accesses remotely to the cellular router that is providing cellular access to the substation Automation units and provokes a failover to MNO B. This turns out into a stable connection which enables a successful completion of firmware upgrade process. At the same time, he checks the \"Alarm panel\" and confirms that a notification has been sent to the MNO A because this bad behaviour has been happening for the last month.\n3)\tUtility U is embarked in the renewal of electric MV cables of a group of 10 Substations located in the proximity of \"Main Convention centre\". These Substations are using BPL (Broadband PLC over Medium Voltage) as the main backhaul connection with failover to cellular backhaul in case of main connection failure. Fred observes that the backup cell communication with MNO A for the 10 Substations is working, though runs unstably. Fred checks the \"Dashboard KPI\" Performance graph and confirms that the Substations' cellular connections have high latency and packet loss rate during day working hours for the last two weeks. At the same time, after checking Stability graph on \"KPI Dashboard\" Fred confirms that the USIM cards in the 10 Substations also present constant technology roaming from E-UTRAN service to UTRAN service. This issue has been affecting hourly smart meter readings. Fred remembers that there has been an Automobile Fair at the Convention centre in the last two weeks that might have affected the Radio resources available at the eNodeB. He checks the alarms and sees that there has been an alarm sent to MNO A to report on Service Quality degradation. This alarm triggers an auditing process lead by MNO's radio team in order to increase the capacity of 2 specific sectors of 1 eNodeB serving the Convention centre area. (This is an example of a performance based trigger for Change Management as part of the overall Service Level Management process between U and A.)\n4)\tWhile analysing MNO A's monthly SLA report, Fred observes that the average latency of all connected SIM cards has dramatically increased in the last two months from an average of 200 ms up to 630 ms. Furthermore, there has been an accumulated amount of 10 massive incidents in the last month. This information is instrumental to contact MNO A that was aware of the massive incidents but was not of the increase in latency. In order to solve it the MNO takes appropriate action.\n5)\tWhile monitoring the Performance graph on \"KPI Dashboard\", Fred observes high packet loss rate affecting all connected Substations through MNO B. This issue is starting to affect the smart meter reading rates. Fred promptly opens a ticket to MNO B (as part of the Incident Management process.)\nAlternatively, if B detects a problem in their network that will degrade service levels in U's network, B will use a standard mechanism to raise an alarm in U's network. This will alert Fred, who will note that there is already an open ticket related to the incident, as well as other data associated with the service degradation.\n6)\tMNOs A and B have recently informed DSO \"U\" about the imminent phase out of 3G services at national level. They inform about the process timeline which is planned to start in the next 6 months to be fully completed along one year starting in urban areas. Fred has been designated to coordinate the remediation activities that will avoid MNO's network operations to affect DSO U's Smart Grid operations. Fred checks \"KPI dashboard\" in \"M&M platform\" to do a first evaluation of the dimensions of the situation. The accumulated graph per technology and frequency band for each MNO shows that there are 20,000 substations currently connected by means of Cellular 3G. \"3G remediation\" project definition starts. (This is an example of the Change Management process informed by Configuration Management and performance data.)\n7)\t\"3G remediation\" project requires DSO \"U\" to undertake both field and administrative operations. Field operations will consist on replacing cellular devices and SIM cards of MNOs A and B all over 20,000 substations. Inventory information of SIM cards' location available on \"M&M\" platform allows to efficiently coordinate field operations. (Configuration Management is needed during Release Management process. The release management process is not discussed further in this use case.)\n8)\tAdministrative operations consist on provisioning 20,000 new generation technology SIM cards of both MNOs A and B. \"M&M\" platform will enable a single interface of operation which will make the task more efficient and straightforward than it was before when provisioning had to be performed by means of two separate MNO's Web Portals. This is possible thanks to the fact that SIM card parameters (APN, status, IP, Subscription group, etc.) for both MNO's A and B are standard, delivered through the same API definition. This allows an easy integration of all MNO information into a single operating platform. (This is an example of Configuration management processes making use of standard interfaces.)\n",

Figure 5.8.1-1 illustrates a work flow example of Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal.\n\nFigure 5.8.1-1: Example of Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal work flow\nWith the assistance of 5G system, it could report massive energy data separately to multiple energy application platforms according to their requirements. And data from energy application platforms could also be sent to terminal through 5G network, no matter it is business data or management data. Typical interactive data includes fault / alarming events, switch state variation, device abnormal changes, remote control operation, electrical analog data, meter reading data, topology relationship, decision-making information, edge computing conclusion, equipment OA&M data, remote upgrading, scheduled communication, etc. Some of this data is event triggered and requires a high priority for real-time communication while others may need a regular latency but broad bandwidth channel to fit their demands.\nThe energy application platform could be connection management platform (a.k.a.

When they are 5G connections, about 300 ~ 500 energy end equipment are connected to a Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal. The average application layer packet data rate for one kind of Smart Grid application between the Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal and energy end equipment is more than 2 Mbit/s in uplink e.g. smart metering, while the communication range is from 100m to 500m. In some cases, the data delivered to the Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal can be locally processed by the Terminal directly to improve working efficiency with the authorization of application platform. These energy applications and different data flows in one application require different communication services and different safety & isolation protection according to the Industry regulation.

There is no 'end-to-end' support in this scenario, unless a security association is established between the equipment and the service platform (by means outside of the scope of 3GPP, i.e. over the top.)\nSecond, the equipment could establish a security association with the 5G system (not just with the router.)\nTS 22.261 v17.3.0, clause 8.3:\nThe 5G system shall support a suitable framework (e.g. EAP) allowing alternative (e.g. to AKA) authentication methods with non-3GPP identities and credentials to be used for UE network access authentication in non-public networks.\nNOTE 2:\tNon-public networks can use 3GPP authentication methods, identities, and credentials for a UE to access network but are also allowed to utilize non-AKA based authentication methods such as provided by the EAP framework.\nIn this approach, assuming the EAP framework chosen afforded sufficient security protections for the non-public network, the communication from the equipment to the Router/UE and through the 5G System would be in the same security domain. A gap (described below in 5.10.6) is the communication between the 5G System and the EnergyCo service platform, which is currently not defined in the 5G standard.\nThird, the equipment in the EnergyCo network could be provided with sufficient credentials (including a USIM) to fully become authorized with the 5G System. In this case, end to end security is possible by means of the GAA framework.\nTS 33.220 v16.2.0, clause 4:\nThe 3GPP authentication infrastructure, including the 3GPP Authentication Centre (AuC), the USIM or the ISIM, and the 3GPP AKA protocol run between them, is a very valuable asset of 3GPP operators.

A key component of distribution intelligence is outage detection and response. Today, many utility companies rely on customer phone calls to know which areas of their distribution system are being affected by a power outage. Along with smart meters, distribution intelligence will help to quickly pinpoint the source of a power outage so that repair team can be immediately dispatched to the problem area. Most utility companies count on complex power distribution schemes and manual switching to keep power flowing to most of their customers, even when power lines are damaged and destroyed. However, this approach has its limitations, and in many cases an automated system could respond more quickly and could keep the power flowing to more customers. By having sensors that can indicate when parts of the distribution system have lost power, and by combining automated switching with an intelligent system that determines how best to respond to an outage, power can be rerouted to most customers in a matter of seconds, or perhaps even milliseconds.\nThe figure depicts a comprehensive overview of the Smart Energy landscape, showcasing various interconnected components such as smart meters, energy storage systems, and smart grid technologies. It highlights the integration of these systems to optimize energy consumption, reduce costs, and enhance overall efficiency. The figure also emphasizes the importance of data analytics and predictive maintenance to ensure the reliability and sustainability of the energy infrastructure.\nFigure 5.12.1-1: the big picture of Smart Energy\nThe automation in distribution with self-healing solutions is surely a critical challenge to consider in this transformational evolution towards Smart/Smarter Energy. Self-healing will enable system operators to benefit from a significant reduction in the outage duration and number of affected customers, which reacts quickly and precisely to power disturbances so that only those in the immediate neighbourhood are affected, while avoiding any interruption in power. Self-healing not only acts against grid disturbances, but secures the grid against disturbances spread. The basic requirements include [18]:\n-\tFast and proper detection of grid disturbances.\n-\tRedistribution of grid resources to avoid adversative impacts.\n-\tAssuring the continuity of service under any conditions.\n-\tMinimization of service restoration time.\nReliable and secure communications are essential to enable self-healing in the Smart Energy. A precise and effective decision is based on analysing the power grid data, hence collecting and exchanging information, transferring results, executing decisions, and monitoring real-time device states in the grid are the responsibility of the communication system. To support fast and precise detection of grid disturbances 5G system is expected to provide communication services with ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability and availability, as well as high data rate at both uplink and downlink.\nTwo approaches to detect grid disturbances are discussed:\n1)\tfeeder automation\n2)\tline current differential protection\n",

The system is designed to optimize energy consumption and ensure efficient distribution of power to various feeder locations.\nFigure 5.12.2.1-1: Distributed Feeder Automation\n\nThe controller devices have been mounted, connected, and configured during commissioning and deployment. The configuration is usually not done via the mobile network but via local wired connection.\nThe controller devices are connected to the 5G network, and the peer-to-peer communication is enabled using IEC 61850 GOOSE (OSI Layer 2, broadcast/subscription Ethernet-based protocol).\nCommunications are enabled via 5G network among the controller devices\n-\tamong controller devices serving the same feeder and\n-\tamong the controller devices of the whole area and the control centre.\nA feeder fault occurs. The controller device in the upstream of the fault point generates and transmits GOOSE signals to other controller devices serving the same feeder. Each controller device compares the GOOSE signals with the overcurrent signals of the current level, identifies the fault range, and then isolates the fault, implementing automatic power recovery in non-fault areas.\nTo prevent power disturbance, the overall feeder automation process must be completed within 100 ms. As discussed in [x3] with regards to the delay budget, the latency for one way transmission from one controller device to another needs to be kept at approximately 20 ms (this would allow for the necessary margin). To ensure precise fault detection and isolation, 10 μs or less time synchronization accuracy is also required.\nTypically there are 10s of controller devices per km2. The geographical dimension of feeders is usually up to several km2.\n5G communication runs and power distribution is restored in the affected area.\nThe use case \"Distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration\" has been captured in TS 22.104 Annex 2.4.4, while the corresponding performance requirements have been specified in table 5.2-1 \"Periodic deterministic communication service performance requirements\":\nTable 5.12.2.5-1: performance requirements applicable to this use case\n\nThe gaps identified include:\n-\t< 5ms end-to-end latency has been captured with no explanation in TS 22.104 (neither in TR 22.804);\n-\ttime synchronicity requirement is not addressed;\n-\tfault detection and isolation is typically event driven and aperiodic communication may be sufficient.\n[PR.5.12.2-001] The 5G system shall be able to provide a periodic deterministic communication with the service performance requirements reported in the tables below.\nTable 5.12.2.6-1: service performance requirements for Feeder automation\n\nTable 5.12.2.6-2: service performance requirements for Feeder automation continued\n\n",

The approach utilises the natural characteristics of differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection times, which has been described in detail in clause 5.4. This use case focuses on the traffic characteristics.\nProtection relays (e.g. relay_a and relay_b in Figure 5.4.1-1) are deployed and switched on in the distribution grid. All relays are connected to the 5G network and are synchronised with neighbouring relays in the distribution grid with a precision of <10 µs to ensure that the current values are sampled at the same time.\nThe protection relays exchanges the current samples via the 5G system. Each relay then compares the sent and received samples to determine if a fault has occurred in a protected area in order to isolate the fault. The detail of fault detection can be found in clause 5.4.\nThe sampling rate varies dependent on the algorithms designed by the manufacturers. A protection relay collects the current samples (with the typical message size of up to 245 bytes) at a frequency in the range of [600, 1200, 1600, 3000] Hz. The exchange of measurement samples is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner. [6] [20] With the sampling rate of 600 Hz (6 times per 10 ms), the transfer interval would be 1,667 ms with the required bandwidth of 1.18 Mbit/s; for 1200 Hz (12 times per 10 ms), the transfer interval would be 0,833 ms with the required bandwidth of 2.36 Mbit/s.\nAs to the latency, as pointed out in clause 5.4 the maximum allowed end-to-end delay between two protection relays would be between 5ms and 10ms depending on the voltage levels as specified in IEC 61850-90-1 [6]. For some legacy systems the latency usually is set to 15ms [20].\n5G communication runs and power distribution is restored in the affected area.\nThe use case \"Application of differential protection in distribution Network of Smart Grid\" has been captured in TR 22.804. However the use case and the associated service requirements are missing in TS 22.104.\nThe missing requirements based on differential protection in distribution network need to be captured.\n[PR.5.12.3-001] The 5G system shall be able to provide periodic deterministic communication with the service performance requirements reported in the tables below.\nTable 5.12.3.6-1: performance requirement for High speed current differential protection\n\nTable 5.12.3.6-2:\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Using phasors as a mathematical approach to describe a power system operation quantities is not new. With the advent of GNSS and other time sources that provide phasor measurement units (PMUs) with accurate timing signals, the concept of synchrophasor came into existence [21]. Modern PMUs and accompanying entities such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) [22] could connect to the time source and with each other in a number of different ways such as: using direct connection with GPS via an internal GPS receiver, using a connection via IRIG-B (legacy method) or IEEE Std 1588-2008 [23]/IEEE C37.238-2011[24] or PTP time synchronization profile in IEC 61850-9-3 [7] , over an Ethernet to achieve 1 μs time accuracy. This 1 μs time accuracy as referred to in these IEC standards assumes every PMU is has a built-in synchronization modem.\nAs a result, the phasors throughout a wide-area power system can be measured at different but strategically selected locations (such as at tie-lines and on the key network buses) in a synchronized fashion. This powerful possibility releases huge potential for power utility operators to innovate, so as to achieve various goals in safe, robust and efficient network operation and maintenance. Some interesting applications based on synchrophasors are: power system model validation, wide-area protection, advanced state estimation, frequency-control and oscillation mitigation, etc. With the fast adoption of DERs, the power system will undergo challenges of increased variability and unpredictability, which means the synchrophasors could offer utility operators an effective means to understand, respond and predict the real-time dynamics of the power systems.\nUp till now, wide-area measurement systems based on synchrophasors have been under expansion in large scale throughout America, Europe, and Asia. It is an area of opportunity for 5G systems to provide connectivity and services. Thanks for the wide-area coverage of 5G, it is seen by many utilities that 5G could play a major role in supporting PMU wide-area applications paradigm.\nSynchrophasors are measured and collected in a hierarchical structure to meet the power system needs. The figure below comes from [25]. But it is important to know that PDCs can have one to many interconnections with each other for the sake of e.g. redundancy. There could be many internal and external functions defined at each PDC, and PDCs could eventually interface with SCADA, EMS and DMS, where applicable. As defined in [25], a PMU and a PDC may transmit its data in one or more separate data streams. Each stream may have different content and may be sent at a different rate. The destination of each stream may be different device(s) and location(s) (multicast data is sent to multiple destinations). Each stream must then be individually controllable, and have its own identification and a separate configuration control. This feature is useful for sending data to different devices with different purposes, allowing streams with different wait times and class of service (M and P class), as specified in [22].\n\nThe figure depicts a data collection network for synchronous frequency synchronization (Synchrophasor) in a 5G network. It illustrates the network architecture, including the synchronization mechanism, the data collection points, and the communication paths. The network is designed to ensure accurate synchronization of frequencies, which is crucial for ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.13.1.1: Synchrophasor data collection network [X6]\nWithin the synchrophasor system, PMUs can be configured with various reporting rates [25]. In a 60Hz system, reporting rates could be {12, 15, 20, 3, 60} per second, and in a 50Hz system, the reporting rates could be {25, 50} per second. It is encouraged to adopt higher rates up to 120 per second. Table 1 shows the corresponding reporting period 1/Fs.\nTable 5.13.1-1: PMU reporting rate and the corresponding Reporting Period in IEEE Std C37.118™-2011 [25]\n\nWith regard to the data flows, each synchrophasor data flow could have an individual QoS – the performance aspects are addressed in [27]. In [28], the real-time communication between PMUs is addressed, and there two performance classes (P and M) are specified with the corresponding dynamic performance requirements. The P class is mainly for protection and control purposes, which requires fast response, minimum filtering and minimum delay. The M class is mainly used for measurements in the presence of out-of-band signals, which requires greater precision and significant filtering, and allows slower response and longer delay. Intuitively, the higher the PDC in the hierarchy (as in Figure 1), the more prone to class M an application deployed there seems to be.\n\nThe measurement reporting latency compliance specification defines the PMU real-time output reporting latency is dependent on the corresponding reporting rate Fs. For both performance classes, the measurement reporting latency is defined in Table 2 [25].\nTable 5.13.1-2: PMU measurement reporting latency\n\nThe communication end-to-end latency shall be the reporting latency subtracted from the reporting period. Therefore for different reporting rate, the communication latency is shown in Table 3.\nTable 5.13.1-3: max End-to-end communication latency (ms) at different PMU reporting rate\n\n",

The communication between PMU and its peers in wired networks is usually multicast in spontaneous mode [28] of operation. \nThus, while the use case is based on multicast in existing, wired networks, in this use case, we consider 5G technology to be capable of resembling the connectivity needs for the aforementioned spontaneous mode of PMU in a resource efficient way that might not always be multicast but could also be unicast.\nPMUs are configured to operate in spontaneous mode to provide the measurement data to PDCs. According to U's deployment choice, a PDC can make use of data from multiple PMUs and/or from other PDCs.\nIn the grid, some busses may have priority over others, therefore data produced by PMUs deployed at different busses can have different priority too.\nFor a PMU deployed at a given bus in the grid, different types of data are generated to feed different applications of divergent criticality (such as monitoring, control, protection, state estimation, etc.). Also, the same data can be needed by different destinations requiring different QoS treatment. Because of that, these different streams of data is needed by different destinations with different QoS. Additionally, the algorithms a TSO or DSO decides to use further influences the difference in criticality (QoS requirements in other words) of various streams of data this PMU generates.\nAt company U, the automation engineer Antoine is installing PMUs in U's distribution networks according to the PMU-based WAN application design. For each PMU, he configures the data types, calibration factors, and other meta-data for the data that the PMU will send. Antoine also configures the PMU to transmit multiple data streams, each with different content, rate, format, priority. Each data stream shall have its own IDCODE so that the data, configuration, header, and command messages can be appropriately identified. Each stream shall be independently operable including command execution and data, header, and configuration messages.\nPMUs transmits measurement according to the configured reporting period. Multiple data streams generated by the same PMU are transmitted by the 5G network with different QoS treatment as Antoine has configured on the PMU.\nPDCs received the synchrophasors, performs configured local processing functions, forwards data further down the hierarchy.\nAdvanced logics in the applications receive the synchrophasors as prescribed, the designed logics such as control, protection and measurement are carried out as expected.\n",

                            "text_content": "The use case concerns the use of surveillance cameras in sensitive locations and the implications on telecommunications where that serves as the means by which the surveillance media data is collected in a remote location.\nClosed-circuit video (CCTV) is the most bandwidth-intensive of all utility applications. The data rates depend on the required resolution of images, number of colors and frame rate. There are existing standards that reduce this data rate considerably while still providing excellent video quality. During incidents (such as security breaches, equipment malfunctions and power outages,) a higher resolution can be used.\nMany utility substations today use fiber optic cables to provide sufficient communications capacity to transport surveillance media data. This use case explores the use of 5G instead either as the sole means for transporting surveillance media data, or as a backup in case the primary means of transport (fiber) has been compromised. This could occur inadvertently if the fixed communication network suffers damage, or intentionally as part of a coordinated local attack that compromises substation security.\nWhile it is often necessary and prudent to transport surveillance media data continuously, there are approaches that reduce this need, e.g. triggers based on motion detectors, tampering (e.g. with cameras, locks, etc.), heat sensors, etc. In addition, video analytics can identify suspicious changes in a field of view within the secure permission, such as people present when they are unexpected, or people present at places within the secure perimeter for too long, etc. In this case, video could be stored locally and only transmitted on demand, or when triggered by an event. The design of a secure facility is beyond the scope of this use case. In any case, there are times in which transport of all surveillance data is needed – so the capacity model is based on this situation. This capacity may only be needed intermittently, for the reasons given above, or it may be required constantly.\nSome regulations however, e.g. NERC CIP in North America, require continuous live video transport from cameras monitoring the substation's Electronic Security Perimeter.\nFurther, given the use of fiber optic cables, the networks are vastly over-provisioned. For this reason, even where regulation does not require constant video media transport for perimeter security, there is a tendency to transport all surveillance media, at all times.\nThe most common video codecs used are MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and more recently, the Motion-Joint Photographic Expert Group (M-JPEG). The frame rate commonly used is 25-30 video frames per second. The resolutions often used, per the Common Interchange Format (CIF), are QCIF (176x120), CIF (352x240), 2CIF (704x240), and 4CIF (704x480). [16] This reference is 7 years out of date, though, and the current rate used by some energy utilities is now HDTV (1280x720) resolution.\nFor the purposes of this use case HDTV with continual media transport will be considered as the service requirement, as this is most realistic looking forward in time. 1280x720 * 8 bit resolution * 30 frames per second = 2.4 (10)7 bits per second (uncompressed.) For H.264 compression (MPEG-4), this can be transported with 3 Mbit/s.\n",

                            "text_content": "Distributed energy resources (DER) become more and more important because of its close proximity to the user side and the convenience of complementary energy forms. The potentially large number of DERs have a direct impact on the operation and power trading of the power system, affecting the security, stability and operation efficiency of the system. The concept of microgrid was introduced to aggregate and optimise DER thus reduce the negative impact on power grids. As defined in [31], a microgrid is a self-sufficient energy system that serves a discrete geographic footprint, such as a university campus, a hospital complex, a business centre, or a residential area. Within microgrids there are one or more kinds of distributed energy (solar panels, wind turbines, combined heat & power, generators) that produce its power. In addition, many newer microgrids contain energy storage, typically from batteries. Some also now have electric vehicle charging stations.\nThe integration of DERs into the energy system cause many challenges into the communication field. The operational conditions of a microgrid may vary rapidly due to DER contribution with low inertia of nonrotating elements and rapid changes in weather conditions (wind and solar radiation) [32]. To incorporate more renewable and alternative energy sources, the communication infrastructure must have the ability to easily handle an increasing amount of data traffic or service requests and must provide a real‐time monitoring and control operation of all these nodes. A reliable communication between the system elements is crucial. In fact, any type of communication dependent electrical protection scheme requires robustness, a virtually full-time availability, and strictly bounded latency.\nThe figure depicts a 15-bit, 1-1-1 communication stack used in IEC 61850, which is a standard for industrial communication networks. The stack includes various components such as the communication protocol, signaling, and error detection and correction. The figure illustrates the structure and components of the communication stack, providing a clear understanding of its components and their roles in the communication process.\nFigure 5.15.1-1: IEC 61850 communication stack\nWhen it comes to communications architecture, IEC61850 is a widely accepted standard for automation and equipment of power utilities and DER, specifically for defining protocols for IEDs (Intelligent electronic devices) at electrical substations. IEC 61850 standard specifies the timing constraints for messages typically used in substations (table 5.15.1-1). GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) and SV (Sampled Values) messages are assumed as time critical messages, having the tightest deadlines (maximum allowed transfer time) among all IEC 61850 messages, corresponding to 3 ms. While GOOSE is typically used to transfer information closely related to monitoring and control functions (circuit breaker status etc.), SV is used to transfer numerical samples of current and voltage signals. The SV protocol works on a periodic information transmission model, regularly sending messages at a fixed rate. For protection purposes, the default rate is 4000 or 4800 messages per second for, respectively, 50 or 60 Hz power systems. On the other hand, the GOOSE protocol operates in a sporadic information transmission model, where a continuous flow of data is maintained to increase communication reliability. The typical sizes of GOOSE and SV messages are, respectively, 160 and 140 bytes. GOOSE messages are transmitted at two different modes: 1) Safe operation: 1 message / second (with the bitrate of 1.28 kbit/s); 2) Emergency operation: 32 message / second (with the bitrate of 40.96 kbit/s). SV messages are transmitted at much high rate 4800 message / second (with the bitrate of 5.376 Mbit/s).\nTable 5.15.1-1: Time constraints for IEC 61850 messages [33]\n\nIn addition, the increasing number of renewable energy sources and micro-generators as well as the integration of a large amount of DER units in the microgrid has an impact on the scalability and the stability of the communication system. A certain level of redundancy is required in the system, e.g., backup channels, software components and devices, etc. Critical functionalities in a smart microgrid demand high reliability (99.999%) and stringent availability requirement (99.9999%).\nThe integration of networking and communication technologies in microgrids may cause vulnerabilities of cyber-attacks. In addition, due to the increasing number of distributed energy resources in the grid, the attack targets are also rising, producing more access points to disrupt the grid. Thus, a microgrid needs to be robust against security attacks. Table 5.15.1-2 summarizes the [34].\nTable 5.15.1-2: general security requirements for different communication services [34]\n",

                            "text_content": "Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and microgrid are typical ways to use renewables (e.g. wind, photovoltaic parks, etc.). They are fundamental elements of energy transition that form the pathway toward the global energy transformation to combat the global warming and the climate change. Take European Union as an example, the policy frameworks of EU 2020 Climate & Energy Package (COM/2010/0639), EU 2030 Climate & Energy Framework (COM/2014) and EU 2050 Climate-Neutral Economy (COM/2011/0885) have duly produced EU Climate Laws, EU Emission Trading Systems (ETS) and union strategy to stimulate the transformation. European member states interact with the European Commission to set up integrated National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs). In many European countries, ENTSO-E grid code (RfG, DCC, HVDC) compliance guidelines for electricity transition framework are applied by energy and utility players with diverse focuses on the energy markets, system operation, and electricity connections.\nWorldwide, for similar reasons, the renewable market is flourishing, as government and private sectors willingly encourage its adoption. With more DERs and microgrids maturing to participate in utility grid, their impact on the distribution networks need to be properly addressed. This contribution discusses the interconnection between renewables and the utility distribution network, and proposes the corresponding communication service requirements for protection mechanisms specifically.\nShown in Figure 5.16.1-1 is the ecosystem with existing DSOs and potential new stakeholders such as DER owners, DER operators, and/or DER aggregators. The focus of this paper is the interface for energy transport shown in red dashed lines. This interface includes both power interface (green line) and communication interface (blue line).\nThe figure depicts a 16x1 grid with 1x1 cells, representing a new ecosystem and the positioning of interfaces. The grid is divided into two main areas: the North East (NE) and the South East (SE). The NE area is highlighted with a red color, while the SE area is depicted with a green color. The figure also includes a dotted line connecting the two areas, indicating the connectivity between the two areas. The figure is labeled with the figure name \"Figure 5.16.1-1\" and the figure number \"16.1-1\".\nFigure 5.16.1-1: New ecosystem and the positioning of interfaces\nThe \"interface energy transport\" shown in Figure 5.16.1-1 could be embodied with a single Point of Common Coupling (PCC) illustrated in in Figure 5.16.1-2, where the power grid could be a medium voltage (MV) substation, and the microgrid could be controlled by its own micro-Energy Management System (µEMS). µEMS communicates with the Distribution Management System (DMS) of a DSO. It is worth mentioning that when the microgrid in Figure 5.16.1-2 is replaced with a single DER, the interconnection with the utility power grid can be more precisely called the Point of Connection (PoC).\nThe figure depicts a microgrid controlled by its own energy management system (EMS), which is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources with defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity and is able to operate in both grid-connected and islanded mode. The microgrid is designed to operate in both grid-connected and islanded mode, allowing for efficient energy management and grid integration.\nFigure 5.16.1-2: Microgrid controlled by its own EMS (Source: DNV GL). A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources with defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity and is able to operate in both grid-connected and islanded mode [44]\nFrom the electrical system's safety and operation resiliency point of view, renewables are not just plugged in to feed the utility grid energy. Because of renewable generation's unpredictability (generation with increased variability), connecting DER or microgrid into the public distribution network need to fulfil a number of standards and requirements – to consider the fluctuating capacity flowing into the grid, more bidirectional flows at distribution level, issues like generator synchronization, and operation threshold conditions for voltage and frequency (i.e. under-/over-voltage, under-/over-frequency). Aside from possibly being used for power flow management (e.g. downward dispatch/curtailment trigger, etc.), PCC is also a control reference point for two power systems to interact, including the control of voltage magnitude and frequency regulation, injection and absorption of reactive power by DER, etc. Based on abnormal operation conditions, many regional and international standards have produced guidelines for measurements and specified conditions for triggering protection [42] at the PCC interconnection. In this paper, the focus is on voltage and frequency protection. Tripping in this context is the action to clear abnormal conditions within a specific duration of time. Table 5.16.1-1 lists the required trip time values for different types of possible trips at PCC, based on a number of regional and international standards.\nTable 5.16.1-1 Tripping time under certain abnormal conditions (s). The interconnection protection requirements vary among standards\n\nIt does not take much effort to notice that here the tripping time values for DERs are much more relaxed than those for a regular MV/HV substation. That is because for the PCC interconnect, protection functions are required to coordinate with other functions such as frequency ride-through and even ROCOF ride-through, meaning DERs are required to stay \"on\" for much longer. Furthermore, two thresholds are introduced for DER tripping to prevent it from happening prematurely, which would compromise the stability of the bulk power system.\nThere are many available algorithms available for an IED to detect abnormal conditions and to further determine whether the tripping conditions are met. More algorithms are based on continuous measurements and comparison of local and remote measurement provided by PMUs. With renewables and DERs proliferating in the distribution networks, decisions on PCCs would need real-time measurements from multiple strategically chosen measurement points in the network.\nPurely based on the values in Table 5.16.1-1, it could be true that a PV-owner might opt for CS104 (or even OPC-DA, Profinet) that is simpler and cheaper to deploy. But these protocols are less flexible to support PMU multicast mode. That is where IEC 61850 adds value to the WAN protection mechanisms. In this case, multicast PMU data could be transferred via routable sampled values (R-SV) profile (IEC 61850-90-5). Similarly, the tripping command could be sent out by routable GOOSE (R-GOOSE) profile, or even as normal GOOSE provided the IED with protection functions and the circuit breaker for PCC are in the same LAN. When PMU data is multicast using R-SV profile, the transport should support source-specific advanced route path determination. This mechanism helps to mitigate the DDOS attacks known to multicast group addresses.\n",

                            "text_content": "Company U operates a large national grid. Thanks to U's existing IP/MPLS infrastructure, PMUs deployed in substations belonging to transmission grid are connected to this IP/MPLS network. The number of PMUs can range from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Each individual PMU continually streams measurement data to a number of PDCs located in control centers at different levels for monitoring and analysis performed by different teams (or analysis by IEDs – Intelligence Electronic Devices with e.g. protection functions). The network engineer Arjen configures in each IP/MPLS router, so that a dedicated VPN is used for transmitting R-SV (routed-Sampled Values) datagrams (Sampled Values can be generated by MU-Merging Unit, but here PMUs are able to generate Sampled Values too). Then, Arjen assigns IP addresses to PMUs from the IP/MPLS network. Due to the high number of PMUs, Arjen configures the IP/MPLS network to efficiently transfer the PMU data to destination PDCs. In the meantime, to improve security, Arjen uses the source specific multicast (SSM) feature to ensure the IP/MPLS network only forwards datagrams to receiving PDCs from only the source PMUs to which the receiving PDCs have explicitly joined. The multicast trees are static once the PMU application is up and running. Worth mentioning is that for each PMU, its corresponding multicast tree is built based on the WAN Smart Grid protection application logics. In other words, the multicast tree reflects where in the Smart Grid the R-SV measurement data from a particular PMU is needed.\nWith the renewables booming, the distribution grid of company U is connected to an increasing amount of PV parks and wind parks. At and around the interconnections, gradually more new PMUs are deployed. It is impractical to extend the IP/MPLS network physically to all these locations. Therefore, company U decides to make use of the 5G service from an operator KTT.\nNow, for U's DERs and microgrids, Arjen again refers to the WAN Smart Grid protection application logics to configure the newly installed PMUs. The purpose is that these PMUs will virtually take part in the existing multicast trees in U's IP/MPLS network. Thanks to KTT's 5G_LAN service, these PMUs and control centre IP gateways are added to the VPN that Arjen previously configured in the IP/MPLS network. See as the extension of U's IP/MPLS network footprint, 5G delivers the PMUs' datagrams conforming the source-specific multicast a priori.\nAs a result, 5G network provides communication among the PMUs with PDCs in the control centres. A PMU produces a single source of R-SV measurements, and the 5G network delivers the measurements efficiently to the intended group of recipients.\nSuddenly an outage of a distributed generator at a given site causes generation load imbalance (site 1). Similar conditions happen to another distributed generators connected nearby (site 2).\nPMUs measure synchrophasors, frequency and ROCOF associated with the fundamental/primary components at various interconnections with DERs.\nPMUs multicast measurement data to the subscribers, which could be other PMUs and the WAMPAC.\nAt abnormal site 1, based on the PMU's locally measured ROCOF, the protection function decides the problem to be a weak load imbalance. So the protection will not be triggered since the frequency is supposed to restore after some time. At other abnormal sites 2, similar decisions are made by the local protection functions.\nHowever, the WAMPAC receives measurement from all of these PMUs. Based on its global view, it detects that area with prevalence of under frequency conditions spread among a number of DERs could potentially cause severe impact on the overall distribution grid. The WAMPAC decides to trip the generators in some of these problematic sites (treating the under voltage condition as severe imbalance), so as to prevent system collapse.\n",

                            "text_content": "It is important to understand that this use case is widely present in the DSO networks in many regions across the world. This use case resembles the realistic situation in which a utility M2M system interacts with an MNO for consuming cellular technologies. This use case focuses on how 5G can provide improved management related services offered to DSOs, in the realistic real-life context. To bring context to this paper, the use case of AMI is used.\nM2M has existed in DSO networks for a long time. Started with the support by legacy GPRS, CDMA, UMTS and later LTE, smart metering and AMI systems have enjoyed rapid deployment by a DSO to reach their operation and business targets. Not only for metering systems, but also a large number of DSOs have brought cellular connectivity to substations that are remotely located and have relatively less sophisticated Smart Grid applications running. For the sake of clear and comprehensive explanation, the architecture with TCP-UDP/IP communication profile from the DLMS/COSEM UA [46] international standard is referred to, so as to elaborate the topic of the hour in truthful context.\nThe concept is well-known, a device with a cellar module connects to the target server(s) via cellular connectivity. Figure 5.17.1-1 shows how the utility-adopted DLMS/COSEM standard utilizes this concept.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a 17.1-1 TCP-UDP/IP profile based utility M2M system, illustrating a client reporting to two different head-end servers in a data centre. The figure shows the network topology, including the client, two head-end servers, and the data centre. The system uses TCP-UDP/IP for communication, with a 17.1-1 TCP-UDP/IP profile. The figure is used to demonstrate the functionality of the system, which is designed to provide a reliable and efficient M2M communication solution.\nFigure 5.17.1-1: TCP-UDP/IP profile based utility M2M system illustrating a client reporting to two different head-end servers in the DSO's data centre [50].\nSince the cellular connectivity is provided by an MNO, usually the DSO need to setup a dedicated VPN connection between its own RADIUS server and the MNO's RADIUS (as a proxy) to ensure the DSO's own RADIUS server will be responsible for the E2E authentication of the meters or the Smart Grid terminal devices. Figure 5.17.1-2 illustrates a typical situation, where a DSO called EDL has two separate subscriptions with two mobile operators for the many M2M devices they need to connect. The DSO manages its own RADIUS servers (RADIUS A and RADIUS B) in its own IT domain (e.g. own data centre or in a hosting environment), each RADIUS server has a secure tunnel to the peer RADIUS proxy in the corresponding MNO network (here namely the Operator A RADIUS and the Operator B RADIUS). The mechanism of a DSO's M2M system and the related RADIUS interaction is illustrated in Figure 5.17.1-3.\nFor the target M2M applications based on the TCP-UDP/IP profile in DLMS/COSEM [47], and the actual existing M2M management platform widely adopted in DSO's utility M2M infrastructure, it is very important for the DSO to expect successful data connection fulfilling the application's communication needs, as agreed in the SLA. In reality, even the most recently known metering applications in the European Union is the 15-minutes reading cycle [48]. That means, the successful meter reading as required by legislation is changing from once a month, to recently once a day and in the future once every 15 minutes. For a DSO's M2M head-end server, Smart Grid sector specifications have standardized wake-up mechanisms for the head-end server to contact the end devices for data retrieval, so that the data can be fetched within the service window determined by a specific business process. Realistically speaking, if the data must be available every 15 minutes, then the M2M service administrator has sufficient time (roughly a 15-minute window in this case) to trigger this wake-up process multiple times for retrieving the data. Another well-used resort has been that the DSO uses APIs of the MNO's SIM management platform to \"reanimate\" the device back to the mobile network connectivity by means of mechanisms such as reattach and re-registration.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a network architecture with a focus on the management platform of a mobile service (MSM) service. The figure includes two subscriptions to two mobile operators, with one subscription to a DSO (Digital Subscriber Operating Company) and the other to a mobile operator. The DSO EDL platform is managed by the management platform, which is responsible for managing the MSM service. The figure also includes a management platform's subscription to a mobile operator, which is used for the provision of mobile services.\nFigure 5.17.1-2: DSO EDL's management platform of MSM service. EDL has two subscriptions to two mobile operators.\nFrom the experience of some DSOs, it has happened that some M2M systems relying on 2G/3G connectivity did lose contact with the head-end server(s) for hours or even for days, and sometimes a wake-up push message manually sent from the head-end might also fail in getting the M2M device back online (w.r.t connectivity). Apparently, the most and foremost target of 5G is to focus on how to provide more reliable connectivity to the M2M devices, through enhancement of technology evolution, and introduce adequate quality assurance mechanisms to add to warranty. In respect of this, the 5G technology already introduces ground-breaking improvement in connectivity KPIs including reliability.\nEqually important, as the industry-wide wake-up procedure goes, a service maintenance personnel of a DSO might look into their RADIUS server to check the session establishment status. This process has been in existence, ever since legacy cellular technologies were used. But this manual process has been labour-intensive and at times impractical for utility the personnel, who in general do not always have sufficient mobile telecom expertise to analyse the RADIUS call flows. Therefore, it makes sense for a 5G operator to inform the DSO in easy-to-comprehend terms of the following information on a per-M2M-device basis:\nRADIUS session setup information\nDevice session status information\nDevice session setup success rate\nExposing these information during M2M service trouble-shooting can effectively improve the DSO's incident management process.\nCertainly the M2M systems and applications will continue to proliferate in utility network. The reliance on 5G technology encourages the telecom providers to provide more relevant performance and events data to the DSOs. The genuine pursuit of a DSO is that by means of effective reporting the DSO obtains timely information and advice on maintaining resilient operation of their utility grid and services. This basically includes the following:\n5G should introduce to an MNO means to keeping track of the offered connectivity's status, and to abiding by the factually contracted service KPIs (incl. availability) in the SLA;\n5G should enable notifying a DSO in time the events related to MNO-planned maintenance (e.g. time period and impacted cell sites), for the DSO to timely adjust its service operation;\n5G should enable reporting to a DSO the forecasted performance degradation over a specific geographic area (e.g. a cell sector, a cell or a group of cells).\nThe figure depicts a typical utility M2M management mechanism, illustrating the various components and their roles in managing M2M devices. The diagram includes a central hub, which serves as the primary interface for managing M2M devices. This hub is connected to various M2M devices through a network of cables, which are labeled with the device's unique identifier. The diagram also shows the various M2M devices, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, which are connected to the hub. The central hub is equipped with a range of features, including a web-based interface for device management, a mobile app for remote device control, and a command center for centralized management. The diagram highlights the importance of this management mechanism in ensuring the efficient and secure operation of M2M systems in the utility industry.\nFigure 5.17.1-3: Illustration of a typical utility M2M management mechanism [50], implemented ubiquitously in currently available commercial M2M systems for utility operators.\n",

This is normally the case, and Pieter-Jansen could spend time learning UT's business processes related to this M2M service.\n2) One morning while Pieter-Jansen arrives at work, eager as he always is he logs in the service manager portal to take a quick glance of the M2M service status collected last night. Frowning, Pieter-Jansen notices the GUI of the head-end system alerts missing data from a particular M2M device --- data missing for several continuous service cycles (e.g. 120 data points missing in the past 8 hour). Pieter-Jansen has the admin login credential to UT's RADIUS server, however, Pieter-Jansen is not specialized in telecom and has not gained experience in the corresponding IEEE protocols. His supervisor, one of the very few personnel at UT who understands both electricity and telecom was unfortunately under the weather and had called in sick. Pieter-Jansen therefore switches to the GUI that visualizes RADIUS session status in the historian with the data received from TEL's RADIUS servers.

As the DSO and MNO have a standard channel for communication of energy outage incidents, they are both able to plan and execute recovery effectively.\nThe DSO can provide locality, communication requirements and estimated time of repair of an issue in DSO's Distribution network. The MNO can use this information, especially the recovery schedule, the location and the communication requirements, to enable remote access to the Smart Grid asset that will solve the issue.\nFor example, in the event of a service interruption or outage affecting a 5G node with a limited power autonomy, the Node has access to information coming from the Network so that it is able to detect the root cause of the problem and react accordingly. The Node is able to efficiently manage the resources and prioritize granting access to U's traffic. All the rest of processes that are not strictly necessary to the final aim of serving U's need of cellular resources become dormant.\nMNO will inform DSO of the Power autonomy and location of the Node serving the Smart Grid asset that needs to be accessed for remote operations. The DSO will react accordingly, adjusting the operations taking into account the MNO communication constraints.\nThus, both parties will react accordingly, adjusting their processes to facilitate the resolution of the issue. U is able to successfully restore the issue affecting the line remotely so that the Node recovers the power supply after a short period of time. Once Power supply is back to normal, 5G node can resume its normal processes.\nEnergy system comes back online, taking into consideration the timing and UPS resource constraints of both MNO and DSO, as well as the locality of the incident. This is a marked improvement of the current system in which for availability considerations DSOs cannot rely upon mobile telecommunications for recovery with building a redundant infrastructure. This reduces the applicability of mobile telecommunications infrastructure to support energy utility communication.\nAnother alternative, shown in Service Flow 2, is that the MNO provisions their UPS resources sufficiently to suffer loss of service in the event of an energy system outage for a sufficiently long period of time to enable the DSO to restore service. The provisioning of the UPS can be informed by the outcome of past energy outage incidents, as well as historical information exchanged as per Service Flow 1, alternative 1 and 2 – as lessons learned.\n",

There is also a raising interest to have other clock synchronization sources in addition to GNSS.\nIEC 61850-9-2 standard [49] specifies the protocol for transmitting measurement information in a power system using Ethernet. Standard also recommends the use of PTP (Precision Time Protocol) for clock synchronization and IEC 61850-9-3 standard [7] shall be followed whenever PTP is used. PTP accuracy is affected by network structure and devices in the network. Since different types of clock devices produce different time errors and jitters, overall time inaccuracy must be verified to make sure that application time accuracy requirements are fulfilled. Requirements in IEC 61850-9-3 [7] aim at achieving a network time inaccuracy better than 1μs after crossing 15 transparent clocks or 3 boundary clocks. PTP profile for power utility automation defines the inaccuracy as follows:\nTable 5.19.1-1. Allowed inaccuracy defined by IEC 61850-9-3 [7]\n\nGrandmaster clocks in substations today use a GNSS receiver to achieve accurate clock synchronization with holdover time even up to 24h (corresponding to <1μs accuracy). However, since the time source (GNSS) may become unavailable due to failure (e.g. broken antenna, satellite availability or interference), 5G is a candidate resiliency solution (see [51] clause 5.2). In order to reach the same level of measurement accuracy, 5G capable grandmaster clock should fulfil the requirement of maximum 250ns inaccuracy when its timing reference is used in the same location as of the Grandmaster clock that is used to synchronize the Smart Grid devices over Ethernet.\nSynchronization requirements are related to various aspects. In particular, IEC/IEEE 60255-118-1:2018 [50] defines a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) that must maintain less than a 1% total vector error (TVE). Such error includes time, phasor angle, and phasor magnitude estimation errors. Standard also recommends that a time source that reliably provides time, should be at least 10 times better than values corresponding to 1 % TVE. Therefore IEC 61850-9-3 [7] should be followed whenever substation has PMUs either as standalone devices or PMU capable protection relays.\nBy using PTP within a substation the system can have multiple grandmaster capable clocks which, in case of failure of the current grandmaster, can be used to maintain accurate time between devices and processing sampled values. However, when sampled values are processed outside the substation, time inaccuracy limits defined by IEC 61850-9-3 [7] must be followed since the devices are not connected to the same grandmaster clock and therefore measurement timestamps may have too much inaccuracy. Application outside substation may be but not limited to Wide Area Protection.\n",

Given this set of inputs, the SE service processes the received data to provide the most likely operating state of the network at the considered instant of time (the same time at which the measurements are collected). Finally, the results of the SE service are sent to the control centre (or whatever data concentrator) to give situational awareness to the DSO and, if needed, are made available for other control functions requiring this information. SE results are usually also stored in a database for possible a posteriori analysis.\nFor its operation, the SE service thus needs as input some important information of the grid characteristics, the deployed measurement infrastructure, as well as the real-time measurement data collected from the measurement units in the field. In addition, if the electric grid is reconfigurable (i.e. topology changes can be applied), the status of the switches and breakers should be also provided in input to the SE tool to make sure that the service is always considering the correct topology of the grid.\nBeyond the grid data, which can be determined by the DSOs with a different degree of accuracy as the information of low voltage grids may be incomplete and inaccurate, the key point for enabling the SE service is the availability of measurement devices with real-time communication capabilities. Different from the transmission system, where a large coverage of devices is often available, the instrumentation penetration at the distribution level is usually poor with only few devices installed in specific points, like primary substations (high/medium voltage substations). As a matter of fact, the main power system requirement to enable the grid monitoring via SE is thus the deployment of devices providing the needed measurement data. Due to the large size of the distribution grids and obvious economic constraints, guaranteeing a full observability of the grid is mostly impractical and hardly achievable. The SE solution duly takes into account this aspect and aims at enabling the SE service using only few low-cost measurement devices deployed at strategic points of the grid (chosen by means of ad hoc meter placement strategies). Moreover, the conceived SE solutions are designed to maximize the accuracy performance even in presence of few measurement units in the field. However, it is worth noting that the accuracy of the estimation results strongly depends on the number of available measurements.\nNeeded components in the field: sensors and meters.\nInformation about the electrical grid: topology of the network; grid parameters (line impedance, transformer data, etc.); nominal power of connected loads and generators; location of the meters.\nType of measurements: voltage (both magnitude and phase angle), current (both magnitude and phase angle), active and reactive power are the measurements that can be used for SE purposes (it is not mandatory to have all the types of measurements reported).\nMeasurements number: the higher the number, the better the results.\nMeasurement accuracy: the higher the better; information on the uncertainty characteristics of both sensors and measurement units has to be known.\nMeasurement synchronization: highly recommended.\nAdditional data needed from the field: notification of switching events leading to a change in the network topology.\nReal-time communication capability: yes, required.\nBi-directional communication: not required; the communication flow is mono-directional from the meters to the control centre.\nUse of edge cloud. The concept of SE is based on a distributed architecture where both low voltage and medium voltage grids are divided in multiple, smaller areas. This is a solution to reduce the computational cost and execution time of the SE service, as the SE analyses for all areas may operate in parallel. One benefit of this solution is guaranteed scalability of the proposed architecture for SE. Given this framework, it is highly feasible that each local SE runs on a dedicated edge cloud.\n",

This is obtained through the smart control of the active and reactive power injected (or consumed) by converter-based components connected to the grid, such as Distributed Generation (e.g. photovoltaic plants, wind turbines) and energy storage units. For the management of the Distributed Generation based on renewable energy sources, an additional objective is to maximize the use of green energy while respecting the operational constraints of the electric grid, thus minimizing as much as possible the power curtailment of renewable generation. The use of smart power control service in the power grid with high penetration of renewable energy sources is expected to significantly improve the efficient operation of the grid, the power quality, and the grid reliability.

Different goals can be pursued to enhance the operation of the distribution grid, such as: the reduction of power losses during the operation with normal conditions; the minimization of voltage unbalance in case of high differences in the status of the three phases of the system; the minimization of possible active power generation curtailments during circumstances with over-voltage issues in the grid. The output of the PC service is a list of set points of active and reactive power (PQ set points) for the converter-based components connected to the grid. Consequently, the service needs bi-directional communication with the field to ensure proper delivery of the generated control commands.\nThe design of the PC service is coupled with the State Estimation service. According to this idea, the PC service takes as input the results of the State Estimation service, namely the voltage profile at the different buses and the information about the branch power flows and the power consumption (or injection) at the nodes. Together with this information, the service needs as input also the model of the electric grid, expressed in terms of network topology and line characteristics. More specifically, the list of inputs needed to enable the PC service includes the following data.\nStatic grid data:\nElectric grid topology (information about the nodes and the connection among the different nodes in the grid).\nElectric component parameters (e.g. impedances of the lines, impedances of transformers, etc.).\nReal-time data:\nEstimation of the bus voltages, power flows in the branches, power consumption or injection at the nodes (as provided by the State Estimation service).\nReal-time notification of a change in a switch or breaker status.\nThe output of the PC service is the pair of active and reactive power set points for each converter-based component in the grid. The output of the power control service has to be sent to the converters in the field through communication technologies available in the field for control commands. Results can also be sent to the control room of the Distribution System Operator (DSO) for monitoring and can be stored in the database for possible a posteriori analysis.\nSince the PC service relies on the results of the State Estimation service, some of the power system requirements for this service are in common with the State Estimation service. First, measurement devices with real-time communication capabilities are needed to guarantee meaningful monitoring of the electric grid. The accuracy of the estimated results provided by the State Estimation service can also affect the performance of the PC service. Similar to the case of the State Estimation service, a critical challenge for the application of PC at distribution level is the large size of the distribution grids. This calls for the design of distributed approaches where PC services act on small areas, possibly sharing some data with an upper level controller to ensure the coordination of the power control strategy in the whole grid.\nDue to the active nature of this service, a bi-directional communication is needed with the field. Data are collected from the grid to enable the State Estimation service, while the output of the PC service is sent to the converter-based components for the control of their power generation (or consumption). This also implies the need to have converters able to communicate remotely, both for sending measurement data (if available) and for receiving the actuation commands. While converters available today do not always guarantee this behaviour, this requirement can be considered as realistic in future scenarios where the availability of communication capabilities is essential to enable the Smart Grid.\nThe PC service runs continuously and synchronously with the State Estimation service. In particular, a new iteration of the service is triggered by the collection of a new set of estimation results provide by the State Estimation service. Similar to the case of State Estimation service, there are not strict requirements on the reporting rate for the PC service. However, due to the highly intermittent behaviour of renewable energy sources and the possibility of sudden changes in the operating conditions of the distribution grid, it is recommended to run the PC service with at intervals shorter than one minute and possibly close to a few seconds.\nNeeded components in the field: inverters (controllable from remote), sensors and meters.\nInformation about the electrical grid: topology of the network; grid parameters (line impedance, transformer data, etc.); nominal power of connected loads and generators; location of the meters.\nType of measurements: the State Estimation service results are used in input to the PC service, so the same requirements as to the State Estimation service apply for this point.\nMeasurement number: the State Estimation service results are used in input to the PC service, so the same requirements as to the State Estimation service apply for this point.\nData volume: limited. In typical operations, one set of setpoints (i.e., active and reactive power, P and Q) is transmitted per minute with volt-reactive volt ampere curve; as an alternative, dynamic voltage control is recommended in case of disturbances. In such situations, the solution will transmit approximately 1 set of setpoints per second. P and Q are floating point numbers. The communication should be scalable, i.e., supporting changing grid topology with an increasing number of actors in the electrical grid.\nMeasurement accuracy: the State Estimation service results are used in input to the PC service, so the same requirements as to the State Estimation service apply for this point.\nMeasurement synchronization: the State Estimation service results are used in input to the PC service, so the same requirements as to the State Estimation service apply for this point.\nAdditional data needed from the field: notification of switching events leading to a change in the network topology.\nReal-time communication capability: yes, required\nBi-directional communication: yes required; needed to collect measurement and switch notifications in one direction (uplink) and to apply the control signals to the inverter in the other direction (downlink).\nCommunication reliability and security: very high. PC service uses only a limited amount of command messages per actor, typically one actor for each switch, transformer, or major power generation unit. Since there will be only a limited set of such actors, the reliability of the data communication becomes particularly important, because losing just a single actor would impact the impact of the PC service. Likewise, it is essential that the data are transmitted in a secure way ensuring full data integrity because of automatic modification of grid edge settings; and in this context, higher security than for monitoring services expected.\n",

                            "text_content": "During emergencies, public mobile land networks (PLMNs) may restrict network access, which may lead to a lack of service reliability for machine-type communication (MTC) in critical applications, such as power systems and in particular in microgrids. Microgrids are separate parts of a power grid, which can be controlled and operated individually in a so-called island mode or together as a whole. Existing features of a mobile network can be used to differentiate MTC of devices in a microgrid from other MTC or human-to-human (H2H) communication and ensure that these microgrid devices have service during emergencies, which enables use of mobile communication to co-ordinate the use of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in microgrids, so that they can autarkically perform blackout recovery of an islanded microgrid. The idea is to ensure reliable communications for selected MTC devices during emergency conditions, without giving these devices additional priority over other network users during normal conditions or adversely affecting the service to prioritised users during emergencies. It was shown that this method allows the blackout recovery 100 times faster than with a conventional black start [58].\nFigure 5.22.1-1 shows an example of power grid restoration after a large-scale blackout using conventional and autarkic microgrid blackout recovery methods.\nThe figure depicts two restoration scenarios for grid power systems. In the first scenario, a hierarchical top-down blackout recovery is shown, where the grid is restored by sequentially restoring the most critical nodes. In the second scenario, an autarkic microgrid restoration is depicted, where each islanded microgrid autonomously recovers from a blackout. The figure provides a visual representation of the restoration process and highlights the importance of grid stability and resilience in power systems.\nFigure 5.22.1-1: (a) Conventional grid restoration (hierarchical top-down blackout recovery) and (b) autarkic microgrid restoration (each islanded microgrid autonomously recovers from blackout) Figure taken from [58]\nGrid restoration after a large-scale blackout is conventionally done by first starting power stations with black start capability, then expanding the re-energised grid to include more large synchronous power stations and expanding the re-energised grid. In this way, medium voltage and low voltage levels are re-energised hierarchically and top-down, i.e., from the transmission level.\nThe autarkic microgrid blackout recovery method presented in [53] assumes that the MV/LV grid is divided into a set of microgrids (Figure 5.22.1-1 (b)), which can be operated in island mode and are assumed to be autarkic, meaning that they have sufficient local energy generation and storage to be self-sufficient, and autonomous, meaning that they can manage themselves, although in normal operation they may be managed by distribution grid (DG) management systems external to the microgrid.\nIn the context of a microgrid, having reliable communications during a blackout means that the microgrid can continue to manage itself during blackout, i.e., even when the distributed energy resources (DER) in the microgrid are connected to a de-energised grid, the distributed controllers at the DER sites can continue to communicate with each other.\nIf communications from the microgrid to external management systems are working, the microgrid can perform autarkic blackout recovery under their direction. If, however, there is a loss of communication from the microgrid to external management systems, the microgrid can autonomously perform the autarkic blackout recovery. In any case, the autarkic blackout recovery relies on having communications which continue to function locally in the microgrid during blackout to allow the agents to act together to perform a black start using local DERs.\nIn the autarkic microgrid blackout recovery method, the medium/low voltage grid is assumed to be divided into a set of autarkic microgrids, as shown in Figure 5.22.1-1 (b), which are islanded in case of blackout. The DERs remain connected to the grid and continue to use their Multi-Agent System (MAS) MTC devices to communicate with each other and with the distribution grid control centre during the blackout [53]. In this scenario, each microgrid has its own gNB equipped with an emergency power supply. In case the emergency power supply for a gNB is not available, only this specific microgrid covered by the affected gNB cannot perform autarkic blackout recovery. However, other microgrids which are not affected by the malfunctioning gNB can still perform blackout recovery.\n",

                            "text_content": "In the power grid, there are devices deployed to measure physical quantities from the grid, such quantities are e.g. electrical quantities such as amplitudes of voltage and current, phase, frequency or rate of change of frequency (ROCOF). One device that can provide such measurements is called a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU). This particular device provides the above-mentioned values synchronized to a global time clock derived, for example from GPS. Such synchronized values can be used as an input to power distribution grid services, such as state estimation service [61]. Another possible service that relies on measurements of voltage, current and phase is a voltage control service [62].\nAs PMUs are very expensive devices, they are placed only at key points of interest. However, it is possible to use cheaper field devices that collect sampled measurement data and then process them in the edge cloud hosted PMU software, virtualizing the processing functionality of a traditional PMU, thus enabling the concept of the edgePMU [63]. Due to the lower processing requirements of the field devices, their cost is reduced, and they can also be deployed in the distribution grid providing power system operators with a more precise knowledge of the state of their grids. The edgePMU concept separates the data acquisition from the data processing by exploiting the computational capabilities offered by distributed 5G edge clouds.\nThe edgePMU, with its modular approach, tackles the growing need for low-cost measurement devices in distribution networks from a new perspective. It utilizes the scalability of cloud infrastructure and decreases the specialization needed in the data acquisition device, by providing flexible cloud solutions for different data use cases. Furthermore, the overall deployment is simplified from a communication point of view since there is no need for special communications cabling and a network infrastructure managed by distribution grid operators. This approach simplifies the adoption of PMUs in distribution networks by helping distribution grid operators gradually deploy their measurement architectures. In fact, the cloud-based approach offers great flexibility in the development of monitoring and automation functionalities, by gradually stacking services and processing modules. It also provides scalability opportunities, thanks to the cloud technology-based computational infrastructure. The increased computational power offered by 5G edge cloud compared to that of low-cost single board computers enables more computationally challenging algorithms to be deployed.\nHere are the key features of the edgePMU concept [63]:\nHigh rate raw data transmission between the data acquisition unit and the edge cloud using 5G wireless connectivity\nThe ability to deploy services or other applications on edge cloud infrastructure instead of having to deploy them in a traditional PMU with its high processing power\nA single field device can be used as a data acquisition unit for different services hosted in the edge cloud\nServices can be deployed, modified and upgraded on demand without the need to physically visit the sites\nThe cloud-based software is not limited to only providing phasor measurements, but could also be used to calculate other metrics for power distribution grid services\n",

This service works by processing the historical data on the power consumption/injection of the customer, generator, or substation under analysis, and possibly taking into account other information that is likely to affect the power levels (e.g. like weather conditions, temperature, etc.). The forecast given by the LP and GP can refer to different time horizons and can have a different time resolution, according to the requirements of the DSOs. As an example, day ahead forecasts (for example with a time resolution of 15 minutes) can be generated in order to predict possible contingencies and, in case, to be prepared to take adequate countermeasures. Day ahead forecasts could be refined by shorter-term forecasts, e.g. a forecast referred to the next hour, which in general could be more reliable since it can be based on more recent information on the grid status. This could be, for example, a solution to apply preventive control schemes aimed at minimizing the risk of problems in the grid. On the other side, longer term forecasts (e.g. on a seasonal or yearly basis) are also possible and they can support DSOs in planning, and in supporting strategical decisions on managing and reinforcing the grid.\n",

In the case of the LP service, the needed historical data include the power consumption (demand) measured in the past with a time resolution that is equal (or better) than the one required in output for the service. As a consequence, the application of the LP service automatically implies the need to have power meters available at the customer (or substation) site where the forecast is required. In the case of the GP service, similar requirements also apply. Moreover, since the generation can be largely affected by external factors, additional information can be also needed. E.g., in case of a GP service to forecast the power generation from photovoltaic (PV) plants, additional factors such as weather conditions (irradiance, temperature, cloudiness, etc.) can play a relevant role to determine the expected power generation and they need to be duly considered by the service. In summary, the data required as input to the LP/GP service are:\nActive and reactive power consumption (or generation) measured at the customer (generator) or substation that is object of the analysis; data should possibly cover a quite long period of time (months or years) to lead to accurate results.\nWeather forecast data (irradiance, temperature, cloudiness, etc.) as input to the GP service.\nGenerally, the LP/GP service has loose power system requirements. It is worth noting that no data about the grid are needed for this service and that the measurement devices deployed to get the needed power data do not need real-time communication requirements.\nNeeded components in the field: sensors and meters.\nInformation about the electrical grid: no details on the electric grid are needed.\nType of measurements: power measurements at the monitored load, generator, or substation (or both voltage and current in order to be able to compute the associated power).\nMeasurement number: for each point where an accurate forecast is needed, a meter providing power measurements (or information on both voltage and current) is needed.\nMeasurement accuracy: no strict requirements on the accuracy of the measurement chain.\nMeasurement synchronization: no need for accurate synchronization, but meter data need to have a time tag.\nAdditional data needed from the field: no additional data needed from the field.\nReal-time communication capability: not required.\nBi-directional communication: not required, the communication flow is mono-directional from the meters to the control centre.\n",

The use cases demonstrate the anticipated enhancements in the 5G system in order to use the 5G system\nto support periodic communication and aperiodic communication required by different Smart Grid use cases;\nto support clock synchronization required by Smart Grid use cases;\nto support required information exchange between 5G system and a trusted 3rd party;\nto support one or multiple profiles standardized in IEC or IEEE;\nto support secured communication between the 5G system and a 3rd party’s application function.\nSecurity considerations are captured in clause 6. The consolidated potential requirements and KPIs are in clause 7 of the TR. The contents of clause 6 and clause 7 is proposed to be considered as the basis of normative Release 18 requirements to support the Smart Grid service.\n\n",

                    "text_content": "The topic of this annex is transport networks, normally out of scope of 3GPP standardization. For this reason, the material is provided as an informative annex.\nThis use case considers how to provide 3GPP access underground. Equivalently, this use case considers providing 3GPP access anywhere in which 3GPP access cannot penetrate.) The use case considers what actions to take from the perspective of a facility – to provide smart energy services to components that are located underground.\nThis is a relevant use case for smart energy because there are many facilities in the energy system which are either underground or inside structures that have thick walls with little or no ability for transmissions to penetrate.\nThere are essentially three possible approaches – as shown in Figure A.1-1, below.\n\n\nFigure A.1-1: Underground Access Approaches\nThe radio access on the roof can be extended inside by means of a cable as shown in pink (e.g. coaxial cable, with support hardware) to provide radio access to an indoor station (on the lower right, underground.)\nAnother approach is to provide a gateway and a wireless extension topology, as shown in green. This could provide backhaul to a 3GPP access station in the lower right. Alternatively, all access within the building and underground could be accomplished by means of non-3GPP access. The (fixed mobile) 3GPP access remains on the roof, as a gateway providing network access.\nThe third approach is to make use of the existing power line deployment in the building and underground as a means of providing backhaul to the underground access point. There are a number of Power Line Communications (PLC) standards that are already used to provide data access to the edge of the electrical network, especially to physical locations that cannot be accessed easily in other ways.\nTwo prominent examples are Open PLC European Research Alliance (OPERA) [16] and G.9960 [17], which are used for support of Ethernet functionality over medium and low voltage power lines in a restricted range. In OPERA, information is modulated using OFDM with a set of 1536 sub-carriers. Effectively, this network provides an Ethernet over a power-line. G.9960 achieves PHY data rates up to 20 Mbit/s and highly robust communications with PHY bit rates up to 5 Mbit/s (using 4x repetition encoding.) 3GPP components can be integrated above this layer two standard that carries Ethernet frames.\nOPERA achieves PHY data rates of up to 200 Mbit/s with a bandwidth of 30 MHz (this is typically not achieved in practice. Implementation is done in either 5 MHz or 10 MHz channels with much lower maximum PHY bit rate up to 40 Mbit/s and 80 Mbit/s respectively), for medium voltage (MV) cables. These throughput levels are not achievable at all in low voltage (LV) scenarios in which medium conditions are different to MV's. (This is an area of current development at the time this document was written, with researchers currently performing tests to evaluate the LV scenario.) The evolution of Ghn defined in ITU standard G.9960 might be more adequate for LV broadband power line (BPL) and for this use case (use of the LV cabling within a building) because it was specifically defined for domestic cables.\nWhereas adding a cable for range extension through a structure or wireless extension topologies entail extra planning, materials and complexity, power lines already exist in all (modern) structures.\n",

The facility may either exist, or be planned and built from scratch.\nThe builders provide an efficient and effective means to extend wireless communication for Smart Grid communications underground (or in a portion of the facility which cannot be penetrated by emissions for wireless communications.)\nFigure A.2-1 depicts an example deployment architecture.\nThe figure depicts an example of a 3GPP Access Deployment using a PLC, illustrating the underground infrastructure for 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) networks. The deployment includes underground cables, fiber-optic lines, and underground nodes, all connected to a central control point. The figure highlights the importance of proper planning and coordination to ensure reliable and efficient network connectivity.\nFigure A.2-1: Example Underground 3GPP Access Deployment using PLC\nA PLC connection between the UE and the underground gNB has been configured. The UE has a preconfigured tunnel to the MNO's network. The UE's user plane tunnel transports both the user plane and control plane traffic of the underground gNB. The UEs that camp on the underground gNB have full 5G service, limited only by the (limited) bandwidth available (and added latency) due to the PLC and UE to gNB links.\n",
