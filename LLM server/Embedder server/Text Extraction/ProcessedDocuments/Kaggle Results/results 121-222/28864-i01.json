Comparing to the NWDAF without such capability, the NWDAF with \"analytics aggregation capability\" needs to perform the additional interactions with other NWDAFs and the additional aggregation operation, too. In the multiple NWDAF deployment scenario, the operator needs to monitor the performance related to the additional operations of a NWDAF with \"analytics aggregation capability\" and take the result as a necessary part of the performance of this NWDAF instance. However, for a NWDAF without \"analytics aggregation capability\", it is meaningless and even misleading to consider and monitor the performance related to those additional operations.\nAs a result, when multiple NWDAFs are deployed, the operator may want to distinguish the NWDAF instances based on these differences, so that the management can be performed accordingly.\nHowever, the current NWDAFFunction IOC defined in [3] cannot reflect the differences on the NWDAF capability aspect.\nIn this Key Issue, the potential solution(s) is provided to enhances the NWDAFFunction IOC to support reflecting the differences on the NWDAF capability aspect in multiple NWDAF deployment.\n",

NWDAFs containing different logical function supports different sets of service, for example, the \"ML model provisioning service\" is only provided by the NWDAF containing the MTLF, and the analytic related services are only provided by NWDAF containing AnLF.\nThe information of the logical decomposition provides necessary indication to the operators on how to monitor and consider the performance of a NWDAF instances. For example, it is necessary to monitor the performance related to the analytics if a NWDAF instance contains AnLF. However, if the operator knows that this NWDAF instance under observation also contains MTLF, the operator needs additionally monitor the performance related to the model training and take both parts of performance together into account.\nFrom the operator's point of view, the NWDAF instances which train ML model only is different from the NWDAF instances which perform inference only.

The proposed key performance indicator is defined as a Boolean that expresses whether the NWDAF is observing the \"Expected service usage\" or \"Abnormal service usage\". \"Expected service usage\" represents the case where the distribution of requests is similar distribution of requests observed during normal operations, otherwise \"Abnormal service usage\" represents the case where their mare major variations in the number of requests.\nThe solution proposes to use as input the requests received by an NWDAF service producer, and to produces an analysis of the expected incoming requests distribution. For this the MnS producer is given an indication of a period of normal operations, e.g., one where the operator monitors the incoming requests to confirm that they are normal and expected requests. Based on those requests, the MnS producer computes this \"expected distribution of incoming requests\" parameterised by different characteristics like time, location, requesting function, etc.\nThen at any point during operations, the MnS producer computes a \"distribution of the arriving service requests\" which is computed the same way as the \"expected distribution of incoming requests\" but from requests received at that time (i.e., when the operator does not monitor the requests). The MnS producer may take as input the expected behaviour of the service producers' incoming requests as the specific \"expected distribution of incoming requests \" e.g. for a specific requesting function and provides a comparison between these expected distribution of incoming requests \" and the distribution of the arriving service requests.\nThe outcome is an indication whether the service is used as expected or is being used abnormally.\nNote: \tThe service usage performance indication can be computed for any of the services of the NWDAF.\nIn order to measure the performance of the NWDAF related to the Model Training Logical Function (MTLF) on the interaction aspect, this solution is proposed to provide the performance measurements based on the subscriptions and/or requests received by NWDAF. The proposed performance measurements are provided as the number of subscriptions and/or requests received by NWDAF.\nThe proposed solution can be a potential solution for the performance measurement of the NWDAF supporting ML model provision services, such as NWDAF containing Model Training Logical Function (MTLF), based on the interaction aspect.\nThese performance measurements of the NWDAF related to the MTLF on the interaction aspect are provided as the number of subscriptions and/or requests received by NWDAF supporting model provision services.

For the data source, all the data required by NWDAF needs to be generated or prepared accordingly before they are retrieved by NWDAF. And for the NWDAF, it needs to distinguish every piece of data received from different data sources and of data received from the same data source but for different network analytic purposes.\nThe operator may notice that the data collection is the major task of one NWDAF instance, therefore, less computation resource can be allocated to that NWDAF instance, and more storage and network resources may be allocated if necessary. Or on the extreme cases, a new NWDAF instance needs to be provided or it may be found out that deploying a DCCF is the optimum solution. For making a decision, the measurement data is needed, such as how many data is collected by a NWDAF instance or by all NWDAF instances related to some areas of interests, so that the operator could have the understanding and estimation of the working load and working status of the NWDAF instance.\nMoreover, it is also beneficial to have the granular measurement of data collection, such as measuring the data collected from different type of data sources. This measurement may provide information about if it is possible to optimize the deployment of NWDAF. For example, the NWDAF instance may be geographically deployed closer to its major data source to reduce the latency and save network resources.\nIn the other case, the monitoring of data collection will help improve the other services provided by NWDAF. For example, for model training, the training data are expected to be collected periodically. However, in practical, not all of the data are collected successfully, some of them can be missing which is probably caused the malfunctioning of the data source or network transmission issue. The more the data is missing the worse the degradation of the quality of the training data will be. And it will bring negative effect to the model training, such as a slow converging rate. Similar situation may also happen to input data of analytic services and analytic results.\nBy monitoring the periodical notification which is used for data collection expected and actually received by the NWDAF, it is possible to estimate the quality of the data collected in a period which will indicate whether the data collected in this period is able to reflect the network correctly and sufficiently and whether some additional data cleansing or data augmentation are needed before the they are used for model training or analytics.\nIn this key issue, the potential solutions are provided to define the new performance measurement reflecting the data collection performed by NWDAF to fulfil the following potential requirements:\nREQ-NWDAF_COUNT-1 the 3GPP management system shall have a capability to allow an authorized consumer to configure the NWDAF to monitoring the data collection actions initiated by the NWDAF and the corresponding result, respectively.

The optional time \"Time when analytics information is needed\" could be specified during the analytics subscription/request by the consumer.

Meanwhile, the NWDAF has a delay per Analytics ID, called \"Supported Analytics Delay\", that is specified in the NWDAF profile and indicates the amount of time per Analytics ID that is expected to lapse between the instant that the NWDAF receives a request for analytics and the time point at which the NWDAF delivers the corresponding analytics report.\nIdeally, the time \"Time when analytics information is needed\" should not be set to a value lower than \"Supported Analytics Delay\". Otherwise, if the time \"Time when analytics information is needed\" is reached but the analytics information is not ready, the UNSATISFIED_REQUESTED_ANALYTICS_TIME error message might be returned, while if the time \"Time when analytics information is needed\" is set to a value lower than \"Supported Analytics Delay\", it is expected that the NWDAF might not be able to treat the Analytics ID on time.\nOn the other hand, the specifications indicate that NWDAF should trigger ML model training, but the time required for that operation (which can be significantly long under certain circumstances) is not considered in the \"Supported Analytics Delay\" attribute. In addition, the performance management of NWDAF related to errors generated by expiration of \"Time when analytics information is needed\" is missing. Thus, there is the need of introducing performance measurement and KPI for performance management of the NWDAF based on this aspect.\nThe 3GPP management system should introduces the enablers to manage NWDAF performance based on expiration of \"Time when analytics information is needed\" specified by analytics consumer in the analytics subscription/request.
