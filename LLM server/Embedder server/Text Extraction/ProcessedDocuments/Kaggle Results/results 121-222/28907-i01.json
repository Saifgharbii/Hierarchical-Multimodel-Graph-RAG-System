However, fault supervision management which is very important for NPN operators is not specified in detail. Furthermore, in some vertical scenarios, 5G industry terminal, e.g. camera, programmable logic controller (PLC) and Smart Distribution Transformer Terminal and so on, are widely deployed. These large quantity 5G industry terminals which may be provided by multiple vendors are managed by multiple standalone terminal management systems and this increases the complexity and difficulty of NPN management, especially for E2E fault location. For example, if an NPN goes down, it is difficult to locate rapidly where the fault occurred or to determine whether the fault is caused by the industry terminal.\n5G-ACIA has described the functional requirements for exposing the capabilities of non-public 5G systems to industrial factory applications in [5]. 3GPP should also provide potential solutions to support the use cases and requirements from 5G-ACIA. The requirements given in clause 4.3 of 5G-ACIA white paper in [5] are aspects of network management, as following:\n\"[R-4.3.1-07] The 5G exposure reference points must allow monitoring of errors and other alarms from physical/logical network components and connections.\n[R-4.3.1-08] The 5G exposure reference points must provide the monitoring information in such a way that it can be effectively used for error detection, localization, root-cause analysis, and error resolution.\"\nTherefore, for vertical industry scenarios, 3GPP management system needs to provide fault management capabilities scoping NPN and UEs representing 5G industry terminals. These capabilities need to be integrated with the ones scoping OT domain (non-3GPP domain), to allow for E2E fault location.\n",

Before an NPN is created, an MNO (playing the role of NPN-SP/NPN-OP) needs to authenticate the vertical. If the authentication is passed, the MNO management system should manage the related information for NPN service customer, for example, allocating a new identity of the vertical which can be used in MNO management system and creating the context of the vertical to keep the new identity, authorized available management capabilities, required coverage area and so on.\nThe procedure of management of the related information for NPN service customer is following. The pre-condition of the procedure is the business agreements between MNO and NPN-SC is reached.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for managing the related information for a customer of the NPN service. It includes a checklist for each step, ensuring that the customer's information is properly documented and tracked. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different sections of the checklist. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise guide for managing customer information in the NPN service.\nFigure 5.2.2.1.2-1: Procedure of management of the related information for NPN service customer\n1)\tNPN-SC provides the vertical information (e.g. human readable name of vertical, subscribed management capabilities exposed to vertical, etc.) to register a vertical to NPN-SP/NPN-OP through an NPN-SC registration request message. This message may be interacted with BSS layer. But the BSS layer should forward the subscription data to OSS layer to authorize the exposure of management capabilities and corresponding managed resources to NPN-SC.\n2)\tNPN-SP/NPN-OP receives the vertical information from NPN-SC and executes the authentication and authorization for a vertical. The NPN-SP/NPN-OP allocates a new identity which is associated with the vertical identity and creates the context information of the vertical in local. The context information can be managed in form of NRM IOCs. The NPN-SP/NPN-OP uses the allocated new identity in MNO management system to identify the corresponding vertical.\nThe details of the context information, as example, are:\n-\tconsumerID: It is used to identify the MnS consumer (e.g. NPN-SC).\n-\tauthorizedMnS: It gives a list of management services that are allowed to be exposed to the NPN-SC. The MnS components Type A, Type B and/or Type C should be specified in this attribute. The attribute authorizedMnS defined in Table 7.1.4-1 of TR 28.817 [17], which gives list of management services and its capabilities the consumer is authorized to access, can be used to for holding this information.\n-\tvalidDuration: It specifies a time period during which the NPN-SC can consume the exposed management capabilities. The NPN-SC is banned to consume exposed management capabilities when it is out of the valid duration. The attribute Validity defined in Table 7.1.4-1 of TR 28.817 [17] can be used to for holding this information.\n3)\tThe NPN-SP/NPN-OP sends NPN-SC registration response message to the NPN-SC including the authentication result (e.g. success or failure), the new identity, authorized available management capabilities information and other attributes which are part of the context information of the vertical.\n",

A power grid consists of four building blocks: power generation, transmission, distribution and consumption. These different phases require different services, and these services have distinct communication requirements.\nAs description in clause 5.9 of TS 22.867 [4]:\nAccording to the regulation of China Grid industry, the power grid business is mainly divided into two working categories: production control and information management. The production control can be further divided into safety zone I and safety zone II. The information management also can be further divided into safety zone III and safety zone IV.\nDifferent kinds of safety isolation requirements are applied to different safety zones:\na)\tThe energy applications belong to production control category i.e. safety zones I and II need to be physically isolated from other applications which do not belong to production control working category.\nb)\tThe energy applications belong to information management working category i.e. safety zone III and IV can be logically isolation from other applications including non-energy applications.\nc)\tThe energy applications belong to a same working category can be logically isolated each other.\nd)\tThe energy applications belong to a same safety zone can be logically isolated each other.\nNPN may be deployed to support the different use cases and service requirements for multiple Smart Grid applications. For example, multiple NPNs (e.g. multiple PNI-NPNs, each having on-prem NFs and a dedicated portion of PLMN NFs as a slice of the PLMN) may be deployed to meet the requirements of physical isolation communication service. The logical isolation communication service on the other hand may be supported by shared network element or shared network resource in one NPN for Smart Grid.\nTo provide management mechanism to assurance resource isolation for different isolation modes, 3GPP management system may need to configure different network parameters whose purpose is for energy applications with different isolation modes.\nTherefore, 3GPP management system needs to have the capability to meet the distinct communication requirements with different resource isolation demands for some smart grid applications supported by NPNs.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause provides a potential solution to satisfy the resource isolation demand described in clause 5.3.1.\nA resource isolation-sharing policy, which contains the logical and physical isolation policies among different safety zones, can be sent to NPN-OP.\nThe logical resource isolation-sharing policy includes several groups of safety zones. Energy applications belonging to the safety zones within the same group use the shared logical resources (e.g. a network slice), while energy applications categorized into different safety zones across different groups use isolated logical resources. An example of the division of safety zones into groups is shown in Figure 5.3.2.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a logical isolation-sharing policy, which is a method used in telecommunications to ensure that data is transmitted securely and efficiently. It illustrates how groups of data can be divided into multiple safety zones, with each zone being isolated from the others. This allows for the efficient transmission of data while maintaining security and privacy.\nFigure 5.3.2.2-1: Example of logical isolation-sharing policy - groups cross multiple safety zones\nIn case that the applications belonging to the same safety zone require to be logically isolated with each other, the groups can reflect the resource isolation-sharing policy at a more granular level, such as specifying the applications. An example of the division of applications into groups is shown in Figure 5.3.2.2-2. Application 1-1 and Application 2-1 are further divided into different subgroups as they cannot share same logical network resources event though they are both categorized into safety zone 1.\nThe figure depicts a logical isolation-sharing policy, which is a method used in network security to ensure that data is only transmitted within a specific area, known as a safety zone. This policy is implemented within a subgroup within one safety zone, ensuring that data is only transmitted within that specific area. The figure shows the different subgroups within the safety zone, each with its own logical isolation and sharing policy. This policy is crucial for maintaining network security and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.\nFigure 5.3.2.2-2: Example of logical isolation-sharing policy - subgroups within one safety zone\nSimilarly, the physical resource isolation-sharing policy includes several groups of safety zones. Energy applications belonging to the safety zones within the same group use the shared physical resources, while energy applications categorized into different safety zones across different groups use isolated physical resources. An example of the division of safety zones into groups is shown in Figure 5.3.2.2-3.\nThe figure depicts a physical isolation-sharing policy, which is a crucial aspect of network security. It illustrates the various physical isolation methods used in a network, such as physical barriers, firewalls, and network segmentation. The policy is designed to ensure that data is securely transmitted between different network segments, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.\nFigure 5.3.2.2-3: Example of physical isolation-sharing policy\nAll logical and physical isolation-sharing relations (i.e. shared or isolated) between every two safety zones could be figured out with the resource isolation policy, and the NPN-OP should take it into consideration when allocating network resources for each safety zone. When Smart Grid Utilities requests the network resources allocation for energy applications, the safety zone type and the related logical and/or physical resource isolation lists could be attached in the request to show the logical and/or physical resource isolation-sharing relations between one safety zone and other safety zones, so that the network resources allocation for energy applications belonging to certain safety zones satisfies the resource isolation demand. Detailed explanation of the safety zone type, logical and physical resource isolation lists are as following:\n-\tThe safety zone type is used to identify which safety zones the energy applications are categorized into.\n-\tThe subgroup identifier is used to identify the subgroups of energy applications within one safety zone. It is only applicable when applications belonging to a same safety zone requires to be logically isolated each other.\n-\tThe logical resource isolation list is derived from the logical isolation-sharing policy and contains safety zones that are required to be logical isolated with the current safety zone. Safety zones which are out of this list are ones that sharing the same logical network resources with the current safety zone. When the subgroup identifier is specified, the other subgroups of the current safety zone should also be included in the logical resource isolation lists.\n-\tThe physical resource isolation list is derived from the physical isolation-sharing policy and contains safety zones that are required to be physical isolated with the current safety zone. Safety zones which are out of this list are ones that sharing the same physical network resources with the current safety zone.\n",

The technical part, referred to as SLS, capture service requirements which are input to 3GPP management system. For example, TS 22.104 [6] presents service requirements of cyber-physical control applications (e.g. motion control, process automation, etc.) in vertical domains, which require very high levels of communication service availability and/or very low end-to-end latencies. The end-to-end latency is also very important for the applications of smart Grid, e.g. differential protection in power distribution grid.\nFrom network management perspective, the network management service provider allocates network resource to provide communication service based on related service requirements, monitoring the network performance to evaluate the SLA fulfilment. Therefore, the NPN management system may need to study how to assure whether the service and network requirements are achieved. Some related KPIs/KQIs like communication service availability, communication service reliability, end-to-end latency, UE speed, are clarified to continually monitoring the network performance to evaluate the assurance of the SLA. If the SLA is not fulfilled, the network optimization contributing to SLS assurance, e.g. reconfigure the resources should be adopted to resolve the performance degradation.\n",

Therefore, a bundle of management capabilities and corresponding managed resources should be exposed to the vertical from the mobile network operator according to the business agreement between the two parties under MNO-Vertical Managed Mode.\nThe figure depicts a vertical managing PNI-NPN through exposure scenario, illustrating the process of managing and controlling the PNI-NPN (Passive Optical Network Interface) through exposure.
