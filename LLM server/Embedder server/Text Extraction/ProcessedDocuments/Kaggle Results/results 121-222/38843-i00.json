            "description": "The application of AI/ML to wireless communications has been thus far limited to implementation-based approaches, both, at the network and the UE sides. A study on enhancement for data collection for NR and ENDC  (FS_NR_ENDC_data_collect) has examined the functional framework for RAN intelligence enabled by further enhancement of data collection through use cases, examples etc. and identify the potential standardization impacts on current NG-RAN nodes and interfaces. In SA WG2 AI/ML related study, a network functionality NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function) was introduced in Rel-15 and has been enhanced in Rel-16 and Rel-17.\nThis study explores the benefits of augmenting the air-interface with features enabling improved support of AI/ML. The 3GPP framework for AI/ML is studied for air-interface corresponding to each target use case regarding aspects such as performance, complexity, and potential specification impact.\nThrough studying a few carefully selected use cases, assessing their performance in comparison with traditional methods and the associated potential specification impacts that enable their solutions, this study lays the foundation for future air-interface use cases leveraging AI/ML techniques.\nSufficient use cases are targeted to enable the identification of a common AI/ML framework, including functional requirements of AI/ML architecture, which could be used in subsequent projects. The study also serves identifying areas where AI/ML could improve the performance of air-interface functions.\nThe study serves identifying what is required for an adequate AI/ML model characterization and description establishing pertinent notation for discussions and subsequent evaluations. Various levels of collaboration between the gNB and UE are identified and considered.\nEvaluations to exercise the attainable gains of AI/ML based techniques for the use cases under consideration are carried out with the corresponding identification of KPIs with the goal to have a better understanding of the attainable gains and associated complexity requirements.\nFinally, specification impact are assessed in order to improve the overall understanding of what would be required to enable AI/ML techniques for the air-interface.\nThe central objective of this project is to study the 3GPP framework for AI/ML for air-interface corresponding to each target use case regarding aspects such as performance, complexity, and potential specification impact.\nThe use cases to focus include:\n-\tCSI feedback enhancement\n-\tSpatial-frequency domain CSI compression using two-sided AI model\n-\tTime domain CSI prediction using UE sided model\n-\tBeam management\n-\tSpatial-domain Downlink beam prediction for Set A of beams based on measurement results of Set B of beams\n-\tTemporal Downlink beam prediction for Set A of beams based on the historic measurement results of Set B of beams\n-\tPositioning accuracy enhancements\n-\tDirect AI/ML positioning\n-\tAI/ML assisted positioning\nNote:\tthe selection of use cases for this study solely targets the formulation of a framework to apply AI/ML to the air-interface for these and other use cases. The selection itself does not intend to provide any indication of the prospects of any future normative project.\nThis study also introduces AI/ML model terminology and description to identify common and specific characteristics for framework investigations, namely to:\n-\tCharacterize the defining stages of AI/ML related algorithms and associated complexity:\n-\tModel generation, e.g., model training (including input/output, pre-/post-process, online/offline as applicable), model validation, model testing, as applicable\n-\tInference operation, e.g., input/output, pre-/post-process, as applicable\n-\tIdentify various levels of collaboration between UE and gNB pertinent to the selected use cases, e.g.,\n-\tNo collaboration: implementation-based only AI/ML algorithms without information exchange [for comparison purposes]\n-\tVarious levels of UE/gNB collaboration targeting at separate or joint ML operation.\n-\tCharacterize lifecycle management of AI/ML model: e.g., model training, model deployment, model inference, model monitoring, model updating\n-\tDataset(s) for training, validation, testing, and inference\n-\tIdentify common notation and terminology for AI/ML related functions, procedures and interfaces\n-\tNote: \tthe work done for FS_NR_ENDC_data_collect is considered when appropriate\nFor the use cases under consideration:\n1)\tPerformance benefits of AI/ML based algorithms for the agreed use cases are evaluated:\n-\tMethodology based on statistical models (from TR 38.901 and TR 38.857 [positioning]), for link and system level simulations.\n-\tExtensions of 3GPP evaluation methodology for better suitability to AI/ML based techniques should be considered as needed.\n-\tWhether field data are optionally needed to further assess the performance and robustness in real-world environments should be discussed as part of the study.\n-\tNeed for common assumptions in dataset construction for training, validation and test for the selected use cases.\n-\tConsider adequate model training strategy, collaboration levels and associated implications\n-\tConsider agreed-upon base AI model(s) for calibration\n-\tAI model description and training methodology used for evaluation should be reported for information and cross-checking purposes\n-\tKPIs: Determine the common KPIs and corresponding requirements for the AI/ML operations. Determine the use-case specific KPIs and benchmarks of the selected use-cases.\n-\tPerformance, inference latency and computational complexity of AI/ML based algorithms should be compared to that of a state-of-the-art baseline\n-\tOverhead, power consumption (including computational), memory storage, and hardware requirements (including for given processing delays) associated with enabling respective AI/ML scheme, as well as generalization capability should be considered.\n2)\tPotential specification impact, specifically for the agreed use cases and for a common framework, is assessed:\n-\tPHY layer aspects, e.g., (RAN1)\n-\tConsidering aspects related to, e.g., the potential specification of the AI Model lifecycle management, and dataset construction for training, validation and test for the selected use cases\n-\tUse case and collaboration level specific specification impact, such as new signalling, means for training and validation data assistance, assistance information, measurement, and feedback\n-\tProtocol aspects, e.g., (RAN2) - RAN2 only starts the work after there is sufficient progress on the use case study in RAN1\n-\tConsidering aspects related to, e.g., capability indication, configuration and control procedures (training/inference), and management of data and AI/ML model, per RAN1 input\n-\tCollaboration level specific specification impact per use case\n-\tInteroperability and testability aspects, e.g., (RAN4) - RAN4 only starts the work after there is sufficient progress on use case study in RAN1 and RAN2\n-\tRequirements and testing frameworks to validate AI/ML based performance enhancements and ensuring that UE and gNB with AI/ML meet or exceed the existing minimum requirements if applicable\n-\tConsidering the need and implications for AI/ML processing capabilities definition\nNote 1:\tSpecific AI/ML models are not expected to be specified and are left to implementation. User data privacy needs to be preserved.\nNote 2:\tThe study on AI/ML for air interface is based on the current RAN architecture and new interfaces shall not be introduced.\n",

When distinction is necessary for discussion purposes, companies may use the term a logical AI/ML model to refer to a model that is identified and assigned a model ID, and physical AI/ML model(s) to refer to an actual implementation of such a model.\nFor UE-side models and UE-part of two-sided models:\n-\tFor AI/ML functionality identification\n-\tLegacy 3GPP framework of feature is taken as a starting point.\n-\tUE indicates supported functionalities/functionality for a given sub-use-case.\n-\tUE capability reporting is taken as starting point.\n-\tFor AI/ML model identification\n-\tModels are identified by model ID at the Network.

Models \tmay not be identified at the Network, and UE may perform model-level LCM. Whether and how much awareness/interaction NW should have about model-level LCM requires further study.

Applicable models can be reported by the UE.\nHow to handle the impact of UE’s internal conditions such as memory, battery, and other hardware limitations on functionality/model operations and AI/ML-enabled Feature is to be studied.  Note: it does not preclude any existing solutions.\nFor functionality/model-ID based LCM, once functionalities/models are identified, the same or similar procedures may be used for their activation, deactivation, switching, fallback, and monitoring.\nModel ID, if needed, can be used in a Functionality (defined in functionality-based LCM) for LCM operations.\n",

(Note: The AI/ML operation may rely on future specification not related to AI/ML collaboration. The AI/ML approaches can be used as baseline for performance evaluation for future releases.)\nLevel y/z boundary is defined based on whether model delivery over the air interface is done in a non-transparent manner to 3GPP signalling.

                    "text_content": "This section introduces the functional framework for AI/ML for NR air interface illustrated in Figure 4.4-1. The aim of this framework is to cover a general functional architecture addressing both model-ID-based LCM and functionality-based LCM, introduced in clause 4.2. Therefore, some of the functions or data/information/instruction flows (i.e., the arrows) shown in the Figure 4.4-1 might not always be relevant for a given LCM approach. As an illustrative example, consider a scenario where the network performs functionality-based LCM and where models are not identified in the network, while the UE concurrently performs model-level management (e.g., model selection/switching/(de)activation, etc…). In this hypothetical case, the \"Model Training\" or \"Model Storage\" functions with their respective procedures, may be regarded as irrelevant from the network’s perspective.\nIn clause 7, the functions and data/information/instruction flows (i.e., the arrows) depicted in Figure 4.4-1 are analysed for any standardization impact and its implications.\nNote: The functional framework and high-level procedures defined in this TR should not prevent from \"thinking beyond\" them during a normative phase if any use case requires so.\nThe figure depicts a functional framework for AI/ML in the NR Air Interface, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It includes AI/ML algorithms, data processing, and communication protocols, all designed to optimize the air interface for efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure 4.4-1: Functional framework for AI/ML for NR Air Interface\nAs seen in Figure 4.4-1, the general framework consists of the following:\n-\tData Collection is a function that provides input data to the Model Training, Management, and Inference functions.\n-\tTraining Data: Data needed as input for the AI/ML Model Training function.\n-\tMonitoring Data: Data needed as input for the Management of AI/ML models or AI/ML functionalities.\n-\tInference Data: Data needed as input for the AI/ML Inference function.\n-\tModel Training is a function that performs AI/ML model training, validation, and testing which may generate model performance metrics which can be used as part of the model testing procedure. The Model Training function is also responsible for data preparation (e.g., data pre-processing and cleaning, formatting, and transformation) based on Training Data delivered by a Data Collection function, if required.\n-\tTrained/Updated Model: In case of having a Model Storage function, this is used to deliver trained, validated, and tested AI/ML models to the Model Storage function, or to deliver an updated version of a model to the Model Storage function.\n-\tManagement is a function that oversees the operation (e.g., selection/(de)activation/switching/fallback) and monitoring (e.g., performance) of AI/ML models or AI/ML functionalities. This function is also responsible for making decisions to ensure the proper inference operation based on data received from the Data Collection function and the Inference function.\n-\tManagement Instruction: Information needed as input to manage the Inference function. Concerning information may include selection/(de)activation/switching of AI/ML models or AI/ML-based functionalities, fallback to non-AI/ML operation (i.e., not relying on inference process), etc…\n-\tModel Transfer/Delivery Request: Used to request model(s) to the Model Storage function.\n-\tPerformance Feedback / Retraining Request: Information needed as input for the Model Training function, e.g., for model (re)training or updating purposes.\n-\tInference is a function that provides outputs from the process of applying AI/ML models or AI/ML functionalities, using the data that is provided by the Data Collection function (i.e., Inference Data) as an input. The Inference function is also responsible for data preparation (e.g., data pre-processing and cleaning, formatting, and transformation) based on Inference Data delivered by a Data Collection function, if required.\n-\tInference Output: Data used by the Management function to monitor the performance of AI/ML models or AI/ML functionalities.\n-\tModel Storage is a function responsible for storing trained/updated models that can be used to perform the Inference function.\n-\tNote: The Model Storage function in Figure 4.4-1 is only intended as a reference point (if any) when applicable for protocol terminations, model transfer/delivery, and related processes. It should be stressed that its purpose does not encompass restricting the actual storage locations of models. Therefore, the specification impact of all data/information/instruction flows (i.e., the arrows in Figure 4.4-1) to/from this function should be studied case by case.\n-\tModel Transfer/Delivery: Used to deliver an AI/ML model to the Inference function.\n",

When N’TRP < NTRP, the remaining (NTRP - N’TRP) TRPs do not provide measurements to model input, i.e., measurement value is set such that the (NTRP  N’TRP) TRPs do not affect model output.\n-\tApproach 1-A. The set of TRPs (N’TRP) that provide measurements is fixed.\n-\tApproach 1-B. The set of TRPs (N’TRP) that provide measurements can change dynamically.\n-\tNote: for Approach 1, one model is provided to cover the entire evaluation area.\n-\tApproach 2: The TRP dimension of model input is equal to the number of TRPs (N’TRP) that provide measurements as model input. When N’TRP < NTRP, the remaining (NTRP - N’TRP) TRPs are ignored by the given model.\n-\tApproach 2-A. The set of active TRPs (N’TRP) that provide measurements is fixed.\n-\tFor both Approach 1-A and 2-A: one model can be provided to cover the entire evaluation area, which is equivalent to deploying N’TRP TRPs in the evaluation area for positioning if ignoring the potential inference from the remaining (18 - N’TRP) TRPs.\n-\tApproach 2-B: The set of active TRPs (N’TRP) that provide measurements can change dynamically.\n-\tFor Approach 2-B, one model is developed to handle various patterns of active TRPs.\n-\tFor Approach 2, if Nmodel (Nmodel >1) models are provided to cover the entire evaluation area, the total model complexity is the summation of the Nmodel models.\nIn the evaluation of AI/ML based positioning, if N’TRP<18, the set of N’TRP TRPs that provide measurements to model input of an AI/ML model are reported using the TRP indices shown in Figure 6.4.1-5.\nThe figure depicts a TRP layout and its indices for evaluating AI/ML-based positioning systems. The layout includes various components such as the TRP, TRP-1, TRP-2, TRP-3, TRP-4, TRP-5, TRP-6, TRP-7, TRP-8, TRP-9, TRP-10, TRP-11, TRP-12, TRP-13, TRP-14, TRP-15, TRP-16, TRP-17, TRP-18, TRP-19, TRP-20, TRP-21, TRP-22, TRP-23, TRP-24, TRP-25, TRP-26, TRP-27, TRP-28, TRP-29, TRP-30, TRP-31, TRP-32, TRP-33, TRP-34, TRP-35, TRP-36, TRP-37, TRP-38, TRP-39,\nFigure 6.4.1-5: TRP layout and their indices for the evaluation of AI/ML based positioning.\nFor the evaluation of AI/ML based positioning method, the measurement size and signalling overhead for the model input are reported.\nImpact from implementation imperfections is to be studied. Further, how AI/ML positioning accuracy is affected by user density/size of the training dataset is to be also studied. Note: details of user density/size of training dataset to be reported in the evaluation.\nModel input, model output:\nFor the model input used in evaluations of AI/ML based positioning, if time-domain channel impulse response (CIR) or power delay profile (PDP) is used as model input in the evaluation, companies report the input dimension NTRP * Nport * Nt, where NTRP is the number of TRPs, Nport is the number of transmit/receive antenna port pairs, Nt is the number of consecutive time domain samples. If N’t (N’t < Nt) samples with the strongest power are selected as model input, with remaining (Nt ‒ N’t) time domain samples set to zero, then companies report value N’t in addition to Nt. It is also assumed that timing info for the N’t samples need to be provided as model input.\nFor evaluation of AI/ML based positioning, when time domain samples are used as model input and sub-sampling is applied, the selection of N't measurements is based on the strongest power, unless explicitly stated otherwise. When sub-sampling is applied the N't measurement are not necessarily consecutive in time.\n-\tTraining dataset and test dataset use the same measurement selection method (e.g., strongest power) unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n-\tOther selection methodologies for N't measurements are also evaluated, and are not precluded.\nFor evaluations, companies used the following values for sampling period:\n-\t16 Sources used the following sampling period:\n-\tSampling period = 1/(Nf ×∆f). For FR1, sampling period = 1/(4096×30)=8.14 (ns), where Nf =4096 according to 38.211, and ∆f =30 kHz is the subcarrier spacing.\n-\t1 Source used: sampling period = 4.069 ns\nIf the model input is the CIR, then each input value of the CIR is a complex number, i.e., it contains two real values, either {real, imaginary} or {magnitude, phase}. If the model input is the PDP, then each input value of the PDP is a real value. Optionally companies can use delay profile (DP) as a type of information for model input. DP is a degenerated version of PDP, where the path power is not provided.\nNote: CIR and PDP may have different dimensions. Companies to provide details on their assumption on how PDP is constructed and how (if applicable) it is mapped to Nt samples.\nFor evaluation of AI/ML based positioning, when timing information is included in model input (e.g., in CIR/PDP/DP), training dataset and test dataset use the same timing format (i.e., both are absolute time, or both are relative time) unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nFor evaluation of AI/ML based positioning with multipath measurement for model input,\n-\tFor a given set of parameters (N'TRP, Nt, N't, Nport)\n-\tCIR has the largest measurement size, where CIR is composed of a list of measurements where each measurement contains the information of: (a) delay, (b) power and (c) phase.\n-\tPDP has smaller measurement size than CIR, where PDP is composed of a list of measurements where each measurement contains the information of: (a) delay and (b) power.\n-\tDP has the smallest measurement size, where DP is composed of a list of measurements where each measurement contains the information of: (a) delay.\n-\tFor each model input type (CIR, PDP, DP)\n-\tThe measurement size increases (approximately) linearly as N'TRP increases, where N'TRP is the number of active TRPs that provide measurements for the positioning.\n-\tThe measurement size increases (approximately) linearly as Nport increases, where Nport is the number of transmit/receive antenna port pairs that provide measurements for the positioning.\n-\tIf N't (N't < Nt) measurements are selected as model input, measurement size for model input increases (approximately) linearly with N't;\n-\tFor model input type CIR and PDP, if the full set of Nt measurements in time domain is used as model input, measurement size for model input increases (approximately) linearly with Nt;\n-\tNote: if DP is used as model input, DP does not use full set of Nt measurements in time domain (i.e., N't < Nt always).\n-\tNote: for Case 2b and 3b, measurement size of model input has impact to signalling overhead for model inference, data collection, and monitoring.\n-\tNote: There are trade-offs between measurement size / signalling overhead and positioning accuracy when using different sets of parameters (N'TRP, Nt, N't, Nport).\nFor both the direct AI/ML positioning and AI/ML assisted positioning, the model input is studied, considering the trade-off among model performance, model complexity and computational complexity:\n-\tThe type of information to use as model input. The candidates include at least: time-domain CIR, PDP.\n-\tThe dimension of model input in terms of NTRP, Nt, and Nt’.\n-\tNote: For the direct AI/ML positioning, model input size has impact to signalling overhead for model inference\nAt least for model inference of AI/ML assisted positioning, evaluate and report the AI/ML model output, including:\na)\tthe type of information (e.g., ToA, RSTD, AoD, AoA, LOS/NLOS indicator) to use as model output,\nb)\tsoft information vs hard information,\nc)\twhether the model output can reuse existing measurement report (e.g., NRPPa, LPP).\nLabels:\nThe performance impact from availability of the ground-truth labels (i.e., some training data may not have ground-truth labels) is to be studied. The learning algorithm (e.g., supervised learning, semi-supervised learning) is to be reported by participating companies and, when providing evaluation results, data labelling details need to be described, including:\n-\tMeaning of the label (e.g., UE coordinates; binary identifier of LOS/NLOS; ToA)\n-\tPercentage of training data without label, if incomplete labelling is considered in the evaluation\n-\tImperfection of the ground-truth labels, if any\nWhether, and if so how, an entity can be used to obtain ground-truth label and/or other training data is to be studied.\nFor direct AI/ML positioning, the impact of labelling error to positioning accuracy is studied considering:\n-\tThe ground-truth label error in each dimension of x-axis and y-axis can be modelled as a truncated Gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of L meters, with truncation of the distribution to the [-2*L, 2*L] range. Value L is up to sources.\nFor AI/ML assisted positioning with TOA as model output, study the impact of labelling error to TOA accuracy and/or positioning accuracy.\n-\tThe ground-truth label error of TOA is calculated based on location error.

Value m and n are up to sources.\n- \tm%=FN/NLOS is false negative rate of the training data label, where FN (False Negative) is the number of actual LOS links which are incorrectly labelled as NLOS, and NLOS is the total number of actual LOS links;\n-\tn%=FP/NNLOS is the false positive rate of the training data label, FP (False Positive) is the number of actual NLOS links which are incorrectly labelled as LOS, and NNLOS is the total number of actual NLOS links\n-\tCompanies consider at least hard-value LOS/NLOS indicator as model output.\nTraining dataset:\nSynthetic dataset generated according to the statistical channel models in TR 38.901 is used for model training, validation, and testing. The dataset is generated by a system level simulator based on 3GPP simulation methodology.\nAs a starting point, the training, validation and testing dataset are from the same large-scale and small-scale propagation parameters setting. Subsequent evaluations can study the performance when the training dataset and testing dataset are from different settings.\nDetails of the training dataset generation are to be reported, including:\n-\tThe size of training dataset, e.g., the total number of UEs in the evaluation area for generating training dataset;\n-\tThe distribution of UE location for generating the training dataset may be one of the following:\n-\tOption 1: grid distribution, i.e., one training data is collected at the center of one small square grid, where, for example, the width of the square grid can be 0.25/0.5/1.0 m.\n-\tOption 2: uniform distribution, i.e., the UE location is randomly and uniformly distributed in the evaluation area.\nSub-use case specific:\nFor AI/ML-assisted positioning, companies report which construction is applied in their evaluation:\na)\tSingle-TRP construction: the input of the ML model is the channel measurement between the target UE and a single TRP, and the output of the ML model is for the same pair of UE and TRP.\nb)\tMulti-TRP construction: the input of the ML model contains N sets of channel measurements between the target UE and N (N>1) TRPs, and the output of the ML model contains N sets of values, one for each of the N TRPs.\nNotes:\tFor a measurement (e.g., RSTD) which is a relative value between a given TRP and a reference TRP, the TRP in \"single-TRP\" and \"multi-TRP\" refers to the given TRP only. For single-TRP construction, companies report whether they consider same model for all TRPs or N different models for TRPs.\nWhen single-TRP construction is used for the AI/ML model, companies report at least the AI/ML complexity (Model complexity, Computation complexity) for N TRPs, which are used to determine the position of a target UE considering the various constructions in Table 6.4.1-2 below.\nTable 6.4.1-2: Model complexity and computational complexity to support N TRPs for a target UE\nNote:\tThe reported model complexity above is intended for inference and may not be directly applicable to complexity of other LCM aspects\nFor evaluation of AI/ML assisted positioning, the following intermediate performance metrics are used:\n-\tLOS classification accuracy, if the model output includes LOS/NLOS indicator of hard values, where the LOS/NLOS indicator is generated for a link between UE and TRP;\n-\tTiming estimation accuracy (expressed in meters), if the model output includes timing estimation (e.g., ToA, RSTD).\n-\tAngle estimation accuracy (in degrees), if the model output includes angle estimation (e.g., AoA, AoD).\n-\tCompanies provide info on how LOS classification accuracy and timing/angle estimation accuracy are estimated, if the ML output is a soft value that represents a probability distribution (e.g., probability of LOS, probability of timing, probability of angle, mean and variance of timing/angle, etc.)\nModel monitoring:\nFor AI/ML assisted approach, the performance of model monitoring metrics is studied at least where the metrics are obtained from inference accuracy of model output (i.e., label-based model monitoring methods). Further, the performance of label-free model monitoring methods, which do not require ground-truth label (or its approximation) for model monitoring, is to be studied.\nFor direct AI/ML positioning, the performance of model monitoring methods is studied, including:\n-\tLabel based methods, where ground-truth label (or its approximation) is provided for monitoring the accuracy of model output.\n-\tLabel-free methods, where model monitoring does not require ground-truth label (or its approximation).\nModel Fine-tuning:\nFor evaluation of the potential performance benefits of model finetuning, training dataset setting (e.g., training dataset size necessary for performing model finetuning) and horizontal positioning accuracy (in meters) before and after model finetuning, are to be reported.\nFor both direct and AI/ML assisted positioning methods, investigate at least the impact of the amount of fine-tuning data on the positioning accuracy of the fine-tuned model.

With TOA and/or LOS/NLOS indicator as model output, the estimated ground-truth label (i.e., TOA and/or LOS/NLOS indicator) is provided by the location estimation from the associated conventional positioning method. The associated conventional positioning method refers to the method which utilizes the AI/ML model output to determine target UE location.\nFor both direct AI/ML and AI/ML assisted positioning, evaluation results have been provided by sources to demonstrate the feasibility of label-free model monitoring methods.\nModel complexity and computational complexity\nFor AI/ML based positioning method, companies have submitted evaluation results to show that for their evaluated cases, for a given company’s model design, a lower complexity (model complexity and computational complexity) model can still achieve acceptable positioning accuracy (e.g., <1m), albeit degraded, when compared to a model with higher AI/ML complexity.\nIn Figure 6.4.2-1 below, the model inference complexity reported by companies for the positioning use case is shown, including (a) on the x-axis: model complexity in number of real parameters (millions) and (b) on the y-axis: computational complexity in FLOPs (millions). Figure 6.4.2-1 shows the range of complexity for the following schemes: (1) direct positioning; (2) assisted positioning with multi-TRP; (3) assisted positioning with single-TRP and one-model for N TRPs; and (4) assisted positioning with single-TRP and N models for N TRPs.

In addition, optimizing AI/ML complexity (i.e., model complexity and computational complexity) is out of scope of the study item.\nThe figure depicts a model complexity and computational complexity matrix for four AI/ML-based positioning schemes, illustrating the trade-offs between accuracy, computational resources, and computational complexity.\nFigure 6.4.2-1: Model complexity and computational complexity for four schemes of AI/ML based positioning.\nObservations:\nFor data collection of training dataset for AI/ML based positioning, for a given deployment scenario (e.g., InF-scenario, clutter parameter, drop) and with uniform UE distribution, the required sample density (e.g., #samples/m2) for achieving a given positioning accuracy target varies with AI/ML design choices including:\n-\tdifferent positioning approach (direct AI/ML, AI/ML-assisted),\n-\tdifferent type of model input,\n-\tthe size of model input,\n-\tAI/ML complexity (model complexity and computational complexity).\nFor AI/ML based positioning, the positioning accuracy is affected by the training dataset size for a given UE distribution area (or equivalently, sample density in #samples/m2), when the UE is distributed uniformly in training data collection.\n-\tThere exists a tradeoff between the training dataset size and the achievable positioning accuracy.

The following areas are investigated.\n-\tPerformance evaluation without generalization consideration, where the AI/ML model is trained and tested with dataset of the same deployment scenario.\no\tAI/ML vs RAT-dependent positioning methods. For the basic performance without generalization consideration, AI/ML based positioning can significantly improve the positioning accuracy compared to existing RAT-dependent positioning methods. For example, in InF-DH with clutter parameter setting {60%, 6m, 2m}, AI/ML based positioning can achieve horizontal positioning accuracy of <1m at CDF=90%, as compared to >15m for conventional positioning method.\no\tImpact of training data sample density (i.e., training dataset size for a given evaluation area). Evaluation with uniform UE distribution shows that, the larger the training dataset size (i.e., higher sample density), the smaller the positioning error (in meters), until a saturation point is reached where additional training data does not bring further improvement to the positioning accuracy.\n-\tAI/ML complexity. For a given company’s model design, in terms of model inference complexity (model complexity and computational complexity), a lower complexity model can still achieve acceptable positioning accuracy (e.g., <1m), albeit degraded, when compared to a higher complexity model.\n-\tGeneralization study. Evaluations are carried out to investigate various generalization aspects, where the AI/ML model is trained with dataset of one deployment scenario, while tested with dataset of a different deployment scenario. The generalization aspects include: different drops; different clutter parameters; different InF scenarios; network synchronization error; UE/gNB RX and TX timing error; SNR mismatch; channel estimation error; time varying changes.\nMethods are evaluated which have been shown to be able to handle generalization issues, including:\no\tBetter training dataset construction (i.e., mixed dataset), where the training dataset is composed of data from multiple deployment scenarios, which include data from the same deployment scenario as the test dataset.\no\tFine-tuning/re-training, where the model is re-trained/fine-tuned with a dataset from the same deployment scenario as the test dataset.

The horizontal positioning accuracy at CDF=90% is E meters.\n-\tModel input size reduction. Evaluations are carried out to examine various ways to change the model input size and its impact on positioning accuracy:\no\tDifferent measurement type, for example, CIR, PDP, DP.\no\tDifferent number of consecutive time domain samples, Nt.\no\tDifferent number of non-zero samples N't selected from the Nt consecutive time domain samples (N't < Nt).\no\tDifferent number of active TRPs, N'TRP.\nThe model input size for various measurement type (CIR, PDP, DP) and dimensions (N'TRP, Nt, N't, Nport) is analyzed. Evaluation results show that, model input of different measurement type and dimensions can have different reporting overhead and positioning accuracy.\n-\tFixed TRP pattern vs dynamic TRP pattern. Evaluation results show that, approaches supporting dynamic TRP pattern may be able to achieve comparable horizontal positioning accuracy as approaches supporting fixed TRP pattern, when other design parameters are held the same.\n-\tModel output of AI/ML assisted positioning. For AI/ML assisted positioning, evaluations are carried out where the model output includes timing information and/or LOS/NLOS indicator, in the format of hard- or soft- value.\n-\tNon-ideal label in the training dataset. Evaluations are carried out to show the impact of:\no\tLabel error, where the label in the training dataset is degraded from ground-truth label by an error.\n\tFor direct AI/ML positioning and AI/ML assisted positioning with timing information as model output, location error in each dimension of x-axis and y-axis is modelled as a truncated Gaussian distribution.\n\tFor AI/ML assisted positioning where the model output includes the LOS/NLOS indicator, random LOS/NLOS label error is applied.\no\tAbsent label, where some data samples in the training dataset do not have associated labels. Semi-supervised learning is evaluated for this case.\n-\tModel monitoring. Preliminary evaluation of model monitoring methods are provided by individual companies. The following methods are shown to be feasible:\no\tLabel based methods, where ground-truth label (or its approximation) is provided for monitoring the accuracy of model output.\no\tLabel-free methods, where model monitoring does not require ground-truth label (or its approximation).\nBased on RAN1 evaluations of AI/ML based positioning,\n-\tIt is beneficial to support both direct AI/ML and AI/ML assisted positioning approaches since they can significantly improve the positioning accuracy compared to existing RAT-dependent positioning methods in the evaluated indoor factory scenarios.\n-\tBoth UE-side model and NW-side model can significantly improve the positioning accuracy compared to existing RAT-dependent positioning methods.\n-\tIt is desired to apply methods to handle generalization aspects.\n-\tIt is desired to consider training data collection requirements.\n-\tIf AI/ML based positioning is considered for normative work, it is desired to further investigate model input design aspects: the model input type (e.g., CIR, PDP, DP), dimension (e.g., parameters N'TRP, Nt, N't, Nport) and related format (e.g., for the timing information: absolute time or relative time) considering the trade-off of positioning accuracy, signalling overhead, and AI/ML complexity.\n",

The procedures can at least be considered for UE-side models. From clause 4.2, these can include scenarios for which the management decision is taken by the network or by the UE. For network-side decision, this can be either network-initiated, or UE-initiated and requested to the network. While for UE-side decision, this can be either event-triggered as configured by the network and where the UE’s decision is reported to the network, or UE-autonomous, with or without UE’s decision being reported to the network.\nNote:\tThe mapping of these scenarios to specific use cases can be left to RAN1.\nNote:\tThe scenarios discussed below shall not imply support for all potential functionality and/or model Management Instructions (e.g., (de)activation, selection, switching, fallback, etc.) for every use case.\nNote:\tIn the figures below, Management Request/Management Instruction/Management Decision Report may include details about the model/functionality selection, (de)activation, switching or fallback.\n-\tDecision by the network\no\tNetwork-initiated\nThe figure depicts a network decision tree with two branches, one for network-initiated AI/ML management and another for network-initiated AI/ML management.

The figure includes a network decision tree, which outlines the steps involved in selecting an AI/ML solution, and a decision matrix, which shows the trade-offs between different AI/ML solutions. The figure also includes a visual representation of the AI/ML decision tree, which helps to understand the decision-making process.\nFigure 7.2.1.1-2: Network decision, UE-initiated AI/ML management\nThe case where the LCM decision is taken by the network but where the request is initiated by the UE is depicted in Figure 7.2.1.1-2.\nNote:\tThe Management Request may be a result of model/functionality monitoring at the UE.\nNote:\tIn response to the Management Request, the network may send a Management Instruction to the UE.\nNote:\tThe Management Request may include information about the model or functionality.\nNote:\tThe network may accept or reject the Management Request from the UE.\nNote:\tThe Management Request may include information related to model/functionality performance metrics.\nNote:\tThe Management Instruction may include information about the model or functionality.\n-\tDecision by the UE\no\tEvent-triggered as configured by the network, UE’s decision is reported to the network\n\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where an UE (User Equipment) makes a decision based on the event-triggered configuration of the network. The network is configured to trigger an event when a specific event occurs, such as a user's action or a change in the network state. This configuration allows the network to react to user behavior and ensure a smooth user experience.\nFigure 7.2.1.1-3: UE decision, event-triggered as configured by the network\nThe case where the LCM decision is taken by the UE according to prior network configuration is depicted in Figure 7.2.1.1-3.\nNote:\tUse case-specific events/conditions may be configured by the network for event-triggered AI/ML management at the UE.\nNote:\tUE may send a Management Decision Report to the network following event-triggered AI/ML management at the UE.\nNote: The Management Decision Report may include information about the model or functionality.\no\tUE-autonomous, UE’s decision is reported to the network\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario where an UE (User Equipment) is autonomous and makes decisions independently. The network is divided into two main layers: the core network and the distributed network. The core network consists of a base station (gNB) and a set of distributed nodes, while the distributed network consists of a set of optical line terminals (OLTs) and a set of distributed nodes. The figure illustrates the network architecture, highlighting the importance of redundancy paths and the use of SDN principles for network management.\nFigure 7.2.1.1-4: UE autonomous, decision reported to the network\nThe case where the LCM decision can autonomously be taken by the UE is depicted in Figure 7.2.1.1-4.\nNote:\tThe UE may be configured to send a Management Decision Report to the network upon performing a model/functionality Management Decision.\no\tUE-autonomous, UE’s decision is not reported to the network\nFor the case where the LCM decision can autonomously be taken by the UE and where the decision is not reported to the network, the AI/ML management is transparent from a network perspective.\nAccording to the functional framework in Figure 4.4-1, a model ID can be used within functions and for different data/information/instruction flows to identify an AI/ML model. For example, a model ID could eventually be associated to the selection/(de)activation/switching of a model or linked to the \"Model Transfer/Delivery\" information.\nRAN2 assumes that a model ID can be globally unique, e.g., allowing for proper model validation and model testing procedures.\nNote:\tHow to ensure model ID uniqueness is out of RAN2 scope.\nNote:\tDetails of model training, validation and testing are out of RAN2 scope.\nAdditionally, to manage or control AI/ML models, some meta information about the models may be needed.\nNote:\tDetails on the relationship between model IDs and meta information for purposes of model control and management can be addressed during a normative phase.\nData collection plays a crucial role in enabling the different use cases. Therefore, it is important to define the best approaches for collecting data to support UE-side and network-side model inference, monitoring, and training.\nTable 7.3.1.2-1 lists existing data collection mechanisms available in current RAN specifications for the UE to report measurements to another entity acting as termination point for this data. As highlighted in clause 4.2, the analysis/selection of the data collection frameworks should focus on the RRC CONNECTED state for both data generation and reporting. As such, the Table can provide useful insights into existing methods with respect to various categories identified as relevant for data collection method selection.\nTable 7.3.1.2-1. Existing data collection methods identified.\n\nA set of general data collection principles is expected to be considered for network-side model training. These include:\n-\tUE to support data logging,\n-\tUE to report the collected data periodically, event-based, and on-demand,\n-\tThe UE memory, processing power, energy consumption, signalling overhead should be considered.\nNote:\tThe above principles can be revised depending on RAN1 requirements.\nFurthermore, and regarding the use cases in this study, the following is considered.\nFor CSI and beam management use cases, the training of network-side models can consider both gNB and OAM-centric data collection mechanisms. The gNB-centric data collection implies that the gNB can configure the UE to initiate/terminate the data collection procedure. The potential impact of L3 signalling for the reporting of collected data should be assessed.\nOn the other hand, OAM-centric data collection implies that the OAM provides the configuration (via the gNB) needed for the UE to initiate/terminate the data collection procedure. MDT framework can be considered to achieve this. The potential impact on MDT for RRC_CONNECTED state should be assessed.\nFor positioning use cases, when considering LMF-side inference, it is assumed that the LPP protocol should be applied to the data collected by UE and terminated at LMF, while the NRPPa protocol should be applied to the data collected by gNB and terminated at LMF. While for LMF-side performance monitoring, it is assumed that the LPP protocol should be applied to the data collected by UE and terminated at LMF, while the NRPPa protocol should be applied to the data collected by gNB and terminated at LMF.\nNote:\tFor gNB- and OAM-centric data collection, there may be a need to consult with RAN3 and SA5 whether/how OAM is to be involved.\nNote:\tFor possible impacts due to positioning use cases, there may be a need to consult with RAN3 whether/how NRPPa is to be involved.\nThe following proposals were discussed in RAN2:\n1.\tUE collects and directly transfers training data to the Over-The-Top (OTT) server;\n1a)\tOTT (TRansparent)\n1b)\tOTT (non-TRansparent)\n2.\tUE collects training data and transfers it to Core Network. Core Network transfers the training data to the OTT server.\n3.\tUE collects training data and transfers it to OAM. OAM transfers the needed data to the OTT server.\nRAN2 did not study or analyse these proposals and did not agree to requirements or recommendations.\nWhether there is a need to consider standardised solutions for transferring/delivering AI/ML model(s) is unclear from the outcome of the present study. Nonetheless, to support AI/ML model transfer/delivery, the following solutions are considered:\n-\tSolution 1a: gNB can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE via RRC signalling.\n-\tSolution 2a: Core Network (except LMF) can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE via NAS signalling.\n-\tSolution 3a: LMF can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE via LPP signalling.\n-\tSolution 1b: gNB can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE via UP data.\n-\tSolution 2b: Core Network (except LMF) can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE via User Plane (UP) data.\n-\tSolution 3b: LMF can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE via UP data.\n-\tSolution 4a: OTT server can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE (e.g., transparent to 3GPP).\n-\tSolution 4b: OAM can transfer/deliver AI/ML model(s) to UE.\nNote:\tThe relationships between model transfer/delivery solutions and use cases can be derived from what is captured in clauses 7.3.2, 7.3.3, and 7.3.4.\nThe following areas are considered to evaluate the different model transfer/delivery solutions:\n-\tA1: Large, no upper limit model/model parameter size,\n-\tA2: Model transfer/delivery continuity (i.e., resume transmission of model (segments) across gNBs),\n-\tA3: Network controllability on model transfer/delivery (e.g., management decision at gNB),\n-\tA4: Model transfer/delivery QoS (for DRB) (including latency, etc.) and priority (for SRB).\nFor every model transfer/delivery solution, each of the above areas is analysed, focusing on the current status and gaps, and the potential impacts on RAN specification. The analysis is shown in the Tables below.\nTable 7.3.1.4-1 Analysis of current status and gaps, and potential \nRAN specification impact for Solution 1a\n\nTable 7.3.1.4-2 Analysis of current status and gaps, and potential \nRAN specification impact for Solutions 2a and 3a\nNote: \tNAS and LMF upper limits and potential impacts to NAS and LPP specifications have not been studied and feasibility on filling gaps is unknown.\nTable 7.3.1.4-3 Analysis of current status and gaps, and potential \nRAN specification impact for Solutions 1b\n\nTable 7.3.1.4-4 Analysis of current status and gaps, and potential \nRAN specification impact for Solutions 2b and 3b\n\nTable 7.3.1.4-5 Analysis of current status and gaps, and potential \nRAN specification impact for Solutions 4a\n\nTable 7.3.1.4-6 Analysis of current status and gaps, and potential \nRAN specification impact for Solutions 4b\nNote: \tFor Solution 4b, RAN2 discussed the following two solutions but did not study or analyse their feasibility:\n- OAM can transfer/deliver AI/ML models to UE via OAM→RAN→UE, where Control Plane (CP) signalling is used for RAN→UE.\n- OAM can transfer/deliver AI/ML models to UE via OAM→UE, e.g., via IP tunnel.\nA reactive and a proactive approach for initiating a model transfer/delivery can be considered in a normative phase. For the reactive approach, an AI/ML model is transferred/delivered (i.e., downloaded) to the UE when needed. This could typically happen due to changes in scenarios, configurations, sites, etc. While for the proactive model transfer/delivery approach, an AI/ML model is pre-download to the UE, and a model switch can typically be performed due to changes in scenarios, configurations, sites, etc.\nThe legacy UE capability framework serves as the baseline to report UE’s supported AI/ML-enabled Feature/FG. Therefore, for CSI and beam management use cases, this information is indicated in UE AS capability in RRC (e.g., UECapabilityEnquiry/UECapabilityInformation). While for positioning use cases, it is indicated by the positioning capability as defined in LPP.\nFurther discussions concerning UE capability details (e.g., granularity of Feature/FG, content, structure of the related UE capabilities, etc.) can be carried during a normative phase.\nAI/ML models for a given use case may be tailored towards and applicable to specific scenarios, locations, configuration, deployments, among other factors. In this regard, it is acknowledged that AI/ML models may undergo updates, such as model changes, as an inherent part of their development. Therefore, to ensure efficient network control and management, especially associated to what concerns the UE-side, UEs might have the ability to indicate relevant information about their supported AI/ML models and concerning AI/ML functionalities to the network. This can allow the network to perform decisions regarding, e.g., the (de)activation, or switching of AI/ML functionalities and AI/ML models.\nThe previously mentioned information could in principle be understood as \"applicability-related information\" in which the UE could, for example, report to the network conditions under which a model/functionality is applicable/suitable, or whether model(s)/functionality(es) are (non)applicable under the current context. Note, however, that the existing UE capability reporting framework cannot be used for such purposes.\nNote: \tHow and whether there is a need to enable UEs to report applicability-related information can be further discussed and defined in a normative phase. Mechanisms such as UE Assistance Information can eventually be used as example.\nTwo UE reporting types are identified to convey this additional information:\n-\t\"reactive\" reporting, and\n-\t\"proactive\" reporting.\nA reactive reporting would involve the UE to provide information to the network upon receiving an action from it.\nWhile a proactive reporting would involve the UE to provide information to the network without necessarily receiving an action from it. For example, the UE might proactively inform the RAN of updates/changes to its supported model(s) or functionality(es).\nNote: \tWhether necessary signalling from network is needed for proactive UE reporting can be discussed in a normative phase.\nNote: \tWhether there is a need for the network to report to the UE applicability-related information of AI/ML models and/or AI/ML functionalities can be discussed in a normative phase.\n",

If new procedures which legacy framework is not applicable to are introduced, additional core requirement framework can be discussed.\nLCM related tests should consider how the framework can address the possibility of updates/activation/deactivation /switching to the functionalities/models after the deployment of the devices in the field.\nReference block diagrams provide test modules/functionalities of TE/DUT and testing framework for different use cases. Both reference block diagrams for 1-sided model and 2-sided model are studied.\nFigure 7.3.2.3-1 provides the reference block diagram for 1-sided model. LCM in the figure includes functionality and/or model ID based LCM. The link between TE and DUT are physical and not logical. The logical link will depend on the functionality being tested. The scope of the figure includes both performance and potentially LCM tests. Offline training is assumed and some blocks may not be used in some of the tests. LCM may not be tested depending on the purpose of the test.\n\nFigure 7.3.2.3-1: Reference block diagram for 1-sided model\nFigure 7.3.2.3-2 provides the reference block diagram for 2-sided model. LCM in the figure includes functionality and/or model ID based LCM. The link between TE and DUT are physical and not logical. The logical link will depend on the functionality being tested. The scope of the figure includes both performance and potentially LCM tests. Offline training is assumed and some blocks may not be used in some of the tests. LCM may not be tested depending on the purpose of the test.\n\nFigure 7.3.2.3-2: Reference block diagram for 2-sided model\n(NOTE: At the current stage the framework in this session applies to CSI compression case.)\nIn order to determine the test encoder/decoder, the following issues are considered:\n-\tCommon assumptions for proposals of the test decoder / encoder (and the paired encoder/ decoder) for tester\n-\tThe need for and potential definition and derivation procedure of intermediate KPI for decoder evaluation and selection\n-\tData collection/generation for decoder evaluation, and the common assumptions/environment needed for data collection/generation\n-\tHow to minimize the impact of possible variations/differences in the test decoder/ test encoder design/implementation on UE/ gNB performance verification\n-\tThe impact of test decoder/ encoder for testing complexity to UE/gNB performance verification, and the advantage/disadvantage analysis of high/low complexity decoders.\nThe test decoder/encoder design should take into account complexity limitations based on e.g., feasibility of TE implementation and complexity levels considered feasible by network vendors/UE vendors for decoder/encoder deployment.\nThe choice of test decoder/encoder should aim as much as possible to avoid limiting the implementation choices, including e.g. complexity, back-bone model etc, of UE/gNB encoders/decoders operating in the field (this principle may not be fully achievable in practice).\nSpecification on the test may include some high-level parameters for the test decoder/encoder (e.g. parameters related to processing complexity, model structure, etc).\nFollowing the above principles, the considered options of test decoder are listed below\n-\tOption 1: DUT provides the decoder\n-\tOption 2: Infra vendor provides the decoder\n-\tOption 3: Full decoder specification in standard\n-\tOption 4: TE vendor provides the decoder\nOption 3 target is that a single decoder defined in the specifications for at least a single test for any DUTs.\nFor option 4, the following aspects should be considered\n-\tTE vendor should be able to develop the decoder based on the specifications\n-\tTest repeatability should be ensured (variation among TE vendor implementations should be bound)\n-\tOther vendors should also be able to develop such a decoder and which can deliver similar performance\n-\tInteroperability should be ensured based on the parameters that need to be specified\n-\tParameters that need to be specified are FFS\n-\tCandidate parameters/conditions that may be considered for defining test decoder include\n-\tTraining data set for TE decoder training\n-\tModel structure (Activation function is included in the model structure)\n-\tPerformance parameters for the TE decoder (e.g. cosine similarity, loss function, etc)\n-\tMaximum FLOPs allowed for the test decoder\n-\tMaximum number/size of model parameters\n-\tCompression ratio of decoder (output size/input size)\n-\tQuantization level\n-\tOther parameters are not precluded and to be further discussed.\n-\tNote: Feasibility of definition of parameters needs further investigated.\nOption 4 target is that a single decoder implemented by each TE vendor will be enough for at least a single test for any DUTs. TE vendor should be able to implement the test decoder for Option 4 without any involvement from another party. If this is found infeasible, another option in which TE vendors need to collaborate with DUT/infra vendors to implement the decoder could be considered.\nFurther clarifications and analysis of the four options of test decoder are included in Table 7.3.2.3-1. It is assumed that for Option 4 the TE vendors can implement the decoder just based on the specifications (no other party involved). The table would need to be revised if collaboration between TE vendor and DUT/infra vendor is needed.\nTable 7.3.2.3-1: Comparison of the four options of test decoder\n\nThe feasibility of any of the testing options has not concluded and more study is required. Other testing options are not precluded and different options might be required after RAN4 performs additional studies.\nDifferent generating methods of test dataset can be used for different tests. The following candidate methods are to be considered:\n-\tDataset based on TR 38.901, e.g. UMa channel, UMi channel, CDL channel, \"legacy approach\", etc.\n-\t\"Legacy approach\" refers legacy test in which a channel model is used\n-\tField dataset (data collected directly from field measurements)\n-\tTE generates dataset for test based on assumptions/parameters defined by RAN4 (e.g. by defining some rules/function to generate data)\n-\tOther methods are not precluded\nSome conditions and/or accuracy requirements for the training dataset or training data generation could only be introduced if the training procedure is defined in 3GPP specifications.\nThe necessity and feasibility of defining requirements or test to verify the generalization of AI/ML is studied.\nThe goals of generalization test are to verify whether the minimum level of performance of AI/ML functionality/model can be achieved/maintain under the identified scenarios and/or configurations, while the performance won’t be significantly degraded in other scenarios and/or configurations. The following aspects should be considered for generalization/scalability related testing:\n-\tdetails about the scenarios and/or configurations for test and the corresponding AI/ML models/functionality\n-\twhat the minimum level performance for each identified scenario and/or configuration is\n-\twhat the significant degradation for other scenarios and/or configurations is\nIt should also be considered that generalization and/or scalability related requirements for different scenarios/ configurations can be implicitly handled in the test case definition.\nAs for the handling of generalization tests, the following option is considered as baseline:\nSignalling based LCM procedures and performance monitoring are considered in dedicated test cases and are excluded in tests verifying generalization. RAN4 may define multiple tests with different conditions. In each of the test, TE configures the same specified UE configuration, and therefore the same specified UE configuration is tested under different conditions to verify its generalizability. (environment differs in each test but not changing dynamically during the test)\n-\tSpecified UE configuration includes functionality and/or model ID if defined\nThe practical processing capability and implementation complexity for device under test should be assumed when specifying RAN4 requirements.\n-\tThe UE capability may be needed to handle different complexity for one side and two-side models.\n-\tThe complexity of UE should also be studied when making assumption on gNB side model, and vice versa.\n",

            "description": "The following aspects have been studied for the general framework of AI/ML over air interface for one-sided models and two-sided models:\n-\tVarious Network-UE Collaboration Levels\n-\tFunctionality-based LCM and model-ID-based LCM\n-\tFunctionality/model selection, activation, deactivation, switching, fallback\n-\tFunctionality identification and model identification\n-\tData collection\n-\tPerformance monitoring\n-\tVarious model identification Types and their use cases\n-\tReporting of applicable functionalities/models\n-\tMethod(s) to ensure consistency between training and inference regarding NW-side additional conditions (if identified) for inference at UE\n-\tModel delivery/transfer and analysis of various model delivery/transfer Cases\nThe above studied aspects for General Framework can be considered for developing/specifying AI/ML use cases and common framework (if needed for some aspects) across AI/ML use cases.\nCSI feedback enhancement:\nCSI compression sub use case:\nThe performance benefit and potential specification impact were studied for AI/ML based CSI compression sub use case.\nEvaluation has been performed to assess AI/ML based CSI compression from various aspects, including performance gain over non-AI/ML benchmark, model input/output type, CSI feedback quantization methods, ground-truth CSI format, monitoring, generalization, training collaboration types, etc. Some aspects were studied but not fully investigated, including the options of CQI/RI calculation, the options of rank>1 solution.\nPerformance gain over baseline and computational complexity in FLOPs are summarized in clause 6.2.2.8.\nPotential specification impact on NW side/UE side data collection, dataset delivery, quantization alignment between CSI generation part at the UE and CSI reconstruction part at the NW, CSI report configuration, CSI report format, pairing information/procedure and monitoring approach were investigated but not all aspects were identified.\nThe pros and cons are analysed for each training collaboration types, and each training collaboration type has its own benefits and limitations in different aspects. The study has investigated the feasibility of the studied training collaboration types and necessity of corresponding potential RAN1 specification impact. However, not all aspects have been concluded.\nBoth NW side and UE side performance monitoring were studied, some but not all aspects were concluded.\nFrom RAN1 perspective, there is no consensus on the recommendation of CSI compression for normative work.\nAt least the following aspects are the reasons for the lack of RAN1 consensus on the recommendation of CSI compression for normative work:\n-\tTrade-off between performance and complexity/overhead.\n-\tIssues related to inter-vendor training collaboration.\nOther aspects that require further study/conclusion are captured in the summary above.\nCSI prediction sub use case:\nThe performance and potential specification impact were studied for AI/ML based UE side CSI prediction sub use case.\nEvaluations have been performed to assess AI/ML based CSI prediction from various aspects, including performance compared to baseline, model input/output type, generalization over UE speed, etc. Some aspects are studied but lack observations, including scalability over various configurations and generalization over other scenarios and approach of fine tuning. Performance monitoring accuracy has not been evaluated.\nPerformance compared with baseline is summarized in clause 6.2.2.8.\nPotential specification impact on data collection and performance monitoring are discussed in clause 7.2.2. Limited specification aspects were considered.\nFrom RAN1 perspective, there is no consensus on the recommendation of CSI prediction for normative work.\nThe reason for the lack of RAN1 consensus on the recommendation of CSI prediction for normative work:\n-\tLack of results on the performance gain over non-AI/ML based approach and associated complexity.\nOther aspects that require further study/conclusion are captured in the summary above.\nBeam management:\nThis study focuses on evaluation of potential benefits of AI/ML-based beam management and analysis of potential enhancements to enable AI/ML for beam management.\nDuring the study, BM-Case1 (Spatial-domain downlink beam prediction) and BM-Case2 (Temporal-domain downlink beam prediction), as described in clause 5.2, are selected as the representative sub use cases.\nEvaluation scenarios and KPIs are described in clause 6.3.1, and the detailed evaluation results from different sources and the key observations are captured in clause 6.3.2.  Evaluation results have shown that it is beneficial to enable AI/ML for beam management in the considered evaluation scenarios.\nThe necessity, feasibility, benefit and potential specification impacts of potential enhancements to enable AI/ML for beam management were studied from different aspects, and the outputs are captured in clause 7.\nFor AI-based beam management, from RAN1 perspective, at least the following are recommended for normative work:\n-\tBoth BM-Case1 and BM-Case2:\n-\tBM-Case1: Spatial-domain DL Tx beam prediction for Set A of beams based on measurement results of Set B of beams\n-\tBM-Case2: Temporal DL Tx beam prediction for Set A of beams based on the historic measurement results of Set B of beams\n-\tDL Tx beam prediction for both UE-sided model and NW-sided model\n-\tNecessary signalling/mechanism(s) to facilitate data collection, model inference, and performance monitoring for both UE-sided model and NW-sided model\n-\tSignalling/mechanism(s) to facilitate necessary LCM operations via 3GPP signalling for UE-sided model\nPositioning accuracy enhancements:\nThis study focused on the analysis of potential enhancements necessary to enable AI/ML for positioning accuracy enhancements with NR RAT-dependent positioning methods.\nEvaluation scenarios and KPIs were identified for system level analysis of AI/ML enabled RAT-dependent positioning techniques as described in clause 6.4.\nDirect AI/ML positioning and AI/ML assisted positioning were identified and selected as the representative sub-use cases. Evaluation results have shown that in considered evaluation scenarios (i.e., InF-DH, and other InF scenarios), both direct AI/ML positioning and AI/ML assisted can significantly improve the positioning accuracy compared to existing RAT-dependent positioning methods. Various aspects of AI/ML for positioning accuracy enhancement were investigated and evaluated as described in clause 6.4 that provides summary of evaluation results from different sources.\nBased on the conducted analysis, it is recommended to proceed with normative work for AI/ML based positioning.\nThe necessity, feasibility and potential enhancements to facilitate the support of AI/ML for positioning accuracy enhancements with NR RAT-dependent positioning methods were studied and the outcome are outlined in clause 7.\nIt is recommended to specify necessary measurement, signalling and procedure to facilitate training, inference, monitoring and/or other LCM operations for both direct AI/ML positioning and AI/ML assisted positioning, specifically:\n-\tspecify necessary signalling of data collection; investigate the necessity of other information for supporting data collection, and if needed, specify during normative work\n-\tinvestigate on the necessity and signalling details of measurement enhancements, and if needed, specify during normative work\n-\tinvestigate on the necessity and signalling details of monitoring method(s), and if needed, specify during normative work\nA variety of enhancements for measurements (e.g., based on extensions to current positioning measurements or with new measurements) were also identified as potentially beneficial (e.g., trade-off positioning accuracy requirement and signalling overhead) and are recommended to be investigated further and if needed, specified during normative work.\n\n\n",
