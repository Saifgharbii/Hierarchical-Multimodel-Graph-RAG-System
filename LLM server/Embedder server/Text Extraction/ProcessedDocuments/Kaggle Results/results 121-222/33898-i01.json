Some of assistance information could be user privacy sensitive, such as candidate FL members, geographical distribution information etc. In some cases a single piece of information alone would not be considered as privacy-sensitive, but the combination of that piece of information along with other seeming unrelated privacy data could potentially reveal user privacy There is a need to study how to protect such privacy-related assistance information. In addition, 5GC needs to determine which assistance information is required by AF to complete AI/ML operation and to avoid exposing information that is unnecessary for AI/ML operations.\nThis Key Issue is related to objective #2, and aims at studying what assistance information is related to user privacy, how 5GC protects these privacy-sensitive information, and how 5GC authorizes AF to access such assistance information.\n",

The UE privacy profile is stored in the UDM/UDR. For each UE, the UE privacy profile determines whether the specific AF can request or modify specific information of a specific UE. UE profile includes UE identity (e.g., SUPI, SUCI, IMPI, Application layer ID of UE, GPSI), expected service identifier, data type of target 5GC assistance information (e.g., location information), granularity of target 5GC assistance information type (e.g., TAI for location information), expiration time (expiration), authorization policies (e.g., specific UE related 5GC assistance information can be handled by a specific service.), protection policies (e.g., a specific UE related 5GC assistance information needs to be encrypted before sharing to AFs).\n1. AF sends 5GC assistance information request to the NEF/NWDAF. The request includes the AF identity (e.g., AF_ID, Application layer ID, FQDN), expected service identifier, data type of target 5GC assistance information (e.g., location information), details of target 5GC assistance information (e.g., TAI), target UE identity (e.g., IMPI, Application layer ID of UE, GPSI).\n2.

Exposing this data may cause different impact on network or user depending on the nature and purpose of the data. Some may be considered user privacy-sensitive, such as data analytics (e.g., QoS sustainable analytics) may help to determine sensitive information such as subscription location and exposing these data analytics to an unauthorized AF will cause serious privacy breach issue. Some of the data (e.g., NF load analytics) is related to the state of network, and attackers may use it to perform serious attacks, such as DoS attack or lead legitimate UE to believe the incorrect state of the network (e.g., network is busy when in fact it is not) on the network side. Some of the other data (e.g., RSRP) may not be related to security and privacy and exposing them may have little or no impact to the security of the network. Since the data exchanged among 5GC and AF are essential for 5GC to provide the necessary assistance for the application AI/ML operations and not all data requires the same type of protection, it is beneficial to categorize the different type of data so that the appropriate protection scheme can be applied.\nTable A.1 below lists various data based on the Solutions from TR 23.700-80 [3] among 5GC and AF from the perspective of privacy and security.\nTable A.1: Data used in AI/ML operations\n\n\n\n\n",
