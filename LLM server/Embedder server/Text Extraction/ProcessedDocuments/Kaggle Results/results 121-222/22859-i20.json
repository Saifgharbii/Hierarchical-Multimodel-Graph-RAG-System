            "description": "IoT capabilities have been designed for devices that communicate using the traditional cellular network, including battery constrained devices where it is expected that the battery should last in the order of years. Recently standards have been extended to support more vertical IoT devices for factory based, audio visual, medical, mission critical and vehicular solutions. In some contexts, e.g. factory based solutions the concept of a private network has been introduced, this has the added benefit for devices that generate very little user plane traffic (e.g. sensors etc.) the traditional cellular operator might not have to dedicate resources to them in the network and the traffic can stay within the local “factory (private network) environment”. There are 2 consumer segments that have similar traffic characteristics where private networks provide an advantage, where communications are predominately within the constraints of a localized IoT network:\ni)\tWearable devices;\nii)\tHome automation\nFor the purpose of this discussion these will be called “Personal IoT networks” (PINs). These types of networks are very different to commercial IoT device, they are usually less rugged, most highly battery constrained and lifespan of the battery typically a couple of days or weeks. User plane traffic typically stays with a constrained environment, around the body or in the home i.e. within the PIN. Notifications can be received on smartphones that events have occurred within the PIN.\nPINs have been around for a long time using others standards however their take up / adoption rate has been low compared to the general smartphone UE.\na)\t An example of a home automation PIN can be seen in Figure 4-1 where there are a number of devices in the home that either communicate directly with the hub or indirectly via a relay to the hub. A smartphone in the 5G system can receive notifications regarding events (e.g. door opens) from the home automation PIN.\nNOTE 1:\tThe diagram shows home automation but it could equally be a smart office environment, smart police or fire station etc.\nThe figure depicts a home automation PIN, which is a crucial component in the home automation system. It is used to access various smart home devices and control their functions. The PIN is typically a six-digit number that is entered into a keypad or a smart device to initiate the desired action. The figure shows the PIN in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for users to understand and use.\nFigure 4-1: Home automation PIN\nb)\tWearables can use a multitude of different access technologies, battery life can in some situations be severely constrained just by the physical dimension limitations e.g. glasses frames, earbuds, blood pressure monitor, pacemaker and rings. Space is also at a premium, capabilities are limited (memory, processing power, even USIM functionality might not be available). Location requirements on wearable devices, especially those with Uu interfaces can contribute to battery drain. Earbuds / Rings are very small, even an ESIM chip takes up valuable space, battery consumption and adds weight to the device. Figure 4-2 shows two wearable networks, one where all the devices communicate via the smartphone and another where glasses act as a relay for smart earbuds.\nThe figure depicts a series of wearable PINs, each with a unique design and function, designed to be worn on the body for secure access to a secure device. The PINs are equipped with a biometric sensor that can be used to verify the wearer's identity, ensuring a secure and convenient access method.\nFigure 4-2: Wearable PINs\nNOTE 2:\tThe diagram shows wearable networks as used today by consumers, a wearable network could also be employed in industrial, medical or even first responder situations.\nIn summary, it is considered beneficial for 3GPP specification to address 5G system support of different use cases for PINs.\n",

                            "text_content": "Houses, offices, light industrial have many opportunities to be automated, the traditional light bulbs, power sockets, thermostats, sprinkler systems, leak detection and the new smart appliances such as ovens, washing machines, faucets etc. can communicate with each other via a Personal IoT Network (PIN). These devices, to be known as PIN Elements, can have the following characteristics:\ni)\tsome have continuous power and others don’t;\nii)\tsome have strict latency requirements e.g. items that are part of an alarm system, while others provide delay tolerant data;\niii)\tsome need to perform an action so an individual sees an action as instantaneous (e.g. ask the voice assistance to turn the light bulb on and its appears instantaneous); and\niv)\tneed to perform an action but they don’t have strict latency requirements e.g. sprinklers need to come on but it doesn’t matter if its few seconds late.\nThe PIN Elements listed above and many others that are not listed above can communicate with hubs / gateways within the PIN where some control can take place at the gateway (e.g. thermostats and sprinkler controllers are usually self-contained within the PIN Element, whereas power sockets and light bulbs might communicate with a PIN Element that manages the PIN that control their actions). In addition, thermostats etc. can also communicate with these PIN Elements that manage the network known as PIN Element with Management Capability. Power sockets, light bulbs and switches can also act as relay type devices extending the coverage of the PIN.\nNOTE 1:\tA thermostat controller may have remote sensors that communicate with the thermostat. Effectively there can be a PIN within a PIN.\nIn case of the PIN Element that provides access to the 5GS, known as PIN Element with Gateway Capability (shown as a GW in Figure 5.1.1-1) these could be placed in one corner of the house.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PIN Element with Gateway Capability in this diagram also manages the PIN and also is a PIN Element with Management Capability.\nWhen planning a network in a house many houses suffer from problems of coverage due to the number of floors and other obstacles (i.e. walls, doors, columns, furniture), users will plan or configure their PIN Networks based on their needs and may install or move PIN Elements. When the PIN Element with Management Capability connects to a broadband (also acting as a PIN Element with Gateway Capability) network most houses have only one entry network point where the PIN Element with Gateway Capability can be installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1.1-1: inHome scenario\nFurthermore, with the use of millimetre waves there is the danger that the signal is blocked even by people while moving and alternative connection paths are needed. Therefore, enhanced \"fully meshed relays\" will play a key role in achieving extensive fault tolerant coverage in inHome scenarios. These fully meshed relays allow the resident of the home to position relays (PIN Elements) to create a network that is fault tolerant e.g. should a relay fail, devices such as those that detect motion or a door opening can still reach the PIN Element with Management Capabilities. Data is encrypted from the end device to the PIN Element with Management Capabilities.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is up to the home resident to plan their network accordingly so a single failure in the PIN does not stop a PIN Element communicating with any other PIN Element. The home resident is aware that certain types of devices can act as relays.\n",

Regarding devices and applications within the home we can categorize them in the following groups:\na)\tLighting, appliances, sockets and climate control: This is the traditional home automation and control network where continuous power is available to each PIN Element. These PIN Elements can act as fully mesh relays due to being continually powered. Their time to change state (e.g. light bulb from off to on) needs to occur within 200ms [4].\nb)\tSecurity Systems: This includes traditional security components such as motion detector, door / window sensors, automatic lock (PIN Elements). These items are battery powered, in case of door / window sensors it can be expected that the battery should last for 2+ years. Due to nature of these PIN Elements the delay to inform the PIN Element with Management Capabilities that an event has occurred needs to be 200ms [4]. Some devices will need to rely on mesh relays for routing their data. PIN Elements that are also critical to life and safety e.g. motion sensors, alarms, door locks, alarm systems etc can only been offline for seconds a week. Using an availability calculator [16] 99.999% equates to 1 second or less per day.\nPIN-user is aware that they need to plan their network (PIN) and walls, doors etc can present challenges to planning a network. Given PIN Elements can be moved the configuration of a network can change e.g. PIN Element A might have used PIN Element B and Element C as relays however PIN Element B is moved and thus the user who created the PIN needs the PIN Elements within the PIN to discover the network configuration/layout/plan has changed. A user can request the PIN to perform a network configuration/layout/plan test to see what PIN Elements can communicate with other PIN Elements with or without relays.\nPIN-user is aware which PIN Elements can act as a relay and which ones cannot.\nSome example dimensions of products PIN Elements are:\nI\tLight switch: 1.76 x 2.2 x4.1 inches (USA), 86 x 86 x 41 mm (EU);\nII\tPower outlet: 1.75 x 2.1 x 4.2 inches (USA), 86 x 86 x 50 mm (EU);\nIII\tMotion sensor: 18 x 71 x 19 mm, Battery ER14250;\nIV\tLight bulb: 3 x 4.9 x 3 inches (USA), 6.5 × 6.5 × 14 cm (EU).\nA PIN has at least one PIN Element with Management Capabilities. This PIN Element contains a list of PIN Elements that are in the PIN, what each PIN Element is allowed to do (act as a relay in the PIN, end device), if the PIN Element can be communicated with and what credentials they use to access the PIN. A PIN Device may be used to provision each PIN Element in the PIN Element that manages the PIN (PIN Element with Management Capabilities). The PIN Element with Management capability will need to know information about a PIN Element, some attributes could include:\n-\tUnique identifier for the PIN Element within that PIN;\n-\tApplication(s) (e.g. Application ID) hosted on the PIN Element;\n-\tPIN direct connections types supported by a PIN Element\n-\tMetadata associated with the application (e.g. event has occurred, type of event, timestamp etc);\n-\tSecurity credentials;\nApproximate no more than [500] bytes of data.\nPIN Elements use PIN direct connections to communicate with each other.\n",

                            "text_content": "Florence (PIN-User) has decided to build a home automation network (PIN) and has purchased a number of PIN devices i.e. some light bulbs, power sockets, a gateway that acts as a voice assistant and door / window sensors (these are known as PIN Elements). The instructions on the PIN Elements indicate that the PIN Device should be no more than 100m direct line of sight from the PIN device managing the PIN however this might be affected by walls, furniture etc. To improve connectivity some PIN Elements can help extend coverage of the PIN e.g. relays (PIN Relay). The light bulbs and power sockets indicate that these devices can help extend the coverage and that the purchaser should position them around their house / condominium so that devices that cannot communicate directly with the device acting as a gateway can use multiple relays if necessary. PIN relays can also be daisy chained together to greatly improve coverage. Florence provisions her PIN Elements into the PIN Element with Management Capabilities. Checking her APP she sees one of the PIN Elements, a door sensors, is offline. Florences moves a PIN Element that acts as a relay, smart light bulb, per instructions she does a “Network configuration check” and then opens and closes the door and sees in real time the door sensor reports the action. A while later, at 10am, her son turns the light switch off as he sees it in the wrong position. Later that day Florence sees the PIN Device, door sensor, offline again as a notification has been provided on her smartphone and finds out her son turned the light switch off at 10am. She decides to install a smart light switch near the door sensor to prevent that issue of the door sensor going offline from occurring again.\nFlorence speaks to the voice assistant to give it a command to change the state of the light bulb, the light bulbs turns on and off in real time. The door sensor reports when the door is opened and closed with notifications on her smartphone in real-time. Later Florence install a smart door lock on the door with the door sensor. The door lock created a secure connection with the PIN. When she activates the door to open using her app she notices it takes a second before the bolt moves.\nFigure 5.1.3.1-1 gives a pictorial view of the new configuration that Florence network can support where if a PIN Element fails communications can still take place via alternative route/path (see dotted blue lines). The diagram shows if the lightbulb is turned off communications can still take place via a power socket or light switch. It also shows Florence’s smartphone receiving a notification of the failures.\nFigure 5.1.3.1-1: light bulb failure (turned off)\nWhen Florence installs a new PIN Element into the PIN the instructions indicate that the PIN Element with Management Capabilities has to be within 2m so that the 2 PIN Elements can successfully communicate. After that a PIN Element may use a PIN Element that extends the PIN network coverage to successfully communicate with the PIN Element with Management Capabilities.\nWhen Florence first setup her PIN she had one device that was designated as a gateway UE. She is aware of the following capabilities of the gateway (it is in the instruction manual and available by the UI). Florence also configures one PIN Element to be able to adds subsequent PIN Element to the PIN by scanning in a QR or bar code from the PIN Element.\nNOTE 1:\tOther methods could be possible whereby Florence needs to type in information including encryption keys. This could be by the authorised PIN device (e.g. smartphone) or a UI etc. on the gateway.\nShe knows that the PIN Element that needs to be added has to be within communications range of the gateway device (i.e. no relay devices can be used yet) so that it can be provisioned into the PIN. Florence is aware that she can provision devices without the gateway UE being connected to the 5G network, but if the gateway UE is connected to the 5G network it will give her the option to:\na)\tallow her PIN to be more secure. In this situation the PIN Element vendor provides the credentials that need to be downloaded into the PIN Element with Gateway capability; and\nb)\tif a PIN Element, if it supports the capability, to have a better user experience e.g. security equipment, door locks have guaranteed real time operation. (e.g. using operator managed PIN direct connection).\nNOTE 2:\tb) requires credentials to be managed by Florence’s service provider.\nIn both a) and b) the PIN can function (continue to operate) when the PIN Element with Gateway capability has connectivity to Florence’s service provider or does not have connectivity. In the case of b) and operator managed PIN direct connection is used the PIN element has to be in coverage of Florence’s service provider.\nFeature, b), requires Florence to call her service provider to activate the capability. The service provider also provides a service that allows Florence to easily move a PIN Element from using one gateway to another gateway. Service provider services are flat rate or volume charged (e.g. data size, number times operation occurs).\nFlorence also has the option to allow which PIN Elements can interact with other PIN Elements via the UI of the PIN device that acts as a gateway.\n",

This allows for new service offerings to be offered to subscribers. One such offering is where PIN network owners, via user and or service provider authorisation can allow nomadic (guest) PIN Elements to use their PIN networks to reach a specific service in the cloud or in their own personal PIN. A small amount of bandwidth can be dedicated to this. One such offering can be found here [17].\nIn addition, the PIN network can contain multitude of devices, some using PIN direct connection’s that use operator managed spectrum and some that do not. Figure 5.1A.1-1 shows a possible guest PIN Element obtaining access via a PIN2. The user plane data is sent transparently (via a user plane pipe) from the guest PIN2 to a server in the cloud and then server communicates the user plane data to the smartphone (PIN Element) in PIN1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe contents of the user plane is outside the scope of 3GPP.\nThe figure depicts a 1A PIN element, which is a key component in a 10-pin PIN pad. It is designed to access a PIN, which is a security feature used to verify the identity of a user. The figure shows the PIN element with its pins, the 10-pin pad, and the PIN pad itself. The 1A PIN element is connected to the 10-pin pad, and the PIN pad is connected to the 10-pin pad, ensuring that the PIN element can access the PIN. The figure provides a clear and detailed representation of the 1A PIN element and its connection to the 10-pin pad, making it easy to understand the functionality of the device.\nFigure 5.1A.1-1.

The ProSe Communication path could use E-UTRA or WLAN. In the case of WLAN, only ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication (i.e. when ProSe assists with connection establishment management and service continuity) is considered part of ProSe Communication.\nThe network controls the use of E-UTRAN resources used for ProSe Communication for a ProSe-enabled UE served by E-UTRAN. The use of ProSe Communication must be authorised by the operator.\nAccording to operator policy a UE's communication path can be switched between an EPC Path and a ProSe Communication path and a UE can also have concurrent EPC and ProSe Communication paths.\nThese requirements make no reference to using non-3GPP RAT and licensed 3GPP RAT direct network connection at the same time, and hence do not cover aggregating, switching or splitting of data across.  The last sentence from 3GPP TS 22.278 [5] sub-clauses 7a illustrates that concurrent direct network connection and direct device connections are possible.\n3GPP TS 22.278 [5] \"Subject to operator policy and user consent the EPC and a ProSe-enabled UE shall be capable of negotiating the move of a traffic flow between the EPC Path and the ProSe-assisted WLAN direct path.\" Indicates that a UE can move traffic between an EPC Path and ProSe WLAN direct path however the use case in sub-clause 5.4.3 has no user plane traffic (i.e. movie) going to the network\n3GPP TS 22.278 [5] \"Both the HPLMN and VPLMN operators shall be able to charge for ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communications. \" however these requirements are written in the context of the network being involved and user plane traffic going to the network.\n",

These devices are usually behind a wireless gateway. In recent years, there are some security risks found in such settings due to port forwarding and unsecure connectivity provided by the wireless gateway for in home devices.\nWhen considering the gateway with 5G capability for accessing 5G services, , it is important to enable the support of the secure connectivity for allowing authorized users from anywhere in the world to access authorized services provided by these IoT devices or none-3GPP devices in terms of user authentication and authorization.\nThese IoT devices or non-3GPP devices acting as a PIN Elements can be smart plug, smart watch, smart pet collar, earbuds, VR goggle headset, etc. that usually are connected to the UE as a PIN Element with Gateway Capability via non-3GPP access, e.g. WLAN, Bluetooth®. When the UE moves, the PIN moves with the UE and its associated PIN Elements. These PIN Elements authorized to communicate with each other are regarded in a Personal IoT Network (PIN). There are other IoT devices, or non-3GPP devices usually stationary connected to the eRG using non-3GPP access (WLAN, wireline), e.g. media server, printer, smart thermostat, smart sprinkler, smart blinds, smart garage, etc. These IoT devices or non-3GPP devices authorized to communicate with each other directly or via the eRG are regarded in a Customer Premises Network (CPN).\nEditor's Note: this use case assumes that evolved residential gateway (eRG) defined in 3GPP TR 22.858 [6] can operate as a PIN Element with Gateway Capability, which needs further clarification between two studies. For example, in the home or office settings, the PIN Element (non-3GPP device) is stationary installed and can be media server, printer, smart thermostat, smart sprinkler, smart blinds, smart garage door, etc., which can connect to the eRG using non-3GPP access, e.g. WLAN, wireline.\nFigure 5.5.1-1 shows the scenarios of the 5G network enabling connectivity service support for the UE using direct network connection (case a) or direct device connection or PIN direct connection (case b and case c) to access services provided by PIN Element. Each PIN Element may provide one or more services. For example, the PIN Element is a smart watch, earbuds, VR goggles, media server, smart TV, smart video doorbell, etc., which provide one media service. For another example, the PIN Element is a NAS server which can provide multiple services, e.g. media service, web server service, live security cams services, etc.\nThe 5G network supports a User/UE accessing services provided by a PIN Element, with direct device connection (dash line) or direct network connection (solid line).\nFigure 5.5.1-1: 5G network support for a User/UE accessing services provided by PIN Element (dash line is direct device connection or PIN direct connection; solid line is direct network connection)\nIn Figure 5.5.1-1, a user using an authorized UE, e.g. smartphone or tablet, accesses the service A provided by an PIN Element which has connection with PIN Element with Gateway Capability via a non-3GPP access technologies, e.g. WLAN, Bluetooth®, etc.\nCase (a): the user/UE is out of Home and uses authorised service A provided by a PIN Element behind a PIN Element with Gateway Capability which relays traffic to and from 5G network. The PIN Element with Gateway Capability and the PIN Element connects to each other using direct device connection or PIN direct connection while the PIN Element with Gateway Capability connects to the 5G network using direct network connection.\nCase (b): the user/UE operating as a PIN Element is at home and uses authorised service A on the other PIN Element via PIN Element with Gateway Capability which supports relay communication between two PIN Elements. The UE and the PIN Element connect to PIN Element with Gateway Capability using direct device connection or PIN direct connections. One or more PIN Elements can connect to the PIN Element with Gateway Capability.\nCase (c): the user/UE operating as a PIN Element is at home and uses authorised service A directly provided by the PIN Element using direct device connection or PIN direct connection. If connecting to 5G network is required by the PIN Element, the UE can operate as a PIN Element with Gateway Capability to relay traffic to/from the PIN Element.\nTo avoid the potential security/privacy risks that invade the PIN Elements and services, it is important that the 5G network can enable supports of secure access to the PIN Elements and their services for authenticated and authorized users. According to 3GPP TS 22.101 [3] clause 26a, an \"User\" to be identified could be\n-\tan individual human user, using a UE with a certain subscription, or\n-\tan application running on or connecting via a UE, or\n-\ta device (\"thing\") behind a gateway UE.\nIn the context of PIN (personal IoT network), a \"User\" includes a service (\"application”) running on or connected via a PIN Element behind a PIN Element with Gateway Capability.\nThe following service aspects for IoT device and non-3GPP device as PIN Element connected to the 5G network via a PIN Element with Gateway Capability, needs to be considered:\n-\tUser Identity and user authentication;\n1.\tUser Identity of PIN Element or application running on PIN Element;\n2.\tThe authentication of User Identity or application running on the PIN Element;\n-\tAccess to PIN Element or its application running on the PIN Element;\n-\tUser Profiles and User Identifiers for PIN Element or its applications provided by an PIN Element;\n-\tUE policies in the home settings.\n",

                            "text_content": "Step1: [Users configuration]\nMr. Incruedible, signs in his account at operator’s network that provides 5G connectivity services for all UEs of his family. In his account, there are two listed subscriptions with gateway capabilities, including one smartphone , i.e. a UE as PIN Element with Gateway Capability, and one eRG. In Mr. Incruedible’s account, he can create Users with User Identities for family members, PIN Elements, and services provided by PIN Elements.\nFurther, for each service of the PIN Element behind a PIN Element with Gateway Capability, Mr. Incruedible configures User Profiles, e.g. via scanning the QR code of the PIN Element to get some information and editing details manually. For each service identified by a User Identity, it can have one or more User Profile(s) and each User Profile contains the following information:\n-\tUser Identifier\n-\tSpecific service settings and parameters, e.g. active/inactive time, number of accesses, etc.\n-\tAuthentication/authorization policy and access restriction policy required for the service, which are going to be used to authenticate/authorize a User for accessing to the PIN Element or application running on the PIN Element.\n-\tCredential information, e.g. password for the authorized service, security keys for encryption/decryption, and hash algorithm for message digital signing, etc.\nFor an authorized human user(s), its User Profile can indicate the authorized service identified by User Identity and allowed User Identifiers.\nStep2: [Registration of PIN Element and Update of User Profiles for services provided by the PIN Element]\n(2a): When an PIN Element is turned on, the PIN Element with Gateway Capability discovers and connects to the PIN Device at the first time, the PIN Element with gateway Capability determines if the PIN Element is an authorized User identified by a User Identity indicated in its UE configuration.\n(2b): The serving network of the PIN Element with gateway Capability authenticates User Identity of the PIN Element based on its credentials, and then updates User Profiles of the services provided by the PIN Element. In return, the network responds the PIN Element with gateway Capability with the authentication result and updated User Profiles of the registered services.\n(2c): The serving network of the PIN Element with gateway Capability further provides updated User Profiles of the services to 5G subscriber’s HPLMN. The HPLMN of PIN Element with gateway Capability updates its stored User Profiles of all impacted Users.\n(2d): Based on serving network’s policies, the serving network can update User Profiles of impacted Users and UE configuration towards PIN Element with gateway Capability.\nStep3: [User/UE at home or out of home accessing services provided by PIN devices]\nVioleta, Mr. Incruedible’s daughter as an authorized user (User) of the service provided by a PIN Element, would like to use the authorized UE to access a registered application-A of a PIN Element behind a PIN Element with gateway Capability. For example, the PIN Element is a smart garage door and Violeta would like to request the smart home application-A on the PIN Element to open the garage door for the delivery crew to put the package inside the garage. The communication method that connects her UE and the PIN Element is different based on the location of her UE as follows:\n-\tCase (a): When Violeta (User) using authorized UE is out of home, the 5G network connects the UE to the PIN Element behind the PIN Element with gateway Capability.\n-\tCase (b): When Violeta (User) using authorized UE is at home, the PIN Element with gateway Capability discovers and connects the UE acting as an PIN Element and using PIN direct connection or direct device connection based on stored UE policies or user preferences.\n-\tCase (c): When Violet (User) using authorized UE is at home, the UE acting as a gateway UE discovers and connects with PIN Device directly via a non-3GPP access technologies, e.g. Bluetooth, WiFi, or via 3GPP direct communication, instead of via indirect communication over 5RG, based on stored UE policies of the UE or user preferences.\n(3b): Based on stored User Profiles of the PIN Element with authorised Users, the PIN Element with gateway Capability can determine whether to accept access request of the PIN Element from the User/UE.\n(3c): The PIN Element with gateway Capability can further perform user authentication of the application-A based on the security polices and credentials in stored User Profiles of the application-A. If the application-A is configured to apply user authentication by the 5G system, the PIN Element with Gateway Capability requests user authentication for the application-A by the 5G system.\n(3d): The PIN Element with gateway Capability forwards the service access request to the PIN Element only if the user authentication is successful. Otherwise, the PIN Element with gateway Capability rejects the request for service access.\n(3e): The PIN Element with gateway Capabilitystarts to forward the traffic to/from the PIN Elements.\nStep4: [UE policies in the home settings]\nWhen the authorized User/UE moves from out of home, i.e. case (a), to in home, i.e. case (b) or case (c), the User can manually determine how the used UE adopts case(a)/case (b)/case(c), or UE can automatically adapt to case(a)/ case(b)/case (c) based on the UE policies, including the following information provisioned by the 5G network:\n-\tone or more operation modes (e.g. PIN Element, UE, PIN Element with gateway Capability);\n-\tcommunication methods (e.g. direction network connection, direct device connection, PIN direct connection);\n-\tlocation information.\n",

This PIN Element with Gateway Capability can host, or locally be connected to, significant compute and storage resources. , which can host an Application Server. An application on an Application Server can be either in the MNO domain (i.e. a trusted application) or external to the MNO domain (i.e. an authorized third-party application).\nAn AS can be useful to process sensitive data locally. Data generated by some PIN elements can be sensitive, it is therefore important to limit the scope of its dissemination (e.g. temperature and light readings can be used to know if there is someone at home). The AS can also be useful to perform latency sensitive processing. For games and office applications it can be beneficial to render a latency sensitive application locally. The AS can be accessed by local users located in the PIN network, or by remote users connected through the 5G network.\nThe AS can be hosted on a locally connected hardware hosting platform (e.g., a game console, an application server), and/or be embedded in a PIN Element with Gateway Capability (e.g., leveraging virtualization technology to host AS on the PIN element). While an AS can be a standalone service, it can also be an on-site extension of an in-network service hosted on a hosting environment such as an edge computing platform. In this case, the service operator (e.g., a MEC server operator), can influence discovering/authorizing/orchestrating an AS. The AS can be under the control of a 5G network operator, a customer or an authorized third party.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an UE (User Equipment) is accessing a PIN application hosted by a PIN Element with Gateway Capability. The PIN Element is equipped with a Gateway Capability, allowing the UE to connect to the application. The figure illustrates the communication path between the UE and the application, with the PIN Element acting as the intermediary.\nFigure 5.6.1-1.

CTG receives notification that 2 tourists are ready for a tour.\nQTG and CTG take their respective tourists to the 1st sight of a clay warrior. It is very busy at the exhibit with lots of tourists and other tour guides giving their tours. QTG, and CTG give basically the same tour. At this exhibit they provide a verbal description of the clay figure, provide some pictures of the clay figure being excavated and small video clip from the farmer who discovered the clay figure. As Peng, Adrian and Pan listen it is just like standing next to the tour guide with no other tourists, the audio quality is superb. As the pictures are displayed on the smartglasses with some audio description the video then starts to play and can be seen on the smartglasses. Suddenly Pan receives a notification on the glass’s and less pounced notification tone of a WeChat group message, it is from their manager Fei who wants to talk to Pan and Peng. Peng does not get the notification as he has opted not to be disturbed. Adrian has no other service apart from the tour. Pan receives a messenger application call from Fei, the audio from the video display is muted and the messenger application is received from the smartphone UE. Pan walks into a huge metal structure, as Pan is on the messenger application call all of the sudden the call stops. Pan looks at his phone and notices that there is no cellular service.\nWhile Peng, Adrian and Pan were having their tour Poppet and Pongo were receiving the same type of tour from CTG. Poppet and Pongo's audio quality was not as good as Peng and Pan’s, and when the video stream was playing at times the sound would be lost or a video frame corrupted. The problems seemed to get worse when there were more people around, especially when it got very crowded.\nLater that week QTG receives a bill from service provider C indicating that 3 tourists used the service for time Y and consumed Z bytes of data.\n",

The user wants to be able to use the service via both the home network (e.g. Wi-Fi) as well as via the public network.\nSeveral services make extensive use of broadcast messages, e.g. smart home systems. The status or discovery-like messages in e.g. UPnP/DNLA, Bonjour and other protocols are broadcast to all 'participating' IoT devices in the network. This is less of a problem when the service is used in a home network (e.g. via LAN) only. However, when the PIN is used outside the home network via a public network (e.g. smartphone joins the PIN via the 3GPP Network), the phone still receives all broadcast messages. This can cause increased messaging to the UE, while these messages are not always relevant to the user.\nThe user should have the choice to receive discovery and status messages on demand, or filtered (e.g. only when there is a status change) when using the service via the public network.\nFurthermore, the 5G system needs to ensure that the service discovery messages are authentic and sent in sufficiently low numbers as to be not present an obstacle to useful transmissions within the PIN.\n",

One way this could be achieved until now is that people buy for example a smartwatch or step counter themselves, pair it to their phone, and download an application to their phone to monitor some of their health data. As the requirements for these devices are getting more demanding, requiring to monitor additional physiological data with higher accuracy and improved reliability, and moving towards cloud/edge based analysis of these streams of data, also the requirements on the underlying network connections and manageability of these devices gets more demanding. It also should be made as easy as possible for the user to be able to connect and manage these networked health devices.\nIn this use case, Fred has been feeling exhausted in the last weeks and went to his general practitioner for a check up. The general practitioner performed a thorough exam and told Fred that he is quite worried about his health, given that his blood pressure is way too high, his cholesterol is at alarming levels, and that he has initial signs of diabetes and heart problems. If Fred continues like this, he has a serious chance of heart failure or ending up in the hospital. Next to some medicines, his general practitioner subscribes him to a new program offered by his insurance company in cooperation with a health provider to monitor Fred’s health. This new program includes a 24/7 wearable monitoring device combined with a cloud service operated by the health provider for early detection and warning of heart arrhythmia and heart failure and hypertension. The device will be sent to Fred’s home in a few days.\n",

                            "text_content": "The personal health monitoring devices are PIN Elements that are designed to provide patient data to the doctor’s servers via the 5G network through a gateway UE. The devices belong to doctors and/or hospitals, who are the owners of the devices, and are configured to use both cellular access networks as well as wifi networks. The devices are configured by the doctor’s office or hospital with credentials belonging to the doctor or hospital to enable communications over the cellular network. Since the devices may be re-used for different patients at different times, the credentials must be offboarded and onboarded properly to ensure the collected data is associated with the correct patient. The devices can also use PIN direct connection to communicate with other PIN Elements in the network.\nJohn has recently suffered from a heart attack and is recovering from treatments in a hospital. Before John is discharged, his cardiologist provides a heart rate monitoring device that he can use so the doctor can monitor his heart rate while doing light exercises at home. While at the hospital, the staff shows John how to associate the device with his smartphone so the device can send data to the doctor’s office server through the smartphone using the cellular network. John needs to also participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program at a local clinic where nurses can monitor his heart rate when he participates in a medically supervised exercise program. He attends the clinic 3 days a week and for other days of the week, John is encouraged to exercise lightly at home. While at the clinic, the heart rate data is shared with the clinic, which is reported back to John’s doctor. He uses the heart rate monitoring device provided by his doctor to record his heart rate while exercising at home and also when he is resting. However, John needs to be careful to maintain his heart rate within a safe range as to not overextend his heart and trigger another heart attack. To ensure the data can still be sent to the doctor’s office in case there is an issue with John’s smartphone, John also associate the device with his spouse’s smartphone. This would provide redundancy for when John is walking outside.\nJohn also suffers from diabetes and his endocrinologist has provided him with a glucose monitoring device. The glucose monitoring device is a PIN Element that is configured with credentials belonging to his endocrinologist so that measurements from the device can be sent to the endocrinologist’s servers via the 5G network. Similar to the heart rate monitoring device, credentials must be offboarded and onboarded to ensure the collected data is associated with the correct patient. John needs to measure his glucose levels before and after each meal and sometimes on-demand if requested by his endocrinologist or when John experiences unusual symptoms. John needs to maintain his blood sugar level above a certain level to avoid experiencing hypoglycemia symptoms such as dizziness, trembling, weakness, seizures, or even loss of consciousness.\nSince both the heart monitoring device and the glucose monitoring device may provide measurements that indicate a life-threatening situation, the devices are configured to provide redundant access to the 5G network to ensure John’s doctors are notified in case the measurements are beyond safe levels. The devices are configured to be able to connect to multiple gateway UEs to provide concurrent access for the devices to send measurements to his doctors in case of emergency. The devices can connect to and send measurements through both John’s smartphone and his spouse’s smartphone in addition to connecting to and sending measurements through his home network.\nWhen John visits his daughter’s house, he brings both the heart rate monitoring device and the glucose monitoring device so he can continue to provide measurements to both his doctors. The PIN Elements may communicate concurrently to the gateway UE at his daughter’s house (if one is available) John’s smartphone, and his daughter’s smartphone if an emergency arises. Either way, the data traffic sent from each device is charged to the respective doctor’s. servers (PIN Elements).\nNOTE:\tThe sensor measurements (heart rate, sugar levels etc) could be sent over multiple connections at the same time or the sensor is informed that connectivity is unavailable by one route and chooses an alternative route. The mechanism would be dependent on how life threatening the lack of communicating information is.\n",

With the deployment of PIN and the support of the Mobile operators to use this as a new added value service, authorized mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, CPEs can be also used as a PIN gateway to dynamically create and manage an on-demand temporary PIN. This on-demand PIN will not only provides connectivity to the devices in the proximity, but also provides more flexibility and authority to the PIN-user to manage the PIN, such as to decide which devices to be connected into this PIN; to manage the service and the traffic within the PIN, so on.\nThe PIN uses licensed spectrum as well as unlicensed spectrum, Therefore, the creation and management of this type of on-demand PIN requires the authorization and supervision from the PLMN that owns the license spectrum. The PLMN can offer this new on-demand PIN service in certain constrained locations for authorized users with authorized devices. Although the on-demand PIN is provided and controlled by the PLMN, the authorized user of the on-demand PIN can have certain flexibility to manage this PIN, such as to decide when to create and terminate the PIN, coordinate with PLMN to authorize the devices to be allowed to access this PIN, manage the services being allowed in this PIN, so on.\n",

Collectively operator M calls this “PIN Functionality”\nNOTE:\tThese variety of access technologies are supported as avid game players usually have a variety of new and old devices they want to use.\nThe 5G home access router also stores games meta data that can be uploaded Operator’s M network so that the game can be played later on other PIN element(s) or the same 5G home access router at different location.\nToday is the game night, Tom invites his friend Mike, James and Howard to his house to try the new air-combat video game that he just bought recently.

This 5G router sends on-demand PIN creation authentication and authorization request to Operator M, for creating a PIN in this device for 4 hours in his house using mmWave spectrum owned by M. Per the subscription Tom bought, the maximum number of devices to be allowed in this PIN is 10, and tonight he only requires 8 devices. Because the on-demand PIN subscription which Tom bought is the basic and only allows local traffic, it means that guest devices in this PIN will not be able to access services outside the PIN. The PIN subscription also has other restrictions, such as the PIN only allowed operating in Tom’s house and for maximum 10 hours for each time the PIN being created.\nNOTE:\tBasic+ is the same as Basic subscription but allows devices, if supported, to use operators managed spectrum. Tom upgraded tonight because in the past when Mike and others came over and they just used non 3GPP access technologies sometimes there was too much delay and parts of games became unplayable.\n2\tAfter being authorized by M, this 5G home access router is reconfigured by PLMN remotely, which may include getting some necessary functions downloaded from M, to be able to act as PIN gateway.\n3\tWhen the 5G home access router is ready, it starts to use and broadcast its own PIN network ID which can be assigned by M or named by Tom depended on the M’s policy.\n4\tMike and James have connected to Tom’s game night PIN before on other game nights, so their devices automatically discover and connect their 5G home access router and VR glasses to this PIN after being authenticated & authorized via Tom’s 5G home access router. It’s Howard first time to use the PIN, and since he has no subscription of M, he has to manually select and connect his game console to “game night” PIN using WLAN.\n5\tAn local game server is created and hosted in the 5G router after the PIN is up, so everyone’s game consoles can be connected to that local game server for playing locally. Before coming to Tom’s house, James played the game at his home and his game console was connected to the game server hosted in the PLMN’s cloud. After being connected to “game night” PIN, James’s connection with the game server is relocated to the local game service in the “game night” PIN. Within this PIN, Tom, Mike, James’s game consoles and VR glasses can communicate with each other using direct device communication with the26Ghz spectrum, while their consoles communicate with the local game server via Tom’s 5G home access router. Howard’s console can communicate with others’ consoles and the local game server via the connection to Tom’s 5G Home access router using WLAN.\n6\tTom’s 5G home access router monitors and controls the communication of those devices in “game night” PIN based on the policy from M, also may coordinate with M for some necessary network managements, such as interference management.\n7\tAll the gaming content being exchanged between these players is conveyed locally, only the game status information can be conveyed back to the central game server in the cloud via the local game function in Tom’s 5G home access router.\n8\tBecause the PIN is created for only 4 hours, the service and connections associated with PIN elements as well as operators 5GC are configured accordingly to the lifetime of the PIN, to avoid sudden service disruption when the PIN has ended after time life expires.\n9.\tTom and Mike are one team to against the team of James and Howard in the game. Tom and Mike establish an encrypted communication between their game consoles to exchanges some private information (e.g. screen shots, game maps, private chat, voice etc), while another secured communication between James and Howard’s devices is also created.\n",

                            "text_content": "Hummel is a 70-year-old cardiac patient who is equipped with a pacemaker at the TeleCare hospital, who have their own 5G network. During the recent remote intervention, the doctors decided that he must admit himself for a surgery to replace the batteries of his pacemaker. In order to monitor the health of his heart continuously, Hummel has received a 5G enabled wearable heart monitor from another hospital, which is capable of continuously monitoring the vitals including the heartrate and send its data via a 5G network to a cloud server. He also has other personal connected health devices such as an SpO2 monitor and a connected insulin pump attached to his body that are wirelessly connected to his mobile phone for complete overview of his health. He also has a special sleep mask enabling him to breathe better during his sleep and monitor the quality of his sleep that is also connected to his mobile phone when he is using it. It is assumed that all his health devices are clinically qualified to be used for diagnosis in a hospital.\nUpon arriving at the hospital reception, Hummel is immediately directed to the cardiology department, where a 5G enabled smart hospital bed is allocated for him. The smart hospital bed is configured as a PIN element with gateway capability and with management capability. The smart hospital bed enables personal devices of the patient to be connected to the 5G network of the hospital. It also allows some of the PIN elements connected to the hospital bed, such as some controls over the elevation of the head of the bed and a personal screen connected to the bed (e.g. to watch TV or to stream some video content to watch). The hospital bed is also connected to a high-end patient monitor, located behind the patient. Although it cannot be controlled by the patient, the output of the monitor can be displayed and browsed by the patient on his mobile phone or the attached personal screen.\nUpon reaching the smart hospital bed, the devices that are carried and worn by Hummel and the hospital bed (with its connected PIN elements) can discover each other, and together form a PIN. Via the smart hospital bed, the necessary credentials to securely communicate with each other, and to connect to the hospital 5G network are downloaded and configured in Hummel’s devices. The data from Hummel’s health devices can now be sent to the TeleCare’s 5G network, where it can be processed and used for health monitoring by the hospital staff. The high-end patient monitor linked to the smart hospital bed can receive the data from Hummel’s devices directly from the devices and generate an alarm if Hummel’s condition deteriorates. Using the PIN, Hummel can also control the elevation of his bed via his mobile phone and stream some videos from his mobile phone on the screen connected to the bed, and browse the output of the patient monitor.\n",

It also shows the list of connected PIN elements connected to the hospital bed.\n-\tHummel can connect his mobile phone to the smart hospital bed and upon connecting, Hummel’s mobile phone gets added to the hospital’s bed PIN. Also the personal devices that are connected to Hummel’s mobile phone can be discovered by the hospital bed and added to the hospital bed’s PIN. Hummel can decide which personal devices can be discovered and added to the hospital bed’s PIN.  Similarly, the IT department of the hospital can decide which devices of the hospital bed’s PIN can be discovered by Hummel’s mobile phone and/or other UEs outside the PIN.\n-\tOn the screen of the mobile phone (or the screen attached to the hospital bed), it also shows that the 5G PIN enabled wearable heart monitor in the list of discovered PIN elements. Hummel presses a button to also add that device to the hospital bed’s PIN.\n-\tAfter exchange of credentials, the PIN elements can now securely communicate between each other. This allows Hummel to use the screen attached to the bed for streaming some videos from his mobile phone, allows the data from his heart monitor to be received by the high-end patient monitor, and show the patient monitor’s data on his mobile phone.\n-\tAs part of the PIN configuration, the PIN elements are also allowed to gain patient access to the hospital network (via the hospital bed’s PIN gateway capability). On the screen of his mobile phone (or the screen attached to the hospital bed), Hummel allows his wearable heart monitor and his other connected health devices to send their data to the hospital network.\n-\tThe data from the connected devices are useful in improving the pre-surgical preparation of Hummel and saves operational overhead for the hospital staffs.\n-\tThanks to the PIN feature, Hummel had an easy transfer to the hospital and had a fairly comfortable experience (despite his condition) in his smart hospital bed.\n",

The figure highlights the importance of proper network planning and design to ensure efficient and reliable connectivity.\nFigure A2-1: Examples PIN direct connectivity in a PIN\nFigure A2-1 shows PIN Elements that communicate directly, without any relay elements to another PIN Element, this is collectively known as PIN direct connection. PIN direct connection can encompass different types of direct connection as show in Figure A2-1:\na)\tDoor sensor (a device PIN Element) uses PIN direct connection (e.g. WLAN) to communicate with a light bulb (e.g. door opens and the light turns on).\nb)\tMotion sensor (UE PIN Element) uses PIN direct connection in licensed spectrum to communicate with the light bulb (e.g. motion is detected in the room and the light bulb turns on).\nNOTE\tPIN direct connection in 3GPP licensed spectrum is direct device connection as defined in TS 22.261 [2].\nc)\tThe key uses PIN direct connection in non licensed spectrum to communicate with the door lock (e.g. key opens the door).\nd)\tThe smart plug (UE PIN Element) uses PIN direct connection in licensed spectrum to communicate with the smartphone (e.g. notification that it is using 60 watts of energy).\n",
