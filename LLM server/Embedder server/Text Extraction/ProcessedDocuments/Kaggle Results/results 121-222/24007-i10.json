            "description": "The present document defines the principal architecture of layer 3 and its sublayers on the GSM Um interface, i.e. the interface between Mobile Station (MS) and network; for the CM sublayer, the description is restricted to paradigmatic examples, call control, supplementary services, and short message services for non-GPRS services. It also defines the basic message format and error handling applied by the layer 3 protocols.\nFor CTS services, the present document defines the principal architecture of layer 3 on the GSM Um* interface, i.e. the interface between a CTS capable Mobile Station (CTS-MS) and a Fixed Part (FP).\nThe corresponding protocols are defined in other Technical Specifications, see clause 4.3.4.\nFor non-GPRS services the communication between sublayers and adjacent layers and the services provided by the sublayers are distributed by use of abstract service primitives. But only externally observable behaviour resulting from the description is normatively prescribed by the present document.\nFor GPRS services in addition the local information transfer and stimuli sent between sublayers is informatively included within Annex C of in the present document.\nThis document also defines the principal architecture of the EPS NAS and 5GS NAS layer 3 protocol and their sublayers, including the message format applied by layer 3.\nIn the present document MS is also used as a synonym for UE.\nDescriptions in clauses 6 to 10 are not maintained actively.\n",

                    "text_content": "Five models are defined for Layer 3, one model for non-GPRS services, one for GPRS services supporting Class C MSs only, one model for GPRS-services supporting Class A and Class B MSs, one model for EPS services and one model for 5GS services over either 3GPP access or over non-3GPP access. (The third model is a combination of the first two models listed). In the present document GPRS services and EPS services will be used as synonyms.\nThe layer 3 for non-GPRS services provides the functions necessary:\n-\tfor Radio Resource (RR) management;\n-\tfor Mobility Management (MM); and\n-\tfor the Connection Management (CM) functions, i.e. functions for the control, provision, and support of services offered by the network; among which there are, e.g.:\n-\tthe functions to establish, maintain and terminate circuit-switched connections across a GSM PLMN and other networks to which the GSM PLMN is connected;\n-\tsupporting functions for supplementary services control;\n-\tsupporting functions for short messages service control;\n-\tsupporting functions for location services control (only for a type A LMU).\nThe layer 3 for non-GPRS services is composed of three sublayers comprising:\n-\tthe Radio Resource Management (RR) functions;\n-\tthe Mobility Management (MM) functions; and\n-\tthe Connection Management (CM) functions.\nWhen CTS services are added to non-GPRS services, the following functions are added:\n-\tCTS Radio Resource Management (CTS-RR) functions to RR; and\n-\tCTS Mobility Management (CTS-MM) functions to MM.\nThe layer 3 for GPRS services is composed of four sublayers comprising:\n-\tthe Radio Resource Management (RR) functions;\n-\tthe Mobility Management (GMM);\n-\tfor the Logical Link Control (LLC);\n-\tthe Connection Management (CM) functions.\nThe Connection Management (CM) sublayer is composed of functional blocks for:\n-\tCall Control (CC) for non-GPRS services;\n-\tShort Message Service Support (SMS) for non-GPRS services;\n-\tGPRS Short Message Service Support (GSMS) (for GPRS services supporting Class A, B and C MSs);\n-\tSession Management (SM) (for GPRS services supporting Class A, B and C MSs);\n-\tSupplementary Services Support (SS) for non-GPRS services;\n-\tGroup Call Control for non-GPRS services;\n-\tBroadcast Call Control (BCC) for non-GPRS services;\n-\tConnection Management of Packet Data on Signalling channels for non-GPRS services;\n-\tLocation Services support (LCS) for non-GPRS services (only for a type A LMU).\nWithin the context of LCS, for GSM LCS, the services defined for an MS are equally applicable to a type A LMU, unless otherwise stated. However, services defined specifically for a type A LMU are not applicable to an MS. The following is a list of services essential for a type A LMU.\nThe layer 3 for non-GPRS services provides the functions necessary:\n-\tfor Radio Resource (RR) management;\n-\tfor Mobility Management (MM); and\n-\tsupporting functions for location service control.\nThe layer 3 for non-GPRS services is composed of three sublayers comprising:\n-\tthe Radio Resource Management (RR) functions;\n-\tthe Mobility Management (MM) functions; and\n-\tthe Connection Management (CM) functions.\nThe Connection Management (CM) sublayer is composed of a functional block for:\n-\tlocation services support (LCS) for non-GPRS services.\nThe present document does not consider the distribution of signalling functions among the different network equipments. The signalling functions are described between two systems which represent the MS side and the network side of the radio interface of layer 3. Only the functions in the network for signalling communication with one MS is considered.\nFor GPRS services, in addition to the signalling functions also the user data transfer is included in the present document.\nThe layer 3 for EPS services is composed of three sublayers comprising:\n-\tthe EPS Radio Resource Management (RR) functions;\n-\tthe EPS Mobility Management (EMM) functions; and\n-\tthe Connection Management (CM) functions.\nThe Connection Management (CM) sublayer is composed of a functional block for:\n-\tthe EPS Session Management (ESM) functions.\nThe layer 3 for 5GS services is composed of three sublayers comprising:\n-\tthe 5GS radio resource management (5GRR) functions for NAS over 3GPP access or the non-3GPP access functions for NAS over non-3GPP access;\n-\tthe 5GS mobility management (5GMM) functions; and\n-\tthe 5GS connection management (5GCM) functions.\nThe 5GS mobility management (5GMM) sublayer is composed of a functional block for:\n-\tthe 5GS mobility management (5GMM) functions.\nThe 5GS connection management (5GCM) sublayer is composed of a functional block for:\n-\tthe 5GS session management (5GSM) functions.\nNOTE:\tFor NAS over non-3GPP access, the non-3GPP access functions can be supported through functionalities defined in IETF RFC 7296 [30].\n",

The corresponding entities are called peer entities.\nAs each sub-layer entity is specified by one and only one protocol, it is also called a protocol entity or protocol control entity.\nFor GPRS-services supporting Class A and Class B MSs, the MM entities of the MM-sublayer are able to exchange information by means of GMM PDUs as well as MM PDU's. This means if a mobile is GPRS attached, non-GPRS mobility management procedures may make use of GRPS mobility management messages.\nWhen two peer protocol entities exchange PDUs, a transaction is said to be established (or: to be active; or: to exist). It depends from the protocol when exactly a protocol entity considers the transaction to be active, normally this is the case:\n-\tfrom the moment when it has passed the first suitable message to lower (sub-) layers or received the first suitable message from its peer entity;\n-\tup to the moment when it has released the transaction.\n",

In GSM, this implies that SM has ordered SNDCP to establish the needed LLC link. In the UMTS case, this implies that the RLC link towards the RNC has been established and that the SM has been informed about this from the RABM service entity in the MS.

Another reason is e.g. that it was not possible to establish the needed LLC link in the GSM case.\nAn MS initiated PDP context modification is requested. The MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is sent to the network and pending acceptance.

A concrete message is an instance of the corresponding class of messages. Message classes can be described as sets of potential bit strings, and of a common structure, enabling in particular to identify parts meaningful for the co-operation functions the protocol supports.\nIn general, in the rest of the clause as in the protocol specifications, the term message will be used to refer to the class. It may be used, when the context prevents ambiguity, to refer to a message instance (e.g., a received is usually a message instance). In the rest of this clause, the term message instance will be used when needed to refer unambiguously to specific concrete message, i.e. to a specific bit string.\nA message (message class) can be described directly as a set of bit strings, using the formal notation described in Annex B.\nA message can also be described as a standard L3 message, in which case the interpretation of the message description in term of a set of bit strings is specified in the next clauses.\nIn all cases, structuring messages is based on the underlying bit string. Thus, the following terms are used:\n-\ta part of a message instance is a sub-string of the corresponding string; a part of a message (as a class) is described by a definition applicable to all instances; a part of a message then is both a structural attribute of the message as a class, and a set of sub-strings, composed of the sub-strings obtained by applying the definition to each possible instance; for instance, « the first octet » of a message instance is defined from the moment its length is greater than 8, and is the sub-string composed of the first 8 bits of the message instance; the « first octet » of a message as a class is the structural definition given above, and the set of all 8-bit octet strings that can be obtained as the first octet of one instance of the class;\n-\t\"part A follows part B\" means that in the message the sub-string corresponding to part B is concatenated with the sub-string of part A;\n-\tthe length of a message instance, or of part of message instance, is the number of bits of the corresponding sub string; rigorously speaking, a message as a class (or a part seen as a class) has a length only if all the corresponding instances have the same length; by extension, sentences such as « a message as a length in the range so and so » means that the length of an instances of the class always fall in the range.\n",

This numbering can be strictly applied only for message instances, and for the first part of a message structurally identical for all instances.\n-\tBits in octets are numbered from 8 down to 1, starting at the beginning of the octet.\n-\tWhen represented as tables showing the different bit positions, octets are presented in the natural occidental order, i.e., from the top of a page downward.

                            "text_content": "A standard L3 message consists of an imperative part, itself composed of a header and the rest of imperative part, followed by a non-imperative part. Both the non-header part of the imperative part and the non-imperative part are composed of successive parts referred as standard information elements.\nA standard IE may have the following parts, in that order:\n-\tan information element identifier (IEI);\n-\ta length indicator (LI);\n-\ta value part.\nA standard IE has one of the formats shown in table 11.1:\nTable 11.1: Formats of information elements\n\nSome IEs may appear in the structure, but not in all instances of messages. An IE is then said to be present or not present in the message instance. If an IE is not present in a message instance, none of the three parts is present. Otherwise, parts must be present according to the IE format.\nIn the message structure, an IE that is allowed not to be present in all message instances is said not to be mandatory. Other IEs are said to be mandatory.\nLV-E and TLV-E are used for 5GS Mobility Management (5GMM), 5GS Session Management (5GSM), EPS Mobility Management (EMM), EPS Session Management (ESM), GPRS Mobility Management (GMM) and GPRS Session Management (SM) only. In GPRS GMM and GPRS SM messages, IEs of format LV-E and TLV-E may be used only after MS and network have successfully negotiated support of such IEs.\nEvery standard IE has an information element type which determines the values possible for the value part of the IE, and the basic meaning of the information. The information element type describes only the value part. Standard IEs of the same information element type may appear with different formats. The format used for a given standard IE in a given message is specified within the description of the message.\nThe value part of a standard IE either consists of a half octet or one or more octets; the value part of a standard IE with format LV or TLV consists of an integral number of octets, between 0 and 255 inclusive; it then may be empty, i.e., consist of zero octets; if it consists of a half octet and has format TV, its IEI consists of a half octet, too. For LV-E and TLV-E, the value part of a standard IE consists of an integral number of octets, between 0 and 65535 inclusive. The value part of a standard IE may be further structured into parts, called fields.\nFor  or TLV, the length indicator (LI) of a standard IE consists of one octet. For LV-E and TLV-E, the LI of a standard IE consists of two octets where bit 8 of octet n contains the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet n+1 contains the least significant bit (refer to figure 11.9 in clause 11.2.1.1.4 for the relative ordering of the 2 octets). The LI contains the binary encoding of the number of octets of the IE value part. The LI of a standard IE with empty value part indicates 0 octets. Standard IE of an information element type such that the possible values may have different values must be formatted with a length field, i.e., , TLV, LV-E or TLV-E.\nWhen present, the IEI of a standard IE consists of a half octet or one octet. A standard IE with IEI consisting of a half octet has format TV, and its value part consists of a half octet. The value of the IEI depends on the standard IE, not on its information element type. The IEI, if any, of a given standard IE in a given message is specified within the description of the message. In some protocol specifications, default IEI values can be indicated. They are to be used if not indicated in the message specification. Non mandatory standard IE in a given message, i.e., IE which may be not be present (formally, for which the null string is acceptable in the message), must be formatted with an IEI, i.e., with format T, TV, TLV or TLV-E.\nTotally five categories of standard information elements are defined:\n-\tinformation elements of format V or TV with value part consisting of 1/2 octet (type 1);\n-\tinformation elements of format T with value part consisting of 0 octets (type 2);\n-\tinformation elements of format V or TV with value part that has fixed length of at least one octet (type 3);\n-\tinformation elements of format  or T with value part consisting of zero, one or more octets and a maximum of 255 octets (type 4);\n-\tinformation elements of format LV-E or TLV-E with value part consisting of zero, one or more octets and a maximum of 65535 octets (type 6). This category is used in 5GS, EPS and GPRS only.\nType 1 standard information elements of format V provide the value in bit positions 8, 7, 6, 5 of an octet (see figure 11.1) or bits 4, 3, 2, 1 of an octet (see figure 11.2).\nThe figure depicts a Type 1 IE of format V, which is a common format used in the telecommunication industry for transmitting data. The figure shows the various components and their connections, including the transmitter, receiver, and the format V itself. This type of IE is used for transmitting digital signals over long distances, ensuring reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 11.1: Type 1 IE of format V\nThe figure depicts a Type 1 IE of format V, which is a common format used in the telecommunications industry for transmitting data over optical fiber. The figure shows the optical fiber, the connector, and the connector's position relative to the optical fiber. The connector is shown in a standard position, and the optical fiber is shown in a straight position. The figure is used to illustrate the type of optical fiber used in the system and to ensure that the optical fiber is properly connected to the connector.\nFigure 11.2: Type 1 IE of format V\nType 1 standard information elements of format TV have an IEI of a half octet length; they provide the IEI in bit positions 8, 7, 6, 5 of an octet and the value part in bit positions 4, 3, 2, 1 of the same octet, see figure 11.3.\nThe figure depicts a Type 1 IE of format TV, which is a type of electronic display device. It shows the various components and their connections, including the screen, backlight, and power supply. The figure is labeled with the figure number 11.3, indicating its position in the series of figures.\nFigure 11.3: Type 1 IE of format TV\nA type 2 standard IE has format T; its IEI consists of one octet, its value part is empty, see figure 11.4.\nThe figure depicts a Type 2 IE (Intermediate Earth Station) in a 5G network, illustrating its structure and components. The diagram highlights the role of the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE), as well as the presence of scatterers. The figure also illustrates the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 11.4: Type 2 IE\nA type 3 standard information element has format V or TV; if it has format TV, its IEI consists of one octet and precedes the value part in the IE. The value part consists of at least one octet. See figure 11.5 and figure 11.6.\nThe figure depicts a type 3 IE of format V, which is a standard for representing the type of information in a format V. The figure shows the different types of information that can be represented in this format, including the number of bits, the number of bits per character, and the number of characters. The figure is important for understanding the format and its use in various applications.\nFigure 11.5: Type 3 IE of format V (k = 0, 1, 2, ...)\nThe figure depicts a type 3 IE of format TV, which is a digital television format. It is characterized by a 16-bit color depth, a 10-bit RGB color model, and a 10-bit Y/C color model.

The figure also includes a\nFigure 11.6: Type 3 IE of format TV (k = 1, 2, ...)\nA type 4 standard information element has format  or TLV. Its LI has one octet and precedes the value part, which consists of zero, one, or up to 255 octets; if present, its IEI has one octet length and precedes the LI. See figure 11.7 and figure 11.8.\nThe figure depicts a type 4 IE of format (k = 0, 1, 2, ...), which is a key component in the context of network coding theory. It illustrates the relationship between the number of bits in the codeword and the number of bits in the input data. The figure is used to understand the coding efficiency of the system and to optimize the transmission of data.\nFigure 11.7: Type 4 IE of format  (k = 0, 1, 2, ...)\nThe figure depicts a Type 4 IE of format TLV, which is a key component in the format of a type 4 IE (e.g., 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nFigure 11.8: Type 4 IE of format TLV (k = 1, 2, ...)\nA type 6 standard information element has format LV-E or TLV-E. Its LI has 2 octets and precedes the value part, which consists of zero, one or up to 65535 octets; if present, its IEI has one octet length and precedes the LI. See figure 11.9 and figure 11.10.\nThe figure depicts a type 6 IE of format LV-E (k = 1, 2, ...), which is a type of optical fiber connector used in telecommunication networks. The figure shows the various types of connectors, including Type 6, Type 7, and Type 8, and their corresponding connectors. The connectors are shown in different colors and sizes, indicating their different functionalities. The figure is important for understanding the different types of connectors used in telecommunication networks and their corresponding functionalities.\nFigure 11.9: Type 6 IE of format LV-E (k = 1, 2, ...)\n\nThe figure depicts a Type 6 IE of format TLV-E, which is a key component in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard for Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6).

Two description methods are recommended and described hereafter.\nAccording to this description method, the IE is presented in its maximum format, i.e., T, TV, TLV or TLV-E, in a picture representing the bits in a table, each line representing an octet. Bits appear in the occidental order, i.e., from left of the page to right of the page, and from top of the page to bottom of the page.\nBoxes so delimited contains typically the field name, possibly an indication of which bits in the field are in the box, and possibly a value (e.g., for spare bits).\nA specific method can be used in the IE description to describe a branching structure, i.e., a structure variable according to the value of particular fields in the IE. This design is unusual outside type 4 and type 6 IEs, and as, a design rule, should be used only in type 4 and type 6 IEs.\na)\tThe octet number of an octet within the IE is defined typically in the table. It consists of a positive integer, possibly of an additional letter, and possibly of an additional asterisk, see clause f). The positive integer identifies one octet or a group of octets.\nb)\tEach octet group is a self contained entity. The internal structure of an octet group may be defined in alternative ways.\nc)\tAn octet group is formed by using some extension mechanism. The preferred extension mechanism is to extend an octet (N) through the next octet(s) (Na, Nb, etc.) by using bit 8 in each octet as an extension bit.\n-\tThe bit value \"0\" indicates that the octet group continues through to the next octet. The bit value \"1\" indicates that this octet is the last octet of the group. If one octet (Nb) is present, the preceding octets (N and Na) shall also be present.\n-\tIn the format descriptions of the individual information elements, bit 8 is marked \"0/1 ext\" if another octet follows. Bit 8 is marked \"1 ext\" if this is the last octet in the extension domain.\n-\tAdditional octets may be defined in later versions of the protocols (\"1 ext\" changed to \"0/1 ext\") and equipments shall be prepared to receive such additional octets; the contents of these octets shall be ignored. However the length indicated in the formal description of the messages and of the individual information elements only takes into account this version of the protocols.\nd)\tIn addition to the extension mechanism defined above, an octet (N) may be extended through the next octet(s) (N+1, N+2 etc.) by indications in bits 7-1 (of octet N).\ne)\tThe mechanisms in c) and d) may be combined.\nf)\tOptional octets are marked with asterisks (*). As a design rule, the presence or absence of an optional octet should be determinable from information in the IE and preceding the optional octet. Care should be taken not to introduce ambiguities with optional octets.\ng)\tAt the end of the IE, additional octets may be added in later versions of the protocols also without using the mechanisms defined in c) and d). Equipments shall be prepared to receive such additional octets; the contents of these octets shall be ignored. However the length indicated in the formal description of the messages and of the individual information elements only takes into account this version of the protocols.\nThe compact notation described in Annex B can be used to describe the value part of a standard IE. This method is recommended for complex structures, or for a branching structure not respecting octet boundaries.\n",

                            "text_content": "The imperative part of a standard L3 message is composed of a header possibly followed by mandatory standard IEs having the format V,  or LV-E.\nFor the MM, GMM, CC and SM protocols defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [6], the header of a standard L3 message is composed of two octets, and structured in three main parts, the protocol discriminator (1/2 octet), a message type octet, and a half octet used in some cases as a Transaction Identifier, in some other cases as a sub-protocol discriminator, and called skip indicator otherwise.\nFor the EPS protocols EMM and ESM, a standard L3 message can be either a plain NAS message or a security protected NAS message:\n-\tThe header of a plain NAS message is composed of two or three octets, and structured in four main parts, the protocol discriminator (1/2 octet), a half octet used in some cases as security header type and in other cases as an EPS bearer identity (1/2 octet), a message type octet, and one octet included in some cases and used as a procedure transaction identity (PTI). If the procedure transaction identity is present, it is preceding the message type octet.\n-\tThe header of a security protected NAS message is composed of six octets, and structured in four main parts, the protocol discriminator (1/2 octet), a half octet used as security header type, a message authentication code of four octets, and a sequence number of one octet. This header is followed by a complete plain NAS message (i.e. including the header of this plain NAS message).\nFor the 5GS protocols 5GMM and 5GSM, a standard L3 message can be either a plain 5GS NAS message or a security protected 5GS NAS message:\n-\tThe header of a plain 5GS NAS message is composed of three octets for 5GMM NAS messages and composed of four octets for 5GSM NAS messages, and structured in four main parts, namely, the extended protocol discriminator (1 octet); an octet used as security header type (1/2 octet) plus a spare half octet in case of 5GMM NAS messages, and a PDU session identity of one octet in case of 5GSM NAS messages; an octet for procedure transaction identity (PTI) in case of 5GSM NAS messages; and one octet for message type. If the procedure transaction identity is present, it is preceding the message type octet.\n-\tThe header of a security protected 5GS NAS message is composed of seven octets, and structured in four main parts, the extended protocol discriminator (1 octet), an octet used as security header type (1/2 octet) plus a spare half octet, a message authentication code of four octets, and a sequence number of one octet. This header is followed by a complete plain 5GS NAS message (i.e. including the header of this plain 5GS NAS message).\nBits 1 to 4 of the first octet of a standard L3 message contain the protocol discriminator (PD) information element. The PD (with exception of \"extension of the PD to one octet length\") identifies the L3 protocol to which the standard layer 3 message belongs. The correspondence between L3 protocols and PDs (with exception of \"extension of the PD to one octet length\") is one-to-one.\nWhen the PD is set to \"extension of the PD to one octet length\", the first octet of a standard L3 message contains the extended protocol discriminator (EPD) information element as specified in clause 11.2.3.1.1A.\nThe PD can take the following values:\nTable 11.2: Protocol discriminator values\n\nIf the network receives, on a SAP where it expects standard L3 messages, a message with a protocol discriminator different from those specified in table 11.2, the network may ignore the message or initiate the channel release procedure defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 [6b].\nIf the Mobile Station receives, on a SAP where it expects standard L3 messages, a standard L3 message with a protocol discriminator different from those specified in table 11.2, or for a protocol that it does not support, the Mobile Station shall ignore the message.\nWhen the PD is set to \"extension of the PD to one octet length\" as specified in clause 11.2.3.1.1, bits 1 to 8 of the first octet of a standard L3 message contain the extended protocol discriminator (EPD) information element.\nThe EPD identifies the L3 protocol to which the standard layer 3 message belongs. The correspondence between L3 protocols and EPDs is one-to-one.\nThe EPD can take the values specified in table 11.2.3.1.1A.1.\nTable 11.2.3.1.1A.1: EPD values\n\nIf the network receives, on a SAP where it expects standard L3 messages, a message with an EPD different from those specified in table 11.2.3.1.1A.1, the network may ignore the message, may initiate the RRC connection release procedure defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 [24], or may initiate the RRC connection release procedure defined in 3GPP TS 38.331 [28].\nIf the Mobile Station receives, on a SAP where it expects standard L3 messages, a standard L3 message with an EPD different from those specified in table 11.2.3.1.1A.1, or for a protocol that it does not support, the Mobile Station shall ignore the message.\nBits 5 to 8 of octet 1 of a standard L3 message may be used differently, depending on the protocol and the SAP. The use of this half-octet is consistent for a given PD and SAP. One possibility is that this half-octet contains the skip indicator. Another possibility is that this half-octet is a part of EPD as specified in clause 11.2.3.1.1A. Unless otherwise specified in the protocol, the skip indicator IE is a spare field.\nA L3 protocol may define that bits 5 to 8 of octet 1 of a standard L3 message of the protocol contains the transaction identifier (TI). The TI allows to distinguish up to 16 different bi-directional messages flows for a given PD and a given SAP. Such a message flow is called a transaction.\nAn extension mechanism for TI is also defined. This mechanism allows to distinguish up to 256 different bi-directional messages flows for a given PD and a given SAP. The extension mechanism shall not be used unless explicitly stated in the core specification(s) for the protocol. The TI IE is coded as shown in figure 11.9 and table 11.3. It is composed of the TI value and the TI flag.\nThe TI value and the TI flag occupy bits 5 - 7 and bit 8 of the first octet respectively.\nThe extended TI shall not be used unless TI values of 7 or greater are needed.\nWhere the extended TI is used, the TI IE includes a second octet. The TI value in the first octet is ignored, and the TI value is encoded in bits 7-1 of the second octet.\nNOTE:\tIn other specifications, in respect to error handling, there are references to TI value \"111\". This refers to the binary encoding of bits 5 –7 in octet 1. For protocols which do not use the extended TI this '111' encoding is still handled as an error case.Transactions are dynamically created, and their TI value is assigned at creation time. TI values are assigned by the side of the interface initiating a transaction. At the beginning of a transaction a free TI value (i.e., a value not yet used for the given PD, the given SAP, and with the given initiator) is chosen and assigned to this transaction. It then remains fixed for the lifetime of the transaction. After a transaction ends, the associated TI value is free and may be reassigned to a later transaction.\nTwo identical TI values may be used when each value pertains to a transaction initiated by the different sides of the interface. In this case the TI flag shall avoid ambiguity. The transaction identifier flag can take the values \"0\" or \"1\". The TI flag is used to identify which side of the interface initiated the transaction. A message has a TI flag set to \"0\" when it belongs to transaction initiated by its sender, and to \"1\" otherwise.\nHence the TI flag identifies who allocated the TI value for this transaction and the only purpose of the TI flag is to resolve simultaneous attempts to allocate the same TI value.\nThe TI extension mechanism may in future evolution of the L3 protocols be further extended by setting the EXT flag in octet 2 to \"0\" (see figure 11.9).\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Transaction identifier\nTable 11.3: Transaction identifier\n\nA L3 protocol may define that bits 5 to 8 of octet 1 of a standard L3 message of the protocol contains the sub-protocol discriminator (SPD). The SPD allows to distinguish between different protocols inside one sublayer.\nTable 11.4: Sub-Protocol discriminator values\n\nA L3 protocol may define that bits 5 to 8 of octet 1 of a standard L3 message of the protocol contain the EPS bearer identity. The EPS bearer identity is used to identify a message flow.\n\n\nFigure 11.9a: EPS bearer identity\nTable 11.5: EPS bearer identity\n\nFor EPS protocols, a L3 protocol may define that bits 5 to 8 of octet 1 of a standard L3 message of the protocol contain the security header type.\nFor 5GS protocols, a L3 protocol may define that bits 1 to 4 of octet 2 of a standard L3 message of the protocol contain the security header type.\nA L3 protocol may define that a standard L3 message of the protocol contains the procedure transaction identity (PTI). The PTI allows distinguishing up to 254 different bi-directional messages flows for a given PD and a given SAP. Such a message flow is called a transaction. The procedure transaction identity is released when the procedure is completed.\nTable 11.6: Procedure transaction identity\n\nA L3 protocol may define that octet 2 of a standard L3 message of the protocol contains the PDU session identity. The PDU session identity is used to identify a PDU session.\nThe range of PDU session identity values indicated in table 11.2.3.1c.1 is shared between the PDU sessions over 3GPP access and the PDU sessions over non-3GPP access.\n\nFigure 11.2.3.1c.1: PDU session identity\nTable 11.2.3.1c.1: PDU session identity\n\nThe message type octet is the second octet in a standard L3 message.\nWhen a standard L3 message is expected, and a message is received that is less than 16 bit long, that message shall be ignored.\nWhen the radio connection started with a core network node of a Release 98 or older network, the message type IE is coded as shown in figure 11.10a and 11.10x.\nBit 8 is encoded as \"0\"; value \"1\" is reserved for possible future use as an extension bit. A protocol entity expecting a standard L3 message, and receiving a message containing bit 8 of octet 2 encoded as \"1\" shall diagnose a \" message not defined for the PD\" error and treat the message accordingly.\nIn messages of MM, CC, SS (via CS domain), GCC and BCC protocol sent using the transmission functionality provided by the RR layer to upper layers, and sent from the mobile station or the LMU to the network, bit 7 of octet 2 is used for send sequence number, see clause 11.2.3.2.3.\nIn messages of the LCS protocol sent using the transmission functionality provided by the RR layer to upper layers, and sent from the type A LMU to the network, bit 7 of octet 2 is used for send sequence number, see clause 11.2.3.2.3.\nIn all other standard layer 3 messages, except for RR messages, bit 7 is set to a default value. A protocol entity expecting a standard L3 message, and not using the transmission functionality provided by the RR layer, and receiving a message containing bit 7 of octet 2 encoded different to the default value shall diagnose a \"message not defined for the PD\" error and treat the message accordingly.\nThe default value for bit 7 is 0 except for the SM protocol where the default value is 1. No default value for bit 7 is specified for RR protocol. For RR message types see 3GPP TS 44.018.\nThe figure depicts a variety of message types in a telecommunications network, including MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC, and LCS. Each message type represents a different type of data packet, such as a message, command, control, and signaling message, respectively. The figure illustrates the different types of messages and their corresponding formats, which are essential for efficient communication in the network.\nFigure 11.10a: Message type IE (MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC and LCS)\nThe figure depicts a message type IE (protocol other than MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC, and LC S) in a network. It illustrates the various message types and their corresponding protocols, providing a comprehensive overview of the network's communication structure.\nFigure 11.10x: Message type IE (protocol other than MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC and LCS)\nFor MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC and LCS protocols bits 1 to 6 of octet 2 of standard L3 messages contain the message type. For all other L3 protocols bits 1 to 8 of octet 2 of standard L3 message contain the message type.\nThe message type determines the function of a message within a protocol in a given direction. The meaning of the message type is therefore dependent on the protocol (the same value may have different meanings in different protocols), and the direction (the same value may have different meanings in the same protocol, when sent from the Mobile Station to the network and when sent from the network to the Mobile Station).\nEach protocol defines a list of allowed message types for each relevant SAP. A message received analysed as a standard L3 message, and with a message type not in the corresponding list leads to the diagnosis \"message not defined for the PD\". Some message types may correspond to a function not implemented by the receiver. They are then said to be not implemented by the receiver.\nThe reaction of a protocol entity expecting a standard L3 message and receiving a message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver and the reception conditions is defined in the relevant protocol specification. As a general rule, a protocol specification should not force the receiver to analyse the message further.\nThe message type octet is the second octet in a standard L3 message.\nWhen a standard L3 message is expected, and a message is received that is less than 16 bit long, that message shall be ignored.\nWhen the radio connection started with a core network node of a Release 99 or later network, the message type IE is coded dependent on the PD as shown in figures 11.10b, c and d.\nIn messages of MM, CC and SS (via CS domain) protocol sent using the transmission functionality provided by the RR and/or access stratum layer to upper layers, and sent from the mobile station or the LMU to the network, bits 7 and 8 of octet 2 are used for send sequence number, see clause 11.2.3.2.3.\nIn messages of GCC and BCC protocol sent using the transmission functionality provided by the RR layer to upper layers, and sent from the mobile station or the LMU to the network, only bit 7 of octet 2 is used for send sequence number. Bit 8 is set to the default value.\nIn messages of the LCS protocol sent using the transmission functionality provided by the RR layer to upper layers, and sent from the type A LMU to the network, only bit 7 of octet 2 is used for send sequence number. Bit 8 is set to the default value.\nIn all other standard layer 3 messages, except for RR messages, bits 7 and 8 are set to the default value. A protocol entity expecting a standard L3 message, and not using the transmission functionality provided by the RR and/or access stratum layer, and receiving a message containing bit 7 or bit 8 of octet 2 encoded different to the default value shall diagnose a \"message not defined for the PD\" error and treat the message accordingly.\nIn messages of the RR protocol entity, bit 8 of octet 2 is set to the default value. The other value is reserved for possible future use as an extension bit .If an RR protocol entity expecting a standard L3 message receives message containing bit 8 of octet 2 encoded different from the default value it shall diagnose a \"message not defined for the PD\" error and treat the message accordingly.\nThe default value for bit 8 is 0. The default value for bit 7 is 0 except for the SM protocol which has a default value of 1. No default value for bit 7 is specified for RR protocol. For RR message types see 3GPP TS 44.018.\nFor EPS; the default value for bit 7 is 1. The value for bit 8 is 0 for the EMM protocol and 1 for the ESM protocol.\nFor 5GS; the default value for bit 7 is 1. The value for bit 8 is 0 for the 5GMM protocol and 1 for the 5GSM protocol.\nThe figure depicts a message type IE (Message Type IE) with MM, CC, and SS components. The MM component represents the message's message type, CC represents the content of the message, and SS represents the sender's identifier. The figure illustrates the structure of a message type IE, highlighting the importance of each component in the communication process.\nFigure 11.10b: Message type IE (MM, CC and SS)\nThe figure depicts a message type IE (GCC, BCC, and LCS) in a GCC (Group Cipher) context, with a focus on the BCC (Block Cipher) and LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) ciphers. The figure illustrates the encryption and decryption processes, highlighting the use of the BCC and LCS ciphers in the context of a GCC cipher.\nFigure 11.10c: Message type IE (GCC, BCC and LCS)\nThe figure depicts a message type IE (protocol other than MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC, and LCS) in a network. It illustrates the various message types and their corresponding protocols, providing a comprehensive overview of the network's communication structure.\nFigure 11.10d: Message type IE (protocol other than MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC and LCS)\nFor MM, CC, SS, GCC, BCC and LCS protocols bits 1 to 6 of octet 2 of standard L3 messages contain the message type. For all other L3 protocols bits 1 to 8 of octet 2 of standard L3 message contain the message type.\nThe message type determines the function of a message within a protocol in a given direction. The meaning of the message type is therefore dependent on the protocol (the same value may have different meanings in different protocols), and the direction (the same value may have different meanings in the same protocol, when sent from the Mobile Station to the network and when sent from the network to the Mobile Station).\nEach protocol defines a list of allowed message types for each relevant SAP. A message received analysed as a standard L3 message, and with a message type not in the corresponding list leads to the diagnosis \"message not defined for the PD\". Some message types may correspond to a function not implemented by the receiver. They are then said to be not implemented by the receiver.\nThe reaction of a protocol entity expecting a standard L3 message and receiving a message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver and the reception conditions is defined in the relevant protocol specification. As a general rule, a protocol specification should not force the receiver to analyse the message further.\nUpper layer messages sent using the RR sub-layer transport service from the mobile station to the network can be duplicated by the data link layer in at least the following cases:\n-\tin A/Gb mode, when a channel change of dedicated channels is required (assignment or handover procedure) and the last layer 2 frame has not been acknowledged by the peer data link layer before the mobile station leaves the old channel;\n-\tin Iu mode, when an RLC re-establishment occurs (e.g. due to relocation) and the RLC layer has not acknowledged the last one or more RLC PDUs before RLC re-establishment;\n-\tan inter-system change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode is performed and the RLC layer has not acknowledged the last one or more RLC PDUs;\n-\tan inter-system change from A/Gb mode to Iu mode is performed and the last layer 2 frame in A/Gb mode has not been acknowledged by the peer data link layer before the mobile station leaves the old channel.\nIn these cases, the mobile station does not know whether the network has received the messages correctly. Therefore, the mobile station has to send the messages again when the channel change is completed.\nThe network must be able to detect the duplicated received messages. Therefore, each concerned upper layer messages must be marked with a send sequence number.\nTo allow for different termination points in the infrastructure of the messages of different PDs, the sequence numbering is specific to each PD. For historical reasons, an exception is that messages sent with the CC, SS (via CS domain) and MM PDs share the same sequence numbering. In the following, the phrase upper layer message flow refers to a flow of messages sharing the same sequence numbering. The different upper layer flows are MM+CC+SS (via CS domain), GCC, BCC and LCS. The GMM, EMM, SM, ESM, SMS, SS (via PS domain) and TC (Test Control, see 3GPP TS 44.014 [5a], 3GPP TS 34.109 [17a] and 3GPP TS 36.509 [26]) protocols do not use layer 3 sequence numbering.\nIn a shared network with a MOCN configuration, Network Sharing non-supporting UEs can be redirected between CN operators (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [22]). When the redirection takes place, the CN node of the redirecting CN operator shall forward via the RAN the value of N(SD) of the last message received on the MM+CC+SS (via CS domain) message flow to the CN node of the next CN operator (3GPP TS 25.413 [23]).\n\n11.2.3.2.3.1\tVariables and sequence numbers\n11.2.3.2.3.1.1\tSend state variable V(SD)\nThe mobile station shall have one associated send state variable V(SD) (\"Send Duplicated\") for each upper layer message flow. The send state variable denotes the sequence number of the next in sequence numbered message in the flow to be transmitted. The value of the corresponding send state variable shall be incremented by one with each numbered message transmission.\nFor the MM+CC+SS (via CS domain) upper layer message flow:\n-\twhen the RR connection starts with a core network of Release 98 or earlier, arithmetic operations on V(SD) are performed modulo 2. The mobile station shall keep using modulo 2 for the duration of the RR connection;\n-\twhen the RR connection starts with a core network of Release 99 or later, arithmetic operations on V(SD) are performed modulo 4. The mobile station shall keep using modulo 4 for the duration of the RR connection;\n-\tafter successful completion of SRVCC handover (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [27]), the mobile station shall perform modulo 4 arithmetic operations on V(SD). The mobile station shall keep using modulo 4 until the release of the RR connection established at SRVCC handover.\nNOTE 1:\tIn A/Gb mode, the release supported by the core network is indicated in the MSCR bit and in the SGSNR bit in the system information broadcast (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [6b] and 3GPP TS 44.060 [10a]).\nNOTE 2:\tDuring SRVCC handover the MSCR bit is not provided to the mobile station, and therefore the mobile station assumes to access to a Release 99 or later core network.\nFor the GCC, BCC, and LCS upper layer message flows, arithmetic operations on V(SD) are performed modulo 2.\n11.2.3.2.3.1.2\tSend sequence number N(SD)\nAt the time when such a message to be numbered is designated for transmission, the value of N(SD) for the message to be transferred is set equal to the value of the send state variable V(SD).\n11.2.3.2.3.2\tProcedures for the initiation, transfer execution and termination of the sequenced message transfer operation\n11.2.3.2.3.2.1\tInitiation\nThe sequenced message transfer operation is initiated by establishing a RR connection. The send state variables V(SD) are set to 0.\nAfter successful completion of SRVCC handover (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [27]), the mobile station shall set the send state variable V(SD) to 0.\n11.2.3.2.3.2.2\tTransfer Execution\nThe core network shall compare the send sequence numbers of pairs of subsequent messages in the same upper layer messages flow.\nFor the GCC, BCC, and LCS upper layer message flows, in case the send sequence numbers of two subsequent messages in a flow are not identical, no duplication has occurred. In case the send sequence numbers are identical, the network must ignore the second one of the received messages.\nFor the MM+CC+SS (via CS domain) upper layer message flow:\n-\twhen accessed by a release 98 or earlier mobile station, in case the send sequence numbers of two subsequent messages in the flow are identical, the core network shall discard the second one of the received messages;\n-\twhen accessed by a release 99 or later mobile station, the core network shall discard any message whose N(SD) is not the increment by one (modulo 4) of the N(SD) of the last accepted message.\nNOTE:\tThe release supported by the mobile station is indicated by the revision level in the Mobile Station Classmark 1 or  Station Classmark 2 information element, or by the revision level indicator in the MS network capability information element (see 3GPP TS 24.008, clause 10.5).\nIn a shared network with a MOCN configuration, the core network node to which the mobile station was redirected shall compare the send sequence number of the first message received after the redirection in the MM+CC+SS (via CS domain) message flow with the value of N(SD) received during the redirection procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [22]):\n-\twhen accessed by a release 98 or earlier mobile station, if the two send sequence numbers are identical, the core network shall discard the received message from the mobile station;\n-\twhen accessed by a release 99 or later mobile station, the core network shall discard any message whose N(SD) is not the increment by one (modulo 4) of the N(SD) received during the redirection procedure.\n11.2.3.2.3.2.3\tTermination\nThe sequenced message transfer operation is terminated by the RR connection release procedure.\nInter system change from A/Gb mode to Iu mode or from Iu mode to A/Gb mode shall not terminate the sequenced message transfer. UMTS SRNC relocation shall not terminate the sequenced message transfer.\nThe message type octet of a standard L3 message may be followed by mandatory standard IEs having the format V,  or LV-E as specified in the message description in the relevant protocol specification.\nAs a design rule, octet boundaries must be respected. This implies that half-octet standard IEs (i.e., V formatted type 1 standard IEs) must appear by pair. The first half-octet IE occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second half-octet IE bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third half-octet IE bits 1 to 4 of octet N + 1 etc. If the number of half-octet IEs is odd then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet occupied by these half-octet IEs contains a spare half-octet IE in format V.\nIf message is received as a standard L3 message, and that is too short to contain the complete imperative part as specified in the relevant protocol specification, an imperative message part error is diagnosed. (The same error may be diagnosed at detection of certain contents of the imperative part of a message; this is defined in the relevant protocol specification.) The treatment of an imperative message part error is defined in the relevant protocol specification.\n",

                            "text_content": "The imperative part of a standard L3 message is followed by the (possibly empty) non-imperative part. The relevant protocol specification defines where the imperative part of a standard L3 message ends. The non-imperative part of a standard L3 message is composed of (zero, one, or several) standard IEs having the format T, TV, TLV or TLV-E. The receiver of a standard L3 message shall analyse the non imperative part as a succession of standard IEs each containing an IEI, and shall be prepared for the non-imperative part of the message to contain standard IEs that are not specified in the relevant protocol specification.\nAn IEI may be known in a message or unknown in a message. Each protocol specification lists, for each message (i.e., according to the message type, the direction and the lower layer SAP), the known standard IEs in the non-imperative part.\nAn IEI that is known in a message designates the IE type of the IE the first part of which the IEI is, as well as the use of the information. Which IE type it designates is specified in the relevant protocol specification. Within a message, different IEIs may designate the same IE type if that is defined in the relevant protocol specification.\nWhether the second part of an IE with IEI known in a message is the length or not (in other words, whether the IEI is the first part of an IE formatted as TLV, TLV-E or not) is specified in the relevant protocol specification.\nUnless otherwise specified in the protocol specification, the receiver shall assume that IE with unknown IEI are TV formatted type 1, T formatted type 2, TLV formatted type 4 or TLV-E formatted type 6 standard IEs. The IEI of unknown IEs together with, when applicable, the length indicator, enable the receiver to determine the total length of the IE, and then to skip unknown IEs. The receiver shall assume the following rule for IEs with unknown IEI:\nBit 8 of the IEI octet is set to \"1\" indicates a TV formatted type 1 standard IE or a T formatted type 2 IEs. Hence, a 1 valued bit 8 indicates that the whole IE is one octet long.\nFurthermore, for the EPS protocols EMM and ESM:\nBit 8 of the IEI octet set to \"0\" and bits 7 to 4 set to \"1\" indicates a TLV-E formatted type 6 IE, i.e. the following two octets are length octets. Bit 8 of the IEI octet set to \"0\" and bit 7 to 4 set to any other bit combination indicates a TLV formatted type 4 IE, i.e. the following octet is a length octet.\nFurthermore, for the 5GS protocols 5GMM and 5GSM:\nBit 8 of the IEI octet set to \"0\" and bits 7 to 5 set to \"1\" indicates a TLV-E formatted type 6 IE, i.e. the following two octets are length octets. Bit 8 of the IEI octet set to \"0\" and bit 7 to 5 set to any other bit combination indicates a TLV formatted type 4 IE, i.e. the following octet is a length octet.\nIEI assignment in 3GPP TS 24.334 [36] shall comply with the above rule for the EPS protocols EMM and ESM.\nIEI assignment in 3GPP TS 24.519 [33], 3GPP TS 24.587 [34], 3GPP TS 24.193 [35] and 3GPP TS 24.554 [38] shall comply with the above rule for the 5GS protocols 5GMM and 5GSM.\nIEI assignment for UE policy delivery service in 3GPP TS 24.501 [31] shall comply with the above rule for the 5GS protocols 5GMM and 5GSM.\nFor all other protocols:\nBit 8 of the IEI octet set to \"0\" indicates a TLV formatted type 4 IE. Hence, the following octet is a length octet.\nAs a design rule, it is recommended that IEIs of any TV formatted type 1, T formatted type 2, TLV formatted type 4 or TLV-E formatted type 6 IE follow the rule, even if assumed to be known by all potential receivers.\nAs a design rule, it is recommended that no T formatted type 2 IE is added to the non-imperative part of a standard L3 message.\nNOTE 1:\tType 2 IEs restrict the number of possible type 1 IEs which can be used in a message and type 2 IEs cannot be extended or modified once introduced.\nAs a design rule, it is recommended that no new TV formatted type 3 IE is added to the non-imperative part of a standard L3 message except in the first release of a protocol specification which specifies the standard L3 message.\nNOTE 2:\tFor example, for the 5GS protocols 5GMM and 5GSM, Release 15 is the first release of a protocol specification for REGISTRATION REQUEST message.\nA message may contain two or more IEs with equal IEI. Two IEs with the same IEI in a same message must have the same format, and, when of type 3, the same length. More generally, care should be taken not to introduce ambiguities by using an IEI for two purposes. Ambiguities appear in particular when two IEs potentially immediately successive have the same IEI but different meanings and when both are non-mandatory. As a recommended design rule, messages should contain a single IE of a given IEI.\nEach protocol specification may put specific rules for the order of IEs in the non-imperative part. An IE known in the message, but at a position non compliant with these rules is said to be out of sequence. An out of sequence IE is decoded according to the format, and, when of type 3 the length, as defined in the message for its IEI.\n",

A type 6 IE is encoded as 'comprehension required' if bit 8 is set to zero and bits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of its IEI are set to one.\nNOTE:\tIn earlier versions of this specification, type 6 IEs with IEI values 7C and 7D were defined as 'comprehension required'. I.e., dependent on the protocol, receipt of such an IE by a UE or network implemented according to an earlier version of this specification can result in detection of an \"invalid mandatory information\" error. Therefore, IEIs 7C and 7D can be used for type 6 IEs only if the sender of the message knows that the receiver does not treat these IEs as unknown 'comprehension required' IEs.\nThe 'comprehension required' scheme is to be applied if explicitly indicated in the protocol specification. The reaction on the reception of an unknown or out of sequence IE coded as 'comprehension required' is specified in the relevant protocol specification.\n",

The notation addresses the cases where the concrete messages are binary strings. The notation allows to describe sets of strings: the structure of a message defined a protocol defines a set of allowable bit strings. It also allows to put labels on parts of strings that follow a given structure.\nOne aspect of the specification of message set is to define the set of strings that are acceptable as when received. All the strings that cannot be recognized as syntactically correct messages are to be rejected for syntactical reasons. In many cases, only a subset of this set are allowed to be sent. The notation allows also to distinguish the set of the strings that can be sent and the set of strings that are recognized as syntactically correct.\nAnother aspect of the specification of messages is the splitting of an acceptable string in a number of sub-strings that will be use to derive the exact significance of the message. The notation provides this function by labelling sub-strings. These labels can then in turn be used in textual or formal semantic descriptions which are not covered in the present document.\nThe notation described here could be enhanced in the future, with the addition of new rules.\n",

To allow message decoding, a rule must then be given to choose the branch. The rule is that any matching set can be chosen (the concatenation is a true set union).\nIn practice, it is preferable to have non intersecting choice sets. Moreover, the ability to select the branch to take rapidly is important for obtaining simple message decoders. Except for strong reasons, a design should only include choice construction that can be rewritten using only constructions matching the pattern {a1 s1 |a2 s2} where a1 and a2 are non-intersecting sets of strings of the same non-null length. A tolerable derogation is to use intersecting an.\nExamples:\n{100 xx | 001 zz} is acceptable.\n{00 xx | 010 yy | 011 zz} is acceptable, since it can be rewritten {00 xx | 01 {0 yy | 1 zz}}}.\n{{00|01|10} xx | {00|11} yy} is not recommended (the start 00 is ambiguous).\nIn practice this covers fixed length tagging (like tagging by an IEI, or 1-bit tagging in rest octets), and also non-intersecting variable length tagging as used for instance in the frequency list IE (tag list such as 0, 100, 101, 110, 11100, 11101, 11110, 11111, where no tag is the start of another one).\n",

Padding is then necessary to fill up the message up to the desired length. Moreover, the padding uses a particular sequence of bits, of fixed position, i.e., the value of a padding bit depends on its position relative to the start of the message. The padding sequence is protocol-specific. In most cases it is constituted of all 0 values, in which case the following notation is of no use. In the case of GSM 04.08, the padding sequence is the repetition of octet 00101011, starting on an octet boundary.\nThe special notations \"L\" and \"H\" are used to denote the respectively the bit value corresponding to the padding spare bit for that position, and the other value.\nThe notations \"0\", \"1\", \"null\", \"L\" and \"H\" are the only terminals in CSN.1.\nPadding spare bits are bits which are set to the indicated value in emission whereas in reception any bit string is acceptable. The following notation:\n<spare L>\ndescribes a bit which has a logical value L in emission, and is a bit (0 or 1) in reception.\nThe term <spare padding> denotes the required padding spare bits needed to fill up the message. The construction can be developed only partially from the rules described so far, because the length limitation does not appear in the following description:\n< spare padding> ::= <spare L> {null | < spare padding>};\n",

In many cases this can be used within the context of a message to refer to the specific part of the message. However, this is not of general application, since it may happen that two parts of a message follow the same structure, and economy of notation requires that the structure is described but once.\nThe general syntax that follows allows to refer to a part inside a description:\n<name1 : string description>\n\nFor the definition of string sets, this is equivalent to the string description being used alone.\nThe name used as a label can be built according to the rules applicable to parenthesed references.\nExamples:\n<Tag : 000 >\n<Field : <Field type>>\n<Field : octet>\n\nThe third example shows the use of a non parentheses reference to obtain a more elegant expression than, for instance, the second example. At this stage, labels has no use for describing message syntax, but can be used to refer to the corresponding part of the string, e.g., in the description of the message specifying the relationship between the syntactical content and the semantical contents of the message, or to associate properties with effective sub-strings in effective messages (rather than with sets of sub strings). Syntactical use of the semantical identifier are presented in more advanced rules.\nThe same name may appear in several places.
