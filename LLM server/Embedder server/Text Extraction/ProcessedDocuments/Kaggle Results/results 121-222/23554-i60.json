The MSGin5G Server(s) interacts with SEAL Servers over the SEAL-S reference point specified for each SEAL service.

A SEAL Configuration Management Client specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5] may be collocated in the MSGin5G Client, Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway and Non-3GPP Message Gateway. The implementation of such deployment option is out of scope of the present specification.\nNOTE 2:\tDepending on the non-3GPP message service, the interaction between Non-3GPP message client and Non-3GPP Message Gateway may involve 3GPP Core Network.\nNOTE 3:\t3GPP Core Network may not be involved for the interaction between the Non-3GPP Message Gateway and the MSGin5G Server.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the Application Client on UE-2 communicates with the MSGin5G Client on UE-1 over the MSGin5G-5 reference point then the transport layer communication is based on the Unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [18] or is implementation specific.\nThe architecture shown in Figure 5.2-2 and Figure 5.2-3 illustrate architectural options for providing MSGin5G services for constrained devices. In these figures, the MSGin5G UE-2 is a constrained device which does not connect to the 3GPP network directly for message exchange with MSGin5G Server (e.g. UE-2 is out of 3GPP RAN coverage, with or without authorization to use UE-to-Network relay). If allowed by configuration, the MSGin5G UE-2 can use the options listed below to communicate with the MSGin5G Server:\n-\tthe MSGin5G UE-2 uses an UE-1 as relay;\n-\tthe MSGin5G UE-2 interacts with an MSGin5G Gateway UE which supports MSGin5G Gateway Client.\nFigure 5.2-2 shows the application architecture of MSGin5G UE-2 using an UE-1 as a relay. The SEAL Client(s) residing on the UE-1 also acts as relay for the SEAL Client(s) residing on the MSGin5G UE-2 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].\nNOTE 5:\tIn this option, MSGin5G UE-2 discovers the UE-1 and then uses the UE-1 as a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay by using the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [18].\nNOTE 6:\tThe UE-1 can be any UE supporting ProSe UE-to-Network Relay capability and may not be an MSGin5G UE.\nIn the given telecommunication figure, Figure 5.2, we can observe a scenario where an UE-2 is using an UE-1 as a relay to transmit a message. This setup demonstrates the use of relaying in 5G networks, where the UE-2 sends a message to the UE-1, which then relays the message to the destination. The figure also highlights the use of relaying in the context of the 5G network, where the message is transmitted through multiple hops to reach its final destination.\nFigure 5.2-2: MSGin5G UE-2 using UE-1 as a relay\nFigure 5.2-3 shows the application architecture of MSGin5G UE-2 with MSGin5G Client interacts with an MSGin5G Gateway UE over the MSGin5G-6 reference point.\nNOTE 7:\tBoth MSGin5G Client functionality and MSGin5G Gateway service functionality are internal functionalities of MSGin5G Gateway Client. The interaction between MSGin5G Client functionality in the MSGin5G Gateway Client and the MSGin5G Gateway service functionality is implementation specific.\nThe figure depicts a 5G UE-2 with a MSGin5G client interacting with an MSGin5G Gateway UE, illustrating the integration of 5G technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of mesh networks for enhanced network performance.\nFigure 5.2-3: MSGin5G UE-2 with MSGin5G Client interacts with an MSGin5G Gateway UE\nNOTE 8:\tMSGin5G-6 reference point is based on the Unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [18].\nEditor’s note:\tHow to handle SEAL Client functionality in a constrained MSGin5G UE is FFS.\nFigure 5.2-4 illustrates the functional model for interconnection between MSGin5G servers.\nFigure 5 illustrates the interconnection between MSGin5G servers, showcasing the network's architecture and the role of each component.\nFigure 5.2-4: Interconnection between MSGin5G Servers\nTo support distributed SEAL server deployment in one PLMN, and delivering MSGin5G messages between different PLMNs, the MSGin5G Server interacts with another MSGin5G Server over MSGin5G-8 reference point.\n",

The MSGin5G Service flow is shown in figure 7.1-1.\nIf the UE supports a legacy 3GPP message service (e.g. SMS, NIDD, or CB) and does not support the MSGin5G Service (i.e. UE has no MSGin5G Client), the message will be translated to the appropriate message delivery mechanism by the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway. A UE that does not support any 3GPP message service can connect to the MSGin5G Service via Non-3GPP Message Gateway that facilitates the translation between the MSGin5G Service and non-3GPP message delivery mechanism. The connection between such UE and the gateway can be via 3GPP access or non 3GPP access (e.g. WLAN) and is out of scope of the present specification.\nAn Application Server resides outside the 3GPP domain and connects to the MSGin5G Server via a CAPIF-aware reference point.\nThe message communication models include:\n-\tPoint-to-Point messaging: message that is originated at a UE (UE A) and terminated at another UE (UE B, a Legacy 3GPP UE or a Non-3GPP UE).\n-\tAS-to-Point messaging: message that is originated at an Application Sever and terminated at a UE.\n-\tPoint-to-AS messaging: message that is originated at a UE and terminated at an Application Sever.\n-\tGroup Messaging: message that is originated at a UE or an Application Server and is terminated at a group of UEs (a group member can be of type UE A, Legacy 3GPP UE or Non-3GPP UE).\n-\tBroadcast Messaging: message that is originated at an Application Sever or an MSGin5G UE and broadcasted to all the UEs in a specific Broadcast Area within coverage of a cell or of multiple cells. An existing broadcast function (e.g. CB specified in 3GPP TS 23.041 [14]) may be reused in broadcast messaging of MSGin5G Service.\n-\tTopic Messaging: message that is originated at an Application Sever or a UE and is delivered to all UEs and Application Server(s) that have subscribed to the topic.\n\nThe MSGin5G Service overview in Figure 7.1-1 illustrates the key components and functionalities of the MSGin5G service, which is a key component of the 5G network. The figure depicts the various elements involved in the service, such as the network slicing, network slicing management, and network slicing orchestration. The service is designed to provide a seamless and efficient communication experience for users, enabling them to access and utilize the full potential of 5G networks.\nFigure 7.1-1: The MSGin5G Service overview\n",

                    "text_content": "Before a UE or an Application Server can use the MSGin5G Service it needs to register with the MSGin5G Server.\nA UE registers with its identity, its security credentials, the capabilities that it supports, and its availability. The MSGin5G Server will use the availability registration and de-registration to determine if the UE is available for message delivery. If a UE is unavailable for message delivery, the MSGin5G Server will store the message and deliver it once the UE becomes available again.\nWhen a UE or an Application Server sends an MSGin5G message to a recipient UE then such message will be sent to the MSGin5G Server and this server will deliver the message to the UE based on the capabilities of the recipient UE (MSGin5G UE, Legacy 3GPP UE or Non-3GPP UE). If the recipient UE is a Legacy 3GPP UE then the MSGin5G Server will forward the message to the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway and this gateway will convert the message to a message that is supported by the recipient UE (e.g. SMS, NIDD or CB). If the recipient UE is a Non-3GPP UE then the MSGin5G Server will forward the message to the Non-3GPP Message Gateway and this gateway will convert the message to a message that is supported by the recipient UE.\nA Legacy 3GPP UE sends the application payload to the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway and this gateway will forward the application payload in an MSGin5G message to the MSGin5G Server, which will deliver the message to the recipient UE(s). A Non-3GPP UE sends the application payload to the Non-3GPP Message Gateway and this gateway will forward the application payload in an MSGin5G message to the MSGin5G Server, which will deliver the message to the recipient UE(s).\nNOTE:\tConversion by a Message Gateway is out of scope of the present specification.\nIf a UE or an Application Server sends an MSGin5G message to a group of UEs, the MSGin5G Server will deliver the message to all group members taking into account if such a UE is an MSGin5G UE, a Legacy 3GPP UE or a Non-MSGin5G UE and if such UE is available for delivery.\nIf a UE or an Application Server sends an MSGin5G message containing a Messaging Topic to the MSGin5G Server, the MSGin5G Server will distribute the message to all UEs and Application Servers that have subscribed to that topic.\nIf a UE or an Application Server sends a broadcast message to a Broadcast Area, the MSGin5G Server forwards the message to the Broadcast Message Gateway and this gateway will forward the message to the broadcast function.\nAn originating UE or Application Server may request the recipient UE(s) to acknowledge reception of the message. If such a request is made, a message delivery status report shall be sent by the recipient MSGin5G UE or the Message Gateway (on behalf of the Non-MSGin5G UE) as a point-to-point message back to the originating UE or Application Server. The acknolwedgement information is included in the payload and the format of this information is out of scope of the present specification.\nThe Non-MSGin5G UE may respond to an incoming MSGin5G message; it is subject to the Message Gateway implementation to maintain the transaction of the incoming MSGin5G message and reply to it to the sender, with the response it receives from the Non-MSGin5G UE.\n",

The system includes a central node (CNode) responsible for routing and forwarding messages, as well as a set of edge nodes (ENodes) that connect to the CNode and forward data packets to the appropriate destination. The figure also shows the use of a routing protocol (e.g., OLSR or OLSR-based) to ensure efficient data delivery.\nFigure 8.7.1.1-1 Message delivery between MSGin5G UEs\n1.\tThe MSGin5G Client 1 sends an MSGin5G message request to MSGin5G Server as specified in clause 8.3.2 with following clarifications:\na)\tThe MSGin5G message request includes Originating UE Service ID, Recipient UE Service ID and Message ID information elements in Table 8.3.2-1, and may include Delivery status required, Application ID, Payload, Priority type information elements from Table 8.3.2-1.\nb)\tUpon receiving the MSGin5G message request, the MSGin5G Server determines if the MSGin5G Client 1 is authorized to send a message to MSGin5G Client 2.\n2.\tThe MSGin5G Server forwards the MSGin5G message request to MSGin5G Client 2 as specified in clause 8.3.3.\n3.\tIf Delivery status required is included in the MSGin5G message request, MSGin5G Client 2 sends MSGin5G message delivery status report to the MSGin5G Server as specified in clause 8.3.4 and then the MSGin5G Server sends MSGin5G message delivery status report to MSGin5G Client 1 as specified in clause 8.3.5.\n\nFigure 8.7.1.2-1 shows the message delivery procedure from MSGin5G UE to Legacy 3GPP UE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMSGin5G Client in MSGin5G UE has registered with the MSGin5G Server and the Message Gateway has registered with the MSGin5G Server on behalf of the Legacy 3GPP UE.\n2.\tLegacy 3GPP Message Gateway is aware of the UE Service ID of Legacy 3GPP UE and maintains the mapping to IDs used in the legacy network.\n\nThe figure depicts a message delivery scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the use of the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) protocol for data transmission. The figure shows a UE (User Equipment) from the 5G network, which is connected to a Legacy 3GPP UE, representing the legacy network. The message is being transmitted from the 5G UE to the Legacy UE, illustrating the use of the 3GPP protocol for data transmission.\nFigure 8.7.1.2-1: Message delivery from MSGin5G UE to Legacy 3GPP UE\n1.\tThe MSGin5G Client sends an MSGin5G message request to the MSGin5G Server as specified in clause 8.3.2 with following clarifications:\na)\tThe MSGin5G message request includes Originating UE Service ID, Recipient UE Service ID and Message ID information elements in Table 8.3.2-1, and may include Delivery status required, Application ID, Payload, Priority type information elements from Table 8.3.2-1.\n2.\tUpon receiving the MSGin5G message request, the MSGin5G Server determines if the MSGin5G Client is authorized to send a message to the recipient UE.\n3.\tThe MSGin5G Server forwards the MSGin5G message request to the recipient based on the UE Service ID. The Legacy 3GPP Gateway receives the MSGin5G message request on behalf of the Legacy 3GPP UE as specified in 8.3.3.\n4.\tThe Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway determines which legacy 3GPP message delivery mechanism (e.g. SMS, NIDD, Device triggering) will be used based on Legacy 3GPP UE capability, the UE communication status, and the MSGin5G Service configuration. When selected, the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway maps the UE Service ID to the corresponding identifier. For example (not an exhaustive list):\na)\tif the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway selected the device triggering delivery mechanism, it maps the UE Service ID to MSISDN and Application port ID\nb)\tif the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway selected the NIDD delivery mechanism, it maps the UE Service ID to External Identifier or MSISDN.\nc)\tif the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway selected the SMS delivery mechanism, it maps the UE Service ID to MSISDN.\n5-7. The Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway sends the payload of the MSGin5G message to the terminating Legacy 3GPP UE using the determined delivery mechanism. For example:\na)\tFor Device triggering delivery mechanism, the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway interacts with the MTC-IWF/SCEF/NEF and maps the payload of the MSGin5G message to one or more Device Triggering requests. The MTC-IWF/SCEF/NEF interacts with SMS-SC for delivery to the UE and to receive the message delivery status report (see TS 23.682 [8] clause 5.2, TS 29.122 [9] clause 4.4.6 and TS 29.522 [10] clause 4.4.3)\nb)\tFor NIDD delivery mechanism, the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway may interact with the SCEF/NEF and maps the payload of the MSGin5G message to one or more NIDD submit request messages. The Reliable Data Service Configuration, Maximum Latency, Priority, PDN Connection Establishment Option settings are based on pre-configurations (see TS 23.682 [8] clause 5.13, TS 29.122 [9] clause 4.4.5.3 and TS 29.522 [10] clause 4.4.12.3). Alternatively, if tunnel parameters are provisioned in the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway and UPF/P-GW the payload could be tunnelled via the UPF/P-GW (see TS 23.401 [11] (clause 4.3.17.8.3.3), TS 23.501[12] clause 5.6.10.3, TS 23.502 [7] clause 4.24);\nc)\tFor SMS delivery mechanism, the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway sends SMS to the Legacy 3GPP UE through the SMSC according to the procedure in TS 23.204 [13] or the procedure in clause 4.13.3 of TS 23.502 [7].\n8.\tIf Delivery status required is included in the MSGin5G message request, the Legacy 3GPP Message Gateway sends the MSGin5G message delivery status report to the MSGin5G Server as specified in clause 8.3.4 and then the MSGin5G Server sends the message delivery status report to the MSGin5G Client as specified in clause 8.3.5.\nFigure 8.7.1.3-1 shows the message delivery procedure from MSGin5G UE to Non-3GPP UE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMSGin5G Client in MSGin5G UE has registered with the MSGin5G Server and the Non-3GPP Message Gateway has registered with the MSGin5G Server on behalf of the Non-3GPP UE.\n2.\tNon-3GPP Message Gateway is aware of the non-3GPP message client in Non-3GPP UE and provides the mapping to UE Service ID.\nThe figure depicts a message delivery scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the various components involved in the delivery process. The figure includes a 5G UE (User Equipment) that sends a message to a Non-3GPP UE, which is a non-3GPP network device. The message is then relayed through the 5G network, passing through various layers of the network, including the 5G core, OLTs (Optical Line Terminals), and the 3GPP network. The figure also shows the use of beamforming techniques to improve the signal quality and reduce interference.\nFigure 8.7.1.3-1 Message Delivery from MSGin5G UE to Non-3GPP UE\n1.\tThe Application Client in the MSGin5G UE triggers the MSGin5G Client to send an MSGin5G message request to the MSGin5G Server as specified in 8.3.2 with following clarifications:\na)\tThe MSGin5G message request includes Originating UE Service ID, Recipient UE Service ID and Message ID information elements in Table 8.3.2-1, and may include Delivery status required, Application ID, Payload, Priority type information elements from Table 8.3.2-1.\n2.\tThe MSGin5G Server determines if the MSGin5G Client is authorized to send a message to the recipient UE.\n3.\tThe MSGin5G Server forwards the MSGin5G message request to the recipient based on the UE Service ID. The Non-3GPP Message Gateway receives the MSGin5G message request on behalf of the Non-3GPP UE as specified in clause 8.6.1.\n4.\tThe Non-3GPP Message Gateway translates the MSGin5G message to the Non-3GPP message with message delivery status report, if appropriate, requested and sends it to the Non-3GPP Message Client.

The sender initiates the request for reachability status, and the receiver responds with the status of the request. The figure shows the different stages of the protocol, including the sender sending the request, the receiver receiving the request, and the sender confirming the response. The figure is a visual aid for understanding the protocol's flow and its components.\nFigure 8.9.2.2.1-1: MSGin5G reachability status request-response.\n\n1.\tThe MSGin5G Server sends a one-time Monitoring Request to the 3GPP Network using SCEF/NEF capabilities.\nThe one-time Monitoring Request includes monitoring type set to UE_REACHABILITY, Maximum Number of Reports of 1 and does not include the Monitoring Duration IE.\n2.\tThe 3GPP network processes the monitoring request and determines the reachability status of the UE(s), as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [9].\n3.\tIf the Monitoring Request is successfully processed, a monitoring response providing the UE(s) reachability status is sent to the MSGin5G Server.

The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure 8.9.2.2.3-1: MSGin5G reachability status notify.\n1.\tBased on the reachability status change of a monitored UE(s), the 3GPP Network sends a Monitoring Notification message for UE reachability to the MSGin5G Server as specified in 3GPP TS 29.122 [9].\nThe notification may include idle mode information e.g., active time granted to the UE, eDRX cycle length, periodic RAU/TAU timer, depending on the subscription.\n2.\tAfter receiving a UE Reachability monitoring notification, the MSGin5G Server responds with an acknowledgement of the notification via SCEF/NEF.\n3.\tThe MSGin5G Server uses the information provided in the UE reachability monitoring event report to update its information on the UE's availability, e.g., MSGin5G Client Availability information. The MSGin5G Server may provide additional services based on reachability information, e.g., forward a stored message.\nFigure 8.9.2.2.4-1 shows the procedure which may be used by the MSGin5G Server to unsubscribe from monitoring of UE reachability.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MSGin5G Server has subscribed for reachability status monitoring for a UE or group of UEs.\n2.\tLater, the MSGin5G Server unsubscribes for monitoring of UE reachability events in the Core Network, based on the information received from the Application Server or MSGin5G Client.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the MSGin5G Server subscribes or unsubscribes for monitoring of UE reachability events in the Core Network is implementation dependent.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the initial MSGin5G Server subscription for reachability status monitoring reaches the Maximum Number of Reports or Monitoring Duration indicated in the request, the 3GPP Network automatically deletes the subscription and an explicit MSGin5G reachability status unsubscribe is not necessary.\n\n\nThe figure depicts the reachability status of MSGin5G, a protocol used in 5G networks, with a focus on the 2.4-1 range. The status is shown as \"unsubscribe,\" indicating that the user has unsubscribed from the MSGin5G service.\nFigure 8.9.2.2.4-1: MSGin5G reachability status unsubscribe.\n1.\tThe MSGin5G Server sends a Monitoring event unsubscribe request to the 3GPP Network using existing SCEF/NEF capabilities.\n2.\tThe 3GPP network processes the Monitoring event unsubscribe request and deletes the subscription, as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [9].\n3.\tIf the Monitoring event unsubscribe request is successfully processed, a response indicating the subscription was deleted is sent to the MSGin5G Server via SCEF/NEF.\nThe following information flows are specified for UE reachability status monitoring:\n-\tUE Reachability monitoring request and response;\n-\tUE Reachability monitoring subscribe and unsubscribe\n-\tUE Reachability monitoring notify\nAll UE reachability monitoring interactions from MSGin5G Server (acting as SCS/AS) to SCEF/NEF occur over T8/N33 reference points capabilities detailed in 3GPP TS 23.502 [7] and TS 29.522[10].

For example, when an Application Server initiates an MSGin5G message request, but the target MSGin5G UE is not reachable, the MSGin5G Server may use the 3GPP network device triggering mechanism to wake up the device and then deliver the payload to the destination.\nFigure 8.9.3.2-1 shows the MSGin5G device triggering procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe target UE is an MSGin5G UE.\n2.\tThe target MSGin5G Client is registered with the MSGin5G Server.\n3.\tAt a later time, after the registration is completed, the MSGin5G UE has become unreachable by the MSGin5G Server.\nThe figure depicts the triggering procedure for MSGin5G, a protocol used in 5G networks for data transmission. It illustrates the steps involved in initiating a data transmission, including the use of a trigger signal. The figure shows the signal path, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, and highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 8.9.3.2-1: MSGin5G Triggering Procedure\n1.\tThe MSGin5G Server receives a request for sending an MSGin5G message, the request includes the IEs as detailed in clause 9.1.2.1.\n2.\tIf the MSGin5G Server determines that the recipient MSGin5G Client is not reachable, it initiates a device trigger request via the SCEF/NEF.\nTo determine the reachability of the target MSGin5G UE, the MSGin5G Server may use the UE reachability status monitoring procedure in clause 8.9.2. The MSGin5G Server may also use availability information provided by the MSGin5G Client at registration in the MSGin5G Client Communication Availability IE, as detailed in Table 8.2.1-1.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the MSGin5G Server uses the MSGin5G Client Communication Availability IE, the UE reachability status monitoring procedure, or a combination thereof to make this determination is implementation specific.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the recipient MSGin5G Client is reachable then the trigger request is not required, the MSGin5G Server sends the MSGin5G message as detailed in clause 8.3.3 and the rest of the steps in this procedure are skipped.\n3.\tThe MSGin5G Server sends a request for Device Triggering via SCEF/NEF and determines the flow as detailed in clause 8.9.3.2.

The targeted MSGin5G Client or Application Client receives the device trigger request. The targeted MSGin5G Client or Application Client parses the payload of the trigger request and determines the device trigger purpose. The target UE becomes reachable, and the MSGin5G Client or Application Client becomes available for further MSGin5G communications.\n6.\tThe MSGin5G Server receives a Device Triggering delivery status report from SCEF/NEF indicating the success of the delivery, as detailed in clause 8.9.3.3.\n7.\tThe MSGin5G Server send a Device Triggering delivery status report response to SCEF/NEF to acknowledge the delivery status report, as detailed in clause 8.9.3.3.\nBased on the trigger purpose derived from the payload, the targeted MSGin5G Client performs the corresponding actions (e.g. establish access network connectivity, contact the Application Server).\nThe following information flows are specified for MSGin5G triggering:\n1.\trequest for device triggering;\n2.\tresponse to device triggering;\n3.\tdevice triggering delivery report; and\n4.\tdevice triggering delivery report response.\nAll device triggering interactions from MSGin5G Server (acting as SCS/AS) to SCEF/NEF occur over T8/N33 reference points, using capabilities detailed in 3GPP TS 23.502 [7] and TS 29.522[10].

The MSGin5G server(s) may be supporting multiple Application Servers.\nFigure 11.2-1 illustrates the deployment of multiple MSGin5G Servers in a single PLMN operator domain. Each MSGin5G Server serves a part of MSGin5G service subscribers (including the subscriber using the MSGin5G UE or Non-MSGin5G UE) in this PLMN operator domain. In this deployment, the MSGin5G Servers shall be connected with each other to provide the MSGin5G service to all MSGin5G service subscribers in the PLMN operator domain.
