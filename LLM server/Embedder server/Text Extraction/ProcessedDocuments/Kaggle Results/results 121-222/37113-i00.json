A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].\nAncillary equipment: Equipment (apparatus), used in connection with a receiver, transmitter or transceiver is considered as an ancillary equipment (apparatus) if:\n-\tthe equipment is intended for use in conjunction with a receiver, transmitter or transceiver to provide additional operational and/or control features to the radio equipment, (e.g. to extend control to another position or location); and\n-\tthe equipment cannot be used on a stand-alone basis to provide user functions independently of a receiver, transmitter or transceiver; and\n-\tthe receiver, transmitter or transceiver to which it is connected, is capable of providing some intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub-unit of the main equipment essential to the main equipment basic functions).\nantenna connector: connector at the conducted interface of the BS type 1-C\nBand category: group of operating bands for which the same MSR scenarios apply\nBase Station equipment: Radio and/or ancillary equipment intended for operation at a fixed location and powered directly or indirectly (e.g. via an AC/DC converter or power supply) by AC mains network, or an extended local DC mains network.\nBase Station RF bandwidth: The bandwidth in which a Base Station transmits and/or receives multiple carriers and/or RATs simultaneously.\nBase Station RF bandwidth edge: The frequency of one of the edges of the Base Station RF bandwidth.\nBS type 1-C: NR base station operating at FR1 with requirements set consisting only of conducted requirements defined at individual antenna connectors.\nChannel bandwidth: The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.\nContinuous phenomena (continuous disturbance): Electromagnetic disturbance, the effects of which on a particular device or equipment cannot be resolved into a succession of distinct effects (IEC 60050-161 [14]).\nLower RF bandwidth edge:  The frequency of the lower edge of the Base Station RF bandwidth, used as a frequency reference point for transmitter and receiver requirements.\nMaximum Base Station RF bandwidth: The maximum RF bandwidth supported by a BS within an operating band.\nMaximum throughput: The maximum achievable throughput for a reference measurement channel.\nMB-MSR Base Station: MSR Base Station characterized by the ability of its transmitter and/or receiver to process two or more carriers in common active RF components simultaneously, where at least one carrier is configured at a different non-overlapping operating band than the other carrier(s).\nMSR Base station: Base Station characterized by the ability of its receiver and transmitter to process two or more carriers in common active RF components simultaneously in a declared RF bandwidth, where at least one carrier is of a different RAT than the other carrier(s).\nNOTE:\tA Base Station where receiver or transmitter processes carriers of different RATs simultaneously, but not through common active RF components, is not an MSR BS according to the above definition. Such a BS is in the present specification referred to as \"other BS supporting more than one RAT\".\nNB-IoT In-band operation: NB-IoT is operating in-band when it utilizes the resource block(s) within a normal E-UTRA carrier.\nNB-IoT guard band operation: NB-IoT is operating in guard band when it utilizes the unused resource block(s) within an E-UTRA carrier's guard-band.\nNB-IoT standalone operation: NB-IoT is operating standalone when it utilizes its own spectrum, for example the spectrum currently being used by GERAN systems as a replacement of one or more GSM carriers, as well as scattered spectrum for potential IoT deployment.\nRadio communications equipment: Telecommunications equipment which includes one or more transmitters and/or receivers and/or parts thereof for use in a fixed, mobile or portable application. It can be operated with ancillary equipment but if so, is not dependent on it for basic functionality.\nRadio equipment: Equipment which contains Radio digital unit and Radio unit.\nRadio digital unit: Equipment which contains base band and functionality for controlling Radio unit.\nRadio unit: Equipment which contains transmitter and/or receiver.\nPort: A particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is considered as a port (see figure 3.1.1).\nReceiver exclusion band: The receiver exclusion band is the band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made. The exclusion band for receivers is expressed relative to the base station receive band.\nSignal and control port: Port which carries information or control signals, excluding antenna ports.\nTelecommunication port: Ports which are intended to be connected to telecommunication networks (e.g. public switched telecommunication networks, integrated services digital networks), local area networks (e.g. Ethernet, Token Ring) and similar networks.\nNOTE:\tTelecommunication port is called \"wired network port\" in CISPR 32 [34].\nThroughput: The number of payload bits successfully received per second for a reference measurement channel in a specified reference condition.\nTransient phenomena: Pertaining to or designating a phenomena or a quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 [14]).\nTransmitter exclusion band: The transmitter exclusion band is the band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made. The exclusion band for transmitters is expressed relative to the carrier frequencies used (the carrier frequencies of the base stations activated transmitter(s)).\nUpper RF bandwidth edge: The frequency of the upper edge of the Base Station RF bandwidth, used as a frequency reference point for transmitter and receiver requirements.\nFigure 3.1-1 illustrates various ports in a 5G network, highlighting their functionalities and connections.\nFigure 3.1-1: Examples of ports\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a single BS (base station) solution, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. The figure shows the signal path, including the base station, user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 3.1-2: BS with single enclosure solution\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with a BS (base station) and multiple enclosures, illustrating the signal propagation in a multi-path environment. The BS is equipped with beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, while the enclosures are designed to provide redundancy and failover reliability. The layered architecture aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and automation.\nFigure 3.1-3: BS with multiple enclosure solution\n",
