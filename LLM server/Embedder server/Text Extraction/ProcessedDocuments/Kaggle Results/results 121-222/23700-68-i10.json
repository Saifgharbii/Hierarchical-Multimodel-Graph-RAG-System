                            "text_content": "This is an updated procedure based on clause 4.8.3 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe figure depicts the RRC state transition notification process in a 5G network, illustrating the steps involved in updating the radio resource control (RRC) state. The process is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable communication, as it allows the network to react to changes in the radio environment.\nFigure 6.1.3.1-1: RRC state transition notification\n1.\tThe AMF sends a N2 Request to the NG-RAN (i.e. gNB) to request the RRC state transition report as described in TS 38.413 [6] (e.g. when AMF provides RRC Inactive Assistance Information for UE with reduced NR capability and has negotiated extended DRX longer than 10.24s).\n2.\tThe NG-RAN sends the UE Notification message to report the current RRC state for the UE (i.e. RRC Inactive state or RRC Connected state).\nWhen NG-RAN reports RRC Inactive state for a UE using extended DRX longer than 10.24s in RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN includes also the extended DRX information (i.e. eDRX cycle value and Paging Time Window) which triggers CN based MT signalling and data handling as in step 3 below.\n2b.\tWhen the AMF has requested reporting about subsequent state transitions, the NG-RAN sends subsequent UE Notification messages to the AMF at every RRC state transition until the UE transitions to CM-IDLE or NG-RAN receives a Cancel UE State Notification message from the AMF.\nNOTE:\tIf the NG-RAN receives downlink data when executing step 3a/3b, the handling of such downlink data is implementation dependent.\n3a.\tIf the AMF receives extended DRX information when UE enters RRC Inactive state, the AMF stores the extended DRX information for RRC Inactive state and sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request to the SMF enabling the data buffering. When UE enters RRC Connected state, the AMF also sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request to SMF enabling the data delivery.\n3b.\tIf data buffering is handled in UPF, the SMF updates the UPF with proper rules for MT data handling.\n3c.\tThe SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\n4.\tThe AMF can send a Cancel UE State Notification message to inform the NG-RAN that it should terminate notifications for a given UE when such report is not needed.\nThis is an updated procedure based on clause 4.8.2.2a of TS 23.502 [3] with enhancement for UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state and eDRX is longer than 10.24s.\nThe Network Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure is used when the network needs to signal (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or downlink user plane PDU) with a UE in the RRC Inactive state. When the procedure is triggered by other NFs (e.g. SMSF, LMF, GMLC), the UPF (or SMF) in the following figure should be replaced by the respective NF (the corresponding services operations used by other NFs when they communicate with AMF may also be different from the service operation used by SMF/UPF). During the procedure, the NG-RAN (i.e. gNB) sends a RAN Paging to the UE in order to trigger the Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure.\nThe figure depicts a network-triggered connection resume for an UE in a Radio Resource Control (RRC) inactive scenario. The network-triggered connection resume is a feature that allows the UE to reconnect to the network after a temporary interruption due to RRC inactivity. This can be useful in scenarios where the UE needs to reestablish communication with the network, such as when the UE is in a location with poor network connectivity or when the network is experiencing network congestion. The figure shows the steps involved in the connection resume process, including the UE initiating the connection, the network identifying the UE, and the RRC initiating the connection. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network topology, showing the connections between the UE and the network.\nFigure 6.1.3.2-1a: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in RRC Inactive\nThe figure depicts a network-triggered connection resume for an UE in a Radio Resource Control (RRC) inactive scenario. The network-triggered connection resume is a feature that allows an UE to reconnect to a network after a temporary interruption due to RRC inactivity. This feature is crucial for ensuring seamless communication in a network, especially in scenarios where the network is experiencing temporary disruptions. The figure shows the steps involved in the connection resume process, including the UE initiating the connection, the network identifying the UE, and the RRC acknowledging the connection. The figure also highlights the importance of network-triggered connections in ensuring reliable communication in a network.\nFigure 6.1.3.2-1b: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in RRC Inactive\n1.\tWhen downlink data is received and the SMF/UPF is requested to perform buffering as specified in clause 6.1.3.1 above, UPF/SMF checks with AMF for the possibility of data delivery, similar to step 2 of clause 4.24.2 of TS 23.502 [3] with the following differences:\n-\tIf AMF determines that UE is not reachable in RRC INACTIVE state, the AMF provides the Estimated Maximum Wait time in the response message based on the stored extended DRX information for RRC INACTIVE in AMF (see clause 6.1.3.1 above). This handling is similar to CM-IDLE with eDRX. When the AMF provides the Estimated Maximum Wait time, it can consider the time needed for RRC level procedures (e.g. RRC RNA update procedure) when UE wakes up from the eDRX cycle.\n2.\tWhen the AMF determines the UE reachable based on the stored extended DRX inform for RRC INACTIVE, the AMF informs SMF/UPF to deliver data. The NG-RAN receives downlink data (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or the user plane PDU) for a UE in RRC INACTIVE State, the NG-RAN buffers the downlink data and triggers RAN Paging message.\nAs an alternative option, the AMF may notify the NG-RAN of MT service which can trigger the NG-RAN Paging. Then step for downlink data delivery will be executed after UE enters RRC_CONNECTED mode as show in figure 6.1.3.2-1b above when SMF/UPF receives the notification as specified in step 3 of clause 6.1.3.1 above.\n3.\tThe NG-RAN sends the RAN Paging message to the UE.\n4.\tIf the UE is in RRC Inactive State, based on the RAN paging, the UE initiates the UE Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure (see clause 4.8.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]). In case of RRC Resume failure, a NAS procedure is triggered by UE to enter RRC_CONNECTED state.\n",

The message may need to be extended to include that the failure was due to eDRX configuration. TSG RAN3 is responsible for N2 messages and their format.\n-\tIf MT NAS message can't be delivered to the UE within the NAS retransmission timer range i.e. <10.24s), then RAN triggers the UE context release (N2 msg - UE context release request), with cause value indicating that the UE is not currently reachable for MT signalling.\nNOTE 2:\tThe N2 message used to deliver the failure could be the UE Context Release Request message which RAN use to notify the AMF of RAN paging failure. The message may need to be extended to include that the failure was due to eDRX configuration. Sending an N2 notification instead of UE Context release request could be an alternative to prevent that the UE is moved to CM-Idle state in the AMF. TSG RAN3 is responsible for N2 messages and their format.\n-\tAs long as the RAN has not initiated UE context release, the Core Network behaves as in CM-CONNECTED state as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\nEditor's note:\tThis solution is based on extensive re-use of the existing procedures and therefore assumes HLcom procedures in CM-IDLE state. The support of HLcom in CM-CONNECTED state can be studied in separate solution and if found to be feasible, such solution is expected to be compatible with this solution.\n-\tAfter the UE context release, the Core network moves to CM-IDLE state, where it can initiate HLcom procedures, see clause 5.31.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tThe Support of HLcom feature in CM-IDLE depends on AMF and SMF supports the corresponding HLcom features as the support of HLcom feature is optional for the network. The AMF selection is done during the registration procedure and could be based on a combination of request for long eDRX and the 'NR RedCap indication' provided by RAN as specified in rel-17.\nRAN is responsible for RAN based paging within a RAN Notification Area (RNA). Long eDRX may increase the possibility that the UE has moved outside the RNA and possibly further away from the RNA. It is proposed that UE mobility and buffered MT data in the old RAN anchor Node should be handled based on the following principles:\n-\tIf the new gNB, inside or outside the RNA, has an Xn interface between the old RAN anchor node and the new gNB, then the new gNB can retrieve the UE context (as specified in TS 38.413 [6]) and also retrieve the MT data that has been buffered in the old gNB and delivers the data to the UE.\n-\tIf the new gNB is outside the RNA and has NOT an Xn interface between the new gNB and old RAN anchor node, the new gNB is not able to retrieve the UE context and extended buffered Data from the old RAN anchor node. To avoid systematic failure to deliver the extended buffered data to the UE, it is proposed that the new gNB can request assistance from the Core Network in retrieving the UE context and extended buffered data.\nNOTE 4: UE context retrieval via CN needs to be coordinated with RAN WGs\n-\tIn addition to the new gNB requesting assistance to retrieve the buffered data, the old gNB may request the AMF to escalate the paging in a wider area. The old RAN node may include, in the N2 message, how many POs that remains in the PTW.\nNOTE 5:\tTo make efficient use of this alternative, the N2 message should be sent while there are POs remaining in the PTW.\n",

NG-RAN also determines the buffer timer which is used to indicate the time needed for SMF/UPF to buffer the MT data. Before transitioning the UE into RRC_Inactive state, NG-RAN sends the buffer indicator and buffer timer to the AMF to enable data buffering in Core Network.\nThen when MT data arrives, the SMF/UPF will buffer the MT data and forward the buffered data to NG-RAN to trigger RAN based paging when the buffer timer expires. If the UE moves out of the original NG-RAN, the data is transfer between the original and new NG-RAN nodes as needed.\nIf there is a MO data when the UE is during the eDRX in RRC_Inactive state, the NG-RAN forwards the MO data to UPF to disable the data buffering and any MT buffered data is sent to RAN. If the UE enters RRC_CONNECTED without MO data then then RAN can inform the AMF that the UE is no longer in RRC_Inactive and that can trigger delivery of buffered MT to RAN or delivery of MT signalling.\nThe AMF stores an indication of when the UE is in RRC_Inactive with a long eDRX cycle and uses that indication to determine how to handle paging, how to respond to reachability and event exposure requests, enabling the use of HLcom and SMS over NAS with long eDRX cycles in RRC_Inactive.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in handling MT data, including the use of a data buffer, data rate control, and error handling. The figure is crucial for understanding the process and ensuring efficient data handling in such scenarios.\nFigure 6.3.2-1: high level procedure for MT data handling of UE with long eDRX in RRC_Inactive state\n1.\tThe UE initiates the Registration Procedure and the eDRX parameters in CM-IDLE state are negotiated.\n2.\tThe AMF sends the Inactive Assistance Information to the NG-RAN. The eDRX parameters in CM-IDLE state are included as defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\n3.\tBefore transitioning the UE into RRC_Inactive state, NG-RAN determines the eDRX parameters for UE in RRC_Inactive state.\n4.\tIf the eDRX cycle in RRC_Inactive state is larger than 10.24s, NG-RAN may send the N2 message to inform the AMF that UE is entering RRC_Inactive state to enable CN buffering. The buffer indicator and the buffer timer are included to indicate to the AMF to enable data buffering until the buffer timer expires. The CM state of the UE is not update by the indication from NG-RAN, i.e. the UE remains in CM-CONNECTED.\n5.\tIf the AMF receives the notification from NG-RAN that the UE will enter RRC_Inactive state and need to buffer downlink data in the CN, AMF sends the buffer indication and buffer timer to SMF to enable data buffering. The AMF stores an indication that the UE is in RRC_Inactive state with a long eDRX cycle and is therefore not reachable until buffer timer expires. Optionally, the buffer timer contains an initial buffer timer (i.e. time until the start of the first PTW) and re-buffer timer (i.e. the eDRX cycle length time between the start of subsequent PTWs) for the case when the UE remains in RRC_Inactive.\nIf the AMF receives a Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe request for UE Reachability or Availability after DDN failure and if the AMF has stored the indication that the UE is in RRC_Inactive with a long eDRX cycle then the AMF treats the request as if the UE was in CM_IDLE and sends any responses or events for when UE can be paged (i.e. buffer timer expires).\nFor MT signalling the AMF takes into account the indication that the UE is in RRC_Inactive state with a long eDRX cycle and triggers the MT signalling for when UE can be paged (i.e. buffer timer expires).\nIf the AMF receives a Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability Request while the AMF has an indication that the UE is in RRC_Inactive with a long eDRX cycle, then the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability Response is sent back to the requesting NF that the UE is not reachable until when UE can be paged (i.e. buffer timer expires).\n6.\tThe SMF may configure UPF with the new Buffering Action Rule and buffer timer to enable downlink data buffering for the UE until the buffer timer expires.\n7.\tBased on the new BAR and buffer timer, the UPF starts the buffer timer with the initial buffer timer and enables data buffering for the UE in RRC_Inactive state.\nNOTE:\tWhen the initial buffer timer expires and there is no DL buffered data, the buffer timer is always restarted with the re-buffer timer value, unless there is a new value from RAN.\n8.\tThe UE may be moved to RRC_Inactive state. This step may occur in parallel with steps 4 - 7. In case the UE was moved to RRC_Inactive state before the UPF was reconfigured, the RAN node may buffer DL data that is forwarded to the RAN node for the duration of the eDRX cycle or discard the data based on RAN configuration.\n9.\tWhen MT data arrives at the UPF, the UPF buffers it until the buffer timer expires.\n10.\tThe UPF may forward the buffered data to the NG-RAN when the buffer timer expires, so NG-RAN can trigger paging for the UE in time. The NG-RAN node buffers the data from the UPF during the paging procedure.\n11.\tThe NG-RAN sends the RAN Paging message to the UE.\n12.\tThe UE responds to paging from RAN.\n13.\tThe response to paging may not be in the same RAN node which moved the UE to RRC_Inactive state. If the UE has moved away from of the RAN node that moved the UE to RRC_Inactive state, the UE will initiate the RNAU procedure and the context will be transferred between the original RAN node and the new RAN node.\nIf there is no Xn interface between the original and the new RAN nodes, the Core Network can be used to transfer the UE context or buffered data from the original RAN node to the new RAN node. For the UE context in the original RAN node, the AMF can help to retrieve the UE context from the original RAN node and send it to the new RAN node in a container. Similarly, an indirect data forwarding path is built from the original RAN node, the anchor UPF and the new RAN node to enable the buffered data to be transferred.\n14.\tThe MT data is sent to UE.\n15.\tIf there is MO data/signalling triggered connection resume between UE and NG-RAN, the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state.\n16.\tThe NG-RAN notifies the AMF that the UE's RRC state has been changed from RRC_Inactive to RRC_CONNECTED state.\n17.\tThe AMF may also initiate the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service to notify SMF about the state change.\n18.\tAccordingly, the SMF decides disables the data buffering in the UPF and the UPF sends the any buffered data to RAN.\n19.\tIf the UE initiated connection resume is triggered by UL data traffic, the NG-RAN sends the UL data to the UPF, which triggers the UPF to disable the data buffering and forward any DL traffic.\n",

The key benefits for RRC-Inactive/CM-Connected compared to RRC-Idle/CM-Idle are the following:\n-\tUE can resume the AS connection without performing e.g. AS security setup, and save several RRC message interactions between the UE and RAN.\n-\tThere is no RAN and CN interaction when the UE change state RRC-Inactive to/from RRC-Connected, if not required.\n-\tUser plane reconfiguration is not needed.\nThe area in which the UE move around in without the UE needs to perform Update due to mobility maybe much smaller than compared to RRC-Idle. In RRC-Inactive the area is defined by the Radio Notification Area (RNA) consisting of a set of RAN nodes. In RRC-Idle then the area is the whole Registered Area (RA) consisting of a set of Tracking Areas. This may result in more frequent Updates due to mobility.\n",

                            "text_content": "Two methods of buffering are proposed in the solutions with the main difference being DL data buffering in RAN or in the CN. Solution 2 and solution 5 allow buffering of the DL data in RAN. Solutions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 allows DL data in the Core Network either in the SMF or UPF in RRC_INACATIVE state.\nTo enable DL data buffering in the Core Network, the RAN needs to signal to the AMF that the UE has changed its RRC state to RRC-Inactive with long eDRX. This initial N2 message will trigger the communication among CN NFs i.e. the AMF uses the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to trigger the SMF to start the modification procedure towards UPF. Solution 4 and 6 ends these steps after the N2 response from the AMF to the RAN which allows the RAN to release the UE to RRC-Inactive. Solution 1 and 3 performs the these steps either after the UE is released or in parallel to that the UE is released. For solution 1 and 3 there is a risk that DL data can be forwarded to RAN after the UE is released which means that this DL data needs to be buffered in RAN or discarded by RAN.\nThe UE CM state in the AMF after this indication from RAN differs. Solutions 1, 3 and 5 leave the AMF in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF knows that the UE is not reachable due to long eDRX and can apply the same procedures specified for UE that is unreachable in CM-IDLE state. Solution 4 moves the AMF to CM-IDLE with RRC-Inactive where selected CM-IDLE state procedures are applicable. Solution 6 moves the AMF to new substate of CM-CONNECTED state where the AMF can apply the same procedures specified for UE that is unreachable in CM-IDLE state. Solution 2 can move the UE to CM-IDLE based on a RANs decision and allow the CN to buffer using the existing procedures, however the UE is no longer in RRC_Inactive.\nThe advantage of DL data buffering in UPF/SMF is that it has already been specified for 5G-CIoT devices. It is expected that the existing HLcom mechanism can be re-used for extended CN buffering.\nThe negative side is that enabling CN buffering would require RAN/CN interaction, exchanging 5- 6 messages every time the UE change RRC state from RRC-Connected to RRC-Inactive and 6 more messages every time the UE resumes to RRC-Connected. This RAN/CN signalling is independent of whether or not any DL data was sent to the UE.\nRAN is specified from Rel-15 to buffer DL data when the UE is released to RRC-Inactive.\nThe advantage of having the DL data buffering in RAN is that this is legacy behaviour for a UE in RRC-Inactive. There is no RAN/CN interaction when the UE change RRC state between RRC-Connected - RRC-Inactive - RRC-Connected. Thus, extending this capability means extending the buffering capacity of RAN . Furthermore, Solution 2 allows a deployment where RAN decides whether to support extended buffering or not. If the RAN chooses to not support extended buffering, then CN buffering (HLcom) is used instead by releasing the UE to CM-IDLE state. In that case, the RAN informs the AMF. Solution 5 reuses existing RAN buffer capability(e.g. around 1.28 or 2.56s). When the RAN determines that it cannot buffer any more downlink data, it informs the AMF to start CN buffering. The CN is not impacted if the RAN receives very few downlink packets during the UE unreachable time.\nThe negative side with RAN buffering for a UE in RRC-Inactive is that legacy buffering is only for typically around 1.28 or 2.56s, which now will be extended to a much longer time. This may affect the accumulated amount of data to be buffered.\n",

                            "text_content": "Solution 1, 3 and 6 makes the AMF aware of the non-reachability in CM-Connected by the N2 message sent from RAN when the UE is released to RRC-Inactive with long eDRX. This allows the AMF to schedule DL NAS message considering the UE power save state in RAN. Solutions 1 and 3 expect the AMF to run a subset of idle mode procedures in CM-CONNECTED state. Solution 6 uses new CM-state in the AMF to run a subset of CM-IDLE state procedures in that new state.\nSolution 4 allows the same behaviour but avoids violating CM-CONNECTED state design principles in the AMF by introducing a new state combination RRC-Inactive/CM-IDLE with behaviour that is a subset of the AMF CM-IDLE behaviour.\nSolution 5 allows the same indication to be issued by the RAN only on event driven basis if there is DL NAS message towards the UE in long eDRX. The advantage of this approach is that if eDRX is configured for a UE and the RAN does not receive DL NAS message for the UE, then the AMF will never be aware that the UE is using long eDRX power saving. When the UE becomes reachable the RAN can trigger RAN paging without CN involvement. This may reduce the signalling latency.\nIn Solution 2 and 5 the AMF is unaware of that the UE is in RRC-Inactive state and may not be reachable for a DL NAS message. That may result in that the DL NAS message is sent towards the UE at a timing when the UE will not monitor POs until the NAS retransmission timer expires.\nTo handle this, solution 5 proposes that RAN sends a notification as a response to the DL NAS message informing the AMF about the UE power save. This is the event discussed in 7.2.2.1. The AMF may try again once the UE is reachable again. The UE remains in RRC-Inactive/CM-Connected state in the network.\nTo handle the above situation, solution 2 reuses the legacy RAN paging failure and RAN initiate the AN release procedure. The negative effect with using the RAN paging failure is that the UE is moved to CM-Idle in the CN and RRC-Idle in RAN, but the UE is still locally in RRC-Inactive/CM-Connected. When the UE tries to resume the RRC connection it will be rejected, and the UE will need to perform RRC establishment procedure followed by NAS Service Request if the UE has UL data to transmit.\n",

When the UE detects that it is outside the RNA it will perform RNA update due to mobility and the new RAN node will try to fetch the UE context based on the I-RNTI. If there is no Xn and the RAN node is unable to fetch the UE context the RAN node will reject the RRC Resume (RNAU) and the UE is moved to RRC-Idle. RAN does not inform the AMF about this. The UE will need to perform RRC establishment procedure followed by NAS Service Request if the UE has UL data to transmit. This is legacy behaviour and applies to all solutions.\nFor solutions 4 and 6 the above does not affect the handling of the buffered DL data as the DL data is buffered in the CN and the CN can use legacy CN paging after the initial RAN based paging in the old RAN node failed. Typically, the same applies to solution 1 and 3. This may cause additional signalling latency.\nSolutions 1, 2, 3 and 5 may have buffered DL data in the old RAN node and this data will be lost if nothing is done to forward the data to the new RAN node. Solution 1 proposes that the handling of the buffered DL data is done based on implementation. Solution 2 and 3 propose to specify CN assisted UE context/DL data forwarding from the old RAN node to the new RAN node.\n",
