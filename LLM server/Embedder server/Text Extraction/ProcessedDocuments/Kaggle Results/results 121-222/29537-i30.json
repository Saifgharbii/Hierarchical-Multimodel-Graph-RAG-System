It illustrates the steps involved in establishing a policy for managing the network's resources, ensuring efficient resource allocation and user experience. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the process from the initiation of the association to the final establishment of the policy. The use of arrows and labels helps to visually represent the sequence of actions and the logical flow of the process. The figure is essential for network administrators and operators to understand the steps involved in establishing a policy and to ensure that the network operates efficiently and effectively.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1: Procedure for MBS Policy Association establishment\n1.\tIn order to request the creation of an MBS Policy Association, the NF service consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) shall send an HTTP POST request to the PCF targeting the URI of the \"MBS Policies\" collection resource, with the request body containing the MbsPolicyCtxtData data structure that shall contain:\n-\tthe identifier of the concerned MBS Session, within the \"mbsSessionId\" attribute;\n-\tthe MBS Service Information, if available, within the \"mbsServInfo\" attribute;\n-\tthe list of supported features, if feature negotiation needs to take place, within the \"suppFeat\" attribute;

and\n-\tthe S-NSSAI of the MBS session, within the \"snssai\" attribute.\n2.\tUpon reception of the HTTP POST request from the NF service consumer:\n-\tif MBS Service Information is present within the \"mbsServInfo\" attribute, the MBS session is an instance of a location-dependent MBS service, and if the \"AreaSessPolicy\" feature is supported, the Area Session Policy ID is present within the \"areaSessPolId\" attribute, and the PCF is not already serving this location-dependent MBS service (i.e., there is no MBS Policy Association at the PCF for the MBS Session ID provided within \"mbsSessionId\" attribute), or if the MBS Service Information is not present, the PCF may interact with the BSF by invoking the Nbsf_Management_Register service operation, as specified in clause 4.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [21], to check whether there is already a PCF serving the MBS Session, and if it is not the case, register itself as the PCF serving the MBS session;\nNOTE 1:\tInteracting with the BSF is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF.\n-\tif MBS Service Information is present within the \"mbsServInfo\" attribute, then:\n-\tthe PCF may interact with the UDR to retrieve MBS Session policy control data for the MBS session, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [20];\nNOTE 2:\tInteracting with the UDR for MBS Session policy control data retrieval is not necessary in a deployment where MBS Policy Session policy control data is stored locally at the PCF.\n-\tthe PCF shall then perform MBS policy authorization based on the received MBS Service Information, the operator policies that are pre-configured at the PCF and the MBS Session policy control data retrieved from the UDR, if any;\n-\tif MBS policy authorization is successful, the PCF shall derive the required MBS policies (e.g. QoS parameters) and determine whether they are allowed or not;\n-\tif the required MBS policies are allowed:\n-\tthe PCF shall store the generated MBS policies for the MBS session together with the corresponding MBS session ID, and if the \"AreaSessPolicy\" feature is supported and the MBS session is an instance of a location-dependent MBS service, the corresponding Area Session Policy ID; and\n-\tif MBS policy authorization is not successful or the required MBS policies are not allowed, the PCF shall reject the request with an appropriate error response as specified below in this clause;\n-\totherwise, when MBS Service Information is not present within the \"mbsServInfo\" attribute and the PCF has previously derived the necessary MBS policies for the MBS session using the procedure defined in clause 5.3.2.2, the PCF shall provide these MBS policies in the response message returned to the NF service consumer (MB-SMF) as described below;\n-\tupon success, the PCF shall:\n-\tcreate a new \"Individual MBS Policy\" resource; and\n-\trespond to the NF service consumer with an HTTP \"201 Created\" status code including a Location header field containing the URI of the created \"Individual MBS Policy\" resource, and the response body including the MbsPolicyData data structure that shall contain:\n-\tthe received input parameters within the corresponding request body, within the \"mbsPolicyCtxtData\" attribute;\n-\tthe provisioned MBS Policy Decision containing the MBS policies derived by the PCF as defined above in this clause, within the \"mbsPolicies\" attribute; and\n-\tthe list of supported features, if feature negotiation is taking place, within the \"suppFeat\" attribute;\n-\tif errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the PCF shall apply the error handling procedures specified in clause 6.1.7;\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCF also deregisters at the BSF from being the PCF serving the MBS Session using the procedure defined in clause 4.2.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [21], if the PCF created such MBS Session binding as defined above in this clause. Interacting with the BSF to deregister from being the PCF serving the MBS Session is not necessary in a deployment with a single PCF.\nNOTE 4:\tFor a location-dependent MBS service, the PCF deregisters at the BSF from being the PCF serving the MBS Session as indicated in NOTE 3 above only if it is the last MBS Policy Association associated to the location-dependent MBS service (i.e., associated to the corresponding MBS Session ID).\n-\tif MBS Service Information is provided but is invalid, incorrect or insufficient for the PCF to perform MBS policy authorization, the PCF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response message including the ProblemDetails data structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"INVALID_MBS_SERVICE_INFO\";\n-\tif MBS Service Information is provided, but the MBS IP flow(s) description provided within the MBS Service Information cannot be handled by the PCF because the restrictions defined in clause 5.3.8 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [19] are not respected, the PCF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" status code including the ProblemDetails data structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"FILTER_RESTRICTIONS_NOT_RESPECTED\";\n-\tif from an application level point of view, the provided set of input parameters is incomplete, erroneous or missing necessary information for the PCF to perform MBS policy control, the PCF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response message including the ProblemDetails data structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"ERROR_INPUT_PARAMETERS\";\n-\tif MBS Service Information is provided but is not authorized, the PCF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" status code including the MbsExtProblemDetails data structure that shall contain:\n-\tthe ProblemDetails data structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MBS_SERVICE_INFO_NOT_AUTHORIZED\";\nand may contain:\n-\tthe AcceptableMbsServInfo data structure including the MBS Service Information that is acceptable for the PCF;\nand\n-\tif the PCF denies the creation of the \"Individual MBS Policy\" resource based on local configuration and/or operator policies, the PCF shall reject the request within an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" status code including the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails data structure set to \"MBS_POLICY_CONTEXT_DENIED\". At the reception of this error code and based on the internally configured failure actions, the NF service consumer may reject or allow, by applying local policies, the establishment of the corresponding MBS session.\nThe Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Update service operation enables the NF service consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) to request the update of an existing \"Individual MBS Policy\" resource for a multicast or a broadcast MBS session and/or report MBS Policy Decision installation and/or enforcement failure(s) to the PCF.\nThe following procedures using the Npcf_MBSPolicyControl_Update service operation are supported:\n-\tMBS Policy Association Update.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for MBS Policy Association Update, which is a crucial step in the network management process. It illustrates the steps involved in updating the MBS policy, which is the set of rules that govern the network's operation. The figure shows the various components involved, such as the MBS, the policy server, and the network management system, and the flow of data between them.

Then:\n-\tif MBS policy authorization is successful, the PCF shall determine whether updated MBS policies (e.g. QoS parameters) need to be derived and provisioned.
