            "description": "5G systems are designed and developed targeting for both mobile telephony and vertical use cases. Besides latency, reliability, and availability, UE energy efficiency is also critical to 5G. Currently, 5G devices may have to be recharged per week or day, depending on individual's usage time. In general, 5G devices consume tens of milliwatts in RRC idle/inactive state and hundreds of milliwatts in RRC connected state. Designs to prolong battery life is a necessity for improving energy efficiency as well as for better user experience.\nEnergy efficiency is even more critical for UEs without a continuous energy source, e.g., UEs using small rechargeable and single coin cell batteries. Among vertical use cases, sensors and actuators are deployed extensively for monitoring, measuring, charging, etc. Generally, their batteries are not rechargeable and expected to last at least few years as described in TR 38.875. Wearables include smart watches, rings, eHealth related devices, and medical monitoring devices. With typical battery capacity, it is challenging to sustain up to 1-2 weeks as required.\nThe power consumption depends on the configured length of wake-up periods, e.g., paging cycle. To meet the battery life requirements above, eDRX cycle with large value is expected to be used, resulting in high latency, which is not suitable for such services with requirements of both long battery life and low latency. For example, in fire detection and extinguishment use case, fire shutters shall be closed and fire sprinklers shall be turned on by the actuators within 1 to 2 seconds from the time the fire is detected by sensors, long eDRX cycle cannot meet the delay requirements. eDRX is apparently not suitable for latency-critical use cases. Thus, the intention is to study ultra-low power mechanism that can support low latency in Rel-18, e.g. lower than eDRX latency.\nCurrently, UEs need to periodically wake up once per DRX cycle, which dominates the power consumption in periods with no signalling or data traffic. If UEs are able to wake up only when they are triggered, e.g., paging, power consumption could be dramatically reduced. This can be achieved by using a wake-up signal to trigger the main radio and a separate receiver which has the ability to monitor wake-up signal with ultra-low power consumption. Main radio works for data transmission and reception, which can be turned off or set to deep sleep unless it is turned on.\nThe power consumption for monitoring wake-up signal depends on the wake-up signal design and the hardware module of the wake-up receiver used for signal detecting and processing.\nThe study should primarily target low-power WUS/WUR for power-sensitive, small form-factor devices including IoT use cases (such as industrial sensors, controllers) and wearables. Other use cases are not precluded, e.g.XR/smart glasses, smart phones.\nAs opposed to the work on UE power savings in previous releases, this study will not require existing signals to be used as WUS. All WUS solutions identified shall be able to operate in a cell supporting legacy UEs. Solutions should target substantial gains compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 UE power saving mechanisms. Other aspects such as detection performance, coverage, UE complexity, should be covered by the evaluation.\nThe study item includes the following objectives:\n-\tIdentify evaluation methodology (including the use cases) & KPIs [RAN1]\n-\tPrimarily target low-power WUS/WUR for power-sensitive, small form-factor devices including IoT use cases (such as industrial sensors, controllers) and wearables\n-\tOther use cases are not precluded\n-\tStudy and evaluate low-power wake-up receiver architectures [RAN1, RAN4]\n-\tStudy and evaluate wake-up signal designs to support wake-up receivers [RAN1, RAN4]\n-\tStudy and evaluate L1 procedures and higher layer protocol changes needed to support the wake-up signals [RAN2, RAN1]\n-\tStudy potential UE power saving gains compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 UE power saving mechanisms, the coverage availability, as well as latency impact of low-power WUR/WUS. System impact, such as network power consumption, coexistence with non-low-power-WUR UEs, network coverage/capacity/resource overhead should be included in the study [RAN1]\n-\tNote: The need for RAN2 evaluation will be triggered by RAN1 when necessary.\nUse the following terminology for future discussion,\n-\tMain radio (MR): the Tx/Rx module operating for NR signals/channels apart from signals/channel related to low-power wake-up\n-\tLP-WUR (LR): The Rx module operating for receiving/processing signals/channel related to low-power wake-up.\n",

                            "text_content": "This Clause captures the study outcome of LP-WUR RF impacts. RAN4 focus on FR1 frequency ranges as first priority, 2.6GHz is selected as an example band for evaluation purpose.\nFor evaluation purpose, RAN4 defines a new term named as guard RB for LP-WUS, which is Granularity of RB for ACS/ASCS protection. Meanwhile, the traditional guardband for NR channel bandwidth defined in Clause 5.3, TS 38.101-1 is unchanged. The LP-WUS guard RB definition can be described differently for ASCS and ACS as following:\n-\tFor ASCS guard RB, the required guard RB(s) should be blanked RB(s), which belong to WUS carrier/BW (i.e., WUS signal plus ASCS guard RB(s))\n-\tFor ACS guard RB, the required guard RB(s) are RB(s) between WUS signal edge and nearest edge of guardband of channel bandwidth\n-\tIt includes ASCS guard RB(s) (if allocated) and RBs (which could be blanked RBs or RBs used for NR transmission) between WUS carrier/BW edge and nearest edge of guardband of channel bandwidth as defined in spec TS 38.101-1\nRAN4 agrees there is no need to restrict symmetric guard RBs for interference rejection of WUS, both ACS and ASCS.\nRAN4 suggests overall bandwidth of the wake-up signal in the NR channel i.e., desired signal along with all the required guard RBs shall fit in the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration as defined in Table 5.3.2-1 of TS 38.101-1.\n\n(case 1: LP-WUS within large channel)\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a wide-sense-stationary (WUS) signal is transmitted within a narrow channel, with the WUS bandwidth being comparable to the channel bandwidth. This scenario is relevant to the analysis of the given telecommunication figure.\n(case 2: WUS within narrow channel, WUS bandwidth is comparable with channel bandwidth)\nFigure 7.1.2.1-1: Definition of the guardband of NR channel and guard RBs for both LP-WUS ACS and ASCS\n\nAdjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability to receive an NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).\nIn general, NR ACS requirement is derived based on co-existence study to meet max 5% throughput loss metric. While for LP-WUS, the purpose in the study of ACS is not for justification of co-existence between contained LP-WUS and adjacent NR carrier, but to evaluate the required guard RBs in-between the different signals. Given the WUS waveform would be different from NR signal, the traditional throughput loss metric can not be reused. Therefore, RAN4 agrees to focus on the evaluation of required guard RB rather than ACS requirements with co-existence simulation.\nFramework in RAN4 to evaluate ACS and ASCS vs guard RBs:\n-\tACS and ASCS guard RB can be evaluated based on the following aspects:\n-\tTypical filter characteristic, e.g., filter order, pass BW, cut-off frequency\n-\tGuard RB size\n-\tRF impairment can also be considered\n-\tRAN4 adopts two approaches for guard RB evaluation, i.e., filter suppression level analysis and link level simulation\n-\tAveraged power attenuation at ACS or ASCS frequency range\n-\tFFS whether SINR of the wanted signal at detector input is needed\n-\tFFS whether to use ICS instead of ASCS\n-\tFFS Coexistence-simulation-based framework can also be considered\n-\tFFS on details of coexistence study (if needed) of LP-WUS\n-\tCoverage should be considered\nRAN4 Considers a limited set of LP-WUS scenarios for study purpose in RAN4, as shown in Table 7.1.2.2-1.\nTable 7.1.2.2-1: Common LP-WUS evaluation parameters for ACS\n\nThe frequency response of 2nd to 5th order Butterworth filters are shown as below:\n\nThe figure depicts the frequency response of Butterworth filters, which are commonly used in signal processing to filter out unwanted frequencies. The filter is shown in the frequency domain, with its poles and zeros represented by the magnitude and phase of the filter coefficients.

This visual representation allows for a quick understanding of the filter's behavior, enabling a quick understanding of its characteristics.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-1: Frequency response of Butterworth filters\nFor ACS guard RB evaluation, RAN4 focuses on the LP-WUS at the edge of NR channel case, as shown in Figure 7.1.2.2-2.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a focus on LP-WUS at the edge of the NR channel. It illustrates the use of LP-WUS to improve the performance of the network by reducing the impact of noise and interference. The figure also highlights the importance of proper network planning and design to ensure optimal performance.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-2: LP-WUS at the edge of NR channel\nConclusions for RAN4 ACS guard RB analysis:\nBased on the analysis above, RAN4 observed that for 5th order filter, the guard RB number for LP-WUS ACS is in the range of 1RB ~ 6RBs for 30kHz SCS, or 2RBs ~12RBs for 15kHz SCS. For lower power, i.e., lower order filters, the required guard RBs may increase. There is no recommendation on which filter order should be considered to the baseline in SI phase.\n-\tAs the analysis from companies did not comprehensively consider all impairments, and individual results are missing the impact of one or many of the following: phase noise, non-linearity, frequency error, implementation margin. For the evaluation, companies have used OOK waveform and FSK waveform, other type of WUS signals are not used. Final conclusion on the number of guard RB is left to WI discussion.\n\nCompanies' input on simulation analysis of ACS have been presented as following:\nFilter suppression level analysis:\nFor filter suppression level calculation, the suppression level is calculated with averaged power attenuation at ACS frequency range.\n[7B-1]\nThe parameter assumption is aligned with that in Table 7.1.2.2-1. The required guard RB is provided in the Table 7.1.2.2-2 below. CFO from 0ppm~200ppm is considered as RF impairment impacts.\nTable 7.1.2.2-2: Required number of guard RBs for 5MHz ACS\n\n[7B-2]\nThe evaluation parameters are listed in Table 7.1.2.2-3 below.\nTable 7.1.2.2-3: Evaluation assumptions.\n\nTable 7.1.2.2-4: Guard required in kHz for a target interference level of -10 dBc.\n\nBased on the results in Table 7.1.2.2-4, it is suggested that for 5th order filter, the guard RB number for LP-WUS can be 2RBs for 30kHz SCS, or 3RBs ~ 4RBs for 15kHz SCS.\n\n[7B-3]\nFollowing list our filter evaluation analysis assumption.\nTable 7.1.2.2-5: LP-WUS evaluation scenarios\nFollowing list the S21 of 2nd and 5th order butterworth filters and related parameters.\nThe figure depicts the frequency response of 2nd and 3rd order Butterworth filters, illustrating their ability to attenuate high-frequency components while maintaining low-frequency ones. The filters are shown in a frequency domain representation, with the frequency axis on the x-axis and the magnitude of the response on the y-axis. The figure provides a visual representation of the filter's behavior, allowing for a quick understanding of their characteristics.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-3: Frequency response of 2nd Butterworth filters\nThe figure depicts the frequency response of 5th order Butterworth filters, which are commonly used in signal processing to model the frequency response of a system. The filters are shown in a 2D representation, with the frequency axis on the x-axis and the magnitude axis on the y-axis. The figure includes the poles and zeros of the filters, as well as the magnitude and phase responses. The poles are represented by the vertical lines, and the zeros are represented by the horizontal lines. The figure is useful for understanding the behavior of the filters under different frequencies and for designing filters for specific applications.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-4: Frequency response of 5th Butterworth filters\nFollowing table list ACS value based on low-pass filter for zero-IF envelop detector architecture, in which pass bandwidth is 4.32/2=2.16MHz.\nTable 7.1.2.2-6: Evaluated ACS based on low-pass filter with 2.16MHz pass bandwidth\nFollowing table is based on analog band-pass filter for RF/IF envelop detector architecture, in which pass bandwidth is 4.32MHz.\nTable 7.1.2.2-7: Evaluated ACS based on analog band-pass filter with 4.32MHz pass bandwidth\n\nLess pass bandwidth will lead to better filter suppression capability, so table 7.1.2.2-6 with less pass bandwidth will have better performance.\n\nLink-level simulation analysis:\n[7B-1]\nThe detailed parameters are listed in Table 7.1.2.2-8.\nTable 7.1.2.2-8: LP-WUS ACS and ASCS simulation parameters\n\nThe simulation results are in Figure 7.1.2.2-5 for ACS.\n\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with an ACS guard RB (Access Control Service Guard RB) evaluation. The diagram illustrates the guard RB's role in ensuring network security, with a focus on the guard RB's evaluation process. The figure includes key components such as the guard RB, the network, and the guard RB's evaluation criteria. The figure provides a visual representation of the guard RB's role in network security and highlights the importance of evaluating the guard RB's performance.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-5: ACS guard RB evaluation\nIt can be observed that 1 RB of 30kHz SCS with 5th order filtering is sufficient for OOK-1, OOK-2, and OOK-4 LP-WUS.\n\n[7B-4]\nThe 5MHz interferer is 31.5dB higher than the wanted signal for ACS simulation. Simulations for the waveforms in Figure 7.1.2.2-6 have been performed.\nThe figure depicts various LP-WUS waveform options, including the 6-bit LP-WUS waveform, which is used for low-power wireless communication. The waveform options are shown in a graphical format, with different waveforms represented by different colors and shapes. The figure provides a visual representation of the different LP-WUS waveform options and their characteristics, making it easier for users to understand and compare them.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-6: Some of the LP-WUS waveform options\nFor waveform options of OOK-2, FSK-1 and FSK-2, since segmented RB allocations are considered, several narrower filters would be needed to filter out the interference in contrast to a single filter used for OOK-1 and OOK-4.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-7 shows the simulation results for the aforementioned waveforms.\n\na) Guard RB evaluation of OOK-1\t\t\t\t\t\t\tb) Guard RB evaluation of OOK-2\n\nc) Guard RB evaluation of OOK-4\t\t\t\t\t\t\td) Guard RB evaluation of FSK-1\nThe figure depicts the evaluation of Guard RB (Random Bit) for FSK-2 modulation, showing the guard interval (G) and the random bit (RB) values. The guard interval is a critical parameter in FSK-2 modulation, as it determines the amount of time the guard bit is active. The RB value determines the strength of the guard bit, with higher values indicating a stronger guard. The figure provides a visual representation of the guard RB evaluation process, allowing for a quick understanding of the guard interval and RB values.\ne) Guard RB evaluation of FSK-2\nFigure 7.1.2.2-7: ACS guard RB evaluation for several waveforms\nFor the evaluated waveform options of OOK-1, OOK-2, OOK-4, FSK-1 and FSK-2, guard RB with the size of one 30kHz SCS RB could provide necessary protection of LP-WUS from interference of adjacent NR carrier. For 5th order Butterworth filter assumption, it is proposed to reserve 1 RB for 30kHz SCS or 2RBs for 15kHz SCS for protection of LP-WUS from interference of the adjacent NR carrier.\n\n[7B-5], [7B-6]\nSimulations were done to evaluate the impact of adjacent channel and adjacent subcarrier interference. The simulation configuration was created closely match with existing RAN4 minimum requirement for adjacent channel selectivity. Minor adaptations needed to be done as 30 kHz SCS was used. The details of the simulation configuration are provided in Table 7.1.2.2-9.\nTable 7.1.2.2-9: Simulation configuration\n\nSimulation results are also optimistic as no frequency error, phase noise or non-linearities were modelled. For filter passband BW 3 options were used. With the narrowest passband BW the filter already cuts into WUS with 3 dB attenuation at WUS edges. Wider bandwidths are used to model practical implementation imperfections as well as possibility of missing or simplified calibration for filter corner frequency.\nFirst an example of ACI impact and GB impact are presented in Figures 7.1.2.2-8 and 7.1.2.2-9.\nThe figure depicts the impact of ACI, 3rd order filter, 4.32 MHz filter BW, and WUS at system BW edge with GB = 0 RB on the system's bandwidth and system performance.The figure depicts the impact of ACI, 3rd order filter, 4.32 MHz filter BW, and WUS at system BW edge with GB = 0 RB on the system's bandwidth and system performance. ACI and 3rd order filter are used to improve the system's bandwidth and system performance, while WUS is used to mitigate interference.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-8: Impact of ACI, 3rd order filter, 4.32 MHz filter BW, WUS at system BW edge with GB = 0 RB\n\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 7.1.2.2-9,\" depicts the impact of various factors on the system's bandwidth and filter performance. The figure shows the relationship between the third order filter (3rd order filter) bandwidth (BW) and the 4.32 MHz filter BW (4.32 MHz filter BW) on the system's bandwidth edge (system BW edge). The ACI (Active Control Interface) is on for both curves, indicating that the system is operating in an active control mode. The figure provides a visual representation of the system's performance under different conditions, allowing for a better understanding of how these factors affect the system's capacity and reliability.The given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 7.1.2.2-9,\" illustrates the impact of various factors on the system's bandwidth and filter performance.

The figure provides a visual representation of the system's performance under different conditions, allowing for a better understanding of how these factors affect the system's capacity and reliability.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-9: Impact of GB, 3rd order filter, 4.32 MHz filter BW, WUS at system BW edge with GBoff meaning GB = 0RB and with GBon meaning 1 RB GB. ACI is on for both curves.\nIt can be seen that for the chosen example scenario, adding ACI results in extremely poor BER. With no ACI present, there is clear relationship between SNR and BER. Whether guard band of 1 RB = 360 kHz is present or not does not change the results meaningfully. When looking at the SINR vs. SNR, the explanation is clear: when ACI is present, SINR never increase above -7 dB when SNR increases to 10 dB.\nNext results are presented for different filter bandwidths and filter orders when ACI is present in Figures 7.1.2.2-10 and 7.1.2.2-11.\nThe figure depicts a comparison of bit error rate (BER) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a 4.32 MHz filter bandwidth, with a 10 dB WUS at the system BW edge and a 1 dB GB. The figure illustrates the impact of various system parameters on the BER performance, highlighting the importance of system design and optimization for achieving high data rates and reliability in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-10: Left: BER vs. SNR, 4.32 MHz filter BW, WUS at system BW edge, GB = 1 RB; Right: BER vs. SNR, 5 MHz filter BW, WUS at system BW edge, GB = 1 RB\n\nThe figure depicts a comparison of bit error rate (BER) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a 4.32 MHz filter bandwidth, with a 5 MHz filter bandwidth, and a 0 dB receiver gain. The figure illustrates the impact of various system parameters on the BER, including the filter bandwidth, BW edge, and receiver gain. The results show that the BER increases with increasing BW and BW edge, and decreases with increasing receiver gain.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-11: Left: BER vs. SNR, 4.32 MHz filter BW, WUS at system BW edge, GB = 0 RB; Right: BER vs. SNR, 5 MHz filter BW, WUS at system BW edge, GB = 0 RB\nIt can be seen that with 1 RB GB, BER is starting to be borderline acceptable with higher SNR levels only with 5th order filter for which the -3 dB bandwidth is exactly aligned with WUS BW. This is when no phase noise, non-linearities, frequency error, or practical filter implementation aspects are considered. Also with 15 kHz SCS, the NR channel GB would be narrower and performance with the same 360 kHz GB would be worse. Therefore, we conclude that 360 kHz GB at channel edge does not enable low-power low-cost RF implementation of wake-up receiver.\nTo estimate the required GB we simulated how the performance changes if 3 additional RBs, i.e. additional 1.08 MHz, are used for guard band at channel edge. These RBs carry NR OFDM signal. Together with the WUS GB of 0 or 1 RB, the total separation from system BW edge is up to 1.44 MHz, and this is on top of the NR channel GB of 810 kHz. Results are shown in Figures 7.1.2.2-12 to 7.1.2.2-13.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.

The figure illustrates the impact of this offset on the BER performance of the system.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-13: Left: BER vs. SNR, 4.32 MHz filter BW, WUS 3 RB offset from system BW edge, GB = 1 RB; Middle: BER vs. SNR, 5 MHz filter BW, WUS 3 RB offset from system BW edge, GB = 1 RB; Right: BER vs. SNR, 6 MHz filter BW, WUS 3 RB offset from system BW edge, GB = 1 RB\nIn Figure 7.1.2.2-14 and 7.1.2.2-15, BER vs, SNR results are presented for case where LP-WUS is placed 6 RB offset from system BW edge, and when additional 1 RB GB is applied on top of this.\nThe figure depicts a network topology with various components, including a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.

When looking at the data, there are some things to consider: while frequency error, phase noise and non-linearities will make the performance even worse, RAN4 allows a significant relaxation to wanted signal level in ACS test. Therefore, the correct SNR range to be looked at would be rather towards the right side of the plots.\nFinally Figure 7.1.2.2-16 shows performance with 3rd filter with different offsets from system BW edge.\nThe figure depicts the performance of a 3rd order filter at different RB offsets from the system BW edge, with a 4.32 MHz filter BW. The filter is used to improve the system's performance by reducing the impact of noise and interference. The figure shows the filter's effectiveness in reducing the system's noise and interference levels, which is crucial for maintaining a high-quality communication experience.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-16: Performance with 3rd order filter at different RB offsets from system BW edge with 4.32 MHz filter BW\nThe results in Figures 7.1.2.2-8 to Figure 7.1.2.2-13 show that even with total of 1.44 MHz separation from system BW edge, on top of the 810 kHz NR channel GB the SINR with 3rd order filter will not rise above 0 dB. This is with the filter BW matched to WUS BW, no nonlinearities, no frequency error and no phase noise present. If some practical filter implementation aspects are considered and therefore 5 MHz filter BW is considered, only 5th order filter reaches acceptable performance. With 15 kHz SCS the NR channel GB would be narrower, and performance would be worse.\nThe results in Figures 7.1.2.2-14 to Figure 7.1.2.2-16 further show that more than 2.16 MHz offset from system BW edge, on top of the NR channel GB, is preferred for improved system performance with lower complexity implementation.\nWhen frequency error is considered in addition, there is additional negative impact to performance, as exemplified in Figure 7.1.2.2-17.\nThe figure depicts a network topology with various components, including a base station (BTS), a user equipment (UE), and a set of distributed nodes. The network is designed to support high-speed data transmission and is equipped with redundancy paths to ensure reliability. The figure illustrates the layered design of the network, which aligns with the principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).The figure depicts a network topology with various components, including a base station (BTS), a user equipment (UE), and a set of distributed nodes. The network is designed to support high-speed data transmission and is equipped with redundancy paths to ensure reliability. The figure illustrates the layered design of the network, which aligns with the principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).\nFigure 7.1.2.2-17:\nLeft: SINR vs. SNR with ASCI and ACI, 3rd order filter with 4.32 MHz filter BW, LP-WUS 3 RB offset from system BW edge with 1 RB GB towards ASCS.\nRight: SINR vs. SNR with ASCI and ACI, 3rd order filter with 4.32 MHz filter BW, LP-WUS 6 RB offset from system BW edge with 1 RB GB towards ASCS.\nIn Figure 7.1.2.2-17 it can be seen that frequency error has a clear negative impact to SINR, and e.g. in case of 6+1 RB offset from adjacent channel, having frequency error in place can result in need of up to 7 dB higher input SNR to reach the same SINR when compared against case with no frequency error. With 3+1RB offset to band edge in left sub-figure, impact of frequency error makes it very difficult to reach SINR range where successful operation would be possible. It should be noted that while LP-WUS receiver is expected to periodically synchronize itself, there will also be long sleep periods during which frequency can drift. Therefore, considering large frequency offsets is not unreasonable.\nIf full flexibility for WUS location within NR channel bandwidth is needed, the opportunities for low-power implementation are severely limited for envelope detection based RF implementations. Analog filtering is not sufficient if WUS is placed on the RBs closest to channel edge. Even with 4RB, i.e., 1.44 MHz offset with 30 kHz SCS, performance challenges remain unless complex high order filtering with accurate filter BW is used. For 15 kHz, the performance is expected to be worse due to narrower NR channel GB.\nTo enable digital filtering, analog-to-digital conversion needs to have sufficient dynamic range to digitize also the interfering signal. Increase in ADC complexity results in higher power consumption.\nAnalog envelope detection architectures will perform poorly or require a complex implementation if WUS is placed immediately adjacent to channel edge. To improve the likelihood of successful operation and allowing possibilities for low-power implementation, greater than 2.16 MHz offset from outermost RB edge at channel edge is preferred, but exact value needs further study. For architectures using digital detection, placing WUS away from channel edge can enable use of simpler RF HW and power savings.\nIn case only adjacent subcarrier interference is considered, situation is greatly improved. Figure 7.1.2.2-18 shows impact to performance with 3rd order filter (4.32 MHz filter BW) with and without 1 RB GB between WUS and other NR subcarriers:\nThe figure depicts a network topology with various components, including a base station (BTS), a user equipment (UE), and a set of optical fibers.

For ACS case, the phase noise may degrade the SNR at least 3 dB for filter order of 8 and 10.\nThe number of guard RB within the WUS carrier/BW for ASCS case does not need to be greater than 1 as illustrated in Figure 7.1.2.2-19, increasing the number of the guard RB within the WUS carrier/BW may have penalty on the SNR in Figure 7.1.2.2-20.\nFor ACS case, there is a need to shift the WUS away from the adjacent carrier to get more filter attenuation for the adjacent carrier, the number of the shifted RB depends on the WUR filter order and the number of bits per OFDM symbol. For example, it is preferred placing the WUS signal in the middle of 20MHz channel for OOK-2 for WUR with a filter of order 6. For OOK1 and for WUR with a filter of order 6, the WUS signal should be placed with 6 to 10 RB away from the Adjacent carrier channel edge excluding the NR channel guard band. This is illustrated in Figure 7.1.1.2.2-21.\nThe observations from ACS simulation impacts the ACS test case design. The ACS is to test the UE receiver selectivity and the requirement is specified with a special test condition, e.g., ACI level, the UL and DL RB placement. From the simulation results, it can be observed that it is necessary to introduce additional offset from the edge of WUS signal to ACI for certain filter design.  As it is not clear whether to test OOK1, OOK2 or OOK4 and which filter order WUR should be implemented, the detailed design of ACS test case could be discussed in work item phase.\nObserved from the simulation, there is no need to introduce additional guard RB beyond the WUS BW. For ACS, blanking more RB adjacent to the WUS BW does not help to attenuate the leakage power from ACI, shifting the WUS signal away from the ACI helps more to attenuate ACI because the leakage power from ACI much higher than leakage power from adjacent subcarrier.\nThe figure depicts the performance of a 100 Mbps optical communication system under different conditions, including phase noise and bit error rate (BER) for the optical signal. The figure shows the impact of phase noise on the system, with different scenarios represented by different colors and symbols. The BER is measured for both the optical signal and the phase noise, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-19: BLER for OOK1 w/wo phase noise for ASCS case\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of a 5G network, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network, with key components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-20: BLER for OOK1 with phase noise ON/OFF for ASCS case and Guard RB number =1/2, 1 and 1.5 for filter order 4\nThe figure depicts the Bitter End-to-End (BER) performance of a BFP order of 6 and different # of shift RB with ACI of 33 dB. The figure illustrates the impact of the ACI on the BER performance, with the ACI being a key factor in determining the overall system performance.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-21: BLER performance for BFP order =6 and different # of shift RB with ACI = 33 dB\n\nTo evaluate the in-channel interference, RAN4 has defined a new metric as Adjacent Subcarrier Selectivity (ASCS) for evaluation purpose, which is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the adjacent sub-carrier(s).\nThe ACSC BWinterference is set as 5MHz, for both ~5MHz and ~1.4MHz LP-WUS cases, as a starting point for ASCS evaluation. The same PSD of LP-WUS and NR signal is assumed within the channel.\nAs shown in Figure 7.1.2.3-1, WUS at the center of NR channel would be the worst case of ASCS. For ASCS, the required guard RBs belongs to LP-WUR bandwidth.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a focus on signal propagation and the role of various components such as base stations (BSs), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of optical fiber-optic backbone architecture for redundancy and failover reliability. The figure also illustrates the layered design of the network, aligning with SDN principles.\nFigure 7.1.2.3-1：LP-WUS at the centre of NR channel, only ASCS needs to be considered.\nTable 7.1.2.3-1: LP-WUS evaluation parameters for WUS at centre\n\nConclusion for RAN4 ASCS guard RB analysis:\nBased on the following analysis, RAN4 observed that for 5th order filter, the guard RB number for LP-WUS ASCS is in the range of 0RB ~ 1RBs for 30KHz SCS, or 0RBs ~2RBs for 15KHz SCS. Similar number of guard RBs could be applied also with lower filter orders as performance was observed to remain similar with 3rd order filter.\n\nCompanies' input on simulation analysis of ASCS have been presented as following:\nFilter suppression level analysis:\n[7B-1]\nThe parameter assumption is aligned with that in Table 7.1.2.2-1. The required guard RB is provided in the Table 7.1.2.3-2 below.\nTable 7.1.2.3-2: 5MHz LP-WUS ASCS results for WUS at center\n\n[7B-2]\nThe evaluation parameters are listed in Table 7.1.2.3-3 below.\nTable 7.1.2.3-3: Evaluation assumptions.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-4: Guard required in KHz for a target interference level of -10 dBc.\n\nBased on the above table, we suggest that for 5th order filter, the guard RB number for LP-WUS can be 2RBs for 30kHz SCS, or 3RBs ~ 4RBs for 15kHz SCS.\n\n[7B-3]\nFollowing table is based on low-pass filter for zero-IF envelop detector architecture, in which pass bandwidth is 4.32/2=2.16MHz.\nTable 7.1.2.3-5: Evaluated ASCS based on low-pass filter with 2.16MHz pass bandwidth\n\nFollowing table is based on analog band-pass filter for RF/IF envelop detector architecture, in which pass bandwidth is 4.32MHz.\nTable 7.1.2.3-6: Evaluated ASCS based on analog low-pass filter with 4.32MHz pass bandwidth\n\nLess pass bandwidth will lead to better filter suppression capability, so Table 7.1.2.3-5 with less pass bandwidth will have better performance.\n\nLink-level simulation analysis:\n[7B-1]\nThe detailed parameters are listed in Table 7.1.2.2-3. The simulation results are in Figure 7.1.2.3-2 with consideration of CFO RF impairment.\n\n\nThe figure depicts a guard RB evaluation with CFO RF impairment, showing the impact of CFO on the guard RB system.

Considering frequency offset impact, guard RB with the size of one 15kHz SCS RB could provide necessary protection of LP-WUS from interference of adjacent NR sub-carriers.\n\n[7B-7],[7B-9]\nFor ASCS, it can be observed that 1st order filter performs worst while and even with adding 6 guard RBs, the link performance only slightly improves., This means that guard RB does not considerably help if filter order is so low in WUR implementation. For higher than 2nd and 3rd order, the needed Guard RB is not obvious. In simulated link performance vs # RB for 3rd order filter in Figure 7.1.2.3-4, the SNR improvement for 2 RB is 0.2 dB.\nThe figure depicts the link performance for ASCS selectivity with different filter order, showing the impact of filter order on link capacity and throughput. The figure illustrates the relationship between the filter order and the link capacity, with different filter orders resulting in varying link capacities and throughputs.The figure depicts the link performance for ASCS selectivity with different filter order, illustrating the impact of filter order on link capacity and throughput. Different filter orders result in varying link capacities and throughputs.\nFigure 7.1.2.3-4: Link performance for ASCS selectivity with different filter order\nIf the filter order is higher than and equal to 2, smaller guard RB (1 to 2 RB) is sufficient between adjacent subcarrier of eMBB signal and a WUS signal. If the filter order is too low, the guard RB does not help to improve the ASCS selectivity.\nTo investigate the ADC impact on the ASCS, the below simulation with different ADC setting is assumed. The following ADC parameters are used:\nADC number of bit [2, 4, 6,8] and ADC sampling rate [down sampling factor 4, 8, 16, 32]\nIt can be observed that generally there is SNR degradation when sampling rate down-sampling factor is increased from 4 to 32 for the same number of ADC bits and the same BPF order. Such SNR degradation is most prominent for ADC 2 bit case where 1.8 dB SNR degradation is observed in 7.1.2.3-5. Higher ADC bits can reduce the SNR degradation. For example, for ADC bits of 4, 6 and 8, the SNR degradation is around 1 dB. With Higher BPF order (>=6), SNR degradation can be further reduced to around 0.5 dB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1.2.3-5: Link performance for ASCS selectivity for filter order 4 and 6 when ADC impairment is enabled.\n\n[7B-10]\nLink-level simulations to evaluate the required guard RBs for ASCS were performed based on the assumptions as listed in Table 7.1.2.3-7. Simulations were done for OOK1 and OOK4 modulation. Simulations were repeated for different filter order, guard RBs, and residual frequency error. SNR required to achieve 1% BLER are reported in the following tables.\nTable 7.1.2.3-7: LP-WUS link-level simulation parameters.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-8: SNR required for 1% BLER with 3rd order filter. Modulation used is OOK1.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-9: SNR required for 1% BLER with 4th order filter. Modulation used is OOK1.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-10: SNR required for 1% BLER with 5th order filter. Modulation used is OOK1.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-11: SNR required for 1% BLER with 3rd order filter. Modulation used is OOK4.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-12: SNR required for 1% BLER with 4th order filter. Modulation used is OOK4.\n\nTable 7.1.2.3-13: SNR required for 1% BLER with 5th order filter. Modulation used is OOK4.\n\nBased on the above presented data, following observations can be made: One PRB worth of guard RB with 30 kHz SCS is enough, provided the CFO is under ±100 ppm. However, in case of ±200 ppm of residual frequency error, there is a minor improvement in the required SNR by an additional guard RB. Given the low chip rate, filter order doesn't seem to impact performance, as in, given a modulation scheme, number of guard RBs and residual frequency error, increasing the filter order does not provide significant reduction in the required SNR.\nTherefore, in for 30kHz SCS one PRB worth of guard RB can be used.\nAt WUR receiver, reciprocal mixing occurs when a high-power level adjacent interferer signal that is present at antenna mixes with the oscillator noise sideband (phase noise).  The reciprocal mixing generates cochannel interference to the WUR receiver passband as illustrated in Figure 7.1.2.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a reciprocal mixing scheme for the ACI case, illustrating the process of signal reflection and re-propagation in a 5G network. The diagram shows the various components involved, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.1.2.4-1: Reciprocal mixing for ACI case\nThe power boosting of 3 dB or 6 dB of a WUS signal relative to the average power of a configured NR carrier can improve the WUS signal coverage. It is beneficial to enable the 3dB or 6 dB power boosting at the existing network. Therefore, RAN4 assumes to reuse the legacy RF specification as a starting point. Some company observed that 3 dB or 6 dB power boosting for a 24 RB WUS signal may not be feasible for some of deployed gNB when average power is kept the same before and after power boosting. It is feasible to configure different PSD carriers in a multiple carrier configuration where WUS signal can be placed in a higher PSD carrier among all configured carriers. The amount of boosting is up to manufacturer declaration following the legacy manufacturer declaration.\nBS manufacturer could declare if power boosting for WUS signal is supported and the boosting level in the range of [0] to [6] dB is considered. Final power boosting level and the condition of power boosting will be decided based on further analysis in WI phase.\nRF envelop detection architecture is more appropriate for single-band operation. IF envelop detection and BB envelop detection are more appropriate for multi-bands operation. Multi-band here still means that only one band at a time is being received. Multi-band capability for other architectures is FFS.\nRAN4 noticed that the assumed NF in RAN1 simulation may be different with RAN4. RAN4 will derive RF requirement based on NF which is feasible from coverage and implementation perspective. RAN4 will focus on sensitivity evaluation instead of specific NF value in the normative work.\nGenerally, noise figure and power consumption are competing specifications, it is very challenging to achieve both low noise figure and low power consumption at the same time, and power consumption typically increases when sensitivity is improved. There is a delicate balance between lower power consumption, e.g., higher noise figure, and system performance.\nRAN4 has discussed the band operation for LP-WUS according to the scenarios listed below with the understanding that the associated RF aspects could be analysed in the work item phase, depending on the scope of the related normative work.\n1)\tThe band for the low-power radio (LR) and main radio (MR) can be the same, e.g., WUS is located within the NR band used for LP-WUR. In this scenario the WUS and NR DL could be multiplexed according to TDM/FDM modes.\n2)\tThe band for LR and MR can be different, e.g., WUS is located within an NR band for LP-WUR, and another NR band is used for the MR.\nAdditionally, RAN4 has concluded the following aspects from RF perspective, which are provided for information:\n-\tWUS located in an SDO band in TS 36.101 is proposed by some companies, and RAN4 recognizes that there exist dependencies on other WGs that have not been considered in this study.\nNote:\tSome companies have expressed a concern that SDO bands may not be IMT bands.\n",

                            "title": "7.3.1\tRRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode",
                            "text_content": "In RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states, UEs shall perform RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode procedures defined in TS 38.304 and TS 38.331, which specify how UEs shall monitor paging, keep system information up to date, receive ETWS/CMAS information, and perform RRM measurements and corresponding cell selection/re-selection to ensure that UE is camping on the best cell. These procedures may need to be modified to accommodate operation using LP-WUS/WUR.\nThough the network may use different signals to page UE for the case that UE monitors LP-WUS and the case that UE doesn't monitor LP-WUS, the network doesn't need to be aware of whether the UE is monitoring LP-WUS or not in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE. Otherwise, it requires the UE to switch on MR or wake up MR to inform the network whether the UE is monitoring LP-WUS or not, which leads to further signalling overhead, Uu resource consumption and also UE power consumption accordingly.\nWith LP-WUS/WUR, the Main Receiver (MR) of a UE could enter ultra-deep sleep state, which denotes a state when the MR may sleep or turn off. Such ultra-deep sleep state could be entered when predefined condition (e.g. quality of LP-SS and/or SSB is better than the threshold) is fulfilled. An operation like the one for Mobile Initiated Communication Only (MICO), where both monitoring of the downlink and RRM measurements are stopped until there is a subsequent uplink transmission, is however not feasible for LP-WUS/WUR. Thhe point with LP-WUS/WUR is to reduce UE power consumption while maintaining some downlink monitoring functionality, and this is not possible if either the UE stops monitoring in downlink or if the UE does not detect that it has moved into a new cell/area and therefore apply the incorrect configuration for downlink monitoring. According to TS 38.300, the functionality to be supported over Uu interface in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE includes PLMN selection, SI reception, cell re-selection mobility, and paging, etc. Therefore, it is feasible to introduce LP-WUS/WUR as a power saving feature for RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE, while ultra-deep sleep state as a power saving state for RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE.\nPaging reception in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE is supported both with discontinuous reception (DRX), and from Rel-17 and Rel-18, respectively, with extended DRX (eDRX). LP-WUS/WUR could also be supported with or without duty-cycled operation, i.e., as 'continuous' or as 'duty-cycled'. Since the LP-WUS/WUR feature is introduced to lower the UE energy consumption, it is for these two options feasible to introduce support for the LP-WUR option which can introduce the greatest UE energy consumption reduction compared to baseline as discussed above in section 6. If the gain is similar, the magnitude of implementation complexity, specification impact, and latency impact should be the determining factors for which LP-WUR option to support.\nCurrently, paging monitoring in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode is based on the configured I-DRX, as well as PEI is also designed as 'duty-cycled' associated with legacy PO. The specification impact for 'continuous' and 'duty-cycled' depends on the detailed design. While, a potential benefit of 'continuous' is shorter downlink latency. That is, since the UE monitors the downlink continuously the downlink latency could potentially be shorter.\nDue to the transition time to start up the main receiver however, LP-WUR operation may always have worse latency performance than legacy, i.e., comparing to legacy continuous monitoring or DRX. 'Continuous' could still provide shorter downlink latency compared to 'duty-cycled', comparing at the same UE energy consumption reduction gain. This however depends on the UE procedure triggered by LP-WUS and the LP-WUS payload content and size.\nOn one hand, after waking up by LP-WUS, the legacy paging monitoring procedure could be triggered for the main receiver. That is, if the UE detects LP-WUS it would start up its main receiver to monitor legacy paging, i.e., the PDCCH scheduling of the paging message on PDSCH, and at first after finding its own PagingRecord in the paging message the UE could determine that it is being paged (similar to Rel-15 WUS for NB-IoT/LTE-M or Rel-17 PEI). In this case, the downlink latency will be determined by the periodicity of the legacy paging occasions (POs).\n-\tIn some case, 'continuous' mode may not have latency benefit compared to 'duty-cycled'. That is, even if LP-WUS is immediately received using 'continuous' mode the UE might anyway need to wait for the subsequent PO (i.e., maybe a same PO as if 'duty-cycled' is used).\n-\tIn some other case, the beneficial part comes from the margin that LP-WUS could be received earlier in case 'continuous' than 'duty-cycled', which would wake up the main receiver earlier and an earlier PO will be monitored by main receiver after waking up by LP-WUS.\n-\tOn the other hand, after waken up by LP-WUS, the main receiver could also monitor legacy PEI defined in Rel-17, if it is configured by network and it is supported by UE. Especially for the case that LP-WUS doesn't have full coverage compared to legacy signalling, e.g. SSB, main receiver needs to wake up to perform legacy operation out of LP-WUS coverage. In this case, network could still configure PEI for the use of fallback mechanism to save UE power consumption for paging monitoring. It means, the network would configure and transmit both LP-WUS and PEI for the UE, especially when the network is not aware of UE's entry/exit of LP-WUS monitoring. From UE perspective, LP-WUS may be used together with PEI if both LP-WUS and PEI are configured, to achieve more power saving gain.\nThe corresponding pros/cons of the above UE wake up procedures are listed as below:\nTable 7.3.1.2-1: Pros and Cons of different alternatives for wake-up procedures\n\nAfter waking up from LP-WUS, in case UE needs to monitor PO, the time offset between LP-WUS and the PO should be long enough to include the transition time to start up the main receiver to be ready for PDCCH monitoring, which depends on the design of LP-WUR and the detailed procedure after waking up. After waking up from LP-WUS, some PO(s) needs to be monitored. Whether there is association between LP-WUS and PO, and how to define the association if yes, depends on the detailed procedure. For reference, in legacy, Rel-17 PEI supports mapping of up to 8 POs (configured the parameter po-NumPerPEI), and Rel-15 WUS and Rel-16 GWUS for NB-IoT/LTE-M supports mapping of up to 4 POs, but only when the UE is configured with eDRX.\nFurthermore, after waking up from LP-WUS, either all UEs could be triggered to wake up to monitor paging in associated PO(s), or just a subset of the UEs sharing the PO, so called LP-WUS UE subgrouping. The latter can be used to reduce the negative impact from false paging, i.e., unnecessary energy consumption in the UE caused by paging intended for another UE. In the latter case, LP-WUS UE subgrouping information corresponding to 2 bits or more, would be indicated by LP-WUS. How to indicate the subgrouping information, e.g. included in the LP-WUS payload or from the use of multiple LP-WUS signals corresponding to different subgroups, etc., depends on the design of LP-WUS. For reference, both Rel-17 PEI and Rel-16 GWUS for NB-IoT/LTE-M support up 8 subgroups per PO (configured by the parameters subgroupsNumPerPO and GWUS-NumGroups, respectively). The number of subgroups depends on the decision on payload of LP-WUS\nBoth these features rely on I-DRX and UEs already being distributed over the different POs in the cell, and the UE subgrouping therefore refers to further subgrouping of the UEs already divided into the same PO. This would be the same for 'duty-cycled' operation. For 'continuous' operation, UE should monitor the downlink continuously. false paging could apply to all UEs in the cell since all UEs are monitoring the downlink continuously. False paging would therefore be much more severe for 'continuous' and a larger number of LP-WUS/WUR UE subgroups would be required to achieve the same false paging rate.\nA summary of the impact from carrying a UE subgroup indication in the LP-WUS is given below.\nTable 7.3.1.2-2: Impact from the inclusion of UE subgroup information in the LP-WUS payload.\n\nIn Rel-17 PEI, two subgrouping methods were introduced, which includes: CN assigned and UE_ID based subgrouping. For CN assigned subgrouping, UE's subgroup is assigned by CN taking into account the UE's characters, such as mobility pattern, paging probabilities, etc. While for UE_ID based subgrouping, UE's subgroup is formed based on UE_ID and the subgroup number in RAN. UE supporting CN assigned subgrouping in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state can be assigned a subgroup ID by AMF through NAS signalling. The UE belonging to the assigned subgroup ID monitors its associated PEI which indicates the paged subgroup(s). Paging with UE_ID based subgrouping is used in the cell which supports UE_ID based subgrouping. It is up to network configuration to determine which subgrouping should be used.\nSimilar as PEI, the subgrouping methods for LP-WUS could include the CN assigned, and UE_ID based subgrouping. Details, e.g. which one/both should be supported, how to support/provide the configuration, etc., could be further determined during WI phase.\nAccording to evaluation in section 8.2, LP-WUS link performance is considerably worse than legacy physical channels (e.g., PDCCH or PUSCH), and there could be partial LP-WUS coverage in the cell. Another possible scenario is LP-WUS could also have same coverage as legacy cell, while the details depend on the signalling and LP-WUR design. For the partial coverage case, UE may need to keep track of whether it moves in and out of LP-WUS coverage in the cell, this to be able to fall back to monitoring paging using the main receiver when the coverage of LP-WUS is not sufficient (see network awareness in 7.3.1.1 above). The UE could determine this based on the measured RSRP, e.g., compared to an RSRP threshold in system information.\nFor the partial coverage case, UE's MR could stay in ultra-deep sleep power state only when UE is in the coverage of LP-WUS. When UE moves out of the coverage of LP-WUS, the network cannot wake up UE's MR via LP-WUS. Hence, UE should start up its MR when it moves out of the coverage of LP-WUS to avoid missing the paging message. In this way, one of the exit conditions for using LP-WUS or ultra-deep sleep power state should be that the UE is out of LP-WUS coverage. A quality threshold of target Reference Signal can be pre-configured to UE to define the exit condition for using LP-WUS. With this threshold, UE can stop using LP-WUS and exit the ultra-deep sleep power state when the quality of target Reference Signal is lower than the threshold.\nDuring ultra-deep sleep or when using LP-WUS, UE's MR may not perform measurement as per legacy procedures and requirements. Thus, in order to be applicable for all cases, the pre-configured exit condition should be based on the measurement of target Reference Signal by LR and / or MR.\nSimilarly, the measurements and trigger conditions would need to be defined for using LP-WUS. One way is to define a quality threshold for the target Reference Signal measurement to determine the coverage. One entry condition for using LP-WUS could be configured to UE based on this quality threshold. From network perspective, the threshold could be set based on the coverage of LP-WUS. With this threshold, LP-WUS could be used, and UE's MR could enter ultra-deep-sleep power state when the quality of target Reference Signal is better than the threshold.\nBefore the entry condition is fulfilled, UE should perform legacy measurement on serving cell based on legacy SSB, e.g. for cell (re)selection purpose. Hence, it is straightforward to use the legacy SSB as the target Reference Signal for pre-configured entry condition. That is, when the quality of the serving cell's SSB measured by MR is better than a pre-configured threshold, UE considers the entry condition is fulfilled, then, LP-WUS could be used and MR could enter ultra-deep-sleep power state for power saving. Alternatively, LP-SS could be introduced for LR measurement, the pre-condition could be also defined based on the measurement on LP-SS via LR.  In this way, the target Reference Signal could be the LP-SS sent by the serving cell, i.e. when the quality of the LP-SS measured by LR is better than a pre-configured threshold, UE considers the entry condition for using LP-WUS is fulfilled. The solution requires the UE to perform measurement on LP-SS via LR before using LP-WUS. In this way, the UE needs to turn on its LR before entering ultra-deep-sleep power state, which may lead to extra power consumption, but it is not an issue as the power consumption of LR is very low.\nFrom the network perspective, if a unique UE identifier (e.g., 48-bit 5G-S-TMSI or 24/40-bit I-RNTI) is not carried in the LP-WUS payload, a gNB may need to transmit both LP-WUS and the associated legacy PDCCH and PDSCH for the paging message. In this case, the gNB would in principle not need to consider whether the UE is within LP-WUS coverage in the cell or not, but in case it is not there would be some unnecessary control signalling overhead from the transmission of LP-WUS. If instead a unique UE identifier is carried in the LP-WUS payload, the gNB could either transmit LP-WUS or legacy paging depending on if the UE is within LP-WUS coverage or not. However, without any signalling from the UE upon LP-WUS coverage change, or from being in the cell or not, this would have to be done blindly and would be left to the gNB implementation (similar to paging the UE in two different cells, i.e., up to trial and error). With partial coverage, the most severe error case would be if the UE from inaccurate measurements incorrectly concludes that it is in LP-WUS coverage when it is not, and therefore becomes unreachable in the downlink (the UE only monitors using LP-WUR but is outside LP-WUS coverage).\nRegarding the LP-WUS configuration, both UE and gNB must have a common understanding of when LP-WUS should be applied to avoid that UEs become unreachable in the downlink, as mentioned above in 7.2.3.1.3. Both UE and gNB could apply LP-WUS if LP-WUS has been configured in the cell in SI. This would further determine the conditions for entering and leaving LP-WUS monitoring operation as being tied to the monitoring of paging in a cell: A UE enables LP-WUS monitoring if it is configured with LP-WUS and camp on a cell in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state in which LP-WUS is configured, for example when re-selecting a cell in which LP-WUS is configured or being released from RRC_CONNECTED in a cell in which LP-WUS is configured.\nReception of system information (SI) broadcast and ETWS/CMAS are RRC_IDLE mode procedures which must be supported for UE with LP-WUS/WUR. When the UE initiates the acquisition of SI, for example when SI has become outdated or upon cell change, the UE anyway needs to start up the main receiver for the reception of the SI message(s). However, this is not the case for a gNB notification of SI update and it must be possible to notify also UEs with LP-WUR about an upcoming SI change in the cell. For reference, in Rel-16 GWUS for NB-IoT/LTE-M this is done by a subgroup common to all UEs (configured by the parameter commonSequence), whereas for Rel-17 PEI the gNB must transmit PEI to all subgroups separately and upon the reception of PEI UEs continue to, as in legacy operation, monitor for the systemInfoModification and systemInfoModification-eDRX in the Short Messages transmitted on PDCCH using P-RNTI. When UE is using LP-WUS, UE could wake up by LP-WUS firstly and then receive the notification of SI change based on the systemInfoModification and systemInfoModification-eDRX in the Short Messages transmitted on PDCCH using P-RNTI as legacy.\nETWS/CMAS is regulatory requirement for UEs supporting ETWS/CMAS. Therefore, even for UE in ultra-deep sleep, the ETWS/CMAS messages should be ensured to be reachable if the UE is capable of ETWS/CMAS. As in legacy, the gNB would upon ETWS/CMAS information need to wake up UE by LP-WUS from ultra-deep sleep. Similar to the notification of SI change, when UE is using LP-WUS, UE could wake up by LP-WUS and receive the notification of ETWS/CMAS notification based on etwsAndCmasIndication in the Short Messages.\nTo ensure a UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE is camping on the best cell it needs to perform mobility measurements as specified in TS 38.304. RRM measurement for mobility includes serving cell measurements and neighbour cell measurements, which can be intra-frequency or inter-frequency (including inter-RAT) measurements. In general, the neighbour cell measurements however only need to be performed by the UE if the serving cell is not strong enough, i.e., when the intra-frequency cell re-selection criterion (Srxlev > SIntraSearchP and Squal > SIntraSearchQ) or the inter-frequency cell re-selection criterion (Srxlev > SnonIntraSearchP and Squal > SnonIntraSearchQ) is not fulfilled. For the majority of UEs, and in a well deployed network without coverage holes, it is therefore the serving cell measurements that need to be performed the most frequently, and therefore they will also have the biggest impact on UE energy consumption.\nFor a UE operating with LP-WUR, infrequently starting up the main receiver (MR) for neighbour cell measurements is not expected to have any significant impact on UE energy consumption. However, using the MR for serving cell measurements has a significant impact on UE energy consumption and reduce the LP-WUS/WUR gain according to the observations from the study evaluation results. This since according to Clause 4.2.2.2 in TS 38.133, serving cell measurements must be performed every or every second I-DRX cycle in FR1 (and somewhat more relaxed in FR2). Starting the main receiver for RRM measurements every I-DRX cycle removes a large part of the UE energy consumption reductions from LP-WUS/WUR.\nIn order to achieve the UE power saving gain by LP-WUS/WUR, the RRM measurement on serving cell and neighbouring cell via MR is relaxed or may be stopped when UE is using LP-WUS or MR is in ultra-deep sleep. In Rel-16/17 PowSav and RedCap WI, RRM measurement relaxation on neighbouring cell was introduced. But here, further relaxation or even no measurement by MR could be considered while serving cell measurements are offloaded to LR. The relaxation on RRM measurement may impact the performance of mobility performance in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE. In order to avoid or minimize such impact, the RRM measurement on LP-WUR could be considered. Thus, the above RRM measurement relaxation on serving cell and neighbouring cell should be premised on the feasibility or support of RRM measurement on LR.\n",

                            "text_content": "For legacy UE in RRC_CONNECTED state, it should keep MR monitoring PDCCH in C-DRX active time, if C-DRX is configured, also when there is nothing scheduled for the UE. As a result, the power consumption caused by unnecessary PDCCH monitoring is unavoidable. The gain for legacy UE power saving features in RRC_CONNECTED, such as Short C-DRX, Long C-DRX, Rel-16 PDCCH-based WUS, or Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation, comes from reducing the PDCCH monitoring time.\nBoth Rel-16 DCP and Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation are both PDCCH based signalling. For a UE equipped with LR, the MR can be in a sleep state while the LR remains active to monitor Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS), and when LP-WUS is received by LR, it will trigger the MR to wake up to monitor PDCCH. As LR would adopt a minimalistic design, the power consumption of LR is expected to be significantly lower than legacy PDCCH based signaling using the main receiver (MR) in some cases. In this way, LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED can potentially further reduce the UE energy consumption by being able the monitor the downlink with a LR such that the MR used for PDCCH monitoring can be kept in a sleep state. The LP-WUS/WUR solution should target power saving gain compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 UE power saving mechanisms, e.g., according to the evaluation results above, {6%~15%} additional UE power saving gain with no capacity loss in both low load and high load cases for DL only XR traffic compared to the existing Rel-15/16/17 power saving solutions.\nCompared with UE in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE state, UE in RRC_CONNECTED state is more sensitive to the latency. Therefore, the RAN2 study on LP-WUS procedures in RRC_ CONNECTED should target to reduce power consumption while guarantee the latency performance.\nThe MR sleep states considered for LP-WUS/WUR evaluation in RRC_CONNECTED are the same as for baseline: deep sleep state with a 20 ms transition time, light sleep state with a 6 ms transition time, or micro sleep without any transition time, as described TR 38.840. Ultra-deep sleep state is not considered for LP-WUS/WUR in RRC_CONNECTED state as a 400 ms transition time is too long to allow the MR to be ready for PDCCH monitoring from the ultra-deep sleep state considering the traffic requirements for NR. Therefore, the power saving gain for LP-WUS/WUR would be determined by the time duration in which the MR can be kept in a sleep state, and significantly lower power consumed by LP-WUS/LP-WUR compared to the PDCCH monitoring by MR. Regarding latency, the transition time for the MR to start up upon LP-WUS detection by LP-WUR would in principle not be worse comparing to the existing power saving mechanism since the MR could be in micro, light, or deep sleep state as legacy, but is not allowed to be in ultra-deep sleep state when LR is monitoring LP-WUS, as described above.\nWhen using LP-WUS, other conditions could also trigger MR to wake up for PDCCH monitor, e.g. UL transmission by MR, which would be similar to using baseline solutions, e.g. C-DRX, with the same MR sleep state.\nSimilar as in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE, there are two mechanisms to monitor LP-WUS for LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED, i.e. 'continuous' and 'duty-cycled' mode. For 'continuous' mode, LP-WUS is monitored continuously in time, while for 'duty-cycled' mode, LP-WUS is monitored based on a defined duty cycle, which is similar as DRX mechanism. 'Continuous' mode could be expected to have lower latency than 'duty-cycled' mode, but both solutions will have the same lower latency bound from the MR transition time as described above, and in the same way as for legacy C-DRX the duty cycle length for 'duty-cycled' mode would be defined or configured based on the downlink latency requirement. Therefore, any performance comparison of these two LP-WUS monitoring mechanisms, or any down selection between them, should be considered based on the downlink latency requirement. The corresponding pros/cons for these two mechanisms are summarized in the below table.\nTable 7.3.2.2-1: Pros and Cons of 'duty-cycled' and 'continuous' mode for LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED mode\n\nTwo examples for UE operations for 'duty-cycled' mode and 'continuous' mode are shown in the below two Figures.\nThe figure depicts a typical example of a 'Duty-cycled WUR' operation, where the duty cycle is 24 hours. The operation is performed by a 100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-100-\nFigure 7.3.2.2-1: Example for 'Duty-cycled WUR' operation\n\nThe figure depicts a continuous WUR operation, where the signal is transmitted over a continuous path without any interruptions. This operation is crucial in ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network, as it allows for uninterrupted transmission of data packets. The figure illustrates the various components involved in the continuous WUR operation, such as the transmitter, receiver, and the network infrastructure.\nFigure 7.3.2.2-2: Example for 'Continuous WUR' operation\nAs described above, in order to save UE power consumption for PDCCH monitoring and guarantee the latency, the basic design is: when MR is in a sleep state, LR will remain active to monitor LP-WUS. When LP-WUS is received by LR, it will trigger the MR to wake up to monitor PDCCH.\nThe use of LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED could be considered to replace the legacy methods, e.g. Short C-DRX, Long C-DRX, Rel-16 PDCCH-based WUS (DCP), Rel-17 PDCCH skipping, Rel-17 SSSG switching, etc. or be an enhancement thereof when configured, an example is Rel-16 PDCCH-based WUS is an enhancement on top of Long C-DRX. The detailed design for the use of LP-WUS could be in different directions as below, which is summarized in Table X.\nTable 7.3.2.3-1: LP-WUS operation methods in RRC_CONNECTED\nNote:\tThe above directions/solutions are NOT Mutually Exclusive absolutely, e.g. some overlap may exist between direction 3 and direction 2, or between option 2 and option 4, based on the detailed design for each direction/option. The detailed design would be further determined in WI, if included.\nIn direction 1 above, LP-WUS is used in conjunction with C-DRX. LP-WUS could be configured outside the DRX active time with either of the following two options.\n-\tSame function as Rel-16 DCP to indicate whether to start the next drx-onDurationTimer (i.e. option 1 above)\n-\tTo indicate UE to enters into active time for PDCCH monitoring (i.e. option 2 above)\nSome examples for different options in direction 1 are shown as illustrated in the below figures.\nFor option 1: LP-WUS is used similar as Rel-16 DCP, an example is shown as below (note that a longer time offset may likely have to be applied to cover the MR transition time compared to DCP):\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a 5G network, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. It shows how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 7.3.2.3-1: Example for option 1\nFor option 2: LP-WUS could be used at any time outside C-DRX active time to indicate UE to enter into active time, different examples for both 'duty-cycled' and 'continuous' mode are shown as below:\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a wireless communication system, specifically focusing on the role of a duty-cycled LP-WUS (Low Power Wide Area Sensor) in a 5G network. The figure illustrates the various components involved in the system, such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 7.3.2.3-2: Example for option 2 with 'duty-cycled' LP-WUS\nThe figure depicts a network topology with a combination of wired and wireless elements, illustrating the various paths through which data can be transmitted. The network is designed to be resilient and reliable, with redundant paths to ensure failover in case of failures. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, allowing for better control and management of the network.\nFigure 7.3.2.3-3: Example for option 2 with 'continuous' LP-WUS\nIn direction 2 above, LP-WUS is used in conjunction with C-DRX as the direction 1 or without C-DRX. In the latter case, the LP-WUS is used to indicate UE to activate/resume PDCCH monitoring. Some other solutions used to indicate UE to stop the PDCCH monitoring should be used in conjunction with LP-WUS, e.g. Rel-17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation.\nFor option 4: LP-WUS could be used at any time regardless of whether C-DRX is configured or not, different examples for both 'duty-cycled' and 'continuous' mode are shown as below:\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a focus on signal propagation and the use of duty-cycled LP-WUS (Low Power Wide Band) technology. The figure illustrates the signal path, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, as well as the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design of the optical backbone aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and automation.\nFigure 7.3.2.3-4: Example for option 4 with 'duty-cycled' LP-WUS\nThe figure depicts a network topology with a combination of wired and wireless elements, illustrating the various paths through which data can be transmitted. The network is designed to be resilient and reliable, with redundant paths to ensure failover in case of failures. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, allowing for better control and management of the network.\nFigure 7.3.2.3-5: Example for option 4 with 'continuous' LP-WUS\nIn direction 3, the detailed design should be determined based on physical layer design/restriction.\nThe corresponding pros/cons for the above options on LP-WUS using in RRC_CONNECTED are summarized in the below table.\nTable 7.3.2.3-2: Pros and Cons of LP-WUS using options in RRC_CONNECTED\n\nA UE is expected to be configured with LP-WUS/WUR in RRC_CONNECTED mode, e.g. upon RRC connection establishment, i.e., either during RRC Connection Setup or RRC Connection Resumption. Therefore, UE specific LP-WUS/WUR configuration is possible in RRC_CONNECTED mode.\nThe time gap between the LP-WUS monitoring occasion and the PDCCH monitoring occasion for MR must be designed or configured long enough to cover the transition time of the MR to be ready for PDCCH monitoring. Another alternative is similar to Rel-15 WUS for NB-IoT/LTE-M, different transition time gaps, if introduced, could be defined as UE capability. Then, gNB could, based on this capability, know which time gap to configure for the UE (which if, several sleep states are supported, lets the UE to determine the MR sleep state to apply).\nFor partial LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage in the cell, LP-WUS should only be configured/used for a UE within LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage:\n-\tIn one solution, the coverage determination is similar as in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE, which is based on the measurement of LR and/or MR, and the corresponding threshold determined/configured by network. Furthermore, when UE moves out of LP-WUS coverage, LP-WUS cannot be used at the UE, as it is unreachable by the gNB for LP-WUS. It should be either released or de-activated by the network. Otherwise, some conditions would have to be introduced to ensure the UE could autonomously fall back to legacy operation without LP-WUS.\n-\tIn another solution, monitoring LP-WUS can be explicitly activated and de-activated by the network, e.g., entry/exit condition(s) of using LP-WUS may not be needed.\nMeanwhile, for full LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage in the cell, no special configuration would be required. That is, LP-WUS could be configured/activated for a UE in the cell, and not used when it is released/de-activated in the cell.\nAccording to above analysis, LP-WUS in RRC_CONNECTED with partial LP-WUS coverage is expected to have more standardization impacts than the scenario with full LP-WUS coverage.\nOn one hand, LP-WUS could be configured together with Rel-16 DCP for a specific UE. However, the UE may only use one of them at any time, e.g. depend on the network configuration or link quality, etc. It should be noted that this operation is more useful for the partial LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage as described in 7.3.2.4. For example, for partial LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage, when the UE is in LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage, UE could monitor LP-WUS autonomously or UE could monitor LP-WUS if the gNB activate the LP-WUS monitoring. When UE moves out of LP-SS/LP-WUS coverage, the measurement quality of LP-SS via LR is not good enough, UE could consider to use Rel-16 DCP as in legacy in this case.\nOn the other hand, the LP-WUS could be used in conjunction with Rel-16 DCP. That is, the UE firstly monitor LP-WUS and, in case the MR is waked up by the LP-WUS, then, the UE will continue to monitor DCP.\n",

A subset of the results are selected to draw observations for comparison between coverage of LP-WUS and reference NR channel. The selection and comparison are performed based on following criterion.\n-\tThe relative difference for MIL gap between LP-WUS and NR channel is calculated per each company.\n-\tIf companies only report MIL of NR reference channel or only MIL of LP-WUS, no performance gap can be derived from input from this company.\n-\tIf company only input Msg3 results, and PDCCH results is not provided, only performance gap between LP-WUS and MSG3 can be derived from this company.\n-\tTo find whether LP-WUS can achieve similar to or better then MIL of reference NR channels per each companies' results and then observe the amount of resources required per bit in LP-WUS required for LP-WUS, the following is considered,\n-\tMIL margin of LP-WUS is defined as Y= (MIL of LP-WUS – MIL of NR channel), and when Y>= -1dB, the LP-WUS sample is considered to have similar to or better than reference NR channels.\n-\tIf there are multiple samples fulfil above condition from one company, only the sample with minimum resource per bit is kept to draw conclusion.\n-\tThe resource required per bit is provided in terms of X MHz*Symbol/bit. For example, if X= 8.64 and WUS BW is 4.32MHz, it means 2 OFDM symbols are required for LP-WUS to achieve MIL similar to or better than that of NR channel.\n-\tIf no samples can fulfil the above condition (i.e. Y<-1dB), observation is drawn based on the range of X and Y value across companies.\n-\tIf multiple results were provided by one company, the result with minimum abs(Y) value is selected\nThe summary of the observation is provided in the following Table 8.2 -1. In each case, only the samples fulfil above condition are collected, where company A: [X (MHz*Symbol/bit), Y (dB)] means company A results show LP-WUS configuration with X MHz*Symbol/bit can achieve MIL similar to or better than MIL of reference channel, and the MIL of LP-WUS – MIL of ref channel is Y dB.\nTable 8.2.1-1: Summary of the performance gap between LP-WUS and NR reference channel\n\n\nThe NR coverage for comparison are provided in the following tables\nTable 8.2.1-2: NR Coverage, Urban, Normal UE\n\nTable 8.2.1-3: NR Coverage, Urban, Redcap UE\n\nTable 8.2.1-4: NR Coverage, Rural, Normal UE\n\nTable 8.2.1-5: NR Coverage, Rural, Redcap UE\n\nIt can be observed that for a given NR channel, there is a MIL difference among companies. One of the reasons contributes to this difference could be the different assumptions for antenna gain corrections for gNB Tx and Rx. Another reason could be different HARQ assumption for MSG3. Another reason could be different link performance between different companies. The assumed antenna gain correction values used by companies for link budget evaluation is summarized as in Table 8.2.1-6\nTable 8.2.1-6: Antenna gain correction value (dB) in the link budget evaluation\n\n",

                    "text_content": "RAN1 has identified use cases of LP-WUS/WUR for power sensitive devices including IoT, wearable and eMBB, and for both IDLE/INACTIVE and CONNECTED mode usage. RAN1 has identified the performance metrics and KPIs for the studies of LP-WUS/WUR including UE power consumption, coverage, latency and UPT as well as metrics and KPIs for network impact including the impact to system overhead, system capacity (XR traffic), and network energy consumption.\nRAN1 has developed evaluation methodologies for the study of LP-WUS/WUR including power models for LR and MR, traffic characteristics, coverage targets, LR clocks and oscillator assumptions, etc.\nRAN1 has carried out system level evaluations for the UE power saving and latency benefit of using LP-WUS/WUR for IDLE/INACTIVE UEs.\n-\tUE power saving gain cannot be observed if the existing Rel-18 MR RRM measurement periodicity for serving and neighbour cells are applied and UE MR enters in ultra-deep sleep during LP LP-WUS monitoring, therefore MR serving and neighbour cell measurement with further time domain relaxation than that is allowed in Rel-18 specification for IDLE/INACTIVE and/or at least serving cell RRM offloaded from MR to LR are beneficial.\n-\tCompared with existing I-DRX operation,\n-\tSignificant UE power saving gain (up to more than 90%) is observed by using LP-WUS/WUR to trigger UE MR paging monitoring compared with existing I-DRX operation (with and without PEI), if sufficient relaxation to MR RRM measurement is applied.\n-\tFor duty-cycled LP-WUS monitoring and same duty ratio, higher power saving gain is observed if the relative power consumption of LP-WUR ON for LP-WUS monitoring is lower.\n-\tFor continuous LP-WUS monitoring, UE power saving gain is only observed if the relative power consumption of LP-WUR ON for LP-WUS monitoring is lower, e.g. no larger than 1 unit.\n-\tIf the MR enters ultra deep sleep while monitoring LP-WUS, compared with legacy I-DRX operation with same I-DRX cycle, moderate paging latency increase (e.g. ~400ms) is observed by using LP-WUS/WUR, due to the ramp up and re-sync procedure of MR from ultra-deep sleep state and if legacy paging occasion is reused. From RAN1 perspective, potential techniques to decrease the latency e.g. using shorter I-DRX cycles, dynamic paging occasion determination, UE MR transmit PRACH directly after wake-up by LP-WUS, UE MR entering deep sleep during LP LP-WUS monitoring, were proposed and evaluated.\n-\tCompared with existing eDRX operation, significant paging latency reduction and moderate UE power saving gain is observed, if LP-WUS monitoring and the corresponding paging monitoring after MR wake-up is performed not restricted within existing PTW of eDRX. Significant UE power gain and moderate paging latency increase is observed if LP-WUS monitoring is restricted within existing PTW of eDRX and existing paging occasion determination is reused.\nRAN1 has carried out system level evaluations for the UE power saving and UPT benefit of using LP-WUS/WUR for CONNETED mode UEs with different traffic types including XR, FTP and IM. Existing power saving techniques, including Rel-15 long/short C-DRX cycle, Rel-16 DCP, Rel-17 PDCCH skipping/SSSG switching and Rel-18 enhanced C-DRX for non-integer periodicities are used for in the evaluation comparison.\n-\tFor XR traffic and LP-WUS to trigger the UE MR PDCCH monitoring,\n-\tModerate UE power saving gain (up to more than 10%) across different types of XR traffic and system load scenarios can be observed, larger UE power saving gain can be observed if the UE MR can enter light sleep instead of micro sleep during LP-WUS monitoring by LR.\n-\tThe impact to the XR capacity is marginal for low load scenarios. For high load scenarios, the impact to the XR capacity is also marginal when the UE MR enters the micro sleep state and relatively larger when MR enters the light sleep state during LR LP-WUS monitoring.\n-\tFor FTP and IM traffic,\n-\tFor the usage of LP-WUS to trigger the UE MR PDCCH monitoring,\n-\tCompared with existing UE power saving techniques, significant UE power saving gain (up to more than 60%) and moderate UPT improvement (up to more than 10%) when the UE MR enters deep sleep state during LR LP-WUS monitoring, larger UPT improvement (up to more than 180%) is observed for traffic with small packets, e.g. IM. Relatively lower or no UE power saving gain can be observed when the UE MR enters light sleep during LR LP-WUS monitoring, but the UPT improvement is higher (up to more than 50%).\n-\tCompared with UE MR always-on PDCCH monitoring, significant UE power saving gain (up to more than 40%) and similar UPT performance can be observed, when UE MR enters micro sleep during LR LP-WUS monitoring.\n-\tFor the usage of LP-WUS as the wake-up mechanism of C-DRX similar to DCP\n-\tSignificant UE power saving gain (up to more than 30%) and moderate degradation to the UPT (less than 10%) can be observed, especially when the C-DRX cycle is shorter (e.g. 40ms) .\nRAN1 has carried out coverage evaluation to compare the MIL performance of LP-WUS with that of legacy NR channels (e.g. PUSCH for MSG3, PDCCH for Paging). It is observed that for LP-WUS can achieve comparable MIL performance with that of NR PUSCH MSG3, with the assumed resource for each LP-WUS transmission is as the following, in which RedCap and non-RedCap UE cases are not further distinguished.\n-\tFor Urban scenario and single PUSCH MSG3 transmission\n-\tFor OOK-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 0.9~17.28 MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tFor FSK-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 4.32~25.92 MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tFor OFDM-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 0.31~4.32 MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tFor Urban scenario and PUSCH MSG3 transmission with two retransmissions (one source)\n-\tFor OOK-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 241.92 MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tFor OFDM-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 2.16 MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tFor Rural scenarios and single PUSCH MSG3 transmission\n-\tFor OOK-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 0.18~8.64MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tFor FSK-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 4.32 MHz*Symbol/bit (one source)\n-\tFor OFDM-based LP-WUS, the required resource reported is 1.8~3.6MHz*Symbol/bit\n-\tNote the above OFDM symbol assumes subcarrier spacing 30kHz\n-\tIn general, it is much more challenging for LP-WUS to reach comparable MIL as legacy PDCCH with AL16/AL8, more resources occupancy and/or coverage enhancement techniques for LP-WUS transmission would be required to reach such challenging MIL target.\nFor the overhead of LP-WUS used for RRC IDLE/INACTIVE UEs, it depends on the number of information bits, time-frequency occupation, traffic inter-arrival time, number of beams, system BW.\n-\tFor 5MHz LP-WUS with single PUSCH MSG 3 as MIL target\n-\tFor OFDM based LP-WUS carrying information of up to 24bits, the overhead is marginal (up to 0.16%) for 20MHz or 100MHz system BW\n-\tFor OOK/FSK-2 based LP-WUS carrying information up to 24bit, the overhead is marginal (up to 1.98%) for 20MHz. Note that in this case, the overhead evaluation in some sources includes LP-WUS and LP-SS. The reported maximum payload and maximum overhead are from different sources and are not corresponds to each other.\n-\tFor 5MHz LP-WUS with paging PDCCH (AL8/AL16) as the MIL target and 20MHz system BW,\n-\tFor OFDM based LP-WUS carrying information up to 8bits, the overhead is marginal (up to 0.19%) (one source)\n-\tFor OOK-based LP-WUS carrying information up to 48bits, the overhead can be significant (up to 21%). Note that in this case, the overhead evaluation in some sources includes LP-WUS and LP-SS\nFor the overhead of LP-WUS used RRC CONNECTED mode (One source)\n-\tFor XR and 10 UEs per cell (maximum system capacity) and 100MHz system BW, the overhead of OOK-based LP-WUS carrying up to 12bits information bits is small (up to 4.3%);\n-\tFor FTP3 traffic and 10 UEs per cell, RU 40%, 100MHz system BW, the overhead of OOK-based LP-WUS carrying up to 12 information bits is marginal (up to 0.36%);\nFor OOK based LP-SS with 5MHz, 8 beams and 20MHz system bandwidth, the overhead is 0.4% for 320ms LP-SS periodicity and 1 slot (30kHz) duration per beam, and 0.3% for 1280ms LP-SS periodicity and 3 slots (30KHz) duration per beam. The overhead of other configurations can be derived by scaling accordingly.\nThe additional increased network power consumption due to LP-SS is also studied assuming LP-SS is an additional signal transmission than the existing NR signal/channels. When 320ms LP-SS periodicity, 4 or 8 beams and no more than 14 symbols LP-SS duration is assumed, the additional increased network power consumption rate is marginal (0.06%~3.9%), (0.07%~2.716%), (0.388%~1.076%) for zero load, low load and medium load respectively. For 320ms LP-SS periodicity, 8 beams and 42 symbols LP-SS duration, one source shows the additional increase network power consumption rate is 11.4%.\nLower impact to the network power consumption is expected when LP-SS is transmitted FDM with NR SSB/SIB-1.\n",

RAN1 studied RSRP and RSRQ measurement accuracy based on LP-SS (based on OOK which can be received by envelop detector) assuming AWGN channel and observed that depending on SNR target X= {-9, -11} dB as seen by LP-WUR, and depending on 90% accuracy of 3 or 5 dB, different number symbols (1 -20) spread over 1-3 periods is required. Timing and frequency impairments were also considered. Corresponding SNR observed by MR and LR is different due to NF difference between them. Accuracy of RSRP and RSRQ measurement depends on sampling rate.\nRAN1 studied RSRP measurement accuracy based on SSS (OFDMA received by I/Q detector) and observed that depending on SNR target X= [-3, -6] dB as seen by LP-WUR, and depending on 90% accuracy of 3dB, 1 OFDMA symbol in 1 period is required, assuming TDL-C. Timing and frequency impairments were also considered.\nFor waveform generation of OOK/FSK the following observations were made. Flat spectrum in frequency domain provides robustness against frequency selective fading compared to concentrated energy in frequency domain. For OOK-4, sequence before DFT/LS with variation in phase via such as ZC, M-sequence or QAM sequence can achieve more flattened spectrum. Sequence(s) used in LP-WUS symbol generation with different pulse shape or spectral shape may have different performances. Knowledge of sequence(s) used in LP-WUS waveform generation may improve performance for at least a receiver with I/Q branches.\nPre-storing of the generated frequency domain samples to be mapped to LP-WUS sub-carrier segment of iFFT at gNB may reduce complexity of waveform generation at gNB with memory requirement depending on number of possible combinations. The number of combinations is function of number of supported LP-WUS bandwidth sizes, supported values of M for OOK-4, etc. Pre-storing of the generated frequency domain samples may be up to gNB implementation. For OOK4, Manchester coding will reduce the number of combinations for OOK-4 given the same time/frequency resource.\nRAN1 studied LP-WUS bandwidth, at least for IDLE/Inactive mode, at least one BW-size smaller or equal to 5MHz is recommended to be supported for FR1. Other BW sizes are not precluded, however if additional BW-size(s) are recommended to be supported, BW-size can be up to 20MHz. LP-WUS bandwidth size (including guard-bands) is assumed to be an integer number of PRBs. From RAN1 perspective, LP-WUS and signals/channels by MR can be at least on the same carrier in the same band. From RAN1 perspective, for multiplexing with other NR signals and channels, it is beneficial if LP-WUS can be flexibly configured within a carrier.\nRAN1 studied synchronization of LP-WUR. At least for LP-WUR that cannot receive existing PSS/SSS, periodic LP-SS signal is beneficial for the following functionalities: (a) RRM measurements by LP-WUR, if supported (b) At least coarse time synchronization of LP-WUR. (c) At least coarse frequency synchronization of LP-WUR. Additional periodic LP-SS system overhead depends on LP-SS periodicity, system BW, number of beams, and resource required to fulfil the target functionality, etc. Periodic signal if used for coarse synchronization may reduce the overhead of signal preceding LP-WUS, if any. LP-SS can be designed to be common among UE groups (cell-specific) and further reduce system overhead. For LP-WUR that can receive existing PSS/SSS potentially assisted by PBCH DMRS/TRS for synchronization, existing PSS/SSS potentially assisted by PBCH DMRS/TRS may be used for above functionality. Periodic LP-SS coverage should be equal or better than that of LP-WUS. For fine time and frequency synchronization, a signal (e.g., preamble) preceding or part of LP-WUS may be used.\nOFDMA waveform can provide coverage for LP-WUS with lower resource overhead. LP-WUR receiving OFDMA waveform can reuse PSS/SSS to perform RRM measurement and synchronization avoiding the introduction of periodic LP-SS within the carrier. Timing error robustness can be further improved using a sliding window at the receiver.\nSingle frequency segment OOK-1/OOK-4 can provide a range of spectral efficiencies while being the most robust waveform to frequency error while robustness to timing error decreases with the increasing of M, but could be addressed by using a sliding window at the receiver or by pulse shaping in time domain. OOK-4 with variable M can provide a flexible range of spectral efficiencies for a fixed LP-WUS resource. Sequences to generate ON duration in OFDMA transmitter, if specified, can help receiver (with I/Q branches) performance.\nFSK-2 can provide a range of spectral efficiencies by varying M while having good robustness to frequency error and moderate robustness to timing error. Frequency error robustness can be further improved using frequency error correction (i.e., utilizing 2^M parallel receiver structure or frequency domain sliding window), larger guard band between segments at the expense of less frequency diversity, and/or single frequency segment FSK2-envelope IF. Timing error robustness can be further improved using a sliding window or by pulse shaping in the time domain. Uniform distribution of frequency spectrum density can be achieved using single frequency segment FSK2-envelope IF which can provide robustness against frequency fading. Sequences to generate ON duration in OFDMA transmitter, if specified, can help receiver (with I/Q branches) performance.\n",

The LP-SS is a 32-bit low density sequence (i.e., a sequence with lower number of 1 bits compared to 0 bits, 2 ON bits are considered in every 8 bits) occupying 4 OFDM symbols.\n-\tLP-WUS-1: Waveform Option OOK-4 with M=2\n-\tLP-WUS-2: Waveform Option FSK-2 with M=2\n-\tLP-SS: Waveform Option OOK-4 with M=8\nFor both LP-WUS options, a SCS of 30 kHz, a 4.32 MHz LP-WUS bandwidth, and a 2.6 GHz Urban scenario (TDL-C 300) are considered. A 1/2 Manchester code is used for LP-WUS-1 resulting in an information data rate of 28kbps leading to payload+CRC occupying a total of 24 OFDM symbols. On the other hand, an information data rate of 56kbps is achieved by LP-WUS-2 leading to payload+CRC only occupying a total of 12 OFDM symbols. The coverage evaluation methodology in TR38.830 is used and the analysis is shown in Table Annex 8.5.5-1 below.\nTable Annex 8.5.5-1: Link budget analysis for PUSCH (Msg.3) and LP-WUS/LP-SS\n\nThe resource overhead incurred only by the LP-SS is evaluated in Table Annex 8.5.5-2 where system bandwidths  and number of beams  are considered. Further, periodicities  are considered.\nTable Annex 8.5.5-2: Resource overhead for LP-SS\n\nNext, the resource overhead for LP-WUS-1 and LP-WUS-2 is evaluated in Table Annex 8.5.5-3 for IoT use case according to the mMTC usage scenario with a connection density requirement of  devices/ as defined in the ITU-R M.2410 report on \"Minimum requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)\". Additionally, paging arrival is considered according to the traffic model with 1 message/2 hours/device or 1 message/day/device as defined in the ITU-R M.2412 report on \"Guidelines for evaluation of radio interface technologies for IMT-2020\". Further, a hexagonal network layout with inter-site distance (ISD) of 500m and 3 Transmission Reception Points (TRxPs) per site is considered. The average number of UEs to be simultaneously addressed in a LP-WUS is assumed to be . The results in Table Annex 8.5.5-2 and Table Annex 8.5.5-3 suggest that LP-SS/LP-WUS can be supported for IoT use case in urban deployments with coverage close to or exceeding that of PUSCH Msg3 at a resource overhead  considering  devices/km2 connection density, system bandwidth  MHz, number of transmission beams , and per UE paging arrival rate  1 message/2 hours.\nTable Annex 8.5.5-3: Resource overhead for LP-WUS considering  devices/km2 connection density\n\n",
