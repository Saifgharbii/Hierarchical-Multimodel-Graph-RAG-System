It illustrates the process of creating routing information, which is essential for efficient network communication. The diagram shows the flow of data packets from source to destination, with routers acting as the main hubs that forward packets to their respective destinations. The presence of routers and switches indicates a multi-hop network, where data packets are routed through multiple hops to reach their final destinations. The figure also highlights the importance of network protocols, such as IP routing and MPLS, in managing the flow of data packets. Overall, the figure provides a visual representation of the complex network architecture and the role of routers and switches in routing information creation.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.1-1: Routing Information creation\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a PUT request to the resource representing the UE's Mobile Terminated Short Message Information resource (i.e. …/mt-sms/{gpsi}) of the IP-SM-GW to update or create the routing information for a given UE.

The network consists of a base station (gNB), a user equipment (UE), and a cellular network infrastructure (CNI). The figure illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, with key components such as the base station, user equipment, and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the use of redundancy paths ensures failover reliability.

The content of the PUT request shall contain:\n-\tSMSF Instance Id.\n2a.\tIf the resource does not exist (there is no previous routing information stored in SMS Router for that user), SMS Router stores the received routing data and returns a \"201 Created\" response with the \"Location\" header containing the URI of the created resource.\nThe PUT response body shall include:\n-\tthe IP address of the SMS Router (to be sent by the UDM to the SMS-GMSC); and/or\n-\tthe FQDN of the SMS Router (to be sent by the UDM to the SMS-GMSC).\n2b. If the resource exists (there is previous routing information stored in SMS Router for that user), the SMS Router updates the routing data by replacing it with the received information, and responds with \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\".\n2c.\tOn failure, or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned.\nThe MtForwardSm service operation shall be used to transmit downlink SMS message via SMS Router.\nIt is used in the following procedures:\n-\tSuccessful Mobile Terminated short message transfer via SMS Router (see clause 5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 23.540 [14]).\n-\tUnsuccessful Mobile Terminated short message transfer via SMS Router (see clause 5.1.9 of 3GPP TS 23.540 [14]).\nThe NF Service Consumer (e.g. SMS-GMSC) shall transmit downlink SMS message to the SMS Router by using the HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.3.2.3.1-1.\n\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario where a downlink SMS message is transmitted. The network consists of a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and a network element (NE). The figure illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, showing how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 5.3.2.3.1-1: Transmit downlink SMS message\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource representing the UE's Mobile Terminated Short Message Information resource (i.e. …/mt-sms/{gpsi}/sendsms) of the SMS Router. The content of the POST request shall contain the SMS message to be sent.\n2a.\tOn success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned with \"SmsDeliveryData\" object contains the MT SMS Delivery Report in the response body.\n2b.\tOn failure, or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.2.3.3.4.2.2-2 shall be returned.\n",
