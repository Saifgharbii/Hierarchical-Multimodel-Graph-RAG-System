An NPN represents a 5G network with a delimited scope in its use (i.e. non-public use). This means that NPN management can be built upon the roles related to 5G networks management, as long as the scope of these roles is limited to acting on network and services for non-public use.\nAccording to the above rationale, the roles related to NPN management include:\n-\tNPN Service Customer (NPN-SC): a Communication Service Customer (CSC) which consumes communication services for non-public use, i.e. communication services offered over NPNs. An NPN-SC is the realization of the CSC role (see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8) in NPN environments.\n-\tNPN Service Provider (NPN-SP): a Communication Service Provider (CSP) which provides communication services for non-public use, i.e. communication services offered over NPNs. An NPN-SP is the realization of the CSP role (see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8) in NPN environments.\n-\tNPN Operator (NPN-OP): a Network Operator (NOP) whose management scope is limited to 5G networks for non-public use, i.e. NPNs. An NPN operator is the realization of the NOP role (see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8) in NPN environments.\n-\tNetwork Equipment Provider (NEP), including VNF supplier: see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8.\n-\tVirtualization Infrastructure Service Provider (VISP): see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8.\n-\tData Centre Service Provider (DCSP): see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8.\n-\tNFVI Supplier: see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8.\n-\tHardware Supplier: see definition in TS 28.530 [2], clause 4.8.\nNote that NEP, VISP, DCSP, NFVI supplier and Hardware Supplier roles are the same as defined for 5G networks and network slicing management. This is because their managed/provided assets are unaware of the public or non-public nature of 5G network and services running atop.\nDepending on actual scenarios and the type of NPNs under consideration, i.e. SNPN or PNI-NPN, different relationships can be found between NPN management roles and potential stakeholders, see annex A Deployment considerations on NPN management modes.\n",

Management of NPN has the following specific aspects:\n-\tAssurance for diversified SLA requirements: The diversified SLA requirements from different kinds of vertical industries need to be guaranteed, e.g. manufacturing industry and medical care need ultra-reliable low-latency wireless connectivity and indoor, outdoor or hybrid coverage NPN deployments. Other than performance requirements (e.g. ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability), functional and operational requirements should also be guaranteed in SLA, e.g. high-precision positioning, real-time monitoring, etc.\n-\tSupport of different O&M models: an O&M model allows specifying who is responsible for managing what part of the network. The various NPN scenarios, with a number of vertical use cases and a plenty of deployment variants, in some cases may lead to the definition of different O&M models. For example, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have sufficient technical expertise for their NPNs' deployment and operation. Therefore, cooperation with PLMN Operators to obtain O&M of NPNs from PLMN Operators might be the most cost-effective way for such customers. On the other hand, large enterprises like electric utility companies might want to have their own O&M for their NPNs to fulfil specific requirements.\n-\tManagement capability exposure: this expresses the ability of an NPN-SP to expose some management capabilities, such as performance and KPIs monitoring, fault supervision and provisioning management capabilities, to the corresponding NPN-SC. The NPN-SP makes the selected NPN management capabilities available through well-defined APIs to allow the NPN-SC to consume these capabilities, as well as extending them with their own operation and maintenance systems, if needed. NPN-SC may provide their business objectives by intents and policies management to NPN-SP and no need to focus on detailed configuration parameters of NPNs. The mobile management capabilities exposed to the enterprise are as follows.\n-\tManagement capability of configuration: The vertical may request to mobile network operator for a limited management capability which would enable the enterprise to dynamically change the configuration parameters (e.g. CAG configuration).\n-\tManagement capability of performance assurance: The performance assurance capabilities that may be provided to the enterprise may include creation of certain measurement jobs which collects the value of one or multiple measurement types which are the performance measurements and assurance data defined in TS 28.552 [12] or collects the value of one or multiple KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [13].\n-\tManagement capability of fault supervision: The fault supervision capabilities that may be provided to the enterprise may include get NSI/NSSI/NF alarm data and control NSI/NSSI/NF alarm data.\n",

In this case, no specific spectrum resources are required and service continuity (e.g. roaming) with PLMN is ensured by the mobile network operator who manages both PNI-NPN and PLMN.\n-\tMNO-Vertical Managed Mode: The NPN operator role is played by two parties: a mobile network operator, which also plays the NOP role for PLMN, and a vertical customer. The mobile network operator performs the main management tasks related to the PNI-NPN, while allowing the vertical to retain some control over this PNI-NPN. To that end, the vertical consumes the management capabilities exposed by the mobile network operator, being this exposure regulated according to the business agreement between the two parties. The mobile network operator shall restrict the types (e.g. provisioning, fault supervision, performance assurance) of management capabilities and corresponding managed network resource (e.g. NRM fragments) exposed to a vertical.

An optional connection to the public network services via the firewall, can be employed to enable NPN customers to access to public network services, such as voice, while within NPN coverage, see figure 1 in clause 5.2 of [5].\nTo manage an SNPN which is a 5GS (i.e. NG-RAN and 5GC) that can be optionally complemented with other access networks based on non-3GPP technologies (i.e. IEEE Wi-Fi), the standalone SNPN management system needs a dedicated NPN identifier. The combination of a PLMN ID and Network Identifier (NID) is used to identify an SNPN.\nThe NID shall consist of an assignment mode and an NID value, see figure 4.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a network identifier (NID) with a 4-digit number, which is used to uniquely identify a network within a 5G network. The NID is crucial for network management and security purposes.\nFigure 4.4-1: Network Identifier (NID)\nThe NID can be assigned using the following assignment models, see clause 5.30.2.1 of TS 23.501 [3] and clause 12.7.1 of TS 23.003 [6]:\n-\tSelf-assignment: NIDs are chosen individually by NPN-OP for SNPNs at deployment time (and may therefore not be unique) but use a different numbering space than the coordinated assignment NIDs as defined in TS 23.003 [6].

In order to access PNI-NPN, the UE shall have a subscription for the PLMN.\nPNI-NPN operation may optionally make use of the concept of Closed Access Group (CAG) [3], which enables the control of UE's access to PNI-NPN on a per cell basis (CAG cells). The CAG concept is used to prevent UEs which are not allowed to access the PNI-NPN from automatically selecting and accessing the associated cell(s). The CAG cell broadcasts information such that only UEs supporting CAG are accessing the cell. This is not possible with the sole use of network slicing unless an operator specific barring is used. That is why CAG concept is needed for access control.\nThe PLMN ID identifies the network and the CAG ID identifies the CAG cells. Network selection and reselection is performed based on PLMN ID. Cell selection and reselection, and access control are done based on the CAG ID.\nIn a PNI-NPN scenario, the CAG management aspects include:\n-\tAssignment and maintenance of CAG IDs.\n-\tManaging the actual list of UEs that are allowed on the CAG.

Such UE related data is easier or more cost-efficient to be acquired by NPN UEs compared with being acquired by other methods e.g. by add-on devices or applications. For example, healthcare industry NPN customers require location information of their NPN UEs applied in mobile medical machines for asset management; enterprise NPN customers require location information of the NPN UEs of their employees for attendance management.\nIn this case, 3GPP management system may need to collect UE related data and provide them to authorized NPN service customer. Such collected UE related data are generated by management services which are defined and implemented in 3GPP system, such as:\n-\tMDT data, including immediate MDT, logged MDT, RLF reports, accessibility measurements.\n-\tTrace data, to track traffic process of UEs and locate possible causes of traffic problems for example.\nFurthermore, according to pre-defined agreements among the NPN stakeholders, some specific UE related data can be provided to authorized NPN customer, e.g. to promote their positioning ability or evaluate QoE. Such data may be processed or masked based on collected data such as MDT or trace. For example, GNSS information can be extracted from MDT data to locate assets in NPN.\nA 5G Virtual Network (VN) group is a set of UEs using private communication for 5G LAN-type service [3].

In this situation, the 3GPP management system may collect UE related data and provide them to authorized NPN-SC. To obtain the UE related data, the NPN-SC may consume the corresponding capability exposed by the NPN-SP.\n5G-ACIA has described the functional requirements for exposing the capabilities of non-public 5G systems to industrial factory applications in [18]. The requirements given in clause 4.3 of 5G-ACIA white paper in [18] are for NPN fault management aspects, as following:\n\"[R-4.3.1-07] The 5G exposure reference points must allow monitoring of errors and other alarms from physical/logical network components and connections.\n[R-4.3.1-08] The 5G exposure reference points must provide the monitoring information in such a way that it can be effectively used for error detection, localization, root-cause analysis, and error resolution.\"\nTherefore, for vertical industry scenarios where 5G industry terminals, e.g. camera, programmable logic controller (PLC) and smart distribution transformer terminal, etc., are widely deployed in NPN, 3GPP management system needs to provide fault management capabilities to detect rapidly whether or not the faults occurred on the NPN side.\nAs described in clause 4.2, an NPN service customer is used to represent the role of communication service customer in NPN environment. NPN service customer can request and consume the management capabilities exposed by the mobile network operator. The mobile network operator would restrict the types (e.g. provisioning, fault supervision, performance assurance) of management capabilities and corresponding managed network resource exposed to an NPN service customer. The restriction of MnS consumption can be achieved through the granular access control on NPN service customer and the filtering of MnS.\nTS 22.104 [22] presents service requirements of cyber-physical control applications (e.g. motion control, process automation, etc.) in vertical domains, which require very high levels of communication service availability and/or very low end-to-end latencies.\nNPN scenarios bring very specific requirements with regards to SLA fulfilment (e.g., much more stringent KPIs to be fulfilled) and assurance (e.g., different granularity in reporting, much quicker reaction to remediate SLS deviations). Therefore, the 3GPP management system for NPN needs to be provisioned with appropriate capabilities to fulfil these requirements.\n\n",

It is either an MNO or an enterprise can be playing a role of NPN-SP, and it is an enterprise (the different or same if the enterprise is also NPN-SP) be playing a role of NPN-SC. This SNPN consists of network resources decoupled from PLMN resources, including:\n-\tRAN NE(s)\n-\t5GC network functions\n-\tTransport network\nIn this scenario, the NPN-SC sends to the NPN-SP a request for the provision of an NPN. This request contains the NPN related SLS requirements. To fulfil the SLS of requested NPN, the NPN-SP decides to create a new SNPN.\nThe NPN-SP maps SLS of requested NPN into 3GPP 5G system related requirements. These requirements allow the NPN operator to decide on the constituent network resources and the topology of the 3GPP 5G network to be created for the SNPN, as follows:\n-\tFor the AN and CN related parts, the NPN operator takes all the actions needed to set up and configure required network resources, including RAN NE(s) and 5GC network functions. For more details, refer to TS 28.531 [8], clauses 5.1.17 \"Creation of 3GPP NF\" and 5.1.18 \"Configuration of a 3GPP NF instance\". Some of these actions can require setting up a new 3GPP sub-network. For more details, refer to TS 28.531 [8], clause 5.1.19 \"Creation of a 3GPP sub-network\".\n-\tFor the TN related part, the NPN operator takes all the actions needed to set up the required connectivity along the RAN and CN, configuring the underlying transport network. When taking these actions, information on SNPN topology (e.g. external connection points of AN and CN) and performance (e.g. latency, bandwidth) should be considered.\nIf the requested NPN requires connectivity to external PLMN resources (e.g. to allow UEs registered into the SNPN to access public network services), the NPN-SP derives the requirements for such a connectivity. These requirements allow the NPN operator to configure the transport network connecting the SNPN and the PLMN accordingly.\nNOTE 1:\tTo allow UEs to access public network services from the SNPN, the UEs also have to be registered in the PLMN UDM.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the derivation of connectivity requirements between SNPN and the PLMN, the NPN-SP makes use of two sources of information:\n1)\tthe SLS of requested NPN, received from the NPN-SC; and\n2)\tconnectivity information of the created 3GPP 5G network, received from the NPN operator.\nIn this use case, depending on different situations, the NPN operator role can be played by:\n-\tthe mobile network operator only. In such MNO Managed Mode case, the mobile network operator takes the entire responsibility of operating the SNPN and managing SNPN-PLMN connectivity, if required; or\n-\tthe mobile network operator and the enterprise. In such MNO-Vertical Mode case, the mobile network operator can expose some management capabilities to the enterprise, according to business agreement between the two parties. SNPN-PLMN connectivity, if required, is always managed by the mobile network operator; or\n-\tthe vertical only. In such Vertical Managed Mode case, the enterprise takes the entire responsibility of operating the SNPN. The SNPN-PLMN connectivity, if required, is always managed by the mobile network operator who takes the entire responsibility of operating the PLMN.\nIn this use case depending on the different NID assignment models as described in clause 4.4, the NPN operator role can configure the NID to related AN nodes and 5GC NFs.

While in 3GPP management system, tenant represents a group of MnS consumers associated with the management capabilities they are allowed to access and consume (see clause 4.8 of TS 28.533 [21]). Therefore, the management of NPN-SC, which focuses on the granular access control of NPN-SC, is achieved through the management of context information for tenants.\nThe creation of tenant context is finished during tenant registration procedure. The tenant registers to NPN-SP/OP for two reasons:\n-\tEnable the authentication and authorization to tenant.\n-\tEnable the tenant to obtain the permitted MnS information (e.g., MnS type and MnS components).\nFigure 6.1.3-1 shows the procedure of management of tenant.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for managing a tenant in a telecommunications network. It outlines the necessary steps to ensure efficient and effective tenant management, including the identification of the tenant, the creation of a tenant profile, the assignment of roles and permissions, and the monitoring and reporting of tenant activities. The figure is a visual representation of the complex process involved in managing a tenant in a telecommunications network, providing a clear and concise overview of the steps involved.\nFigure 6.1.3-1: Procedure of management of tenant\nThe pre-condition of the procedure is that the NPN-SC and NPN-SP/OP have reached a business agreement. Tenant provides the vertical information (e.g. human readable name of vertical, subscribed management capabilities exposed to vertical, etc.) to register a vertical to NPN-SP/NPN-OP through a tenant registration request message.\n1)\tAccording to the tenant identifier provided by tenant (playing the role of NPN-SC), access control MnS producer (i.e. Authentication and Authorization MnS producer) identifies the management capabilities that are allowed to exposed to the tenant. After specifying the management capabilities for the tenant, access control MnS producer generates credential/access token for authentication/authorization and decides to request the creation of MOI Identity, Role and PermissionForMnSs to manage tenant context.\nEditor's NOTE: reference to IOC Identity, Role and PermissionForMnSs (see 3GPP draftCR 28.533 S5-234845), will be updated later after the draftCR converted to a CR.\n2)\tAccess control MnS producer sends the createMOI request to MnS provisioning producer to create the instances of IOC Identity, Role and PermissionForMnSs of certain tenant to manage tenant context information. For the definition of operation createMOI, see clause 11.1.1.1 of TS 28.532 [14].\n3)\tMnS provisioning producer executes the createMOI operations.\nMnS provisioning producer returns operation execution state (e.g., OperationSucceeded or OperationFailed) and the name/value pairs of MOIs’ attributes to access control MnS producer. The name/value pairs of MOIs’ attributes, as tenant context, include the identifier of tenant, credential, permitted MnSs, etc.\n\n",
