                    "text_content": "5G Network Slicing is one of the most distinctive features provided by 5G NR and is key to meet diversified services requirements in 5G era. With the introduction of 5G network slicing technology, operators will be able to provide network capabilities with different functional characteristics, which will provide e.g. \"exclusive\" network for users with different KPI requirements to ensure a high-quality of service and meet differentiated scenario requirements. 5G network slicing can also help to achieve the goal of improving the efficiency of network resource utilization, optimizing the network construction investment of operators, and building a flexible and agile 5G network.\nThe user experience resulting from the use of 5G network slicing is critical for commercial success, and therefore testing the operation of 5G network slicing is necessary to ensure consistent predictable behaviour. To enable testing the 5G UEs supporting network slicing as they are used in the field the application layer at the device side needs to be included in the testing, as URSP based network slice selection and traffic routing procedures are based on traffic descriptor components (see TS 24.526) passed on by the application layer to the UE protocol stack. The traffic descriptor components that are passed onto the UE protocol stack to be used as a base for the network slice selection when a specific application requests a PDU session are configured within the device. There is a strong industry demand to define the test methods and test procedures that include the full related UE application layer in the testing of the network slice selection functionality for 5G UE supporting network slicing.\n",

Thus, a variety of test points should be picked across different physical layer conditions (doppler, signal-to-noise ratio, antenna configurations, etc.).\nThere can be multiple usages of network slicing with different needs such as mission critical ultra-reliable low latency slice, massive machine to machine type communication slice, extreme high throughput mobile broadband slice. Depending on the use case, channel requirements will be different and accordingly the application layer performance will also be benchmarked.\nDuring the application layer throughput measurement, ACK, NACK and DTX can also be recorded in order to calculate the L1 payload bit throughput, although this is not the main target of the test procedure. The measured throughput and its comparison to an expected throughput value can be evaluated. However, the parameters for this measurement are not as controlled as in the case of L1 throughput.\nFor fixed reference channel testing, the UE is compared against a predefined limit at the physical layer. Therefore, statistics can be derived to determine the minimum number of samples for a given confidence level for the pass/fail decision. While the application layer data throughput is of a statistical nature, in case of fixed reference channel testing, it is possible to set a lower bound for the achievable throughput by computing the overhead due to upper layer payload headers.\n",

The end goal here is to optimize the utilization of the allocation of network resources and the quality of service metrics.\nFor fixed or variable reference channel and an SST, the UE latency for each data traffic session per slice needs to be captured and evaluated against the required maximum delay in reception of the desired data packet. Based on the measured packet delay and jitter experienced e2e evaluation of the layer latency can be derived and benchmarked. Important aspect here to consider would be to adjust the tolerance +/- of the latency and jitter in percentage terms to define a final evaluation criterion as per testing needs and network traffic type usage.\n",

If PASS/FAIL requirements are recommended, appropriate analysis of test tolerance shall be considered.\nTest system uncertainties play a big role in application layer throughput results. The tighter the uncertainty requirements are the more re-producible and comparable the results are.\nIn TS 38.521-4 [12] applicable test system uncertainty has been specified. Test System Uncertainty is a measure how accurately tester can setup the certain parameter/signal level to the specified level. In5G NR UE Full Stack Testing for Network Slicing, for service performance test procedure the most meaningful test system uncertainties are listed in Annex F of 38.521-4[12].\nThese specified test system uncertainties are very tight requirements for test systems. Typically the specified uncertainty values are the best that test system vendors can achieve when their test systems are fully calibrated. Full calibration means that each individual device, signal route and cable has to be calibrated. Hence the calibration costs take quite a big share of total costs of 3GPP compliant test systems.\n",
