The radio interface is composed of the Layer 1, 2 and 3. The TS 38.200 series describes the Layer 1 (Physical Layer) specifications. Layers 2 and 3 are described in the 38.300 series.\nThe figure depicts the radio interface protocol architecture around the physical layer, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It includes the radio interface protocol (RIP), the physical layer, and the network layer. The figure shows the use of different protocols such as Ethernet, IP, and MPLS, as well as the use of different network layers like the physical layer, the network layer, and the transport layer. The figure also shows the use of different protocols like Ethernet, IP, and MPLS, as well as the use of different network layers like the physical layer, the network layer, and the transport layer.\nFigure 1: Radio interface protocol architecture around the physical layer\nFigure 1 shows the NR radio interface protocol architecture around the physical layer (Layer 1). The physical layer interfaces the Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer of Layer 2 and the Radio Resource Control (RRC) Layer of Layer 3. The circles between different layer/sub-layers indicate Service Access Points (SAPs). The physical layer offers a transport channel to MAC. The transport channel is characterized by how the information is transferred over the radio interface. MAC offers different logical channels to the Radio Link Control (RLC) sub-layer of Layer 2. A logical channel is characterized by the type of information transferred.\n",

A resource block spans 12 sub-carriers with a given sub-carrier spacing.\nThe radio frame has a duration of 10ms and consists of 10 sub-frames with a sub-frame duration of 1ms.

Before the LDPC coding, for large transport blocks, the transport block is segmented into multiple code blocks with equal size.
