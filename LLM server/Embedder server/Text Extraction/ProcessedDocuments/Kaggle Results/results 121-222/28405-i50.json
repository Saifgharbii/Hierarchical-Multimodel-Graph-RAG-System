            "description": "The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:\nTS 28.404:\t\"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Concepts, use cases and requirements\";\nTS 28.405:\t\"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control and configuration\";\nTS 28.406:\t\"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Information definition and transport\".\nOne main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user experience, which is why the evaluation of the user experience at the UE side is vital to network operators. This is especially true when the operators provide high bit rate real-time services like streaming services (typically video services), where even intermittent quality degradation is very annoying. Many of these streaming services are a significant part of the commercial traffic growth rate, therefore the focus is on the end users' experience.\nQuality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed information at session level on a number of UEs.\nThe capability to log information within a UE, and in particular the QoE of an end user service, initiated by an operator, provides the operator with QoE information. The collected information (specified in 3GPP TS 26.247 [6]) cannot be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.\nThe QoE information is information collected by the end user application in the UE.\nThe QoE information is collected by the management system for analysis and/or KPI calculations.\n",
