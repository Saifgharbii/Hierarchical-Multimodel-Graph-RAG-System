The MDA output is provided by the MDAS (Management Data analytics Service) producer to the corresponding consumer(s) that requested the analytics.\nThe MDA can identify ongoing issues impacting the performance of the network and services, and help to identify in advance potential issues that may cause potential failure and/or performance degradation. The MDA can also assist to predict the network and service demand to enable the timely resource provisioning and deployments which would allow fast time-to-market network and service deployments.\nManagement Data Analytics Service (MDAS), the services exposed by the MDA, can be consumed by various consumers, including for instance MnFs (i.e. MnS producers/consumers for network and service management), NFs (e.g. NWDAF), SON functions, network and service optimization tools/functions, SLS assurance functions, human operators, and AFs, etc.\nNOTE:\tThroughout the present document the terms, MDAS and MDA MnS are equivalent and may be used interchangeably.\n",

For example, a prediction of load in an area of interest may differ when all gNBs and potential additional RATs are operating compared to case where certain gNBs or other RATs are experiencing a fault or are powered off to save energy. The analytics conducted and produced by the MDA MnS producer for these two example scenarios would be different and directly affected by the specific status of network. Although the network status (context) affects the produced analytics conducted by the MDA producer, awareness of the network context would fall on the consumer side to complement the obtained analytics results. This network context, reflecting network status at the time of enabling data collection, is important for the MDA MnS consumer to understand the network conditions related to the obtained analytics and hence be able to use such analytics more efficiently.\nThe MDA MnS consumer cannot expect the MDA producer to provide the network context, because the network context interest of each MDA MnS consumer may differ depending on the usage and purpose of analytics. The usage can include a proprietary algorithm that assist a decision-making process. For example, a load balancing algorithm may require the load and mobility information among neighbouring gNB whereas other load balancing algorithms may also require load and mobility information from a greater geographical area.\nIn addition, the selection of the parameters and their combinations may prove to be impractical for the MDA MnS producer to prepare and provide. Hence, it is efficient for the MDA MnS producer to prepare only the MDA output without including any network context and allow the MDA MnS consumer to obtain the required network context, to complement the obtained analytics, using conventional configuration management procedures as described in TS 28.511 [20] and TS 28.531 [21].\n",

It involves monitoring and collection of events, status and performance of the managed networks and services, and providing the observed/collected data.\nAnalytics: The data analytics for the managed networks and services. MDA plays the role of Analytics in the management loop. It prepares, processes and analyses the observed/collected data or time series of the observed/collected data related to the managed networks and services. MDA reports may contain root cause analysis of ongoing issues, predictions of potential issues and corresponding relevant causes and recommended actions for preventions, and/or prediction of network and/or service demands.\nDecision: The decision making for the management actions for the managed networks and services. The management actions are decided based on the analytics reports (provided by MDA) and other management data (e.g. historical decisions made previously) if necessary. The decision may be made by the consumer of MDAS (in the closed management control loop), or by a human operator (in the case of open management loop). The decision may include e.g. what actions to take, and when to take the actions.\nExecution: The execution of the management actions according to the decisions. During the execution step, the actions are carried out to the managed networks and services, and the reports (e.g. notifications, logs) of the executed actions are provided.\n",

                            "text_content": "This MDA capability is for analysis of coverage related problem.\nThe RAN coverage problem may cause UEs to be out of service or result in a downgrade of network performance offered to the UEs, such as failure of random access, paging, RRC connection establishment or handover, low data throughput, abnormal releases of RRC connection or UE context, and dissatisfied QoE.\nThere are various types of coverage problems, e.g. weak coverage, a coverage hole, a pilot pollution, an overshoot coverage, or a DL and UL channel coverage mismatch, etc., caused by different sorts of reasons, such as insufficient or weak transmission power, blocked by constructions and/or restricted by terrain.\nThe 5G related coverage problem may exist in NR, in E-UTRA or both.\nTo unravel a coverage problem, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to determine the details about when and where the problem occurred or likely to occur, and the type and cause(s) of the problem. Therefore, it is desirable for MDA to correlate and analyze multifold data (such as performance measurements, MDT reports, RLF reports, RCEF reports, UE location reports, together with the geographical, terrain and configuration data of the RAN) to detect and describe the problem with detailed information.\nThe RAN coverage related problems can cause network performance degradation and in the extreme cases can result into service degradation. So besides identifying the problems after they have happened, it is also necessary to proactively avoid the RAN coverage related problems well before they occur.\nTo avoid coverage related problems or to proactively undertake actions to avoid their occurrence, the consumer of MDA MnS may wish to know the characteristics and quality of the coverage of the RAN. This may be expressed graphically on a Map, called a Radio Environment Map, that shows the coverage quality for a set of cells. Such a map may be constructed e.g. to show the RSRP or the SINR of the cells as derived from the observed UE performance and/or from radio configuration parameters of the cells including transmit powers, antenna gains, antenna tilts, etc. It is desirable that the MDAS producer can provide the Radio Environment Map in an appropriate graphical form.\nMoreover, where a new RAN node is provisioned, the MDAS producer should be able to take into considerations the coverage of existing cells as defined by a Radio Environment Map and derive the configuration of the new cell(s) and the existing cells to optimize the coverage. Image analytics should help to identify the most optimized set of initial radio configurations that can be assigned to a new RAN NE.\nTo help MDAS consumer to solve the coverage problem as quickly as possible, MDA may also provide, along with the description of the problem, the recommended remedy actions (e.g. reconfigure or add cells, beams, antennas, etc.).\nTable 7.2.1.1.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for the slice coverage analysis.\nThe slice coverage is one of the indicators when a 3rd party (i.e. slice tenant) issues a slice request and is mapped into the desired geographical coverage area with the available radio coverage which depends on the base station planning and deployment. In order to map the desired slice coverage perfectly, MDA can be used to optimize the slice coverage on the slice instantiation and runtime considering:\ni)\tslice-aware statistics, e.g. slice-UE distributions and mobility patterns;\nii)\tslice SLA; and\niii)\taccess node capabilities.\nIn 5G the notion of coverage is represented by a set of one or more Tracking Areas (TAs), which are contained in a Registration Area (RA), which is assigned to a UE once it registers to the network. Depending on the MDA MnS producer output, TA and RA planning, i.e. grouping cells to form a TA and then TAs to an RA, can be optimized and the RAN parameters can be adjusted to shape the cell edges and load distribution. The main objective is to fulfill a given slice SLA involving as few cells as possible by leveraging the benefits of adjusting cell configurations for satisfying the desired coverage.\nTable 7.2.1.2.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for enabling various functionalities related to paging optimization.\nAs per the current procedures, if the UE goes Out-Of-Coverage (OOC) the paging which was initiated by the network Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) fails. The re-attempts continue to fail until UE enters the coverage and respond to the paging attempts. This repetitive paging attempts result in the wastage of network resources. As an example, the use case includes a user or a group of users getting into an area, with no cellular coverage on a regular basis for a considerably long duration, for e.g. the user gets into a shielded room for some testing purpose every day for a defined period. The Network initiated paging for such users will fail until they are back in the area with cellular coverage. This would result in in-efficient network resource usage.\nIt is desirable to use MDAS (Management data analytic service) to optimize the current paging procedures in 5G networks. MDAS producer provides an analytics output containing the user(s) paging analytics indicating the time window at which a group of users are OOC on a regular basis at the particular location. MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g. AMF, gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when there are more chances for it to be successful.\nTable 7.2.1.3.3-1\n\n",

In 5G system, the diversity of network services is expanding all the time and the requirements of different services especially from vertical users are being standardized. Considering these diverse requirements and expectation from end user perspective (e.g. priorities of SLA related attributes such as latency, throughput, maximum number of users or different required values of these attributes), the service experience as a comprehensive indicator need to be extensively analysed.\nTable 7.2.2.1.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for the network slice throughput analysis.\nThroughput is of great importance which represents the end users' experiences and also reflects the network problems, e.g. low UE throughput may be caused by resource shortage. In order to satisfy the requirements of dL/ulThptPerSlice in the ServiceProfile, MDAS may be utilized for throughput related analysis/predictions for network slice instance.\nMDAS producer allows the consumer to request analytics of network slice throughput related issues and identify the corresponding root cause(s) to assist throughput assurance. Network slice throughput analysis can be for a specific domain and/or for cross-domain. The two level MDAS producers, i.e. domain-specific and cross-domain may work in coordination to assure the optimum throughput performance.\nTable 7.2.2.2.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for the prediction of network slice traffic patterns.\nIt is desirable to use MDAS to get the network slice traffic predictions including individual traffic load predictions on each of the constituent network function instance present in the network slice. The traffic load predictions per constituent network function instances can be used for better resource provisioning of the network slice. For example, resources can be pre-configured considering the predicted traffic on the network slice.\nTable 7.2.2.3.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for E2E latency related issue analysis.\nE2E latency is an important parameter for URLLC services. User data packets should be successfully delivered within certain time constraints to satisfy the end users requirements. Latency could be impacted by the network capability and network configurations. These factors may be the root cause if the latency requirements cannot be achieved. Packet transmission latency may dynamically change if these factors change. The latency requirement should be assured even if some of the network conditions may degrade. It is important for the MDAS producer to analyze the latency related issues to support SLS assurance.\nTable 7.2.2.4.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for network slice load analysis.\nNetwork slice load may vary during different time periods. Therefore, network resources allocated initially could not always satisfy the traffic requirements, for example, the network slice may be overloaded or underutilized. Overload of signalling in control plane and/or user data congestion in user plane will lead to underperforming network. Besides, allocating excessive resources for network slice with light load will decrease resource efficiency.\nThe analysis of network slice load should consider the load of services with different characteristics (e.g. QoS information, service priority), load distribution to derive the corresponding resource requirements. Load distribution analytic result may be provided, e.g. load distribution for network slices, different locations and/or time periods etc.\nTraffics and resources related performance measurements and UE measurements can be utilized by MDAS producer to identify degradation of the performance measurements and KPI documented in an SLS due to load issues, e.g. radio resource utilization. MDAS producer may further provide recommendations to the network slice load issue. This analytics results can be considered as an input to support SLA assurance to perform further evaluation.\nTable 7.2.2.5.3-1\n\n",

These faults and the associated failures need extensive troubleshooting. In order to reduce network and service failure time and performance degradation, it is necessary to supervise the status of various network functions and resources, and predict the running trend of network and potential failures to intervene in advance. These predictions can be used by the management system to autonomously maintain the health of the network, e.g. speedy recovery actions on a network function related to the predicted potential failure.\nDue to the fact that failure prediction could depend on the existing alarm incidents and relevant historical and real-time data (performance measurement information, configuration data, network topology information, etc.), there is a possibility for MDA to be used in conjunction with AI/ML technologies and model training to predict potential failures.\nIn order to avoid the occurrence of failures and abnormal network status, it is necessary for consumers of analytics to obtain the required details of potential failure and the corresponding degradation trend (abnormal KPI, performance measurement information, possible alarm type, fault root cause, etc.). Therefore, MDA, may in conjunction with AI/ML technology, be required to obtain basic health maintenance knowledge (e.g. the relationship between the failures or potential failures and the related maintenance actions) through predefined expertise or model training, so as to effectively predict potential failures. The basic health maintenance knowledge could be updated with feedback.\nIf necessary, MDA could also provide corresponding recommended actions for failure prevention.\nTable 7.2.3.1.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for service failure recovery.\nThere are multiple sources of faults which may cause the 5G system to fail to provide the expected service. When a service interruption disaster occurs (e.g. massive call disconnections), it is important for MDA to provide analytics to suggest management actions to quickly recover the service while avoiding causing other problems (e.g. signalling overload) during the recovery. The analysis of failure recovery can be used by the management system to recover from service interruptions in an orderly manner.\nAs an example, in case that the service interruption occurs, the MDA can provide analysis of the possible recovery plan and the recommended actions for service recovery (e.g., update NF, change configuration of core network NF etc.).\nTable 7.2.3.2.3-1\n\n",

                            "text_content": "This MDA capability is for the energy saving analysis.\nOperators are aiming at decreasing power consumption in 5G networks to lower their operational expense with energy saving management solutions. Energy saving is achieved by activating the energy saving mode of the NR capacity booster cell or 5GC NFs (e.g. UPF etc.). The energy saving decision making is typically based on the load information of the related cells/UPFs, the energy saving policies set by operators and the energy saving recommendations provided by MDAS producer. To achieve an optimized balance between the energy consumption and the network performance, MDA can be used to assist the MDAS consumer to make energy saving decisions.\nTo make the energy saving decision, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to determine where the energy efficiency issues (e.g. high energy consumption, low energy efficiency) exist, and the cause of the energy efficiency issues. Therefore, it is desirable for MDA to correlate and analyze the energy saving related performance measurements (e.g. PDCP data volume of cells, power consumption, etc.) and the network analysis data (e.g. observed service experience related network data analytics) to provide the analytics results which indicate current network energy efficiency. In some low-traffic scenarios, MDA MnS consumers may expect to reduce energy consumption to save energy. In this case, the MDA MnS consumer may request the MDAS producer to report only high energy consumption issue related analytics results.  When the consumer expects to improve energy efficiency, although it may lead to high energy consumption in network or in certain parts of network, then the related issue is the low energy efficiency one. In that case, the consumer may request analytics results related to low energy efficiency issue. So, the target could be to enhance the performance of NF for a given energy consumption. This will result in higher Energy Efficiency of network.\nTo make the energy saving decision, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to determine which Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI related factor(s) (e.g. traffic load, end-to-end latency, active UE numbers, etc.) are affected or potentially affected. The MDAS producer can utilize historical data to predict the EE KPI related factors (e.g. load variation of cells at some future time, etc.). The prediction result of these information can then be used by operators to make energy-saving decision to guarantee the service experience.\nThe MDAS producer may also provide energy saving related recommendation with the energy saving state to the MDAS consumer. Under the energy saving state, the required network performance and network experience should be guaranteed. Therefore, it is important to formulate appropriate energy saving policies (start time, dynamic threshold setting, base station parameter configuration, etc.). The MDAS consumer may take the recommendations with the energy saving state into account for making analysis or making energy saving decisions. After the recommendations have been executed, the MDA producer may start evaluating and further analyzing network management data to optimize the recommendations.\nTable 7.2.4.1.3-1\n\n",

                            "text_content": "This MDA capability is for the mobility performance analysis.\nThe mobility performance related problems may result from too-early/too-late/ping-pong handovers due to inappropriate handover parameters. MDAS can be used to analyse service experience and network performance during handover period in different mobility scenarios. MDAS producer may also be capable to provide the recommendations of optimal handover parameters to MDAS consumer.\nIn different NSA and SA deployment architecture scenarios, handover mechanisms (e.g. DAPS, CHO or RACH-less handover) will have different impacts on the mobility performance. The analytics report to identify the most optimal handover mechanism may be provided by MDAS producer.\nTable 7.2.5.1.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for the handover optimization analysis.\n7.2.5.2.2.1\tHandover optimization\nCurrent handover procedures are mainly based on radio conditions for selecting the target gNB upon a handover. The target gNB accepts or rejects the Handover (HO) request depending on various conditions. In virtualized environment, the HO may be rejected due to inadequate available resources within the target gNB. The notion of resources may include virtual resources (e.g. compute, memory) and/or radio resources (e.g. PRB, RRC connected users). If the HO request is rejected, a UE will try to connect to a different gNB until the request is successfully accepted. Several target gNBs can be tried until the request is successfully accepted. This process can result in wastage of UE and network resources, while it may also introduce service disruption due to increased latency and Radio Link Failures (RLFs). It also introduces inefficiency in the HO or other network procedures.\nTo address this handover optimization issue, it is desirable to use MDA (Management Data Analytics) to provision and/or select a particular target gNB for handover in order to reduce or even avoid HO rejections. The MDAS producer provides a HO optimization analytics output containing the current and future/predicted resource consumption, resources capabilities and other KPIs' status for the available target gNB(s). The analytics output also provides recommended actions to optimize the target gNB for handover. This may include resource re-configuration or the updated selection criteria for target gNB. Based on the output, the MDAS consumer adjusts (e.g. scale-out/up the virtual resource, re-schedule/optimize radio resource) the resources before continuing with the handover and/or adjusts the selection criteria of the target gNB by also considering the overlapping coverages of inter-frequency and inter-RAT deployments.\n7.2.5.2.2.2\tHandover optimization based on UE Load\nThe target node, eNB, may not have adequate resources to accept certain handover requests. In the context of network virtualization, these resources may include not only legacy radio resources, but also virtual resources such as processor and memory. Handover optimization can benefit from knowledge about the projected UE load on the target cell including additional radio and virtual resources.\nTable 7.2.5.2.3-1\n\nThis MDA capability is for inter-gNB beam selection optimization.\nWith the deployment of 5G networks, Massive MIMO has been used on a large scale. Beamforming, as a key technology to reduce user interference, which can suppress interference signals in non-target directions and enhance sound signals in target directions, is always combined with Massive MIMO to further decrease interference. A cell can make use of multiple beams for serving residing users (SSB or CSI-RS) with each user served by a single beam at a time. The cell level quality can be represented as an aggregated metric over one or more beams. So, although handover is performed between two 5G cells, the granularity of handover can be further broken down to beam level.\nThe handover of beams could be performed if the network resource or the user's state have changed to obtain better network performance. Beam optimization includes the handover between different beams and configuration of beam parameters.\nIn order to avoid selecting the wrong beam to perform RACH on the target cell and causing RLF of the UE, MDA can be used to recommend a means to prioritize and/or select the beam in case of handover for a specific target cell. MDA can provide a beam level HO optimization analysis considering information on the handover performance of different beam combinations between the source and target cell pairs. Beams of the target cell with a successful handover are preferred in the selection.\nMDA could also provide recommended actions and priority options for beam selection. Based on the recommended actions, the MDA MnS consumer adjusts the priorities for the beam selection at HO, i.e. the beam combinations that are likely to succeed are prioritized, less optimal beam combinations are down prioritized. The target cell may also obtain analytics to allocate RACH resources in a way that ensures HO success.\nIn order to optimize antenna and beam configuration, so as to reduce energy loss and enhance network performance, MDA can be used to analyze the current network status.\nTable 7.2.5.3.3-1\n\n",

Consider a scenario, when a RAN Node is required to shut down manually to undergo critical maintenance for a very short duration of time. Software upgrade can be one such critical maintenance scenario. In such cases, all the resources (bearer, security functions, mobility management) that are managed by this RAN Node need to be purged and reconfigured at another RAN Node (standby RAN Node) or if another RAN Node is not available then resources will be reconfigured again when former RAN Node comes up after software upgrade. Both the situations lead to additional operational expenses and data loss. Operational expense in terms of all the resources to be released/attached again and data loss for all GBR sessions/bearer.\nIt is expected to use MDAS to optimize the procedure of software upgrade at RAN Node by providing the right time to execute the required upgrade. The software upgrade should be automatically initiated by the OAM system, once configured, during the time frame when the expected impacts are minimum i.e. at the optimal time when there would be minimum expected operational cost and data loss. The Optimal Time (current or futuristic) can be derived by collecting and analysing the data related to DRBs including GBR/non-GBR, state, modification count, ongoing handover etc. MDAS can utilize historical data and AI/ML (e.g. time series based) algorithm to derive the future optimal time frame for software upgrade.\nNote:\tRAN Node above refers to CU-CP in case of gNB split case.\nTable 7.2.6.1.3-1\n\n",

The workflow includes the following steps:\n\n1. **Request**: A user initiates a request for data analytics services.\n2. **Request Form**: The user fills out a form with relevant data.\n3. **Data Collection**: The MDA system collects data from various sources.\n4. **Data Processing**: The system processes the collected data.\n5. **Data Analysis**: The system performs data analysis to identify patterns and trends.\n6. **Report Generation**: The system generates a report based on the analysis.\n7. **Report Delivery**: The report is delivered to the user.\n\nThis workflow ensures that the user's data analytics needs are met efficiently and effectively.\nFigure 11.1-1: Generic MDA request/reporting workflow\n1\tMDAS Producer creates MOI for MDARequest IOC (see createMOI operation defined in TS 28.532 [11]) for the MDAS Consumer with MDA request related information.\nNote:\tVoid\n2.\tThe MDAS producer subscribes to the relevant notifications or setup the streaming connections, per the selected reporting method (identified by reportingMethod attribute in the MDARequest MOI):\n-\tIf the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"File\":\n2a.\tif subscription for the reporting target (specified by the reportingTarget attribute in the MDARequest MOI) do not exist, the MDAS producer subscribes to the file data reporting related notifications (see TS 28.532 [11]) for the reporting target;\n-\tIf the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"Streaming\":\n2b/2c.\tif the streaming connection with the reporting target does not exist, the MDAS producer invokes the establishStreamingConnection operation (see TS 28.532 [11]) to setup the streaming connection with the streaming target;\n2d/2e.\tif the streaming connection with the reporting target exists, the MDAS producer invokes the addStream operation (see TS 28.532 [11]) to add the stream for the expected MDA reports. And,\n2f/2g.\tif the newly added stream is to replace an existing one, the MDAS producer invokes the deleteStream operation (see TS 28.532 [11]) to delete the stream.\nNOTE 1: \tthe order of 2d/2e and 2f/2g is not significant and could be swapped too.\n-\tIf the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"Notification\":\n2h.\tif subscription for the reporting target do not exist, the MDAS producer subscribes to the provisioning related notifications (see TS 28.532 [11]) for the reporting target.\nNOTE 2: \tAlthough, the workflow assumes that different entities are playing the role of \"MDAS Consumer\" and \"Reporting target\", it is possible and allowed to have single entity playing the role of both \"MDAS Consumer\" and \"Reporting target\".\n3.\tWhile the MDARequest is active, the MDAS Producer keeps performing MDA,  and making the MDA report (see the MDAReport IOC defined in clause 9) according to the MDARequest MOI.\n3a.\tthe MDAS producer makes the MDA report ready and sends the MDA report to the reporting target per the selected reporting method (identified by reportingMethod attribute in the MDARequest MOI):\n-\tIf the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"File\":\n3b.\tthe MDAS producer makes the MDA report into a file;\n3c.\tthe MDAS producer emits the notifyFileReady notification (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the reporting target for the MDA report.\n-\tIf the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"Streaming\":\n3d.\tthe MDAS producers makes the MDA report into a stream date unit;\n3e.\tinvokes the reportStreamData operation (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the reporting target for the MDA report.\n-\tIf the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"Notification\":\n3f.\tthe MDAS producer creates and MDAReport MOI (see clause 9) for the MDA report;\n3g.\tif notifyMOICreation is used, the MDAS producer emits the notifyMOICreation notification (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the reporting target for the MDA report.\n3h.\tif notifyMOIChanges is used, the MDAS producer emits the notifyMOIChanges notification (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the reporting target for the MDA report.\n\n",
