Electric utilities are transitioning towards smart power grids to enhance efficiency and reliability, with real-time measurements and control between smart devices in the field with centralized data facilities running intelligent analytics.\nThe timing solutions for Smart Grid must address a significant list of concerns. Time synchronization is in general considered a key security vulnerability of Smart Grids, and an area of direct relevance to timing resiliency systems and the 5G System is ensuring timing integrity, e.g., providing solutions to the increasing prevalence of satellite signal loss, jamming, and the potential for spoofing [2]. Power utility companies do not want to be dependent only on satellite-based time synchronization due to several factors:\nInterference: Either caused intentionally or by environment (e.g. solar flares).\nGovernmental decision: Public time synchronization service can be disabled or weakened remotely; GPS selective availability as an example.\nMaintenance: Changing the faulty GPS antenna may take some time.\nOther: Long downtime time when updating or fixing satellite systems; Galileo downtime of 100h as an example. As a comparison, 24h holdover time has been specified for power systems.\nAlthough there are a large range of applications possible in Smart Grids in need of timing resiliency, the focus here is mainly on power sub-stations where robust time synchronization is needed for e.g., synchro phasor applications. Those are relevant for 5G System-based timing resiliency solutions and simultaneously represent the most demanding application in terms of required time synchronization performance. However, other applications are also mentioned and captured.\n",

                            "text_content": "Precise timing is key to operating the smart power grid. One area relates to controlling the frequency (50Hz/60Hz), while another area relates to providing events with timestamped measurement values, with required accuracies down to a few hundred nanoseconds [2]. Correct timing is a key enabler for communication and orchestration of technologies for accurate and optimal wide area monitoring, protection and control in the power industry [2].\nIn a typical smart grid architecture, centralized monitoring systems have visibility to events occurring in a distributed hierarchy of substations and distribution systems. Having very accurate timing across the endpoints allows the monitoring systems to readily detect faults, identify the source and extent of impact, and take corrective action in a manner affecting the smallest possible portion of the grid. For such event reporting, a 1ms timing accuracy is sufficient.\nThe figure depicts a time-stamped event log for a 5G network, illustrating the various events that occurred during the network's operation. The log includes timestamps, event types, and associated data, providing a comprehensive overview of the network's performance and troubleshooting.\nFigure 4.1.2-1: Time stamped events [5]\nTiming accuracy is also needed for power system measurements for fault detection in the current phase. Recordings of the phase may be triggered at various points when a fault is detected. Running analysis on multiple time-aligned recordings can provide a clear picture of the extent of impact. For reliable analysis, 1 ms timing accuracy is typically needed across all recordings and is today limited mostly by SNTP time sync methods typically in use.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a current disturbance recoding system, highlighting the various components and their connections. The system is designed to handle disturbances in a reliable and efficient manner, ensuring the smooth operation of the network.\nFigure 4.1.2-2: Current disturbance recoding [5]\nMonitoring the power system frequency also requires timing accuracy for fault detection and resolution. In this case, accuracy between 1 µs to 10 µs is needed to provide accurate correlation of frequency.\nThe figure depicts a frequency synchronization system in a 5G network, illustrating the synchronization of radio frequency signals at different frequencies. The system includes a base station (gNB) and multiple user equipment (UE) nodes, with the gNB transmitting signals at different frequencies to ensure synchronization. The figure also highlights the use of frequency diversity to mitigate interference and improve network performance.\nFigure 4.1.2-3: Frequency synchronization [5]\nFinally, the accuracy needed depends on the timing role of the component within the power sub-system. E.g., a PTP sync device within the sub-network generally needs to fulfil the application requirements as discussed above (e.g., down to 1s accuracy requirement) whereas a component that is a PTP Grand Master needs to be accurate to a 250 ns requirement [3], specifically, 250 ns are assumed in (section 7.2 [3]) in order to distribute synchronization over a chain of up to 15 transparent clocks while meeting the requirement of 1 µs at the end-device.\n",

                            "text_content": "A simple overview of a power sub-station is provided in Figure 4.1.3-1. In a typical deployment today, the sub-station achieves time synchronization by means of a grandmaster clock that uses the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [4] protocol to synchronize elements inside the power sub-station via an Ethernet connection. The grandmaster clock often uses a GNSS receiver to achieve time synchronization information. To access the GNSS signal, an external GNSS antenna is typically required. The figure shows how time and communication redundancy can be achieved within substation by means defined in IEC 61850-9-3-2016 [3]. However, since the time source (GNSS) illustrated is a single point of failure (e.g. whenever satellite(s) are not available or there is interference), 5G is a candidate resiliency solution.\nThe figure depicts a power sub-system setup utilizing 2x GNSS based clock grandmasters, which are essential components for accurate time synchronization in power systems. The setup includes a master clock, a master clock generator, and a master clock receiver, all interconnected via GNSS signals. This setup ensures reliable time synchronization, which is crucial for power systems to maintain accurate power flow and grid stability.\nFigure 4.1.3-1: Example power sub-system setup leveraging 2x GNSS based clock grandmasters [5]\nThe GNSS receiver elements of the clock grandmaster installed in power-subsystems have some desirable characteristics including intrinsic multi-layer jamming and spoofing detection capabilities, e.g., autonomous disruption detection and intelligent protection and control. The timing accuracy requirement of the GNSS receiver is <250 ns according to the grandmaster requirements listed in [4]. This allows sufficient budget for synchronization distribution errors within the power sub-station versus the E2E requirements of the Smart Grid operation (e.g., where every PTP sync device needs to be synchronized to a <1 s accuracy).\nMany power sub-systems already have cellular 4G coverage. A 5G System-based timing solution offers multiple potential enhancements, including:\nAs a resiliency solution to the GNSS received timing solution if GNSS fails or is compromised, e.g., integrated as alternative radio in each grandmaster clock or as an alternative grandmaster clock with 5G capability in the power sub-system.\nAs an alternative to GNSS use, e.g., integrated with PTP grandmaster clock avoiding installation of external GNSS antenna and receiver at the power sub-station.\nThese alternatives are illustrated in Figure 4.1.3-2. In both cases, time synchronization may be provided from the 5G System to 5G sync modem by either C-Plane method (e.g., via System Information Broadcast or unicast RRC messaging) or using PTP method according to the power sub-system configuration requirements.\nThe latter requires also some actions from the 5G System in case time source is lost is missing, e.g., similar to IEC 61850-9-3, clockClass should be dropped when the 5G System is in holdover state. Further, PPS output has significant use-cases and is commonly used today and can be desired property of 5G sync modem.\nThe figure depicts a 5G integration into a system, highlighting the resilience and alternative mode of operation. It illustrates the use of 5G technology to enhance system resilience, with the integration of 5G into existing 4G networks, and the introduction of alternative modes of operation, such as 5G-NR (New Radio) and 5G-M (Massive MIMO). The figure also highlights the use of 5G technology to improve network performance, with the integration of 5G into existing 4G networks and the introduction of 5G-NR and 5G-M.\nFigure 4.1.3-2: 5G integration into system – resilience and alternative mode\nAnother key requirement is holdover capability, the ability to continue providing accurate timing service in the event of loss of an external source (e.g., GNSS), for the 5G System. For option (a) in Figure 4.1.3-2 a 24 h holdover capability is automatically supported as this is the case for today’s distributed solution where GM1 and GNSS is always one and the same device. 5G modem functionality could be either integrated into the same device as a chip or as an input using option (a) type external modem, e.g., for this case, no specific holdover capability is required from the 5G System. With option (b), holdover capability is mainly determined by the 5G network. Here it is desirable that the 5G sync modem has a holdover capability of at least 5 s to comply with [3] and that the 5G network can support up to 24 h of holdover capability. However, as option (a) can be a solution when 24 h holdover capability is strictly needed for the power utility, this requirement could be more scalable, e.g., allow for wider range of performance of 5G networks and 5G sync modems with exploiting also hold-over capability (stability) of GM1.\nHigh level requirements to the 5G System to support these alternatives are highlighted in Table 4.1.3-1\nTable 4.1.3-1 High level requirements for 5G timing resiliency in smart grid\n",

                    "text_content": "For financial markets, the ability to verify continuously when events take place, i.e., time traceability, is fundamental to enable regulatory oversight and analyse the order in which trades are placed (e.g. accurate time stamps are used to settle disagreements and to prevent fraud). Market participants may execute orders on stocks in seconds or microseconds depending on the type of trading activity (e.g., high-frequency algorithmic, voice trading systems, human intervention, concluding negotiated transactions, etc). Financial markets are distributed systems; therefore, a common regulated timekeeping system can only be done if every market participant at each end point of the system involved in the transaction maintains an accurate clock.\nThere are several means to access UTC time such as using an atomic clock, NTP servers, GNSS signal, or UTC(k) delivery over fiber, where UTC(k) is a realisation of UTC maintained by the contributing institute (e.g., NPL, NIST) identified by k. The 5G system can be operate in collaboration with or as backup to other timing solutions used already by financial markets to comply with financial directives for timekeeping. As illustrated in Figure 4.2-1, the 5G system can be integrated as another time source within the clock distribution infrastructure of the financial customer.\n\nThe figure depicts a time resilience use case for financial markets, illustrating the concept of time-based resilience in the context of financial trading. The diagram shows a scenario where a market participant experiences a significant delay in the arrival of a signal, leading to a loss of market information. The figure illustrates the use of time-based resilience techniques, such as time-based routing and time-based routing protocols, to ensure that the market participant can continue to trade despite the delay. The figure also highlights the importance of network reliability and the use of redundant paths to ensure that the market participant can continue to trade even in the face of network failures.\nFigure 4.2-1 Example of time resilience use case for financial markets\nFinancial regulations for time source and time dissemination require the market participants must provide traceability back to UTC. This requires the time information sent to financial exchanges should be measured and verified at every link in the chain, i.e. from UTC generated at the BIPM (global ‘paper’ time scale [11]) up to the timestamping engine within the financial customer domain. Depending on the time source and distribution method the financial customer has, the traceability to UTC to comply with the regulations is achieved in different ways. For example (for more information see [10]):\nIf GNSS satellite signals are used, these signals alone do not readily provide traceability to UTC, but users can demonstrate traceability by obtaining GNSS monitoring bulletins from one of the regional UTC(k) timing centres. In this case, the end user will use these bulletins in addition to perform calibration and monitoring of the GNSS receiver equipment to demonstrate traceability to UTC.\nIf services for time delivery over fibers are used (e.g., as delivered by a national metrology institutes), the UTC is disseminated over managed fiber links. The traceability to UTC is maintained using PTP to distribute the time and continuously monitoring and audit the provision point to ensure the agreed level of accuracy defined in the service SLA. Note: this option may not be generally available.\nThe 5G system could follow similar approaches when applied in this use case (Figure 4.2-2 illustrates the two approaches):\na)\tThe 5G system provides traceability to UTC up to the DS-TT: In this approach, the 5G system needs to continuously monitor and audit each link within the time distribution chain within the 5G system domain. The UTC traceability is certified up to the provision point at the DS-TT. Therefore, monitoring, calibration, and certification functionalities are required at the DS-TT. Two alternatives can be considered:\n1.\tThe 5G system supports these new functionalities including the required mechanisms in the standard.\n2.\tProprietary solutions are used in collaboration with the 5G system. For example, a client for the service of time delivery over fiber is installed within the DS-TT to combine NPL service and 5G wireless time distribution to provide traceability to UTC.\nb)\tThe 5G system does not provide traceability to UTC: Similar to GNSS signal delivery described before, the 5G system is not responsible of monitoring, calibrating or documenting evidence for traceability to UTC, the financial customer is taking care of these functionalities.\nThe figure depicts a time distribution traceability chain for a 5G system, showing the traceability chain from UTC (K) to the current time. The traceability chain includes various components such as base stations (BSs), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of traceability in ensuring the reliability and integrity of the 5G network.\nFigure 4.2-2 UTC(k) time distribution with 5G system indicating the traceability chain (modified from source [10])\n",

Markets and market participants are highly interconnected, absolutely accurate time stamping is essential to determine exactly who made what trade, and precisely when. Market participants may execute orders on stocks in seconds or microseconds depending on the type of trading activity (e.g. high-frequency algorithmic, voice trading systems, human intervention, concluding negotiated transactions, etc). Without a reliable common reference time to provide synchronized time stamps, transactions across locations and stock exchanges are impossible to audit or to detect wrongdoing. To achieve a more regulated timekeeping system, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued new rules in support of the MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) regulations [12]. The Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) 25 is a part of the standards developed by ESMA in the context of MiFID II. RTS 25 defines standards for clock synchronization [13]. Similar to MiFID II, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced Rule 613 and the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) to accurately track all activity throughout the U.S. markets in National Market Systems (NMS) securities. Rule 613 requires electronic trading business clocks to be accurate to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) clocks (i.e. 50 ms for automated orders, 1s for manual orders). MiFID II generally has the strictest requirements when it comes to time stamping (i.e. ≤100µs for high frequency algorithmic trading, ≤1s for voice trading, human intervention, or concluded negotiated transactions, and ≤1ms for other type of trading activities), and is of relevance also to foreign regions as foreign regimes need to have regulations of comparable quality in order for companies in that regime to transact with European entities.\nTo ensure MiFID II compliance, market participants must have the ability to demonstrate where the timestamp is applied and that it remains consistent, it is not enough just having an accurate time source. Satellite signals or systems that provide direct traceability to the UTC time issued and maintained by a timing centre listed in the BIPM Annual Report on Time Activities are considered as acceptable as time sources. However, if satellite signals are used, the ESMA states the users should be aware of the relevant risks with those signals and must mitigate them [15]. In addition to document and monitor their timing network architecture, market participants also need to consider impacts MiFID II compliance brings in their system such as the security and integrity of the reports collected (e.g. access management that ensures only a certain group of nodes can access the data, authentication to protect the data, data integrity to maintain the consistency and accuracy of the data).\n",

The 5G timing distribution and resilience service ensures time traceability through either real-time monitoring (e.g., the continuous comparisons of the clock to ensure the device is working properly) or offline (e.g. calibration of the equipment) handling of the following:\nA continuous chain of comparisons with known uncertainties.\nTime equipment calibration.\nContinuous monitoring to demonstrate compliance and correct functioning.\nCalibration evidence and monitoring results to be archived.\nFor UTC traceability, each link involved in the time dissemination chain from the reference time scale UTC up to the point of provision must be documented, as illustrated in Figure 5.4.2-1. An SLA will be in place to establish the time synchronization accuracy and traceability requirement to UTC.\nThe time synchronization accuracy provided by the 5G System domain at the output of the 5G Device will be a suitable portion of the target requirement applicable at the application layer of the Financial customer domain, as an example in order to meet 100 µs, the 5G System domain could provide at least 10 µs accuracy.\nThe figure depicts a time distribution chain for a financial customer, illustrating the UTC time distribution across various time zones. The distribution is represented by a series of rectangles, each representing a different time zone, with the UTC time at the center. The rectangles are connected by lines, indicating the flow of time from UTC to the customer's location. The figure provides a visual representation of the time distribution, allowing for easy understanding of the time zones and their relative positions.\nFigure 5.4.2-1: UTC time distribution chain to the financial customer\n",
