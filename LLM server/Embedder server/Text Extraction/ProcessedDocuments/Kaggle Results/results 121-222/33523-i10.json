The present document contains objectives, requirements and test cases that are specific to the various split gNB network product classes. Test cases for such deployments are provided, are based upon and borrow heavily from the specification for the gNB product class (see TS 33.511 [6]). The main differences are the inclusion of cases for the F1 signalling and user plane connection and the E1 signalling connection on the top of the gNB cases as well as some revised cases to account for the split functionality. The present document also refers to the Catalogue of General Security Assurance Requirements (see TS 33.117 [2]) and formulates specific adaptions of the requirements and test cases given there, as well as specifying requirements and test cases unique to the various split gNB network product class.\n",

Following TCP/IP layer model and considering all the protocols over transport layer, for gNB-DU, the following interfaces and protocols are in the scope of the testing:\nFor F1-u: the UDP and GTP-U protocols.\nFor F1-c: the SCTP and F1AP protocols.\nNOTE: \tThere could be other interfaces and/or protocols requiring testing under clause 4.4.4 of TS 33.117 [2].\n\n\n\n",
