            "description": "Release 16 can be seen as a set of independent improvements of the 5G System, introduced in Rel-15 and described in TR 21.915 [2]. As such, several references are made in the present document to pre-Rel-16 Features and to 5G reference points and network functions.\nOther Rel-16 enhancements are for Features that have been introduced several Releases ago, including those related to Mission Critical, or to Conversational services.\nThe main Rel-16 radio enhancements concern the 5G (NR) radio interface, but also the 4G (LTE) radio, and improving the cooperation between them. For the 5G radio, the end user bit rate has been increased by introducing several configurations of Carrier Aggregations and by adding 256QAM. Other radio enhancements include the NR-based access to unlicensed spectrum, and some enhancements in the fields of mobility and UE Power Saving. These radio enhancements are presented in section 19.\nAs for the system-wide features, presented in sections 5 to 18, the overall trend in Rel-16 is to make the 3GPP 5G System (5GS) a communication-enabling platform suitable for a wide range of industries (“verticals”), such as e.g. transportation (autonomous driving V2X, Railways, Maritime), automated factories, healthcare, public safety and many more. In this respect, the versatility and reliability of the 5GS has been further increased to make it industry-grade compatible, with enhancements to Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Network Slicing, Edge Computing, Cellular IoT (Internet of Things), Non-Public Networks, Positioning Services and LAN-type services. In addition, the use of 5G as an underlying communication network (i.e. to be used transparently by applications external to the network) has been enhanced, mostly under the work on \"Northbound APIs\". Besides all these industrial aspects, other Rel-16 enhancements cover the coexistence of 5G with non-3GPP systems, entertainment (e.g. streaming and media distribution) and network optimisations (e.g. user identity).\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-200295.\nThis Feature enhances 5G core network to support ultra-high reliability and low-latency communications (URLLC). The main functionalities introduced here are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.\nRedundant transmission for high-reliability communication\nSome URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. With this, service failure can be avoided even in case the packet transmission via one path occasionally fails or exceeds the delay requirement.\nDifferent options are specified to support redundant transmission at different layers (figures extracted from 23.501):\n-\tDual-connectivity-based end-to-end redundant user plane paths: two redundant PDU Sessions with independent user plane paths are established between UE and DN. Packet replication and elimination are performed by the upper layer of UE and DN, which are not specified in 3GPP.\nThe figure depicts a redundant User Plane path using Dual Connectivity, illustrating how two paths are available for each user, ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 1: redundant User Plane paths using Dual Connectivity\n-\tSupport of redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces: for a PDU Session used for URLLC services, two redundant N3/N9 tunnels with independent user plane paths are established between UPF and NG-RAN to transfer the duplicated user packets. Packet replication and elimination are performed by NG-RAN and User Plan Function (UPF).\nThe figure depicts a redundant transmission system using two N3 and N9 tunnels between the NG-RAN and PSA UPF, illustrating the use of redundant paths to ensure reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 2: redundant transmission using two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF\n-\tSupport of redundant transmission at transport layer: this approach assumes that the backhaul provides two disjoint transport paths between UPF and RAN. The redundancy functionality within NG-RAN and UPF makes use of the independent paths at transport layer, which is not specified in 3GPP.\nThe figure depicts a redundant transmission system using two N3 tunnels between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN node. This system ensures reliable communication by providing a backup path in case of network failure.\nFigure 3: Redundant transmission using two N3 tunnels between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN node\nQoS Monitoring\nQoS Monitoring is defined in this release for the measurement of packet delay between UE and PSA UPF. The NG-RAN is required to provide the QoS Monitoring of UL/DL packet delay at the Uu interface. The QoS Monitoring of UL/DL packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF can be performed at different levels of granularities, i.e. per QoS flow level, or per GTP-U path level.\nDynamic division of Packet Delay Budget\nThe Packet Delay Budget (PDB) of URLLC services is typically more stringent than for traditional services. To obtain a more accurate delay budget for NG-RAN, SA WG2 decided to allow a dynamic value for the core network PDB (CN PDB), so that the SMF or NG-RAN can dynamically calculate delay budget of NG-RAN based on the CN PDB.\nEnhancements of session continuity\nWhen a UE moves, the user plane path of low latency services need to be optimized to reduce the latency and to guarantee session continuity. Several related mechanisms are developed or enhanced in this WI.\nPDU Session Anchor (PSA) relocation for Ethernet PDU Session is specified in this release. The target UPF will assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding tables of Ethernet switches in the DN, so that UL/DL traffics will switch to the target UPF once the UE moves.\nFor Uplink Classifier (ULCL) relocation, a forwarding tunnel between the old and new ULCLs is introduced to avoid packet loss during relocation.\nAF-influenced traffic routing mechanism is further enhanced to allow flexible coordination between SMF and AF when user plane change events happen.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\nThe redundant transmission and QoS monitoring mechanisms are specified in TS 23.501[1], Clause 5.33.

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-200887.\nBasic support for URLLC was introduced in Release 15. It included Transmission Time Interval (TTI) structures for low latency as well as methods for improved reliability. Use cases with tighter requirements, e.g. higher reliability up to 1E-6 and short latency in the order of 0.5 to 1ms, have been identified as important areas for NR.\nThis work item is based on the outcome of the study items resulting in TR 38.824 [2] and TR 38.825 [3]. It specifies PDCCH enhancements, UCI enhancements, PUSCH enhancements, enhanced inter UE TX prioritization/multiplexing and enhanced UL configured grant transmission. More precisely, the following key functionalities were introduced:\nDCI format 0_2 and DCI format 1_2\nDCI format 0_2/1_2 with configurable sizes for most of the DCI fields are introduced, which provides the possibility to improve the reliability by decreasing the DCI size (e.g. ~24 bits) with appropriate RRC configuration of the DCI fields. Details of DCI format 0_2/1_2 can be found in [4].\nEnhanced PDCCH monitoring capability\nRel-16 span-based PDCCH monitoring capability is introduced mainly for achieving low latency. A UE can indicate a capability to monitor PDCCH according to one or more of the combinations (X, Y) = (2, 2), (4, 3), and (7, 3) per SCS configuration of μ=0 and μ=1. A span is a number of consecutive symbols in a slot where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH. If a UE monitors PDCCH on a cell according to combination (X,Y), the UE supports PDCCH monitoring occasions in any symbol of a slot with minimum time separation of X symbols between the first symbol of two consecutive spans, and the number of symbols of a span is up to Y. For each reported combination (X, Y), the UE supports the limit M_PDCCH^(max,(X,Y),μ) on the maximum number of monitored PDCCH candidates per PDCCH monitoring span as defined in Table 10.1-2A in [5] and the limit C_PDCCH^(max,(X,Y),μ) on the maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs for channel estimation per PDCCH monitoring span as defined in Table 10.1-3A in [5]. An example of PDCCH monitoring according to combination (4, 3) is as shown in Figure 1.\nThe figure depicts a PDCCH monitoring system using Rel-16 span-based PDCCH monitoring capability, which allows for efficient monitoring of PDCCH traffic. The system includes a PDCCH monitoring unit (PMU) and a span-based PDCCH monitoring unit (SPMU), which are connected to a network monitoring system (NMS). The PMU collects data from the PDCCHs and sends it to the SPMU, which then processes the data and sends it to the NMS for analysis. The system is designed to provide real-time monitoring of PDCCH traffic, ensuring that network performance is maintained and that any issues can be identified and resolved quickly.\nFig. 1. An example of PDCCH monitoring using Rel-16 span based PDCCH monitoring capability.\nSub-slot based HARQ-ACK feedback\nSub-slot based HARQ-ACK feedback is introduced to support more than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot, which is mainly beneficial for achieving low latency. An UL slot consists of a number of sub-slots. No more than one PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACKs starts in a sub-slot. A UE can indicate the supported sub-slot configuration among the candidate values of {7-symbol*2, 2-symbol*7 and 7-symbol*2} for normal CP or { 6-symbol*2, 2-symbol*6 and 6-symbol*2} for extended CP.\nTwo HARQ-ACK codebooks constructed simultaneously\nThis work item specifies the support of two HARQ-ACK codebooks with different priorities to be simultaneously constructed, which is mainly beneficial for improving reliability for service with higher priority. Each of the two HARQ-ACK codebooks can be either slot-based HARQ-ACK codebook or sub-slot-based HARQ-ACK codebook. Separate PUCCH configurations are supported for different HARQ-ACK codebooks. The feature supports two priority levels for HARQ-ACK. Rules are defined for the UE to resolve collisions between UL channels/signals with different priorities.\nPUSCH enhancements\nThis work item specifies PUSCH repetition type B and PUSCH repetition type A for PUSCH enhancements. PUSCH repetition type B is mainly beneficial for achieving low latency. PUSCH repetition type A can improve the spectral efficiency.\nFor PUSCH repetition type B, for a transport block, one dynamic UL grant or one configured grant schedules two or more PUSCH repetitions that can be in one slot, or across a slot boundary in consecutive available slots. Examples of PUSCH repetition type B are given in Figure 2. Inter-slot frequency hopping and inter-repetition frequency hopping are specified for PUSCH repetition type B. Interaction with DL/UL directions is specified as in Clause 6 in [6].\nThe figure depicts various examples of PUSCH repetition type B, illustrating the different types of PUSCH repetition patterns used in telecommunication systems.\nFig. 2. Examples of PUSCH repetition type B.\nPUSCH repetition type A corresponds to PUSCH transmission with Rel-15 behavior with or without slot aggregation. With slot aggregation, the number of repetitions can be dynamically indicated in Rel-16.\nEnhanced inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing\nThis work item specifies UL cancellation scheme and enhanced UL power control scheme for enhanced inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing, which are mainly beneficial for achieving low latency.\nFor UL cancellation scheme, DCI format 2_4 is introduced for notifying the PRB(s) and OFDM symbol(s) where UE cancels the corresponding UL transmission from the UE. An indication by DCI format 2_4 for a serving cell is applicable to a PUSCH transmission or an SRS transmission on the serving cell.\nFor UL power control scheme, open-loop power control parameter set indication is included in DCI format 0_1/0_2 to indicate the P0 value for PUSCH scheduled dynamically as defined in [5].\nMultiple active configured grant configurations for a BWP\nUp to 12 configured grant configurations can be configured in a BWP of a serving cell, which is mainly beneficial for achieving high reliability. Separate RRC parameters can be configured for different configured grant configurations. Separate activation/release can be used for different configured grant Type 2 configurations. In addition, joint release for two or more configured grant Type 2 configurations for a given BWP of a serving cell is also supported.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-191584, “Revised WID: Physical Layer Enhancements for NR Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC)”, Newport Beach, CA, June 3-6, 2019.\n[2]\tTR 38.824 \"Study on physical layer enhancements for NR ultra-reliable and low latency case (URLLC)\"\n[3]\tTR 38.825 \"Study on NR industrial Internet of Things (IoT)\"\n[4]\tTS 38.212 \"NR; Multiplexing and channel coding\"\n[5]\tTS 38.213 \"NR; Physical layer procedures for control\"\n[6]\tTS 38.214 \"NR; Physical layer procedures for data\"\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell in RP-200798.\nThis Work Item evolves the NR system as to better support the use cases of various vertical markets such as factory automation or electrical power distribution. It introduces transmission reliability enhancements, NR support for Time Sensitive Communications (as defined in TS 23.501 [4]), and addressed efficiency of the system where UEs handle a mixture of URLLC and eMBB traffic. This WI focused mainly on Layer 2/3 protocols aspects while PHY layer enhancements for URLLC were introduced as part of Work Item on Physical layer enhancements for NR ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) [3].\nThis Work Item has introduced the following enhancements:\n1.\tPDCP packet duplication enhancements – a possibility of multiplication of the packets related to signalling or data radio bearer over three or four logical channels has been specified for the increased reliability of the transmission over the air interface. This is possible for both Carrier Aggregation based packet duplication where the packet is sent over up to four different serving cells of a single gNB and for Dual Connectivity based packet duplication where the packet is sent over serving cells belonging to two different gNBs (e.g. two serving cells in Master Node and two serving cells in Secondary Node or three serving cells in Master Node and one serving cell in Secondary Node etc.). The network dynamically controls which of the configured logical channels are active for duplication at a certain time by utilizing a dedicated MAC CE command.\n2.\tRAN support for higher layer multi-connectivity - The feature introduces also higher reliability for the end to end transmission by using duplication of a PDU session. This functionality allows NG-RAN to ensure the data of the PDU session and its redundant one to utilize two independent transmission paths. The NG-RAN may, for example, use dual connectivity principles with one PDU session delivered through the master node and the redundant one via the secondary node, or the NG-RAN may use independent paths within the same NG-RAN node. Besides, the feature offers the possibility to provide redundancy over N3 tunnel between the UPF and the NG-RAN node on a per QoS flow basis.\n3.\tSupport for accurate reference timing delivery – to support strict synchronization accuracy requirements of TSC applications, the delivery of time reference information from the gNB to the UE using unicast or broadcast RRC signalling with a granularity of 10 ns was introduced. UE Assistance Information procedure was extended to allow the UE to indicate its preference to receive such information.\n4.\tScheduling enhancements – support for up to eight simultaneously active semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) configurations for a given BWP of a UE was specified. Work Item introduced also new logical channel restriction based on physical layer priority level of the grant and a list of Configured Grant (CG) configurations allowed to be utilized by a certain logical channel (support of up to twelve simultaneously active CG configurations in a BWP of a UE was introduced as part of WI on Physical Layer Enhancements for NR Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC) [3]). UE can now be configured with CG and SPS periodicities of any integer multiple of a slot with maximum periodicity of 640 ms. These enhancements allow, e.g., to more efficiently support, deterministic traffic with a wide range of different periodicities.\n5.\tTime Sensitive Communication Assistance Information (TSCAI): Core Network may provide a gNB with an information about TSC traffic characteristics such as Burst Arrival Time, traffic flow direction and periodicity, to allow for a more efficient scheduling at the gNB.\n6.\tEthernet Header Compression (EHC): since TSC traffic is often carried over Ethernet frames with a short size (e.g. 20-50 bytes), EHC protocol was specified within PDCP sublayer to increase efficiency of Ethernet frames transmission over the NR air interface. EHC allows to avoid transmission of Ethernet header fields such as DESTINATION ADDRESS, SOURCE ADDRESS, 802.1Q TAG, and LENGTH/TYPE, between the gNB and the UE. EHC was specified for both NR and EUTRA PDCP.\n7.\tPrioritization between overlapping uplink resources of one UE: when multiple UL grants provided to a single UE overlap in time on a serving cell, the UE is now able to consider the priority of the grant and/or the priority of the logical channel that can be carried over the grant when making a decision about which grant to utilize. Similarly, the UE may consider the priority of a scheduling request (SR) as well as priority of the logical channel which triggered the SR when deciding whether to transmit PUSCH or SR when they overlap in time. Furthermore, if two PUCCHs of different PHY priorities or a PUCCH and a PUSCH of different PHY priorities are overlapping in time on a serving cell, the UE is able to cancel the lower priority transmission with the specified cancellation behaviour and related timeline to allow for transmission of the PUSCH or PUCCH of higher PHY priority.\nThanks to the introduced enhancements it is possible to support Industrial IOT applications and Time Sensitive Communications in a more efficient way, allow for extra reliability for URLLC traffic as well optimize handling of a mixture of applications with various priorities and QoS requirements by a single UE.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTR 38.825: “Study on NR industrial Internet of Things (IoT)”\n[2]\tRP-192590: ”Revised WID: Support of NR Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)”\n[3]\tRP-190726: “New WID: Physical Layer Enhancements for NR Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC)”\n[4]\tTS 23.501: “System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)”\n",

The 5G VN Group management can be configured by a network administrator or it can be managed dynamically by an AF. In order to support dynamic management of 5G VN Group identification and membership, the NEF exposes a set of services to manage (e.g. add/delete/modify) 5G VN group and 5G VN members. The NEF also exposes services to dynamically manage 5G VN group data. Furthermore, 5GS supports optimized routing by enabling support for local switching at the UPF without having to traverse the DN for UE-UE communication when the two UE(s) are served by the same UPF.\nIntegration with IEEE TSN\nTSC is a communication service that supports deterministic and/or isochronous communication with high reliability and availability. It provides packet transport with Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics such as bounded latency and reliability, where end systems and relay/transmit nodes can be strictly synchronized. In Release 16, main focus was on integration with IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).\nThe 5G System also enables support for TSN time synchronization. In order to support time synchronization, the entire E2E 5G system can be considered as an IEEE 802.1AS [104] \"time-aware system\". UE, gNB, UPF, NW-TT and DS- TTs are synchronized with the 5G GM (i.e. the 5G internal system clock), which keeps these network elements synchronized. The TTs located at the edge of 5G system provides all functions related to IEEE 802.1AS.\nFurthermore, this feature has also introduced TSC assistance parameters were introduced to facilitate optimized QoS scheduling for time sensitive and deterministic traffic.\nNon-Public Network\nThis work item also addressed the deployment of Non-Public Networks (NPNs).

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-200274.\nSubstantial E-UTRAN/EPC evolution has been achieved in 3GPP to enable the \"Cellular Internet of Things\" (CIoT). In particular, eMTC (WB-E-UTRAN) and NB-IoT have been designed in RAN WGs in Rel-13 and enhanced in Rel-14. The corresponding system architecture aspects have been designed for EPC in Rel-13 and Rel-14. These system architecture aspects apply to both NB-IoT and eMTC (WB-E-UTRAN).\nThe \"Cellular IoT support and evolution for the 5G System\" work item focused on enabling equivalent functionality for NB-IoT and eMTC connected to 5GC as what has been defined for NB-IoT and eMTC connected to EPC in earlier releases\nThis section summarizes the key system impacts resulting from the “Cellular IoT support and evolution for the 5G System” work item.\nAs documented in TS 23.501 [1] clause 5.31, the following CIoT features have been introduced in Rel-16:\n-\tControl Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation) is used to exchange user data between the UE and the SMF as payload of a NAS message in both uplink and downlink directions, avoiding the establishment of a user plane connection for the PDU Session (i.e. avoiding the need for Data Radio Bearer and N3 tunnel). Early Data Transmission (EDT), i.e. sending user data in RRC Message 3 is supported for mobile originated Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.\n-\tUser Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation) supports transfer of user plane data from CM-IDLE without the need for using the Service Request procedure to establish an Access Stratum (AS) context in NG-RAN and UE. UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled by the Connection Suspend and Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedures. EDT is also supported for UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation.\n-\tUE and network negotiate whether to use CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation and/or UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation as well as N3 data transport and header compression for CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation during the Registration procedure. The UE indicates its Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, i.e. the UE indicates which of the aforementioned features the UE supports and whether it prefers to use CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation or UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation. In response, the network indicates which of those features it supports for this UE.\n-\tNon-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) refers to mobile originated (MO) and mobile terminated (MT) communication between UE and an Application Function (AF) where the user data is considered unstructured (also referred to as \"non-IP\"). NIDD is enabled using an unstructured PDU session between UE and NEF and the NEF's NIDD API on the N33/Nnef reference point for data delivery from/to AF. Alternatively, non-IP data is delivered using an unstructured PDU session between UE and UPF and a Point-to-Point N6 tunnel between UPF and AF. The NEF also supports distribution of mobile terminated messages to a group of UEs based on the NIDD API.\n-\tReliable Data Service (RDS) may be used between UE and NEF or UPF, respectively, for unstructured PDU Sessions. RDS provides a mechanism for the NEF or UPF to determine if the user data was successfully delivered to the UE and for the UE to determine if the data was successfully delivered to the NEF or UPF. When a requested acknowledgement is not received, RDS retransmits the packet.\n-\tExtended Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED with RRC-INACTIVE enables the UE to reduce its power consumption while still being available for MT data and/or network originated procedures within a certain delay dependent on the negotiated DRX cycle value. In CM-IDLE state the following DRX cycles are supported: up to almost 44 minutes (for eMTC) and up to almost 3 hours (for NB-IoT). In CM-CONNECTED with RRC-INACTIVE, DRX cycles of up to 10.24 seconds are supported.\n-\tEnhancements for the Mobile Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode of rel.15:\n-\tMICO mode with Extended Connected Time enables an AMF that is aware of pending or expected MT traffic to keep the UE in CM-CONNECTED state and to request the RAN to keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state for an Extended Connected Time period to ensure that the downlink data and/or signalling is delivered to the UE before the UE is released.\n-\tMICO mode with Active Time is similar to the UE Power Saving Mode (PSM) defined for EPS [2], i.e. UE and AMF negotiate an Active Time value, which dictates for how long the UE is reachable for paging upon entering CM-IDLE. Once the Active Time has elapsed, the UE can enter MICO mode, i.e. become unreachable for paging.\n-\tMICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control enables the network to align a UE's Periodic Registration Updates with an expected DL communication schedule for the UE. This is achieved by the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication which the network can provide to the UE to avoid that the Periodic Registration Timer is restarted by the UE when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED.\n-\tHigh latency communication refers to mechanisms that may be used to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using power saving functions (e.g. extended DRX or MICO mode with Active or Extended Connected Time). High latency communication is supported by extended buffering of downlink data in the UPF, SMF or NEF when a UE is using power saving functions in CM-IDLE and is not reachable. Alternatively, high latency communication is supported through different AF notifications. An AF may for example subscribe to receive UE reachability notifications so that the AF then waits with sending the data until it gets a notification that the UE has become reachable.\n-\tSupport for Monitoring Events enables AFs to acquire information such as whether a UE is roaming or to determine when a USIM is changed to a different ME. The complete list of monitoring events is documented in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.3.1.\n-\tExternal parameter provisioning refers to functionality originally defined in Rel-15 already, which enables an AF to provision information such as Expected UE Behaviour parameters or other service parameters to the network (see TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.6.1). In Rel-16, additional Expected UE Behaviour parameters were introduced (e.g. an indication whether the UE is stationary or mobile), which can be used by the AMF and/or SMF for various purposes, e.g. by AMF for paging optimisations. In addition, an AF can provide Network Configuration parameters (e.g. Maximum Response Time) to the network, which in turn can be used to derive parameters for system procedures (e.g. to derive the Active Time or Extended Connected time for MICO mode). The complete list of Expected UE Behaviour parameters and Network Configuration parameters are documented in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.6.3 and 4.15.6.3a, respectively.\n-\tPDU session handling during inter-RAT idle mode mobility to and from NB-IoT allows the SMF to maintain a PDU session, disconnect a PDU session with a reactivation request or to disconnect a PDU session without reactivation request when the UE moves between a \"broadband\" RAT (e.g. NR or WB-E-UTRAN) and a \"narrowband\" RAT (NB-IoT).\n-\tSystem aspects of the Enhanced Coverage RAN feature as specified in TS 36.300 [4], in particular storage of Paging Assistance Data for UEs supporting Enhanced Coverage and providing of Paging Assistance Data to RAN during paging has been introduced. Specific subscribers can also be restricted to use the Enhanced Coverage feature through Enhanced Coverage Restricted information that is stored in the UDM. Based on the latter, AMF informs UE, RAN and SMF about the use (or not) of the Enhanced Coverage feature.\n-\tThe rate of user data sent to and from a UE can be controlled in two ways:\n-\tServing PLMN rate control allows the serving network to protect its AMF and the Signalling Radio Bearers in the NG-RAN from the load generated by NAS Data PDUs by indicating a limit for the number of NAS Data PDUs per time unit to the UE and UPF/NEF.\n-\tSmall Data Rate Control allows HPLMN operators to offer customer services such as \"maximum of Y messages per day\" and is also based on indicating a number of packets per time unit limitation to UE and UPF/NEF for enforcement.\n-\tCongestion control for control plane data transfer enables the AMF to restrict, e.g. during high-load situations, the use of the control plane for data transmission (i.e. for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation). In particular, AMF may provide a Control Plane data back-off timer to the UE. While the Control Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE is not allowed to initiate any data transfer via Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.\n-\tService Gap Control can be used to control the frequency at which UEs can access the network, e.g. to alleviate peak load situations. Service Gap control is realized by AMF indicating a Service Gap Time to a UE; the UE then stays in CM-IDLE mode for at least the whole duration of the Service Gap timer before triggering Mobile Originated user data transmission.\n-\tInter-UE QoS for NB-IoT targets UEs that are using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and are accessing the network via NB-IoT. The feature allows NG-RAN to prioritise resource allocation between those UEs based on the subscribed NB-IoT UE Priority that NG-RAN may retrieve from the AMF.\n-\tDifferentiation of Category M UEs enables the network to identify traffic to/from Category M UEs, e.g. for charging differentiation and subscription based access control. This functionality is based on a Category M indication from UE to NG-RAN during RRC Connection Establishment and subsequently, an LTE-M Indication to the AMF in the Initial UE Message. Based on this, AMF considers the RAT type to be LTE-M and informs SMF, SMSF and PCF accordingly for subsequent use of the LTE-M RAT type, e.g. in CDRs. A subscription parameter for subscription based access restriction for LTE-M is also introduced.\n-\tSelection, steering and redirection between EPS and 5GS allows a network that supports CIoT features in both EPC and 5GC to steer UEs from the CN type that the UE is attempting to register with to the other CN type (e.g. from 5GC to EPC) due to operator policy, e.g., due to roaming agreements, Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, load redistribution, etc. It is assumed that operators configure the steering policies in EPC and 5GC such that steering UEs back and forth between EPC and 5GC is avoided.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTS 23.501, “System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)”\n[2]\tTS 23.401, “General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access”\n[3]\tTS 23.502, “Procedures for the 5G System (5GS)”\n[4]\tTS 36.300, \" Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2\"\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by FUTUREWEI in RP-201229.\nThis Feature builds on the successful base NB-IoT feature in Rel-13, and enhancements in Rel-14 and Rel-15, and adds features such as DL/UL transmission efficiency improvement, UE power consumption improvement, scheduling enhancement, network management tool enhancement, latency improvement, enhancement on coexistence with NR and connection to 5GC.\nImproved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption\nReduced UE power consumption and improved transmission efficiency are achieved through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.\nUE-group wake-up signals (GWUS) (FDD):\nWith the introduction of Rel-15 wake-up signalling (WUS), UE can skip the paging procedures if the wake-up signal is not detected to save power. This feature (UE-group WUS) allows eNB to transmit a UE-group WUS to instruct the UEs in the group that they must monitor NPDCCH for paging. This allows the UE to skip the paging procedures to save more power if eNB sends UE-group WUS to UEs in other groups. The UEs are grouped according to their paging probability and/or their UE ID based on system information configuration.\nMobile-terminated early data transmission (MT-EDT) (FDD):\nRel-15 Mobile Originating Early Data Transmission (MO-EDT) allows one uplink data transmission optionally followed by one downlink data transmission during the random access procedure, avoiding transition to RRC_CONNECTED mode. Rel-16 Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) allows one downlink data transmission during the random access procedure triggered in response to a paging message. This feature allows the eNB to decide whether to initiate Mobile Terminated EDT procedures towards the UE based on the data size received from the core network. Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) is only supported in EPC.\nSupport for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode (FDD)\nIn Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature, where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure.\nIn Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.\nScheduling of multiple DL/UL transport blocks with single DCI (FDD)\nThis feature allows the scheduling of up to two transport blocks (TB) with a single DCI for uplink or downlink unicast transmission, where the number of TBs is indicated by DCI. The transmission of multiple TBs can be configured to be contiguous or interleaved. And HARQ bundling can be potentially configured when transmission is configured as interleaved. It also allows the scheduling of up to eight transport blocks with a single DCI for SC-MTCH, where the number of TBs is indicated by DCI. The DCI overhead can be reduced for contiguous UL/DL transmissions.\nNetwork management tool enhancements - SON (FDD and TDD)\nRel-16 introduces SON features: RACH report, RLF report and ANR for network resource optimisation. The ANR measurements are performed when the UE is in RRC_IDLE and reported next time the UE enters RRC_CONNECTED. The NPRACH configuration of the NB-IoT Cells are exchanged between neighbour eNBs for RACH optimization. And the RLF report from UE is forwarded to the old eNB to determine the nature of the failure.\nSON features are only supported in EPC.\nImproved multicarrier operations - Quality report in Msg3 and connected mode (FDD)\nIn cells with interference, the coverage level corresponding to the estimate RSRP may be mismatched with the channel quality. This feature allows the eNB to configure a UE in IDLE mode to report the downlink channel quality in Msg3 for non-anchor access. It also allows the UE to report the downlink channel quality in connected mode other than Msg3 for anchor and non-anchor carriers. This allows the eNB to schedule NPDCCH and NPDSCH more accurately, especially in cases with mismatch between coverage level and channel quality.\nPresence of NRS on a non-anchor carrier for paging (FDD)\nThis feature allows eNB to transmit NRS in subframes on a non-anchor carrier for paging even when no paging NPDCCH is transmitted. The NRS are present in the first M subframes out of the 10 NB-IoT DL subframes before the Paging Occasion (PO), where the PO can be a subset of POs or a whole set of POs, and the values of M depend on the value of nB as defined in TS 36.304.\nWhen NRS is present on a non-anchor paging carrier and the conditions for NRSRP measurement on non-anchor carrier are met as defined in TS 36.133, the UE may perform serving cell measurements on the non-anchor paging carrier.\nMobility enhancements - Idle mode inter-RAT cell selection to/from NB-IoT (FDD and TDD)\nWith this feature, NB-IoT can provide assistance information for inter-RAT cell selection to E-UTRAN/GERAN and E-UTRAN can provide assistance information for inter-RAT cell selection to NB-IoT. A UE may use the assistance information provided by the network for cell selection to/from NB-IoT.\nImproved latency - UE Specific DRX (FDD and TDD)\nRel-16 introduces support for UE specific DRX to reduce paging latency. The eNB may broadcast a minimum UE specific DRX value shorter than the cell default DRX value. When UE specific DRX is configured by the upper layers and the minimum UE specific DRX value is broadcast, the UE monitors paging according to the longer of the two values.\nCoexistence of NB-IoT with NR (FDD and TDD)\nThis feature allows the configuration of the DL/UL resource reservation in subframe/slot/symbol-levels on non-anchor carriers for unicast transmission to avoid resource overlapping with NR channels/signals. The configuration can be for 10ms or 40ms duration, with a periodicity from {10ms, 20ms, 40ms, 80ms, 160ms} and a start position in a granularity of 10ms, which is independent from legacy configurations. It also allows dynamic indication whether the resource reservation is applied or not.\nThree system scenarios have been studied and captured in TR 37.824:\n•\tFor NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, RB alignment, power boosting and numerologies have been addressed.\n•\tFor NB-IoT operation in NR guard band, RF requirements will not be specified.\n•\tFor NB-IoT standalone operation, based on coexistence study, it is concluded that there is no issue for NB-IoT standalone coexistence with NR.\nConnection to 5GC (FDD and TDD)\nRel-16 introduces support for connection to 5GC reusing eLTE as a baseline, including Unified Access Control (UAC). RRC_INACTIVE, NR SDAP and NR PDCP are not supported and a maximum of two PDU sessions mapped to two default DRBs is supported.\nRel-16 also introduces support for the CIoT 5GS optimisation, in particular extended DRX (eDRX) in RRC_IDLE, control plane and user plane CIoT optimisation, MO-EDT for the control plane and user plane CIoT optimisation, RRC Connection Reestablishment for the control plane and restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage.\nSimilar backhaul signalling to support control plane and user plane CIoT optimisation are introduced over NG interface (between ng-eNB and AMF) and over Xn interface (between ng-eNBs), including e.g. early UE radio capability retrieval from core network after msg3, NB-IoT CP relocation procedures to support connection reestablishment, Paging assistance information exchanging, UE differentiation information exchanging, etc.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-201276.\nThis work item builds on the LTE features for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) introduced in earlier releases (e.g. low-complexity UE categories M1 and M2, and Coverage Enhancement Modes A and B) by further improving network operation and efficiency in a range of areas.\nThe following sections describe the new MTC features for LTE in Rel-16. All features are optional for the UE and can be supported by Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 and by normal LTE UEs supporting CE mode unless otherwise stated. All features are applicable to both CE modes (A and B) in all duplex modes (HD-FDD, FD-FDD, and TDD) unless otherwise stated.\nImproved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption\nReduced UE power consumption is achieved through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.\n•\tUE-group wake-up signals (GWUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode was enabled in Rel-15 by the introduction of the wake-up signal (WUS), a compact signal transmitted a configurable time before the paging occasion (PO) when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to maximize its sleep time during periods when there is no paging. In Rel-16, an enhancement is introduced that allows a WUS to wake up a configurable group of UEs rather than all UEs that happen to monitor the same PO. This helps reduce the power consumption even further. The mapping of GWUS in the time and frequency domains is highly configurable.\n•\tMobile-terminated early data transmission (MT-EDT): For scenarios where the UE only needs to transmit a small amount of data, the early data transmission (EDT) feature in Rel-15 enables the UE to transmit up to (slightly more than) 100 bytes of data already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure, and to receive data already in Msg4. If needed, eNB can order fallback to legacy random-access procedure during the EDT procedure. In Rel-16, an enhancement is introduced that allows not only mobile-originated (MO) EDT access but also mobile-terminated (MT) EDT. When the MME triggers MT-EDT, an indication is included in the paging message, after which the UE triggers random access to resume the connection (in case the UP CIoT EPS optimization is used) or initiate MO-EDT (in case the CP CIoT EPS optimization is used). MT traffic is received in Msg4. MT-EDT is only supported when UE is connected to EPC (not 5GC).\n•\tImproved DL quality reporting: Legacy CE mode A supports both periodic and aperiodic CSI reporting which can be used to assist PDSCH link adaptation. In Rel-16, a new type of DL quality reporting is introduced which reflects MPDCCH quality rather than PDSCH quality. The report represents the required number of MPDCCH subframe repetitions for reliable MPDCCH reception. It can be sent in connected mode, but it can also be sent already in Msg3 during the random access procedure, which means that the report can be used for guiding the UE-specific MPDCCH configuration, which helps optimize power consumption, latency, and spectral efficiency.\n•\tMPDCCH performance improvement: In legacy LTE-MTC, MPDCCH demodulation is DMRS-based. With this feature, the UE can use a combination of DMRS and CRS for MPDCCH demodulation to improve the MPDCCH performance. The feature takes the configured DMRS-to-CRS power ratio into account. The feature can be used for transmissions in idle mode and/or connected mode. In idle mode, the DMRS-to-CRS mapping is based on precoder cycling, whereas in connected mode, it can be configured to be precoder cycling based, CSI-based, or (in case of TDD) reciprocity-based.\nBeside the features listed above, the features described in sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6 can also improve UE power consumption and/or transmission efficiency in DL and/or UL.\nPreconfigured uplink resources (PUR)\nIn Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature, where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure.\nIn Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). When the feature is configured, both the random-access preamble transmission (Msg1) and the random-access response (Msg2) can be omitted, and the data transmission can be completed in only two messages (i.e., Msg3 and Msg4).\nThe UE is configured with PUR via dedicated RRC signaling while in connected mode. Configuring a UE with PUR can be triggered by the network or requested by the UE. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.\nThere are two schemes for transmitting using PUR, dedicated PUR and shared PUR, the latter allows up to two users to transmit simultaneously when the number of PUSCH repetitions is greater than or equal to 64 for full-PRB allocation.\nScheduling of multiple transport blocks\nIn legacy LTE-MTC operation, each DCI carried by MPDCCH schedules a single PDSCH or PUSCH transport block (TB). In Rel-16, a possibility to schedule multiple TBs using a single is introduced. This can help improve the resource utilization by reducing the number of physical resource blocks (PRBs) spent on MPDCCH transmission and the number of subframes spent on guard time for DL-to-UL and UL-to-DL transition (in half-duplex FDD operation).\n•\tUnicast multi-TB scheduling: When the feature is configured, a single DCI can schedule multi TBs for PDSCH or PUSCH (up to 8 TBs in CE mode A, or up to 4 TBs in CE mode B). The number of TBs is dynamically controlled by the DCI. The TBs can be configured to be transmitted consecutively or subframe interleaved (in case of subframe repetition). For PDSCH multi-TB scheduling, HARQ-ACK bundling can optionally be used to improve the resource utilization further for UEs in good coverage. For PUSCH multi-TB scheduling, early termination of the PUSCH transmission is supported through indication of positive HARQ-ACK in the DCI.\n•\tMulticast multi-TB scheduling: When the feature is configured a single DCI can schedule up to 8 TBs for PDSCH for a SC-MTCH, with configurable time gaps between the TBs if desired. The number of TBs is dynamically controlled by the DCI.\nCE mode improvements for non-Cat-M UEs\nThe features in this work item can be supported both by Cat-M UEs and non-Cat-M UEs that support CE mode A or B. In addition, the following features have been specified specifically for non-Cat-M UEs that support CE mode A or B.\n•\tEnhancements to idle mode mobility: A possibility is introduced for a non-Cat-M UE in a non-standalone LTE-MTC cell to use enhanced coverage functionality to camp in the cell even if the S-criterion indicates that the UE is in normal coverage. This functionality is enabled/disabled by a configuration provided in SIB1. (This is the default behavior for the standalone LTE-MTC case described in the next section in this document.)\n•\tCSI feedback based on CSI-RS: In legacy CE mode A, periodic and aperiodic CSI feedback is based on up to 4 CRS antenna ports. This feature introduces support for periodic CSI feedback based on 8 CSI-RS antenna ports in TM9 for non-Cat-M UEs in CE mode A. The feature can help improve the DL link adaptation and hence the DL performance. As a separate UE capability, the feature can also optionally be supported in combination with codebook subset restriction.\n•\tETWS/CMAS in connected mode: In legacy LTE-MTC, ETWS/CMAS notification indication is supported using DCI format 6-2 in MPDCCH common search space Type-1 in idle mode. This feature introduces ETWS/CMAS notification indication using DCI format 6-1A/B in MPDCCH common search space Type-0 in connected mode for non-Cat-M UEs in CE mode A/B. This means that a UE can be notified without releasing the UE to idle mode.\nStand-alone deployment\nIn legacy LTE-MTC operation, the first few OFDM symbols in each DL subframe are unused by LTE-MTC since they are assumed to be occupied by LTE control channels for normal LTE UEs (PCFICH, PDCCH, PHICH). This feature enables transmission of MPDCCH and/or PDSCH to UEs in CE mode A/B in the “LTE control channel region” on carriers that are not used for normal LTE. The feature can be used for transmissions in idle mode and/or connected mode. The potential DL transmission efficiency gain is about 14% (corresponding to 2 out of 14 OFDM symbols) for 1.4 MHz carriers and about 7% (corresponding to 1 out of 14 OFDM symbols) for wider carriers.\nMobility enhancements\nIn Rel-15, two new LTE-MTC signals were introduced, the resynchronization signal (RSS) and the wake-up signal (WUS), and in Rel-16 the following mobility enhancements are introduced which make use of the Rel-15 signals.\n•\tRSS-based measurements: In Rel-15, support for a resynchronization signal (RSS) was introduced and its configuration is provided by the serving cell. In Rel-16, signaling of RSS configurations for neighbor cells is introduced. Both broadcasted and dedicated signaling can be used to provide the configurations. The primary purpose of RSS is to improved synchronization performance, but with the Rel-16 signaling, the UE may also use RSS for improved measurement performance for intra-frequency RSRP measurements for neighbor cells in both idle and connected mode.\n•\tRRM measurement relaxation: The legacy LTE-MTC UE behavior requires the UE to measure on the serving cell and evaluate the cell selection criterion at least every DRX cycle. The wake-up signal (WUS) introduced in Rel-15 would allow the UE to sleep for multiple paging cycles and wake up to receive paging after a configurable time duration, but the UE power saving gain from WUS cannot be fully utilized since the UE is still required to wake up for measurements. Therefore, an RRM measurement relaxation is introduced in Rel-16, which allows the UE meet the requirements using a longer measurement cycle to save power, where the cycle is configurable under certain conditions.\nPerformance improvement for NR coexistence\nSpectrum sharing with legacy (Rel-13/14/15) LTE-MTC is already supported in Rel-15 NR, and the RF coexistence aspects described in TR 37.823. The following features are introduced in Rel-16 LTE-MTC in order to further improve the performance of the coexistence with NR.\n•\tDL/UL resource reservation: Legacy LTE-MTC supports configuration of invalid DL/UL subframes, which can be used in order to avoid mapping LTE-MTC transmissions to subframes that are needed for NR transmissions. Rel-16 takes a step further by introducing finer-granularity LTE-MTC resource reservation in both the time domain (with subframe, slot, or symbol level granularity) and the frequency domain (with LTE RBG level granularity) for unicast MPDCCH/PDSCH/PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions in connected mode in CE mode A/B. The resource reservation patterns are configurable using parameter combinations based on bitmaps, periodicities and offsets. For PDSCH/PUSCH, the DCI can indicate that the resource reservation should be overridden, in which case the PDSCH/PUSCH transmission becomes continuous.\n•\tDL subcarrier puncturing: In order to achieve PRB alignment between LTE-MTC and NR, a possibility to puncture 1 or 2 DL subcarriers at the lower or higher edge of each 6-PRB narrowband is introduced. The puncturing affects MPDCCH/PDSCH transmissions in connected mode in CE mode A/B. The performance loss from the puncturing should typically be insignificant.\nConnection to 5GC\nIn Rel-16, support for connecting LTE-MTC UEs to 5GC is introduced. It resembles the Rel-15 functionality for connecting LTE UEs to 5GC. The RRC_INACTIVE state is supported and additionally the User Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation is supported in RRC_IDLE (similar to the corresponding EPC feature). Some features, such as EDT and PUR are supported only in RRC_IDLE using the UP-optimisation solution and are not supported in RRC_INACTIVE. Long extended DRX in RRC_IDLE is supported, and RAN paging cycles of 5.12 s and 10.24 s are supported in RRC_INACTIVE.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-192875, Rel-16 LTE-MTC work item description\n[2]\tRP-201275, Rel-16 LTE-MTC work item status report\n[3]\tRP-192647 & RP-192648 & RP-200196 & RP-200698, RAN1 CR packs\n[4]\tRP-200360 & RP-201192 & RP-201193, RAN2 CR packs\n[5]\tRP-201086 & RP-201087, RAN3 CR packs\n[6]\tRP-193023 & RP-200418 & RP-200962, RAN4 CR packs\n",

The following reference points are defined in the architectural reference models:\n-\tPC5 reference point: NR PC5 RAT, LTE PC5 RAT.\n-\tUu reference point: NR, E-UTRA.\nThe Stage 2 of the interworking between EPS V2X and 5GS V2X is also specified .\nThe various parameters for V2X communications over PC5 and Uu reference points are specified and these parameters may be made available to the UE in following ways:\n-\tpre-configured in the ME; or\n-\tconfigured in the UICC; or\n-\tpreconfigured in the ME and configured in the UICC; or\n-\tprovided/updated by the V2X Application Server via PCF and/or V1 reference point; or\n-\tprovided/updated by the PCF to the UE.\nIn addition to PCF initiated Policy Provisioning procedure, the UE may perform UE triggered Policy Provisioning procedure to the PCF when the UE determines the V2X Policy/Parameter is invalid (e.g. Policy/Parameter is outdated, missing or invalid).\nRegarding V2X communication over PC5 reference point, two types of PC5 reference points exist: the LTE based PC5 reference point as defined in TS 23.285 [4], and the NR based PC5 reference point as defined in TS 23.287 [1]. A UE may use either type of PC5 or both for V2X communication depending on the services the UE supports. The V2X communication over PC5 reference point supports roaming and inter-PLMN operations. V2X communication over PC5 reference point is supported when UE is \"served by NR or E-UTRA\" or when the UE is \"not served by NR or E-UTRA\".\nV2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point supports broadcast mode, groupcast mode and unicast mode. For unicast mode, Layer-2 link establishment, Link identifier update, Layer-2 link release, Layer-2 link modification and Layer-2 link maintenance procedures are specified. Per-Flow PC5 QoS Model is introduced for V2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point.\nArchitecture enhancements for EPS to support V2X communication over NR PC5 reference point are specified in TS 23.285 [4].\nFor V2X communication over Uu reference point, only unicast is supported. Latency reduction for V2X message transfer via unicast may be achieved by using various mechanisms, including via e.g., edge computing defined in TS 23.501 [5].\nNotification on QoS Sustainability Analytics to the V2X Application Server is specified so that the V2X Application Server may request notifications on QoS Sustainability Analytics for an indicated geographic area and time interval in order to adjust the application behaviour in advance with potential QoS change.\nTo support V2X applications that can operate with different configurations (e.g. different bitrates or delay requirements), the V2X Application Server, acting as the Application Function, can provide, in addition to the requested level of service requirements, Alternative Service Requirements to the 5G System. This enables the 5G System to act on the Alternative Service Requirements and apply them for the extended NG-RAN notification (i.e. Alternative QoS Profiles are provided from SMF to NG-RAN), as described in TS 23.501 [5] and TS 23.503 [6].\nIn order to facilitate deployment of dedicated network slice for use of, for example, automotive industry and to facilitate roaming support, a new standardized Slice/Service Type (SST) value dedicated for V2X services, i.e. 4 is defined in TS 23.501 [5].\nSecurity aspects of 3GPP support for advanced V2X services are specified in TS 33.536 [7].\nStage 3 normative works made by CT working groups are specified in TS 24.587 [8] and TS 24.588 [9] that are new specifications for V2X as well as many specifications listed in the WID on CT aspects of architecture enhancements for 3GPP support of advanced V2X services [10].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 23.287: \"Architecture enhancements for 5G System (5GS) to support Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services\".\n[2] TS 22.185: \"Service requirements for V2X services; Stage 1\".\n[3] TS 22.186: \"Enhancement of 3GPP support for V2X scenarios; Stage 1\".\n[4] TS 23.285: \"Architecture enhancements for V2X services\".\n[5] TS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n[6] TS 23.503: \"Policy and Charging Control Framework for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n[7] TS 33.536: \"Security aspects of 3GPP support for advanced Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services\".\n[8] TS 24.587: \"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services in 5G System (5GS); Stage 3\".\n[9] TS 24.588: \"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services in 5G System (5GS); User Equipment (UE) policies; Stage 3\".\n[10] 3GPP CP-192078: \"WID: CT aspects of architecture enhancements for 3GPP support of advanced V2X services\".\n",

The architecture allows for flexible deployments considering V2X application support layer being deployed centrally or deployed in a distributed manner by either a V2X service provider or PLMN operator or both.\nThe following features are specified in Rel.16 for the support of V2X application specific layer:\na.\tThe following VAE capabilities are specified in TS 23.286 [5], the related detailed procedures over HTTP protocol between VAE client (V2X UE) and VAE server are specified in TS 24.486 [7] and the RESTful APIs provided by VAE server towards the V2X application specific server is specified in TS 29.486 [8]:\n•\tV2X service discovery to enable V2X UE to discover V2X services provided by V2X application servers via VAE server, V2X UE register at VAE server for receiving V2X services from V2X application specific servers and V2X message distribution/delivery (including group communication) for V2X messages originated from the V2X application specific layer (Uplink and/or Downlink).\n•\tApplication level location tracking of the V2X UE(s) as per the geographical information provided by the V2X application specific layer.\n•\tV2X service continuity by dynamically receiving local service information and discovery of appropriate VAE server to serve the V2X UE as per the geographical area corresponding to V2X UE mobility.\n•\tDynamic group management for scenarios like Platooning where the groups are enabled by V2X application specific server and the related V2V configurations/provisioning to the V2X UE are enabled by VAE server.\n•\tV2X UE subscription and notification of network situation information to support V2X UE level application adaptations.\n•\tCommunication of V2X application specific layer requirement to the EPC by translating the application requirements to the network requirements.\n•\tSupporting file distribution from V2X application specific server to the V2X UEs using xMB APIs as specified in TS 26.348 [9].\nb.\tThe following SEAL capabilities specified in TS 23.434 [6] are used by V2X application layer and more details about the following services are provided in clause 9.4:\n•\tGroup management service\n•\tConfiguration management service\n•\tLocation management service\n•\tNetwork resource management service\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 22.185: \"Service requirements for V2X services; Stage 1\".\n[2] TS 22.186: \"Enhancement of 3GPP support for V2X scenarios; Stage 1\".\n[3] TS 23.285: \"Architecture enhancements for V2X services\".\n[4] TR 23.795: \"Study on application layer support for V2X services\".\n[5] TS 23.286: \"Application layer support for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services; Functional architecture and information flows\".\n[6] TS 23.434: \"Service enabler architecture layer for verticals; Functional architecture and information flows\".\n[7] TS 24.486: \"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Application Enabler (VAE) layer; Protocol aspects; Stage 3\".\n[8] TS 29.486: \"V2X Application Enabler (VAE) Services; Stage 3\".\n[9] TS 26.348: \"Northbound Application Programming Interface (API) for Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) at the xMB reference point\".\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in RP-200855.\n3GPP RAN technology for sidelink communication based on 5G NR was specified through this WI to define the means for providing the advanced V2X services identified by 3GPP SA1. This WI corresponds to 3GPP V2X phase 3, which is the evolution of LTE V2X in Release 14 (phase 1) and 15 (phase 2).\nThis section provides a summary of the key functionalities of NR sidelink.\nPhysical layer structure\nSidelink bandwidth part (BWP) is defined to support the flexible numerologies in operating on various spectrum band such as the intelligent transport system (ITS) dedicated band and the licensed band of frequency range 1 (FR1) and FR2. For sidelink synchronization, GNSS, gNB/eNB and the NR sidelink UE can be used as a synchronization reference source of a UE.\nThe NR V2X sidelink uses the following physical channels and signals:\n-\tPhysical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) and its de-modulation reference signal (DMRS)\n-\tPhysical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) and its DMRS\n-\tPhysical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) and its DMRS\n-\tPhysical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH)\n-\tSidelink primary and secondary synchronization signals (S-PSS and S-SSS)\n-\tPhase-tracking reference signal (PT-RS) in FR2\n-\tChannel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)\nSidelink control information (SCI) in NR V2X is transmitted in two stages. The first-stage SCI is carried on PSCCH and contains information to enable sensing operations, as well as information about the resource allocation of the PSSCH. PSSCH transmits the second-stage SCI and the sidelink shared channel (SL-SCH) transport channel. The second-stage SCI carries information needed to identify and decode the associated SL-SCH, as well as control for hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) procedures, and triggers for channel state information (CSI) feedback, etc. SL-SCH carries the transport block (TB) of data for transmission over SL.\nPSCCH and PSSCH are multiplexed in time and frequency within a slot for short latency and high reliability. DRMS is frequency multiplexed with PSCCH or PSSCH in the corresponding DMRS symbols. PSFCH, which is used for sidelink HARQ feedback for unicast and groupcast, is transmitted at the end of a slot, which is preceded by an additional guard symbol and an automatic gain control (AGC) symbol. Two multiplexing examples are shown in Figure 1(a) and 1(b).\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the slot format used in 2-symbol Phase Shift Keying (PSCH) and Phase Shift Keying with Multiple Reference (PSSCH-DMRS) systems. The slots are labeled with the number of symbols and the corresponding phase shift values. The figure also includes a dashed line to represent the reference signal, which is used to synchronize the transmission of the data symbols. The figure is a useful tool for understanding the structure and operation of these communication systems.\nFigure 1(a) Example slot format of 2-symbol PSCCH, 2-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and no PSFCH.\nThe figure depicts the slot format of 3-symbol PSCCH, 3-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and PSFCH signals, illustrating the different types of signaling used in 5G networks.\nFigure 1(b) Example slot format of 3-symbol PSCCH, 3-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and PSFCH.\nResource allocation\nThere are two resource allocation modes: mode 1 and mode 2. Mode 1 for resource allocation by gNB and Mode 2 for UE autonomous resource selection are very similar to Mode 3 and Mode 4 in LTE sidelink respectively. For mode 1, gNB schedules to UE the dynamic grant resources by downlink control information (DCI), or the configured grant resource type 1 and type 2 by radio resource control (RRC) signalling and DCI respectively.\nIn Mode 2, the sensing operation to determine transmission resources by UE comprises 1) sensing within a sensing window, 2) exclusion of the resources reserved by other UEs, and 3) select the final resources within a selection window. In Mode 2, shortly before transmitting in a reserved resource, a sensing UE re-evaluates the set of resources to check whether its intended transmission is still suitable, considering a possible aperiodic transmission after the resource reservation. If the reserved resources would not be part of the set for selection at this time, then new resources are selected from the updated resource selection window. In addition to the re-evaluation, pre-emption is also introduced such that a UE selects new resources even after it announces the resource reservation when it observes resource collision with a higher priority transmission from another UE.\nSidelink HARQ feedback, sidelink CSI and PC5-RRC for unicast and groupcast\nNR sidelink supports sidelink HARQ-ACK for sidelink unicast and groupcast services for improved reliability. Two sidelink HARQ feedback operations are defined, HARQ-ACK with ACK and NACK, and HARQ-ACK with NACK only. When ACK/NACK operation is used, the sidelink HARQ-ACK procedure is similar to that of Uu for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ-ACKis transmitted based on the success or failure of the whole transport block. NACK-only operation is defined for groupcast to allow a a larger number of Rx UEs to share a single PSFCH resource by sending feedback only when a Rx UE receives SCI but fails to decode the transport block. The transmission of NACK-only feedback can be restricted to UEs within given a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide any HARQ-ACK. This minimum range requirement of a service is provided together with the associated QoS parameters from service layers. For mode 1, sidelink HARQ-ACK information is reported to gNB to indicate whether additional retransmission resources are required or not.\nIn sielink unicast transmission, Tx UE can configure aperiodic sidelink CSI reporting from the Rx UE to get information it can use for sidelink link adaptation and rank adaptation. CQI and RI are reported via MAC layer signalling, in a PSSCH transmission for this purpose. In addition, radio link monitoring is adopted to manage a sidelink connection.\nThe figure depicts the PC5 control plane (PC5-C) protocol stack for RRC (Radio Resource Control), which is a key component in 5G networks. The stack includes various protocols and services, such as RRC, RRC-V, and RRC-V2, which are used to manage radio resources and ensure efficient use of spectrum. The figure also shows the RRC-V protocol, which is used for radio resource control and is a key part of the PC5-C stack. The RRC-V protocol is responsible for managing radio resources and ensuring efficient use of spectrum. The figure also includes the RRC-V2 protocol, which is used for radio resource control and is a key part of the PC5-C stack. The RRC-V protocol is responsible for managing radio resources and ensuring efficient use of spectrum. The figure also includes the RRC protocol, which is used for radio resource control and is a key part of the PC5-C stack. The RRC protocol is responsible for managing radio resources and ensuring efficient use of spectrum. The figure also includes the RRC-V protocol, which is used for radio resource control and is a key part of the PC5-C stack. The RRC-\nFigure 2 PC5 control plane (PC5-C) protocol stack for RRC.\nTo support exchange of the AS layer configuration and UE capability information between UEs, PC5-RRC is defined for unicast sidelink communication. The AS protocol stacks of the control plane for RRC is depicted in Figure 2.\nCross-RAT and in-device coexistence between LTE V2X and NR V2X sidelinks\nDepending on the NR V2X and LTE V2X deployment, it is envisaged that an optional UE design can be supported where a device has both an LTE-V2X RAT and an NR-V2X RAT which are able to inter-communicate. 5G V2X defines two Cross-RAT operations. LTE Uu can control NR resource allocation mode 1 by providing configured grant Type 1 configurations via LTE RRC signalling, and resource allocation mode 2 by LTE Uu RRC providing the semi-static configurations relevant to resource pools, sensing, etc. NR Uu can control LTE resource allocation mode 3 by transmitting an NR DCI which contains the information needed to dynamically control the LTE sidelink, and resource allocation mode 4 by NR Uu RRC providing the necessary semi-static configurations within which the LTE-V2X RAT autonomously selects resources for sidelink transmission.\nIt is envisaged that there will exist devices that support both LTE-V2X and NR-V2X, and which will be operating in both systems concurrently. If the two RATs are widely spaced in frequency, e.g. being in different bands, then there need be no particular issues to consider since it is assumed that a separate RF chain will be provided for each band. If, however, a sufficiently close frequency spacing is deployed, then it is desirable to enable a single RF chain to be used in the implementation. In this case, the simultaneous transmission on both RATs is prevented by the UE's single power budget, and one RAT cannot be received/transmitted while the other RAT is doing the opposite. In this case, one of the RATs may be dropped at times when both occur simultaneously, but that in some cases where the priority of the V2X service on both RATs is known, the higher priority one is automatically selected.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n- RP-200129, “Revised WID on 5G V2X with NR sidelink”\n- TR37.985, “Overall description of Radio Access Network (RAN) aspects for Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) based on LTE and NR (Release 16).”\n- TR38.886, “V2X Services based on NR; User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and reception.”\n- Last status report in RP-200854\n",

A common API framework within 3GPP will allow for a consistent development of northbound APIs across multiple working groups, i.e. when defining northbound APIs to abstract or expose the underlying 3GPP network capabilities to 3rd party applications. Intended users of CAPIF are third-party developers that may not be familiar with 3GPP networks and their underlying complexities.\nIn Release 15, the technical report TR 23.722 was provided to cover key issues, architecture requirements, functional architecture model, and corresponding solutions that are relevant to the definition of a common API framework applicable to any service APIs when used by northbound entities. Subsequently, still in Release 15, a stage-2 Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs (CAPIF) specification was developed in TS 23.222, based on the solutions and conclusions of TR 23.722. The work item summary for Release 15 CAPIF is available in TS 21.915 [1].\nWhile a basic Common API Framework is made available in 3GPP Rel-15, there are several enhancements that are considered for developing eCAPIF in Rel-16 in TS 23.222 [2], and the key enhancements are listed as follows:\na.\tArchitecture functional model to support multiple API providers (within and outside the PLMN trust domain) where CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4 and CAPIF-5 were enhanced as CAPIF-3e, CAPIF-4e and CAPIF-5e respectively to enable the API exposing function, the API publishing function and the API management function of the API provider domain within the 3rd party trust domain interaction with the CAPIF core function in the PLMN trust domain. Further, the API exposing function within the PLMN trust domain interacts with the API exposing function in the 3rd party trust domain via CAPIF-7e.\n\nb.\tArchitectural model for the CAPIF interconnection which allows API invokers of a CAPIF provider to utilize the service APIs from the 3rd party CAPIF provider where the designated CAPIF core function of the CAPIF provider A provides the information about the CAPIF instances and service APIs deployed by the CAPIF provider A to the designated CAPIF core function of the CAPIF provider B and vice versa over CAPIF-6e reference point.\n\nc.\tAdditional deployment models including distributed deployment of CAPIF considering PLMN trust domain and 3rd party trust domain, multiple CAPIF core functions that may be deployed within the PLMN trust domain.\nd.\tThe procedure to support API topology hiding by dynamically configuring the address of the AEF providing the Service API to the AEF entry point providing the topology hiding. The API publishing function and the API exposing function can be within PLMN trust domain or within 3rd party trust domain.\ne.\tProcedures to support for CAPIF interconnenction including interconnection API publish request from CAPIF core function to CAPIF core function, service API discovery by the API invoker from multiple CCFs, service API discovery between multiple CCFs.\nf.\tProcedures for updating the API invoker's API list on the CAPIF core function.\ng.\tProcedure for dynamically routing the service API invocation from the AEF acting as service communication entry point to the destination AEF for handling service API.\nh.\tProcedure for registering API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function and for updating the registration information of the API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function.\ni.\tIntegrated deployment of 3GPP network exposure systems with the CAPIF - The SCEF and the NEF may be integrated with a single CAPIF core function to offer their respective service APIs to the API invokers. The following deployment model is possible for integrated deployment of the SCEF and the NEF with the CAPIF core function.\nSecurity aspects of enhancements for Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs are specified in TS 33.122 [3].\nStage 3 normative work to support enhancements for Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs including the OpenAPI specifications made by CT3 working group is specified in TS 29.222 [4].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 21.915: \"Release 15 Description; Summary of Rel-15 Work Items\".\n[1] TS 23.222: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs; Stage 2\".\n[2] TS 33.122: \"Security aspects of Common API Framework (CAPIF) for 3GPP northbound APIs\".\n[3] TS 29.222: \"Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs\".\n",

It was identified that V2X applications will also require a similar common set of application layer capabilities as specified in TS 23.286.\nSpecifying such common capabilities for V2X, independent from those that are defined in existing mission critical specifications could lead to fragmented capabilities and deployments. This approach results in consuming significant development time and delays in timely adoption of 3GPP technologies.\nTherefore, a set of common capabilities that can be utilized by V2X applications and potentially by multiple vertical industry applications is developed as service enabler architecture layer (SEAL) over 3GPP networks in TS 23.434 [1].\nThe Stage-2 SEAL in TS 23.434 specifes the following:\n1)\tThe architecture requirements for SEAL services.\n2)\tThe functional model for SEAL is organized into generic SEAL service functional model and specific SEAL service functional models. The generic SEAL service functional model will be used as the reference model for the specific SEAL service functional models. The generic functional model (represented using reference point and service based interface) for SEAL service is in the figure below:\n\nIn the vertical application layer, the VAL client communicates with the VAL server over VAL-UU reference point. VAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast delivery modes.\nThe SEAL functional entities on the UE and the server are grouped into SEAL client(s) and SEAL server(s) respectively. The SEAL consists of a common set of services (e.g. group management, location management) and reference points. The SEAL offers its services to the vertical application layer (VAL).\nThe SEAL client(s) communicates with the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-UU reference points. SEAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast delivery modes. The SEAL client(s) provides the service enabler layer support functions to the VAL client(s) over SEAL-C reference points. The VAL server(s) communicate with the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-S reference points. The SEAL server(s) may communicate with the underlying 3GPP network systems using the respective 3GPP interfaces specified by the 3GPP network system.\n3) The functional model for interconnection between SEAL servers to support distributed SEAL server deployments, the SEAL server interacts with another SEAL server for the same SEAL service over SEAL-E reference point as shown in the figure below:\n\n4) The functional model for inter-service communication between SEAL servers to support the SEAL server interaction with another SEAL server for inter-service communication over SEAL-X reference point is shown in the figure below:\n\n5) The functional architecture of each SEAL service listed below and corresponding functional entities and reference points along with the procedures and information flows, northbound APIs to expose the SEAL services to the vertical applications in compliance with CAPIF for each SEAL service is listed below:\n-\tGroup management (GM): The vertical application specific group communication is one of the essential feature in any vertical application. To enable group communication, each vertical application needs to create and manage the group, group specific policies and group members. The group management service, as provided by SEAL, supports group management operations (i.e. Create, Read, Update, Delete and Notify) by the authorized users or VAL servers. It also supports merging of multiple groups into single group where all the group members of the constituent groups are also members of the merged group.\n-\tLocation management (LM): Managing VAL user’s location information is a service that is required by multiple vertical specific applications. The location management service, as provided by SEAL, supports sharing location data between client and server for vertical application usage. It also provides support to request for on-demand location reporting by client and location reporting based on configurable triggers. The service also enables VAL servers to query location of any user as well as sharing the network location information obtained from the 3GPP network systems to the vertical applications.\n-\tConfiguration management (CM): Most of the vertical applications need to create and maintain configurations. Further, they need to provide the initial configuration to all its users and need to notify as soon as there is any change in configuration. The configuration management service, as provided by SEAL, supports creating and managing UE configuration and user profile configuration for the vertical applications. It also supports subscribe-notify mechanism so that the VAL users can subscribe to any change in configurations.\n-\tNetwork resource management (NRM): Many vertical applications require managing different radio bearers and switching among them. The network resource management service, as provided by SEAL, supports establishing and modifying unicast and/or multicast bearers. It also supports announcements for multicast bearers and switching from unicast to multicast bearers and vice versa.\n-\tKey management (KM): The security of sensitive data and user’s information is important aspect for every vertical application. The key management service, as provided by SEAL, supports generation and secure distribution of encryption keys to VAL users.\n-\tIdentity management (IM): The identity management service, as provided by SEAL, supports VAL user’s authentication and authorization framework. As per the defined framework, each VAL user sends authentication request using SEAL Identity Management Client (SIM-C) and once the user authentication is successful, the VAL user can request for access-token. The SEAL Identity Management Server (SIM-S) creates the access token, which is opaque to the VAL clients. The access token contains VAL user’s identity. The VAL user presents the access token to VAL server to access VAL service. The VAL server authorizes the VAL user after verifying the validity of the access token.\n6) Specifying various deployment models of SEAL services: The SEAL server(s) may be deployed either in the PLMN operator domain or deployed in the VAL service provider domain. The SEAL server(s) connects with the 3GPP network system in one or more PLMN operator domain. The SEAL server(s) may be supporting multiple VAL servers.\n7)\tService-based interface representation of the functional model for SEAL services as shown in the figure below:\nThe SEAL function(s) exhibit the service-based interfaces, which are used for providing and consuming SEAL services. The service APIs are specified for each SEAL function enabled over the service-based interface. The service-based interfaces of specific SEAL services are specified in TS 23.434. All the interactions with SEAL are governed based on the reference point interactions of the functional models specified in subclause 6 of TS 23.434. VAL function represents the functionalities of the VAL server.\nThe service APIs offered by the SEAL function(s) are published and discovered on the CAPIF core function as specified in TS 23.222 [9].\n8)\tSEAL functional model mapping with Common functional architecture (CFA).\nSecurity aspects of 3GPP support for service enabler architecture layer (SEAL) are specified in TS 33.434 [2].\nStage 3 normative work to service enabler architecture layer (SEAL) are specified in TS 24.544 [3], TS 24.545 [4], TS 24.546 [5], TS 24.547 [6], TS 24.548 [7] and TS 29.549 [6].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 23.434: \"Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals; Functional architecture and information flows\".\n[2] TS 33.434: \"Security aspects of Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL) for verticals\".\n[3] TS 24.544: \"Group Management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[4] TS 24.545: \"Location Management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[5] TS 24.546: \"Configuration management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[6] TS 24.547: \"Identity management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[7] TS 24.548: \"Network Resource Management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[8] TS 29.549: \"SEAL; Application Programming Interface (API) specification\".\n[9] TS 23.222: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs; Stage 2 \".\n",

Furthermore the WI aimes to support Non-3GPP network as Trusted network in contrast with Untrusted network. The main features introduced by the WI includes the specification of new access network node, called W-AGF (Wireline Access Gateway function), the improvement of registration and session management procedures, policy, QoS etc, tailored to the specific characteristic of wireline access network. The main future for supporting Trusted network includes the definition of architecture with new Trusted Gateway Network Function, selection procedure of such gateway, improvement and extension of registration and session procedures, policy , etc for supporting such scenario.\nThe description of support of Wireline Access Network and Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network are described in the following clauses.\nSupport of wireline access network\nThe architecture for non-roaming is shown in figure 1, where the Wireline Access Gateway Function (W-AGF) is the access node performing the termination of N2 and N3 reference point, termination of access network interface Y4 and all access network specify functionalities, the relay of N1 to/from the UE., QoS enforcement, etc. The customer device, the UE, is replaced by the Residential Gateway which is augmented to support the 5G functionalities required to connect to 5G systems, such as NAS, URSP, PDU session, etc, called 5G-RG. The specification in TS 23.316 [1] defines the modification to system architecture, procedure and flows, Policy and Charging Control for the 5G System in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503 [4].\nThe 5G-RG can also be connected via 3GPP Access basically by means of supporting the specification defined for UE. This scenario is called Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). Furthermore the 5G-RG may simultaneously connect to 3GPP Access and to wireline access by using the Single Access PDU session or supporting ATSSS feature. This scenario is called Hybrid scenario, using a terminology common on wireline access network. The ATSSS is supported as specified in TS 23.501, 23.502 and TS 23.503 where UE is replaced by 5G-RG and the Non-3GPP access (es) is specifically referred to wireline access. In this latter case, TS 23.316 has also specified the support of interworking with EPC via 3GPP Access via a MA PDU session with a PDN Connection as user-plane resource associated with a MA PDU Session.\nThe support of legacy Residential Gateway not supporting 5G capability (FN-RG) is supported via W-AGF terminating the N1 NAS on behalf of UE and acting as a UE in respect the 5G core.\n\nIn the case of Wireline Access Network defined in Broadband Forum the W-AGF functionalities is specified in BBF TR-470 [5], BBF TR-456 [6] and BBF TR-457 [7], the 5G-RG is defined in BBF TR-124issue6 [8]. In the case of Wireline Access network defined in Cablelabs the W-AGF and 5G-RG functionalities are defined in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [9].\nMain impacts on the system by the WWC Work Item for wireline support are the following:\n-\tW-AGF: the access network function which performs the termination of N2 and N3 reference point, termination of access network interface Y4 and all access network specify functionalities, the relay of N1 to/from the UE. QoS enforcement, etc. When the W-AGF facing the FN-RG the W-AGF is supporting the termination of N1 NAS and performs the interworking between 5GC and the legacy wireline access network.\n-\t5G-RG: end user device replacing the UE which supports 5G capabilities (NAS protocol and procedure, USRP, IMSI, ATSSS) and extension of wireline access layer specific functionalities defined by Broadband forum and CableLabs. The 5G-RG may also support UE capability when connects via 3GPP Access.\n-\tFN-RG: end user device replacing the UE which does not support 5G capabilities.\n-\tGlobal Line Identifier (GLI): in case of wireline access based on BBF specifications this parameter uniquely identifies the line at which the 5G-RG in connected to within an operator domain.\n-\tGlobal Cable identifier (GCI): in case of wireline access based on CableLabs specification this parameter uniquely identifies the line at which the 5G-RG in connected to within an operator domain.\n-\tSUPI for FN-RG based on GCI and GLI.\n-\tAll procedures defined in TS 23.502 have been modified to introduce the new network elements. The procedures are focused mainly on the part of specification that required improvements and to point out the access network interaction involving the W-AGF, 5G-RG and FN-RG to allow the Broadband Forum and CableLabs to develop the specifications under their responsibility.\n-\tIPTV support: The specification TS 23.316 in clauses 4.9.1 and 7.7.1 defines the support of IPTV via the support of multicast over unicast PDU session by using IGMP/MLD message send by STB via 5G-RG on PDU session and managed by UPF for adding the requiring 5G-RG to a multicast group and replicating the traffic received on N6 interface to the PDU session. The SMF is improved to control the support of IPTV by the UPF acting as PSA using PDR, FAR, QER, URR. This includes control of which IGMP and MLD requests the UPF is to accept or to deny.\n-\tQoS: the QoS model for wireline network is based on a subscription maximum aggregate bitrate including both GBR and Non-GBR traffic, hence the new parameter RG Total Maximum Bit Rate (RG-TMBR) has been defined. The RG-TMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows of a RG. The RG-TMBR is a parameter provided to the W-AGF by the AMF based on the value of the Subscribed RG-TMBR retrieved from UDM. The QoS control on wireline access network (i.e scheduling, rate limiting and traffic class management) is based on the line characteristic included in user subscription, for example different priority of service, different traffic class support by line of the single user, etc, for such reason the new parameter RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics (RG-LWAC) has been introduced. The format and content of RG LWAC is specified by BBF and it is transparently provided by UDM to AMF which may provide to the W-AGF at the time of the RG registration\n-\tmobility restriction based on GLI and GCI\n-\tsupport of BBF interaction with the Access Configuration System (ACS) to support the provisioning of configuration and remote management of 5G-RG as described in BBF TR-069 [12] or in BBF TR-369 [13].\nThe non-roaming architecture for 5G Core Network for 5G-RG with Wireline 5G Access network and NG RAN, as depicted in Figure 1, illustrates the seamless integration of wired and wireless technologies in a 5G network. This architecture enables seamless roaming between wired and wireless networks, ensuring high-speed data transmission and efficient network utilization. The figure highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing functions, which enable the efficient allocation of resources and the provision of differentiated services to users.\nFigure 1: Non- roaming architecture for 5G Core Network for 5G-RG with Wireline 5G Access network and NG RAN\nThe non-roaming architecture for 5G Core Network for FN-RG with Wireline 5G Access network and NG RAN, as depicted in Figure 2, illustrates the network's design principles. It emphasizes the use of wireline 5G access network and NG RAN to provide a seamless roaming experience for users. The architecture includes non-roaming features such as network slicing, virtualized radio access network (VRAN), and network slicing, which enable efficient resource allocation and improved network performance.\nFigure 2: Non- roaming architecture for 5G Core Network for FN-RG with Wireline 5G Access network and NG RAN\nSupport of Trusted Access network\nThe support of Trusted Network addresses the scenario where the Non-3GPP access network has a tighter relationship with 5GC in respect the untrusted scenario. However how the network is considered Trusted or Untrusted is not in the scope of this WID. The architecture for non-roaming is shown in figure 3, where the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network (TNAN) is the access node performing the termination of N2 and N3 reference point, termination of access network interface, relay of N1 to/from the UE. From 3GPP point of view the TNAN network is composed by the TNGF and the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP) which are interconnected via the reference point Ta. However the detailed definition of TNAN and of Ta is beyond the WID scope. The reference point between the UE and the TNG, the NWt, is specified leveraging the IKEv2 defined for Untrusted. The main difference in contrast to Untrusted is in registration procedure, where it is assumed that EAP-5G can be carried between UE and TNAP directly on access layers, such on IEEE 802.11x and between TNAP and TNGF via Ta and not as part of IKEv2 establishment. From other the point of view of other procedures, such as session management, the same procedure specified for Untrusted Non-3GPP access network can be used with basically the TNGF replacing the N3IWF, and modification that IKEv2 Child SA establishment is requested by TNGF and not by UE side.\nWithin the context of Trusted Non-3GP network, also the scenario of devices not supporting NAS connected via WLAN is specified. The role of TNGF is replaced the Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF) with the main difference that TWIF terminates the N1 NAS interface and it play the role of UE in respect the 5GC.\nThe specification is addressed in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503 [4]\nThe non-roaming architecture for 5G Core Network, depicted in Figure 3, illustrates the multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network, showcasing how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.

The multi-access PDU Connectivity Service is realized by establishing a Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session, i.e. a PDU Session that may have user-plane resources on two access networks, as shown on the figure below, extracted from TR 23.793 [1].\nThe figure depicts a multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network, illustrating how signals reflect off buildings and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 1: MA PDU session\nThese following procedures are defined in the context of this Feature:\n-\tAccess Traffic Steering: it selects an access network for a new data flow and transfers the traffic of this data flow over the selected access network. Access traffic steering is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.\n-\tAccess Traffic Switching: it moves all traffic of an ongoing data flow from one access network to another access network in a way that maintains the continuity of the data flow. Access traffic switching is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.\n-\tAccess Traffic Splitting: it splits the traffic of a data flow across multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is applied to a data flow, some traffic of the data flow is transferred via one access and some other traffic of the same data flow is transferred via another access. Access traffic splitting is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.\nKey concepts of ATSSS supported in Release 16 include the following:\n-\tMulti-access PDU Session is a PDU Session that provides a PDU connectivity service, which can use one access network at a time, or simultaneously one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network and two independent N3/N9 tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN.\n-\tAfter the establishment of a MA PDU Session:\n-\tWhen there are user-plane resources on both access networks:\n-\tThe UE applies network-provided policy (i.e. ATSSS rules derived by UE’s serving SMF based on ATSSS policy from serving PCF) and considers local conditions (such as network interface availability, signal loss conditions, user preferences, etc.) for deciding how to distribute the uplink traffic across the two access networks.\n-\tSimilarly, the UPF anchor of the MA PDU Session applies network-provided policy (i.e. N4 rules derived by UE’s serving SMF based on ATSSS policy from serving PCF) and the feedback information received from the UE via the user-plane (such as access network Unavailability or Availability), the UPF then decides how to distribute the downlink traffic across the two N3/N9 tunnels and two access networks.\n-\tWhen there are user-plane resources on only one access network, the UE applies the ATSSS rules and considers local conditions for triggering the establishment or activation of the user plane resources over another access.\n-\tThe type of a MA PDU Session may be one of the following types: i.e. IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, and Ethernet. The Unstructured type is not supported in Release 16.\n-\tThe ATSSS feature can be supported over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, including untrusted and trusted non-3GPP access networks, wireline 5G access networks, etc., as long as a MA PDU Session can be established over the given type of access network\n-\tTwo ATSSS steering functionalities are supported:\n-\tMPTCP functionality, for TCP traffic, with MPTCP proxy in UPF, by using the MPTCP protocol over the 3GPP and/or the non-3GPP user plane; and\n-\tATSSS-LL functionality for all types of traffic, including TCP traffic, UDP traffic, Ethernet traffic, etc. ATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory for MA PDU Session of type Ethernet.\nThe following presents the example of the ATSSS traffic steering functionality within the UE.\nFigure 2 illustrates the steering functionalities in an example UE model, demonstrating how the UE can adjust its steering angle to optimize signal reception and avoid collisions with other UEs.\nFigure 2: Steering functionalities in an example UE model\n-\tThe Performance Measurement Function (PMF) is supported by UPF and is specific for ATSSS-LL functionality, if enabled. In Release 16, PMF supports two types of measurements between UE and UPF to assist access selection and they are:\n-\tUE and UPF make RTT measurements per access when the \"Smallest Delay\" steering mode is used; and\n-\tUE reports access availability/unavailability to UPF\nThe following presents the protocol stacks of the PMF for the user plane measurements over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses respectively.\n\nThe figure depicts a protocol stack for 3GPP access and an MA PDU Session with type IP, illustrating the measurements related to the UE/UPF.\nFigure 3: UE/UPF measurements related protocol stack for 3GPP access and for an MA PDU Session with type IP\nIn the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack over 3GPP access is that same as the one in the above figure, but the PMF protocol operates on top of Ethernet, instead of UDP/IP.\nThe figure depicts a protocol stack for non-3GPP access and an MA PDU Session with type IP, illustrating the measurements related to UE/UPF and the associated protocol stack.\nFigure 4: UE/UPF measurements related protocol stack for non-3GPP access and for an MA PDU Session with type IP\nIn the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack over non-3GPP access is that same as the one in the above figure, but the PMF protocol operates on top of Ethernet, instead of UDP/IP.\n-\tAn ATSSS-capable UE may decide to request a MA PDU Session based on the provisioned URSP rules. In particular, the UE should request a MA PDU Session when the UE applies a URSP rule, which triggers the UE to establish a new PDU Session and the Access Type Preference component of the URSP rule indicates \"Multi-Access\".\n-\tThe 5G QoS model for the Single-Access PDU Session is also applied to the MA PDU Session, i.e. the QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the MA PDU Session. One difference compared to the Single-Access PDU Session is that in a MA PDU Session there can be separate user-plane tunnels between the AN and the PSA, each one associated with a different access. The SMF shall provide the same QFI in 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses so that the same QoS is supported in both accesses. Non GBR QoS Flow can be distributed over 3GPP access and non 3GPP access, but GBR QoS Flow is transferred over single access.\n-\tATSSS is currently not supported when moving to EPC from 5GC, except for the specific case with wireline access integrated to EPC/5GC with 5G-RG; ATSSS with one User Plane leg in E-UTRA/EPC and one User Plane leg in wireline/5GC is supported.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTR 23.793: \"Study on ATSSS\".\n[2]\tTS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n[3]\tTS 23.502: \"Procedures for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n[4]\tTS 23.503: \"Policy and Charging Control Framework for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n",

Figure 1 shows the case where no specific installation is deployed to handle high-speed trains, i.e. UEs in the train use the \"standard\" LTE eNBs. Alternatively, figure 2 shows the case where Single Frequency Network (SFN) are deployed. SFNs use so-called \"Remote Radio Heads\" (RRH), which are dedicated antennas deployed along the train track. In this case, the baseband unit (BBU) is connected to the RRH, e.g. using fiber.\nThe figure depicts a non-single frequency network (SFN) scenario, highlighting the high-speed transmission capabilities of the network. The SFN network utilizes multiple frequency bands to support high-speed data transmission, with the use of frequency hopping and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques. This allows for efficient use of the available spectrum and enables the transmission of high-speed data at high rates. The figure also illustrates the use of optical fibers and optical line terminals (OLTs) to facilitate the transmission of data.\nFigure 1. Non-Single Frequency Network (SFN) high speed scenario\n\nThe figure depicts a high-speed scenario of a fiber-optic network, showcasing the various components and their interconnections. The SFN (Single Fiber Network) is highlighted, with key components such as the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of redundancy and failover mechanisms.\nFigure 2.

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by SyncTechno Inc. in SP-200344.\nThe MARCOM feature introduces service requirements to enable maritime communication services to be supported over 3GPP system in TS 22.119 [1]. With the MARCOM feature, the work on maritime communication services is officially included in the scope of 3GPP standardization so 3GPP enabling technologies can be applicable to for maritime usage from 3GPP Release 16 onwards.\nThe first 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 22.119 [1] covering service requirements (Stage 1) is specified for the support of maritime communication (MARCOM) over 3GPP systems.\nThe maritime domain, one of the 5G vertical domains in 3GPP, is moving forward with the digitalisation and mobilisation of commercial as well as safety fields. Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully support the performances required by the maritime domain. The maritime radio environment was not originally considered by 3GPP when the technical specifications and solutions were standardised for LTE and 5G.\nHowever, most of the legacy mobile services and IoT services based on capabilities of EPS and 5GS specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to maritime usage for the support of mobile broadband services, and for the support of IoT services or machine-type communication services in a vessel at sea.\nIn addition, there are service scenarios and requirements specified in 3GPP specifications based on requirements of other related vertical domains (e.g. public safety domain, automotive domain, factory automation domain, and satellite industrial domain). Some requirements derived by service scenarios from these related vertical domains are applicable to the maritime domain. Thus, it is beneficial to use 3GPP enabling technologies developed to satisfy those requirements for the maritime domain in terms of the economy of scale.\nFor example, satellite access is one of the 3GPP radio access networks supported over the 5G system, so it is possible to provide seamless maritime mobile services by integrating multiple access technologies including satellite access depending on the service scenarios. In addition, Vertical LAN that can replace Ethernet-based access are applicable to indoor maritime mobile services inside a vessel.\nMC Services specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to commercial and maritime safety fields. Some similarities exist between the public safety domain and the maritime domain in terms of service scenarios that are essentially the same. For example, in some situations, mobile communication services are supported in spite of disconnected networks, i.e. off-network mode, or under isolated conditions.\nHowever, the maritime domain also has specific situations that do not happen in other vertical domains or in the legacy ICT industrial domain. New 3GPP enabling technologies dedicated to the maritime domain can be used to address such specific situations based on requirements derived from maritime use cases. Other vertical domains may benefit from such new 3GPP enabling technologies that consider maritime domain scenarios and may need more robust technologies or solutions than those that currently exist for those vertical domains.\nThe stage 1 requirements in TS 22.119 [1] are specific to maritime usage over 3GPP system for commercial as well as safety purposes. The stage 1 requirements derived from specific maritime usage but also related to MCX Services are specified in 3GPP technical specifications dedicated to MCX Services [2] [3] [4] [5].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 22.119, Maritime communication services over 3GPP system\n[2] TS 22.179, Mission Critical Push to Talk (MCPTT); Stage 1\n[3] TS 22.280, Mission Critical (MC) services common requirements\n[4] TS 22.281, Mission Critical (MC) video\n[5] TS 22.282, Mission Critical (MC) data\n",

The recent growth in the number of IoT devices - not used by human users – also highlights the need for an alternative to text based Warning Notifications.

Similar to user service authorization for the other MC services, an appropriately scoped access token is obtained from the Identity Management server which permits only authorized users to access the MC location service.\nMCData payload protection is enhanced to support separate algorithm types for the MCData payload field and the signalling parameters field, Data signalling payload field and end to end security parameters fields. This allows the architecture to meet varying security needs of the mission critical operator for both on and off network MCData operational scenarios.\nSecurity for interconnection now combines the MC gateway, Interconnection Signalling (IS) proxy and HTTP proxy to provide topology hiding, HTTP protection and signalling protection for inter-domain MCPTT, MCData and MCVideo communications between two disparate mission critical systems for a complete interconnection security solution.\nThe security foundation for dynamic rekeying of 3GPP interworking mission critical users across the IWF from a Land Mobile Radio system is further enhanced to support pre-provisioning of interworking key management records. The KMS provides these records to the UE (i.e. mission critical user) during service authorization to establish the initial key material needed to support protection of interworking communications.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 33.180, Security of the mission critical service; (Release 16)\n",

The general architectural principle was to define a logical Interworking Function (IWF) (representing an LMR system) on a Mission Critical (MCPTT or MCData) server to allow a server – server based connection between the IWF and the MC system, and develop the procedures and functional flows for an IWF by basing them on those already identified for the corresponding server-server communication within the MC system.\nAn IWF is composed of two parts: the first is an interface to the relevant MC server: IWF-1 (based on a subset of the MCPTT reference points described in TS 23.379), IWF-2 (based on a subset of the MCData reference points described in TS 23.282) and IWF-3 between the IWF and the Group Management Server. The second part of the IWF is an interface to the LMR system based on reference points defined by the LMR system. This provides a generic architecture to interwork between LMR systems such as TETRA, P25 and DMR, as well as a framework for interworking with other non-MC systems – e.g. GSM-R. An illustration of this for MCData interworking is in Figure 1.\nThe figure depicts a simplified illustration of the interworking architecture for MCData SDS, showcasing the various components and their interconnections. The architecture includes a central server, which serves as the hub for data exchange and management. The server is connected to multiple data sources, such as MCData SDS, and to other components like MCData SDS-specific servers, data storage, and data processing units. The interworking architecture is designed to facilitate seamless data exchange and processing, ensuring efficient and reliable data delivery.\nFigure 1: Illustration of Interworking architecture for MCData SDS\nThe subsequent documentation approach in Stage 3 was to document the differences between existing relevant MCPTT / MCData functionality and the primitives & process needed for the same purpose in interworking.

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-201114.\nFor Release 16, the enhancements to the MCPTT service were contained in three work items: enh2MCPTT for stage 2 (SA6), Enhanced Mission Critical Push-to-talk architecture phase 2; enh2MCPTT-CT for stage 3 (CT1), CT aspects of enh2MCPTT; and MCXSec for stage 2 and 3 (SA3), Mission Critical Services Security Enhancements. The corresponding items which have been completed in Release 16 are described in the following clause.\nThese enhancements to the MCPTT service impact the following areas of the architecture and protocols: call control and media handling, configuration, and security.\nThe following features have been newly introduced or enhanced.\nGroup and user regrouping using preconfigured group\n-\tRegroup using a preconfigured group refers to the creation of a user or group regroup based on the configuration information associated with an existing group that is referred to as the preconfigured group. This type of regroup takes its entire configuration from the preconfigured group, including initial security information. Since all MCPTT clients participating in the regroup operation are already configured with the preconfigured group information, this allows immediate use of the regroup for a group call upon initiation of the regroup.\n-\tA regroup using a preconfigured group is initiated without the creation of a new group document in the group management server. The advantage of regroup using a preconfigured group is speed of setup of the regroup, especially when large numbers of users (e.g. hundreds) may be involved. Control of the regroup using a preconfigured group is contained in the MCPTT server (namely the controlling MCPTT function). Creation and removal of a regroup is initiated by an authorized MCPTT client. Removal of the regroup can also be initiated by the MCPTT server based on certain criteria.\n-\tA group regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT groups into a new MCPTT regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group.\n-\tA user regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT users into a new regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group.\n-\tThe MCPTT regroup group can be specified to be a broadcast or non-broadcast type according to the configuration of the MCPTT group specified in the regroup request.\n-\tThe broadcast type of regroup is used for one-way communication where only an authorized MCPTT user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup users are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members).\n-\tThe non-broadcast type is used for two-way communication where all regrouped users can transmit and receive (i.e. a normal group call).\nLocation enhancements for current talker and ambient listening\n-\tLocation of a current talker is a feature that allows the initiator of a group or private call transmission to share his current location via the media plane with every transmission (floor request that is granted). Based on privacy settings, the talker’s location is delivered to the other affiliated members of the group, or to the receiving user in the private call.\n-\tThe ambient listening call is a type of a private MCPTT call that only allows a \"listened to\" user to transmit media to a \"listening\" user such that there is no indication on the MCPTT UE of the \"listened to\" user about the call and the media transmission.\n-\tRemotely initiated ambient listening is initiated by the authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) who wants to listen to another user. In this case, the \"listened to\" user is the called party, and shall automatically accept the call without causing any indication about the call and transmit the media to the \"listening\" user.\n-\tLocally initiated ambient listening is initiated by an authorized user who wants another user to listen to the MCPTT UE communication. In this case, the \"listened to\" user is the calling party and shall automatically transmit the media to the \"listening\" user without causing any indication about the call processing and media transmission.\n-\tEnhancements have been made to more reliably deliver location via the media plane in the scenarios listed above.\nEnhancements for entering or existing a geographic area\n-\tGeographical affiliation and de-affiliation is a feature that allows an authorized MCPTT user to define a geographical area for the purposes of causing the target MCPTT client to affiliate to a group when within this geographic area. Upon leaving the geographic area the target MCPTT client is sent an indication to de-affiliate. The MCPTT system keeps track of the target MCPTT user’s location and sends an indication to the MCPTT client upon entering or exiting the geographic area.\n-\tGeographical sending of an emergency alert is a feature that allows an authorized MCPTT user to define a geographical area for the purposes of causing the target MCPTT client to send an emergency alert when within this geographic area. Upon leaving the geographic area the target MCPTT client sends an emergency alert cancel. The MCPTT system keeps track of the MCPTT user’s location and sends an indication to the target MCPTT client upon entering or exiting the emergency alert area.\n-\tEnhancements have been made to the polygon and ellipsoid-arc definition of area to more reliably define location when entering or existing the geographic area of interest.\nSecure tunnel between key management server and key management client\n-\tThe establishment of a direct secure tunnel between the mission critical key management server and the mission critical key management client is required. Such a direct TLS tunnel needs to be an option for mission critical agencies that require stronger security.\n\nThe requirements, architecture, protocol, and security aspects related to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:\n1.\tThe MCPTT service requirements are specified in TS 22.179 and TS 22.280;\n2.\tThe MCPTT service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.379 and TS 23.280;\n3.\tThe security aspects of the MCPTT service are specified in TS 33.180;\n4.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.379 and TS 24.380 respectively;\n5.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for group configuration, identity management, and general configuration are specified in TS 24.481, TS 24.482, TS 24.483, and TS 24.484 respectively;\n6.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for codecs and media handling are specified in TS 26.179;\n7.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for policy and charging control are specified in TS 29.213 and TS 29.214;\n8.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for data management related to MC service user profile are specified in TS 29.283;\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 22.179 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE; Stage 1\n[2] TS 22.280 Mission Critical Services Common Requirements (MCCoRe); Stage 1\n[3] TS 23.379 Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT); Stage 2\n[4] TS 23.280 Common functional architecture to support mission critical services; Stage 2\n[5] TS 24.379 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) call control; Protocol specification\n[6] TS 24.380 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) media plane control; Protocol specification\n[7] TS 24.481 Mission Critical Services (MCS) group management; Protocol specification\n[8] TS 24.482 Mission Critical Services (MCS) identity management; Protocol specification\n[9] TS 24.483 Mission Critical Services (MCS) Management Object (MO)\n[10] TS 24.484 Mission Critical Services (MCS) configuration management; Protocol specification\n[11] TS 26.179 Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT); Codecs and media handling\n[12] TS 29.213 Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and Quality of Service (QoS) parameter mapping\n[13] TS 29.214: Policy and Charging Control over Rx reference point\n[14] TS 29.283: Diameter data management applications\n[15] TS 33.180: Security of the mission critical service.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-190865.\nThe Coverage and Handoff Enhancements for Multimedia (CHEM) feature enables the network to delay or reduce handoffs of a Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS ( MTSI) terminal by providing the eNB/gNB additional information about the robustness to packet losses of the negotiated media configurations. The eNB/gNB can set handoff thresholds that allow the MTSI terminal to remain on the current sector, cell, access technology, or domain (packet-switched vs. circuit-switched) and avoid a handoff even when the MTSI terminal experiences higher packet loss on the traffic channel as the media configuration robustness will help mitigate the effects of the additional packet losses.\nThe feature is structured with a baseline core functionality and some optional enhancements as illustrated in Figure 1. The optional enhancements can be independently used with the core CHEM feature and each other. TR 26.959 [1] has also been updated to explain the operation and interaction of these options and the core feature.\nThe figure depicts the core function and optional enhancements of the CHEM feature, which is a reference to clauses in TS 26.114 [6]. The figure illustrates the various components and their functions, including the core function, which is responsible for the overall operation of the system, and the optional enhancements, which provide additional features or functionalities to enhance the performance of the system.\nFigure 1: Core function and optional enhancements of the CHEM feature \n(references are to clauses in TS 26.114 [6]).\nThe core CHEM functionality specified in clauses W.1 and W.2 of TS 26.114 [2] introduces the ‘PLR_adapt’ SDP attribute that is used to negotiate the CHEM feature between the MTSI clients. MNOs choosing not to enable the feature can remove the attribute in the SDP negotiation. The attribute is also used by the PCRF/PCF to determine whether it can expect the MTSI clients to adapt to the most robust configurations that have been negotiated without relying in application layer redundancy. The PCRF/PCF uses this information to determine the appropriate PLR thresholds, i.e., choosing the PLR of the most robust mode when ‘PLR_adapt’ is negotiated, and communicate the PLR thresholds to the eNB/gNB.\nAn optional enhancement specified in clause W.4 of TS 26.114 [2] enables the MTSI clients to indicate the maximum tolerable end-to-end PLRs for particular codec configurations and then negotiate how this end-to-end PLR can be budgeted across their respective uplinks and downlinks. Indicating maximum tolerable end-to-end PLR thresholds can be useful to account for differing client implementations of features, e.g., such as the de-jitter buffer and Packet-Loss-Concealment (PLC) in the media receiver, which can affect the maximum tolerable PLR for achieving a certain Quality of Experience (QoE). This enhancement uses the defined ‘MAX-e2e-PLR’ attribute and associated parameters to perform the necessary indication and negotiation. The PCRF/PCF uses the ‘MAX-e2e-PLR’ attribute information in the SDP answer to determine and communicate the appropriate PLR thresholds to the eNB/gNB.\nAnother optional enhancement for speech media specified in clause W.3 of TS 26.114 [2] is to support use of application layer redundancy to improve media robustness that, when used with the CHEM feature, can delay or avoid handing off an MTSI terminal. The optional ‘ALR’ parameter for the ‘PLR_adapt’ attribute has been specified to enable this option and allows the MTSI clients to use newly specified in-band RTP CMR codepoints to request application layer redundancy without having to use RTCP-APP messages. The PCRF/PCF uses the presence of the ‘PLR_adapt: ALR’ attribute and parameter in the SDP answer to determine the appropriate PLR thresholds based on the maximum tolerable PLRs of the codec configurations (among those that both use, and do not use, application layer redundancy), then communicates this to the eNB/gNB.\nAn Annex of TS 26.114 [2] provides example PLR values that can be used for different speech codecs and their configurations. The annex also provides SDP examples for using the specified SDP attributes and parameters.\nReferences\n[1] TR 26.959 “Study on enhanced Voice over LTE (VoLTE) performance”\n[2] TS 26.114 “IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS); Multimedia telephony; Media handling and interaction”\nCRs related to this Feature: Select \"TSG Status = approved\" in:\n\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the inputs provided by China Unicom in SP-200129 for global aspects and in RP-200152 for the radio aspects.\nThe work item of 5G_SRVCC introduced a mechanism to support single radio voice call continuity (SRVCC) from 5GS to UTRAN for the following scenarios:\n-\tOperators with both 5G Voice over IMS and LTE enabled, but no VoLTE.\n-\tOperators with no LTE (nor VoLTE).\n-\tOperators with both 5G Voice over IMS and VoLTE enabled, but the voice service continuity may not be guaranteed if the VoLTE coverage provided by the operators is not (ideal) complete, i.e. there are some “holes” of VoLTE coverage.\nThis work item implemented the conclusion of the study for single radio voice continuity from 5GS to 3G (FS_5G-SRVCC) which is specified in TR 23.756[4]. The main enhancements introduced by this work item are specified in TS 23.216[3].\nThe architecture of 5G-SRVCC is illustrated in Figure 2-1. A simplified MME function (MME_SRVCC) was introduced to facilitate session transfer (SRVCC) of the voice component to the CS domain. The support of N26 interface and Sv interface is required for the MME_SRVCC.\nThe 5G-SRVCC (Serving Radio Virtual Channel) architecture, as depicted in Figure 1, is a key component of 5G networks. It enables efficient resource allocation and efficient use of radio resources, particularly in scenarios where the number of users is high. The architecture consists of a set of virtual radio channels, each serving a specific user, and a set of virtual radio access network (VRAN) nodes that connect to these virtual channels. This architecture is designed to support high-speed data transmission and efficient resource utilization, making it an essential component of 5G networks.\nFigure 1: 5G-SRVCC architecture\nThe 5G-SRVCC mechanism defined by this work item is an indirect SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN. When an UE moves out of the coverage of NG-RAN while a 5G voice session over IMS (either a normal voice session or an emergency session) is ongoing, a PS to CS handover procedure between 5GS and 3G CS is triggered by the NG-RAN. The 5G-SRVCC procedure including two main parts:\n-\t5GS to EPS handover using N26 procedure triggered by the NG-RAN.\n-\tPS-CS handover procedure initiated by the selected MME_SRVCC.\nNo E-UTRAN involved during the whole process. All the PDU sessions is released by the request of AMF at the end of the 5G-SRVCC procedure.\nReferences for global part\n[1] SP-180897, Single radio voice continuity from 5GS to 3G.\n[2] CP-193014, CT aspect of 5G_SRVCC.\n[3] TS 23.216, Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC); Stage 2.\n[4] TR 23.756, Study for single radio voice continuity from 5G to 3G.\n\nRadio part\nIn Rel-16, the WI “Single Radio Voice Call Continuity from 5G to 3G” was approved (latest WID in RP-200151). This work item aims to specify the support of SRVCC from 5GS to UTRAN in RAN. More specifically, the main objectives are as follows:\n-\tInter-RAT measurement to support voice service continuity from 5GS to UTRAN [RAN2, RAN1].\n-\tSpecify that the NG-RAN and UE in NR RRC connected mode support the UTRAN cell measurement procedure, e.g. measurement configuration of target UTRAN cells, and the measurement performing and reporting by UE.\n-\tIndirect Inter-RAT handover procedure to support voice service continuity from 5GS to UTRAN [RAN2, RAN3].\n-\tSpecify the procedures of SRVCC (including emergency call) in RAN, which includes handover preparation between gNB and AMF, gNB and UE, and Handover execution between UE to RNS etc.\n-\tSignalling of source RAT to target RAT at incoming SRVCC [RAN3].\n-\tUE capability reporting for supporting SRVCC [RAN2, RAN3].\n-\tSpecify the transfer of UE capability information between UE, NG-RAN and AMF.\n-\tRRM requirements to support voice service continuity from 5GS to UTRAN [RAN4].\n-\tRequirements of NR handover to UMTS.\n-\tRequirements of NR- UMTS inter-RAT measurements.\nThe key functionalities are:\n-\tSupport of the UTRAN cell measurement procedure for NR node and UE in NR RRC connected mode. A new measurement object for UTRA is defined to include only UTRA-FDD. -\tThe UE is only required to measurement and report the listed cells. Periodic and event triggered (event B1/B2) reporting for UTRA measurement are both supported. The same measurement gap configuration for UTRA is reused in measurement in NR as in LTE.\n-\tSupport of inter-RAT handover procedure of SRVCC. MobilityFromNRCommand message is reused for SRVCC from NR to UTRAN. SRVCC to UTRAN is also supported for UEs configured with NR-DC and NE-DC, network can trigger SRVCC to UTRAN procedure directly irrespective of the whether the bearer for the voice call is anchored in SN or MN. When and how to perform the return procedure from UTRAN to NR after the UE completes the voice service depends on UE implementation.\n-\tSupport of Signalling of source RAT to target RAT at incoming SRVCC. Add 5G-SRVCC possible into Initial Context Setup Request, HO Request, Path Switch Request Ack. Clarify the source to target transparent container is source RNC to target RNC Transparent Container in 5G-SRVCC. Clarify the target to source transparent container is Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container in 5G-SRVCC.\n-\tSupport of UE capability reporting for supporting SRVCC, including SRVCC handover capability with FR1/FR2 and TDD/FDD split, and UTRA-FDD band list is also reported.\n-\tRRM Requirements have also been specified, including measurement gap applicability requirement for SRVCC, Measurement capability, CSSF, UMTS inter-RAT measurement requirements and handover requirements for SRVCC.\nReferences for the radio part\n[1]\tR2-2000325\tIntroduction of SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tEricsson, ZTE\n[2]\tR2-2000335\tIntroduction of SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tEricsson\n[3]\tR2-2000542\tIntroduction of SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tHuawei, HiSilicon, China Unicom\n[4]\tR2-2000651\tIntroduction of SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tChina Unicom, Huawei, HiSilicon\n[5]\tR3-194169\tSupport SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tEricsson\n[6]\tR3-194171\tSupport SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tEricsson\n[7]\tR3-200071\tSupport SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tEricsson\n[8]\tR3-200073\tSupport SRVCC from 5G to 3G\tHuawei, China Unicom, Ericsson, Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell, ZTE, Qualcomm Incorporated\n\nOverall References, for both the radio and the general parts\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n",

Implementations can be conformance-tested using “bit-exact” methods that have been specified already when the EVS codec was first standardized. These methods are suitable for fixed-point implementations but their applicability is limited for floating-point implementations. EVS_FCNBE provides methods which enable conformance testing also for “non bit-exact” floating-point implementations.\nDuring Rel-15, the FS_EVS_FCNBE study item investigated tools, conformance process, and criteria for EVS floating-point non bit-exact conformance, and documented in TR 26.843 [1] several recommendations. Based on the agreed conclusions and recommendations of TR 26.843, the EVS_FCNBE work item conducted normative work on TS 26.444 to introduce the non bit-exact conformance process and criteria in the CR 26.444-0027.\nThe conformance process uses three specific tests:\n-\tDecoder test comparing the implementation decoder with TS 26.443 decoder.\n-\tEncoder test comparing the implementation encoder with TS 26.443 encoder.\n-\tMOS-LQO verification comparing the coder implementation with TS 26.442 coder.\nThese three tests allow to compare the implementation with the reference floating point code in TS 26.443, and interoperability with the fixed-point code in TS 26.442. All three tests shall pass for the implementation to be declared conformant.\nThe decoder test relies on a set of signal-based metrics (RMS, SNR, and Spectral Distortion). The encoder test uses a loudness metric. The MOS-LQO test uses a set of metrics using objective quality measurements.\nTo define a range of acceptable variation for the various metrics, a set of 10 reference implementations (based on mainstream compilers and platforms) has been used to define reference values.\nAnnex B of CR 26.444-0027 provides details on the tests as well as the conformance process and criteria.\nThe results obtained during the course of the normative work indicate that this conformance process correctly discriminates implementations with functional code changes and aggressive compiler optimization.\nReferences\n[1] TR 26.843 “Study on non-bit-exact conformance criteria and tools for floating-point EVS codec”\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in\n\n",

                            "text_content": "During Rel-15, the FS_5G_MEDIA_MTSI study item investigated media handling aspects of conversational services in 5G, and documented in TR 26.919 several recommendations on Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI) in TS 26.114 around media rate adaptation, NR access and profiles for 5G deployments.\nBased on the agreed conclusions and recommendations of TR 26.919, 5G_MEDIA_MTSI_ext conducted normative work, mostly on TS 26.114, to introduce the following functionality:\n-\tFor media rate adaptation, the CR 26.114-0436 [2] recommended additional speech and video adaptation capabilities based on access network bitrate recommendation (ANBR) (a.k.a. RAN-assisted codec adaptation) support. In particular, this CR makes ANBR-triggered speech adaptation a recommended feature in MTSI clients for Rel-16 and beyond. Moreover, it provides additional recommendations for MTSI receivers to generate CMR/RTCP-APP (for speech) and TMMBR (for video) and for MTSI senders to generate TMMBN (for video) messages in response to receiving ANBR information.\n- On profiles for 5G deployments, the CR 26.114-0438 [3] defined the constrained MTSI client terminal to address codec requirements for IMS/VoLTE/ViLTE/VoNR conversational services in the low end 5G verticals such as wearables and IoT. In particular, this CR relaxed the Rel-15 speech and video codec requirements for these constrained terminals, e.g., resulting in optional support for super-wideband for speech and HEVC for video, exceptionally only for this special category of constrained terminals (support for SWB for speech and HEVC for video is otherwise mandatory for Rel-15 and beyond).\n-\tTo realize further RAN-assisted codec adaptation enhancements, the CR 26.114-0461 [4] and CR 26.114-0480 [5] introduced ANBR capability signalling into MTSI. In particular, the CRs standardized a new SDP attribute ‘anbr’ to enable end-to-end signaling and coordination of ANBR capabilities (both at the radio level and application level) across the UEs, Access Networks, and PCRF/PCF. According to the adopted solution, the MTSI client in terminal supporting \"anbr\" signals this attribute in the SDP only if: (i) MTSI client in terminal supports ANBR at the application layer, including the use of ANBR with dynamic bitrate adaptation. (ii) The UE of the MTSI client in terminal is capable of RAN-assisted codec adaptation at the radio layer, including the ability to query and receive ANBR information (both downlink and uplink ANBR) from its eNB/gNB. (iii) The P-CSCF has indicated to the UE of the MTSI client in terminal its ability to handle this SDP attribute through the respective SIP registration procedures specified in TS 24.229 via the corresponding feature capability indicator g.3gpp.anbr.\n-\tThe low and ultra-low latency of 5G will enable new types of use cases with real-time communication and interaction needs where it will be desirable to not only have voice, text and video calling connectivity but also delivery of any kind of data stream and real-time interaction within the same IMS multimedia session. This is already enabled as part of the IMS-based Tele-Presence service in TS 26.223 toward the exchange of CLUE messages and has been introduced to MTSI in TS 26.114 as part of this work item to provide a generic and flexible data channel support for IMS-based multimedia telephony. In particular, CR 26.114-0496 [6] adds necessary UNI procedures to support MTSI data channel based on WebRTC data channel and web scripting techniques as a new MTSI media. This provides a generic and flexible data channel for MTSI in TS 26.114 that allows both UE-to-UE and UE-to-network generic data transfers, in addition to and in parallel with the existing MTSI media such as audio, video, and text. Accordingly, TS 26.223 was also updated via CR 26.223-0013 [7] to align the data channel support of a Tele-Presence (TP) UE with that specified in MTSI.\nReferences\n[1] Tdoc SP-180663, New WID on “Media Handling Extensions for 5G Conversational Services” (5G_MEDIA_MTSI_ext)\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in\nThis includes:\n[2] Tdoc SP-180975, CR 26.114-0436, “Recommendations on Media Rate Adaptation”\n[3] Tdoc SP-180975, CR 26.114-0438, “MTSI Client Profiles”\n[4] Tdoc S4-190489, CR 26.114-0461, “Signaling of ANBR Capabilities”\n[5] Tdoc S4-190603, CR 26.114-0480, “Updates on ANBR Capability Signaling”\n[6] Tdoc S4-200266, CR 26.114-0496, “Addition of MTSI Data Channel Media”\n[7] Tdoc S4-200269, CR 26.223-0013, “Alignment with MTSI on IMS Data Channel Support”\n\n",

The related agreed CRs can be found in Tdocs S4-181176 (CR 26.114-0441) [2], S4-181452 (CR 26.114-0443) [3], S4-190167 (CR 26.114-0448) [4], S4-190497 (CR 26.114-0462) [5] and S4-190498 (CR 26.114-0463) [6].\nRAN delay budget reporting is specified in TS 36.331 for E-UTRA and TS 38.331 for NR. RAN delay budget reporting through the use of RRC signalling to eNB / gNB allows UEs to locally adjust air interface delay. Based on the reported delay budget information, a good coverage UE on the receiving end (i.e., the UE that contains the MTSI receiver) can reduce its air interface delay, e.g., by turning off CDRX or via other means. This additional delay budget can then be made available for the sending UE (i.e., the UE that contains the MTSI sender), and can be quite beneficial for the sending UE when it suffers from poor coverage. When the sending UE is in bad coverage, it would request the additional delay from its local eNB / gNB, and if granted, it would utilize the additional delay budget to improve the reliability of its uplink transmissions in order to reduce packet loss, e.g., via suitable repetition or retransmission mechanisms, and thereby improve end-to-end delay and quality performance.\nWhile RAN-level delay budget reporting as defined in TS 36.331 and TS 38.331 allows UEs (i.e., MTSI sender and MTSI receiver) to locally adjust air interface delay, such a mechanism does not provide coordination between the UEs on an end-to-end basis. To alleviate this issue, this work item defined a new RTCP feedback message type in clause 7.3.8 of TS 26.114 to realize the following capabilities on signalling of Delay Budget Information (DBI) across UEs as per CRs 26.114-0443 in Tdoc S4-181452, 26.114-0448 in Tdoc S4-190167 and 26.114-0462 in Tdoc S4-190497: (i) an MTSI receiver can indicate available delay budget to an MTSI sender, and (ii) an MTSI sender can explicitly request delay budget from an MTSI receiver. Such RTCP-based signaling of DBI can also be used by an MTSI receiver to indicate delay budget availability created via other means such as jitter buffer size adaptation. The recipient UE of the RTCP feedback message carrying DBI may then use this information in determining what delay budget adjustments it may request from its eNB / gNB over the RAN interface, e.g. by using RRC signalling based on UEAssistanceInformation as defined in TS 36.331 and TS 38.331.\nIn addition, the work item specified a few further media handling aspects of RAN delay budget reporting for MTSI in TS 26.114 to address the following:\n1.\tSDP-based exchange of RAN capabilities in regards to delay budget reporting, this is specified in clause 6.2.8 and Annex V.3 of TS 26.114 as per CR 26.114-0441 in Tdoc S4-181176 and CR 26.114-0463 in Tdoc S4-190498. Accordingly, an MTSI client supporting DBI can offer this capability in SDP for all media streams containing speech and/or video by including the a=rtcp-fb attribute with the DBI type under the relevant media line scope as expressed with the parameter 3gpp-delay-budget.\n2.\tRecommendations on when and how the UEs in an MTSI session should use RAN-based delay adjustment mechanisms in an end-to-end fashion also accounting other factors such as local radio conditions, various RAN capabilities and configurations, jitter buffer considerations, and UE battery constraints. These are provided as part of the informative signalling flows in Annex V of TS 26.114, as per CR 26.114-0443 in S4-181452.\n3.\tRecommendations on when and how the various kinds of end-to-end quality metrics and other relevant information in the MTSI client could be used to trigger RAN delay budget reporting. These are provided as part of the informative signalling flows in Annex V of TS 26.114, as per CR 26.114-0443 in S4-181452.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] Tdoc SP-180662, New WID on “Media Handling Aspects of RAN Delay Budget Reporting in MTSI” (E2E_DELAY)\n[2] Tdoc S4-181176, CR 26.114-0441, “Signaling of Delay Budget Information”\n[3] Tdoc S4-181452, CR 26.114-0443, “Recommendations on use of RAN Delay Budget Reporting in MTSI”\n[4] Tdoc S4-190167, CR 26.114-0448, “DBI Signaling Recommendations”\n[5] Tdoc S4-190497, CR 26.114-0462, “Additional DBI Signaling Recommendations”\n[6] Tdoc S4-190498, CR 26.114-0463, “SDP Examples on DBI Signaling”\n[7] TS 36.331: \"E-UTRA; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification\".\n[8] TS 38.331: \"NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol Specification\".\n\n",

Many 3GPP specs adopted H.263, used for the first mobile video deployments. However, more than 20 years later, this format became obsolete and as such was removed from Rel-16 onwards.\nIn 2012 (Rel-11), 3GPP already addressed to change the status of H.263 and MPEG-4 Video in several specifications, but did not fully remove the technology for all services. Some leftover H.263 related statements remained, as in TS 26.140. MPEG-4 Visual did not have any status in any spec, but many leftovers still.\n\"Retiring\" older codecs is needed due to the impact of codecs on hardware and/or softwareincluding area size, design and testing, and then on the cost. Supporting such codecs on 5G device would have reduced the available space for other, newer, codecs and technologies.

It addresses a wide variety of services and use cases, including (but not limited to) regulatory requirements in support of emergency calls and first responder operations, new services in multiple verticals covering for instance industry, logistics, eHealth and aerial.\nEmphasis has been put, among other, on improving accuracy, seamless positioning in the entire 5G coverage, flexibility, features to further enable and combine multiple positioning technologies RAT-dependent, RAT-independent such as GNSS and TBS). The work also covers energy efficiency of the positioning function, being key for many use cases such as, for instance, asset tracking.\nThe work item 5G_HYPOS provides the stage 1 specifications to enable enhanced and more accurate positioning in 5G systems. The positioning services and specifications aim multiple service levels involving different types of UE (e.g. UE for Location Based Services, asset tracking devices, machine-type UE, transportation, etc.), and which can refer to RAT-dependent positioning technologies, RAT-independent positioning technologies (e.g. GNSS, TBS), and/or a combination of several of those.\nFunctional requirements for positioning services are reported in chapter 6.27 of TS 22.261 [2]. They cover aspects such as configuration of the positioning service capabilities and features, for instance to allow the operators to manage the combination and hybridization of multiple positioning technologies or to report positioning related information to authorized third parties.\nKPI for positioning services are reported in chapter 7.3 of TS 22.261 [2]. Several KPIs, such as accuracy, availability, coverage (indoor, outdoor, 5G positioning service area or 5G enhanced positioning service area, etc.) are sorted in 7 Positioning Service Levels, with accuracy ranging from 10 meters for Service Level 1 down to 0.2 meters for Service Level 7. These Service Levels have been coordinated with the needs of industry automation use cases, as specified in TS 22.104 (Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains, [3]), to facilitate the work in subsequent working groups.\nFinally, as the work also identified the importance of trusted positioning information to support regulatory and commercial applications, some requirements relating to the integrity and protection of the positioning information and measurements have been introduced in chapter 8.7 of TS 22.261 [2].\nThe requirements have translated into work in subsequent working groups (SA2, SA3, RAN) and for RAN, in new specifications in: TS 38.215 (NR Physical Layer measurements, [4]), TS 38.305 (Stage 2 functional specification of UE positioning in NG-RAN, [5]), TS 37.355 (LTE Positioning Protocol, [6]), TS 38.455 (NR Positioning Protocol A, [7]) and TS 38.331 (UE radio transmission and reception, [8]) which defines evolution of RAT-dependent technologies for NR, as well as it introduces new features and capabilities in LPP to enable cm-level accuracy positioning with High-Accuracy GNSS (HAGNSS). These specifications address UE-based, UE-assisted methods, and broadcast of information / corrections using RRC System Information messages.\nThe performance targets for RAT-dependent techniques in Release 16 NR Positioning are matching the TS 22.261 Service Level 1 (<10m) positioning requirements in the case of outdoor users and the SL2 (<3m) requirements in the case of indoor users. High-accuracy GNSS, based on State Space Representation corrections (SSR), has been added to the list of positioning techniques supported by LPP and it is able to meet service levels captured in TS 22.261 for majority of outdoor users with its expected performance (<1m) .\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] Tdoc SP-180329, “New WID on 5G positioning services (5G_HYPOS)”\n[2] TS 22.261 Service requirements for the 5G system; Stage 1\n[3] TS 22.104 Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains; Stage 1\n[4] TS 38.215 “NR Physical Layer measurements”\n[5] TS 38.305 “Stage 2 functional specification of UE positioning in NG-RAN”\n[6] TS 37.355 “LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)”\n[7] TS 38.455 “NR Positioning Protocol A (NRPPa)”\n[8] TS 38.331 “UE radio transmission and reception”\n",

This completed normative work [2] is a continuation of the 3GPP Rel.16 study item on NR Positioning Support [3]. The main motivation behind this work is to support accurate UE positioning in NR technology by utilizing RAT-dependent and RAT-independent solutions.\nRAT-dependent positioning techniques\nIn the NR positioning WI 3GPP specified support for the following RAT-dependent positioning techniques (defined in TS 37.355):\n•\tDL TDOA – Downlink Time Difference of Arrival\n•\tDL AoD – Downlink Angle of Departure\n•\tUL TDOA – Uplink Time Difference of Arrival\n•\tUL AoA – Uplink Angle of Arrival (Azimuth and Zenith)\n•\tMulti-RTT – Multi Round Trip Time\n•\tNR E-CID – NR Enhanced Cell ID\nThese positioning methods may be supported in UE-based, UE-assisted/LMF-based, and NG-RAN node assisted versions.\nTable 1: Supported versions of UE positioning methods (defined in TS38.305)\n\nPhysical layer signals and measurements: In order to support RAT-dependent positioning solutions, the following new reference signals and new physical layer measurements were specified:\n•\tReference signals (defined in TS 38.211)\no\tDL Positioning Reference Signals (DL PRS)\no\tUL Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) for positioning\n•\tPhysical layer measurements (defined in TS 38.215)\no\tUE measurements\n- DL PRS-RSRP (downlink positioning reference signals - reference signal receiver power): Applied for DL AoD, DL TDOA, Multi-RTT\n- DL RSTD (downlink reference signal time difference): Applied for DL TDOA\n- UE Rx – Tx time difference: Applied for Multi-RTT\no\tNG-RAN (gNB) measurements\n- UL RTOA (uplink relative time of arrival): Applied for UL TDOA\n- UL SRS reference signal received power (UL SRS-RSRP): Applied for UL TDOA, UL AoA, Multi-RTT\n- gNB Rx – Tx time difference: Applied for Multi-RTT:\n- UL AoA (uplink angle of arrival): Applied for UL AoA and E-CID\nIn addition, the existing RRM measurements were reused for NR E-CID support: CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ.\nDownlink positioning reference signal (DL PRS): they are allocated and transmitted periodically with configurable periodicity and time offset with respect to SFN0. The DL PRS configuration is done per DL positioning frequency layer that defines multiple DL PRS resource sets associated with different transmission/reception points (TRPs) and characterized by the same DL PRS subcarrier spacing, transmission bandwidth, cyclic prefix length, DL PRS Point A and offset with respect to DL PRS Point A. DL PRS resource set may contain multiple DL PRS resources, where each DL PRS resource is associated with certain spatial transmission direction of DL PRS from a given TRP (beam) and characterized by configurable number of symbols, resource element pattern, initial comb-offset, offset in slots, symbols and DL PRS sequence ID.\nDL PRS is single port signal that can be configured as quasi-collocated with SSB index or other DL PRS resources. The configuration of DL PRS is provided as a part of UE assistance information. DL PRS transmissions can be muted according to configured bitmaps for each DL PRS resource set that control the DL PRS resource set transmission period or DL PRS resource repetition transmission within a DL PRS transmission period.\nUplink sounding reference signals for positioning: they are defined based on NR UL SRS with modified staggered RE pattern and disabled frequency hopping. The UL SRS for positioning are defined through configuration of UL SRS resource sets for positioning, where each set may contain multiple UL SRS resources for positioning. UL SRS resource for positioning is characterized by number of symbols, transmission bandwidth, RE pattern, time offset and may be associated with UE TX beam. UL SRS resources for positioning can be spatially related with SSB indexes or DL PRS resource index as well as reference signal for UL open loop power control towards serving and neighbor cells (defined for UL SRS for positioning).\nLMF may recommend the spatial relation and pathloss reference to the gNB for SRS configuration. LMF may also request activation and deactivation of non-periodic SRS transmission to the gNB.\nBroadcast of Assistance Data: this can be included in positioning System Information Blocks (posSIBs) which are carried in RRC System Information (SI) messages. The UE may request posSI by means of on-demand SI request in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and also request posSIBs by means of on-demand SI request in RRC_ CONNECTED.\nFor each assistance data element, a separate posSIB-type is defined. Each posSIB may be ciphered by the LMF using the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm (with counter mode), either with the same or different ciphering key.\nRAT independent positioning techniques: PPP and RTK, are already supported in Rel-15 LPP. In Rel-16, LPP is extended to support GNSS SSR (PPP-RTK support) based on the “Compact SSR” definitions specified for QZSS for both LTE and NR. Following additional information are added to be transferred from the LMF to UE:\n-\tSSR Phase Bias\n-\tSSR STEC Corrections\n-\tSSR Gridded Correction\n-\tSSR URA\n-\tSSR Correction Points\nPositioning network architecture: In the positioning architecture specified in TS 38.305 and TS 38.401, the LMF is connected to the NG-RAN node through the AMF. The NG-RAN node may control several TRPs. Both split (i.e. CU/DU) and non-split NG-RAN architectures are supported. The NRPPa and the F1AP protocols have been extended to support the positioning methods listed above.\nUE DL PRS processing requirements: For defined physical layer measurements DL-RSTD, DL PRS-RSRP and UE Rx-Tx time difference in Rel16, the requirements on the measurement time were defined. These requirements are applicable for the case when measurement gap is configured to UE. The UE processing capabilities specified in TS 37.355 are taken into account to derive total DL PRS measurement delay.\nMeasurement gaps: On top of legacy measurement gap patterns, the new measurement gap patterns with > 6ms measurement gap length (MGL) were introduced in Rel16 for NR positioning.\n\nThese two gap patterns can be requested by the UE and configured by the network only when the UE is configured via LPP with NR positioning measurements and can only be used during the corresponding positioning measurement period. The supported measurement gaps are applicable for DL PRS and NR/LTE RRM measurements i.e. new gaps are not shared between PRS and 2G/3G RRM measurements.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-190752, “New WID: NR Positioning Support”, Intel Corporation, Ericsson\n[2]\tRP-201835, “Status Report to TSG on NR Positioning Support”, Intel Corporation\n[3]\tTR 38. 855 “Study on NR positioning support” v16.0.0\n",

[1][2][3]\nThe actual identity provisioning service with creation, managing and authentication of identities is not specified by 3GPP, but the interworking of the 3GPP system with some external entity to authenticate the User Identity and to authorize the user for access to a specific network slice, in addition to the 3GPP network slice selection and authorization.\nRel. 15 Network slice selection (i.e. the procedure to select an AMF that supports the required Network Slices and establishing PDU Session(s) to the required Data network via the Network Slice instance(s) with its Control Plane and User Plane Network Functions) is based on the NSSAI, which consists of one or more S-NSSAIs.\nNow with the Rel. 16 feature, Subscription information allows the indication which S-NSSAIs are subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA). For those S-NSSAIs the AMF invokes an EAP-based Network Slice-Specific authentication procedure in which the AUSF exchanges AAA protocol messages with a potentially external AAA Server (AAA-S) via an optional AAA Proxy (AAA-P) to authenticate and authorize a UE for the network slice. Depending on the result of the procedure a UE is either authorized for a network slice, re-allocated to a different one or deregistered. A re-authentication and re-authorization procedure may be triggered by the AAA Server at any time. [2][3]\nSecurity aspects are specified in detail in [4], UE and network capabilities to support and perform NSSAA in [5], message flows for interworking to the AAA-S in [6], flags to indicate that a slice is subject to NSSAA are defined in [7] as well as [8] and the impact on the AUSF is captured in [9].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 22.101, Service aspects; Service principles\n[2] TS 23.501, System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\n[3] TS 23.502, Procedures for the 5G System (5GS)\n[4] TS 33.501, Security architecture and procedures for 5G System\n[5] TS 24.501, Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3\n[6] TS 29.561, 5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3\n[7] TS 29.503, 5G System; Unified Data Management Services; Stage 3\n[8] TS 29.505, 5G System; Usage of the Unified Data Repository services for Subscription Data; Stage 3\n[9] TS 29.509, 5G System; Authentication Server Services; Stage 3\n",

GSMA RILTE have been working with specifying multi-device solutions and asked 3GPP to create requirements for all their use cases to be specified. This work item specifies the user experience requirements for a consistent user experience when the user uses these services.\nFurthermore, the work also covers use cases where a user can allow another user (or possibly the same user) to use one or more of its identities. One example is for a user wishing to be able to use the work identity for the private phone. I.e. originated calls should show the work identity and terminating calls to the work identity should go to the private phone and include information that the work identity is called. Another example is to use a group identity, where employees can make calls on behalf of the group or firm and calls to the group are distributed to any member of the group.\nThe Multi-Device (MuD) service is an operator specific service which enables a user to use different UEs that are registered under the same public user identity. The UEs can be of different types (e.g. phone, tablet, wearable device, PC) and can support a communication log.\nThe Multi-Identity (MiD) service is an operator specific service which enables a user to use different identities. A served user can use a single UE to receive calls addressed to any of its identities and to make calls using any of its identities.\nThe MuD and MiD services can be used at the same time.\nThe Stage 1 requirements are document in chapter 4.6 in TS 22.173 [2].

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Wistron Telecom AB in SP-200125.\nThe objective of this work item is to address the following aspects:\n-\tEnhance the network slicing interworking support from EPC to 5GC, when UE moves from EPC to 5GC by selecting the proper target serving AMF as well as V-SMF. Note that, the 5GC may not be able to serve all the PDU sessions that the UE intends to move from EPC.\n-\tProvide the network slice based authentication and authorization that uses User Identities and Credentials different from the 3GPP SUPI and that takes place after the primary authentication.\nRelease 16 Network Slicing addresses two major limitations of Release 15 in 5GC:\n(1)\tEnhancement of interworking between EPC and 5GC when UE moves from EPC to 5GC, the target serving AMF may not be able to serve all the PDU sessions that the UE intends to move to the 5GC. More specifically, the following aspects needs to be addressed:\n-\tSelecting an AMF based on the slices associated to the active PDU connections that serve the UE in the EPC in Connected mode and during the Idle mode mobility\n-\tSelecting an appropriate serving V-SMF based on the slices associated to the active PDN connections that serve the UE in the EPC in Connected Mode\n(2) Support for Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA)\n-\tEnable the support for separate authentication and authorization per Network Slice. The trigger of NSSAA in the 5GC is based on UE subscription information from UDM and also operator’s policy. However, the UE shall indicate its support for NSSAA to its serving 5GC.\n-\tThe AMF performs the role of the EAP Authenticator and communicates with the AAA-S via the AUSF. The AUSF undertakes any AAA protocol interworking with the AAA protocol supported by the AAA-S.\nEnhancement of Interworking Between EPC and 5GC\nDuring the mobility from EPS to 5GS, in case of CM-IDLE state, the PGW-C+SMF sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF in Registration procedure. The AMF derives S-NSSAI values for the Serving PLMN and determines whether the current AMF is appropriate to serve the UE. If not, the AMF reallocation may need to be triggered. For each PDU Session the AMF determines whether the V-SMF need to be reselected based on the associated S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN. If the V-SMF need be reallocated, the AMF trigger the V-SMF reallocation.\nIn case of CM-CONNECTED state, during handover preparation phase the PGW-C+SMF sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF. Based on the received S-NSSAIs values, the target AMF derives the S-NSSAI values for the Serving PLMN, the target AMF reselects a final target AMF if necessary and forwards the handover request to the final target AMF. When the Handover procedure completes successfully, the UE proceeds with the Registration procedure. For each PDU Session based on the associated derived S-NSSAI values, if the V-SMF need be reallocated, the final target AMF triggers the V-SMF reallocation. The final target AMF sends the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN to V-SMF to update the SM context. The V-SMF updates NG RAN with the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN via N2 SM message.\nNetwork Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA)\nIn Release-16, based on UE’s 5GMM Core Network Capability and subscription information, the serving AMF will trigger Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN. If a UE does not support this feature but requests these S-NSSAIs that are subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, these S-NSSAIs will be rejected by the PLMN.\nIf a UE supports this feature and requests these S-NSSAIs, which are subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the UE shall leverage the corresponding credentials for these S-NSSAIs for the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization. As for how to these credentials in the UE are not specified.\nTo perform the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for an S-NSSAI, the AMF invokes an EAP- based Network Slice-Specific authorization procedure for the S-NSSAI.\nThis procedure can be invoked for a supporting UE by an AMF at any time, e.g. when:\na.\tThe UE registers with the AMF and one of the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which maps to an S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization; or\nb.\tThe Network Slice-Specific AAA Server triggers a UE re-authentication and re-authorization for an S-NSSAI; or\nc.\tThe AMF, based on operator policy or a subscription change, decides to initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure for a certain S-NSSAI which was previously authorized.\nBased on the outcome of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type will be updated accordingly.It is network policies to decide for which Access Type to be used if both Access Types are subject for the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization. However, if the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization fails for all S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF shall execute the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure with the appropriate rejection cause value for each Rejected S-NSSAI.\nAfter a successful or unsuccessful UE Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the UE context in the AMF shall retain the authentication and authorization status for the UE for the related specific S-NSSAI of the HPLMN while the UE remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN, so that the AMF is not required to execute a Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for a UE at every Periodic Registration Update or Mobility Registration procedure with the PLMN.\nA Network Slice-Specific AAA server may revoke the authorization or challenge the authentication and authorization of a UE at any time. When authorization is revoked for an S-NSSAI that is in the current Allowed NSSAI for an Access Type, the AMF shall provide a new Allowed NSSAI to the UE and trigger the release of all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI, for this Access Type.\nThe AMF provides the GPSI of the UE related to the S-NSSAI to the AAA Server to allow the AAA server to initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, or the Authorization revocation procedure, where the UE current AMF needs to be identified by the system, so the UE authorization status can be challenged or revoked.\nThe Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization requires that the UE Primary Authentication and Authorization of the SUPI has successfully completed. If the SUPI authorization is revoked, then also the Network Slice-Specific authorization is revoked.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n[2]\tTS 23.502: \"Procedures for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n",

The 3GPP management system provides multi-tenancy support, by associating different tenants with different sets of management capabilities. Every tenant may be authorized to access and consume those MnSs that the operator makes available to this tenant based on SLA.\nThe MnS consumer, acting on behalf of a tenant, may get the performance measurements of a network slice. Performance measurements specified in TS 28.552 can be split into sub-counters per S-NSSAI. 3GPP management system can use these sub-counters to distinguish performance measurements for different tenants, which might be required when performance measurements are exposed as part of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) specified in TS 28.530.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-200294.\nThis WI adds requirements to enable a 3GPP system to adequately support the variety of business role models for network slicing that are possible in a 5G system. The requirements address service exposure giving additional control to 3rd parties, impact of SLAs on network slice management, and non-public network access to MNO spectrum. Also addressed are security relationships between\na UE and a private slice,\na private slice and a network, and\na private slice and other slices of the same network.\nThe requirements are captured in TS 22.261 [1].\nThe requirements from the BRMNS WI provide the means to support new business role models in vertical markets introduced for supporting vertical markets. These role models extend the possible interactions between Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and 3rd parties who use the network and/or own/manage part of the network infrastructure. In particular, the introduction of network slicing allows new opportunities for 3rd parties to exercise additional control over the portions of the network, i.e., the network slice, supporting their network needs. Four key business relationship models were considered.\n-\tModel 3a: MNO provides the virtual/physical infrastructure and V/NFs; a 3rd party uses the functionality provided by the MNO,\n-\tModel 3b: MNO provides the virtual/physical infrastructure and V/NFs; a 3rd party manages some V/NFs via APIs exposed by the MNO,\n-\tModel 3c: MNO provides virtual/physical infrastructure; a 3rd party provides some of the V/NFs,\n-\tModel 3d: a 3rd party provides and manages some of the virtual/physical infrastructure and V/NFs.\nModels 3a and 3b are supported by the Rel-15 network slicing requirements, with some enhancements in the Rel-16 APIs and management functions to extend 3rd party access and control of capabilities provided by the MNO, and to do so in a secure manner. In these two models, the 3rd party has greater control over the network capabilities that support its service. However, this control is limited to what is allowed by the MNO through the provided APIs. The Rel-16 enhancements allow the 3rd party to monitor the activities of their UEs when using the network slice and to monitor resource usage within the network slice. These capabilities are added to support SLAs between the MNO and the 3rd party.\nAs an example of the additional monitoring functionality, a network slice supporting a local smart grid needs additional APIs to monitor activities of many sensors throughout the grid and receive network status information that can be used to detect and resolve any communications problems that arise within the grid. Figure 2-1 from TR 22.830 [2] illustrates the smart grid role models.\nIn this scenario, a power grid company is responsible for managing and maintaining the electrical grid, while a mobile network operator (MNO) is responsible for providing mobile network services to consumers. The figure depicts a role model scenario where the MNO is responsible for managing the grid's power supply, while the power grid company is responsible for managing the grid's electrical distribution. This scenario highlights the importance of collaboration between the two entities to ensure the smooth operation of the grid and the reliable delivery of mobile network services to consumers.\nFigure 2-1: role model scenario between MNO and power grid company\n\nModels 3c and 3d resulted in the addition of new functionality to support three new network management models.\nMNO manages all virtual/physical infrastructure and all V/NFs including 3rd party’s ones,\n3rd party manages its own virtual/physical infrastructure and/or its own V/NFs; MNO manages the others.\n3rd party manages virtual/physical infrastructure and/or V/NFs including its own virtual/physical infrastructure and/or V/NFs and some MNO’s virtual/physical infrastructure and/or V/NFs; MNO manages the others.\nFrom the 3rd party perspective, the management role models 2 and 3 support the 3rd party management function and provide extended management for the MNO to coordinate with the 3rd party management. The 3rd party may use suitable APIs provided by the MNO to directly manage the V/NFs as well as the infrastructure resources so that it can properly handle when their business requirements are changed.\nFor models 3c and 3d, additional consideration is needed on the mechanisms to provide the isolation and interfaces that give the 3rd party the appropriate level of control while securing the PLMN. Specifically, where the 3rd party provides V/NFs or provides and manages some of the virtual/physical infrastructure and V/NFs, SLAs may be used to address some trust issues, such as what each party will provide and manage. However, the principles of trust and verification also come into play. The 3rd party must be able to verify, though the management interface, that all terms of the SLA are being met by the MNO. Similarly, the MNO must be able to verify that the 3rd party is managing resources appropriately so that there is no adverse impact to the rest of the network. Appropriate management interfaces are needed to support both the network operator and 3rd party.\nModels 3c and 3d allow for additional interactions between non-public networks, private slices, and PLMNs as shown in the following figures from [2].\n\n\n\nFigure 2-2: Example of enterprise communications using a combination of 5G PLMNs, a private slice, and a non-public network\nThe figure depicts an example of enterprise communications using a geographically constrained private slice, illustrating the use of a private network slice to connect remote offices and branches. The slice is designed to provide high-speed, secure, and reliable communication services, while also ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The figure includes key components such as the private network slice, the core switch, and the distributed nodes, which are essential for managing and routing data packets. The layered design of the slice ensures redundancy and failover capabilities, ensuring the continuity of communication services in the event of network failures.\nFigure 2-3: Example of enterprise communications using a geographically constrained private slice\nThe figure depicts a private slice within a public local network (PLMN) used for enterprise communications. It illustrates the use of a private network slice, which is a dedicated network segment within a public network, to provide secure and private communication services to enterprises. The figure shows the network slice, including the network interface controller (NIC), network access control (NAC), and the private network segment. The private network slice is designed to provide a secure and private communication environment for enterprises, ensuring that sensitive data is transmitted securely and that the network is not compromised.\nFigure 2-4: Example of enterprise communications using a private slice throughout the PLMN\n\nSupport for enterprise communications may be provided by a variety of network configurations, including multiple PLMNs, private slices, and non-public networks. New requirements allow for managing the enterprise communications in a coordinated manner across these various implementation options. New requirements also provide for isolation of private network resources which may be constrained for access within a geographic area such as a factory site or restricted for use only by UEs belonging to the enterprise. As a counterpart, additional requirements provide for restricting some enterprise UEs from accessing a PLMN, this may be useful for example to keep factory equipment connected to the private slice or non-public network when a PLMN covers the same area.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 22.261 Service requirements for the 5G system\n[2] TR 22.830 Feasibility Study on Business Role Models for Network Slicing\n",

A study item [1] was drafted accordingly, along with a corresponding RAN study item [13]. The SA2 study item conclusions are documented in TR 23.743 [2]. The conclusions of the RAN study item are documented in TR 37.873 [14]. Subsequent to the study items, work items were drafted in SA ([5]) and RAN ([10]) to implement optimisations to the UE radio capability signalling.\nThe work is divided into two subfeatures, UE radio capability ID and UE capability segmentation.\nUE Radio Capability ID\nThe SA2 work item [5] specified system optimisations for the 5GS (documented in TS 23.501 [3]) and for the EPS (documented in TS 23.401 [4]), that apply to both NR and E-UTRA, but not NB-IoT, consisting of using UE Radio Capability IDs as an alternative to signaling the UE Radio Capabilities container in system procedures:\n-\tbetween the UE and the CN (over Uu)\n-\tbetween the CN and the RAN (impacting N2/S1 interfaces)\n-\twithin the RAN in e.g. the handover procedures (impacting Xn/X2/S1/N2 interfaces)\n-\twithin the CN.\nWork was done in collaboration with RAN WGs for the related RAN interfaces and CT WGs for the CN interfaces and NFs. Interworking with nodes that support the feature and those that do not support the feature was also defined.\nThe UE Radio Capability ID format is defined in TS 23.003 [7]. The UE Radio Capability ID is signaled by the UE in NAS as specified in TS 24.501 [8] for the 5GS and as specified in TS 24.301 [9] for the EPS. Two possible options for the assignment of UE Radio Capability ID exist:\n-\tManufacturer-assigned: The UE Radio Capability ID may be assigned by the UE manufacturer in which case it includes a UE manufacturer identification (i.e. a Vendor ID). In this case, the UE Radio Capability ID uniquely identifies a set of UE radio capabilities for a UE by this manufacturer in any network.\n-\tNetwork-assigned: If a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is not used by the UE or the serving network, or it is not recognised by the serving network’s UE Capability Management Function (UCMF), the UCMF may allocate UE Radio Capability IDs for the UE corresponding to each different set of UE radio capabilities which the network may receive from the UE at different times. In this case, the UE Radio Capability IDs which the UE receives are applicable to the serving network and uniquely identify the corresponding sets of UE radio capabilities in this network. The network-assigned UE Radio Capability ID includes a Version ID in its format. The value of the Version ID is the one configured in the UCMF, at the time when the UE Radio Capability ID value is assigned. The Version ID value makes it possible to detect whether a UE Radio Capability ID is current or outdated.\nUE Radio Capability IDs and the mapping to the corresponding UE radio capabilities are stored in a new function called the UE Capability Management Function (UCMF) in the CN. The UCMF is used for:\n-\tstorage of dictionary entries corresponding to either Network-assigned or Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.\n-\tassigning Network-assigned UE Radio Capability ID values.\n-\tprovisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in the UCMF performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either directly or via the NEF/SCEF (or via Network Management).\nThe UCMF (Universal Communication Module Framework) architecture, depicted in Figure 1, is a key component of 5G systems. It is designed to support a wide range of communication services, including voice, video, and data. The architecture includes various reference points, such as the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and the communication network (CN). These points are interconnected to ensure efficient communication and data transmission.\nFigure 1: UCMF architecture and related reference points in 5GS (left) and EPS (right)\nSystem procedures are defined for 5GS in TS 23.502 [6] and for EPS in TS 23.401 [4].\nUE Capability Segmentation\nThe RAN work item [10] calls for specification of a segmentation mechanism, so that in cases of excessively large UE capability signalling (e.g. capability information messages exceeding the maximum size of a PDCP SDU), the capability can be segmented into multiple RRC messages. Segmentation applies to both NR and E-UTRA and is captured respectively in [11] and [12].\nSegmentation is performed in the RRC protocol layer, with a separate RRC PDU for each segment. The UE encodes the capability information message, then divides the encoded message into segments such that the size of each segment does not exceed the maximum size of a PDCP SDU (8188 octets in E-UTRA, 9000 octets in NR); the RAN node (eNB or gNB) receives the segments and reassembles them to reconstruct the original capability information message. Segmentation is applied only in case the size of the encoded capability information message exceeds the maximum size of a PDCP SDU. The signalling formats support up to 16 segments for a single capability information message.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tSP-180599, “Study on optimisations on UE radio capability signaling”\n[2] \tTR 23.743, “Study on optimisations on UE radio capability signaling”\n[3]\tTS 23.501, “System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)”\n[4]\tTS 23.401, “General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access”\n[5]\tSP-190180, “Work item on optimisations on UE radio capability signaling”\n[6]\tTS 23.502, “Procedures for the 5G System (5GS)”\n[7]\tTS 23.003, “Numbering, addressing and identification”\n[8]\tTS 24.501, “Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3”\n[9]\tTS 24.301, “Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Stage 3”\n[10]\tRP-191088, “Updated WID: Core part: Optimisations on UE radio capability signalling – NR/E-UTRA Aspects”\n[11]\tTS 38.331, “NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification”\n[12]\tTS 36.331, “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification”\n[13]\tRP-181459, “Study on optimisations on UE radio capability signalling – NR/E-UTRA Aspects”\n[14]\tTR 37.873, “Study on optimizations of UE radio capability signalling; NR / Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) aspects”\n",

The requirements address identifying when restricted local operator services are available and enabling a UE to attach to a network for the purpose of accessing a restricted local operator service even if the UE is not able to be authenticated by the network. The requirements can be found in TS 22.101 [1], TS 22.115 [2], and TS 22.228 [3].\nThe PARLOS WI was driven primarily by FCC regulations for manual roaming as described in [4] and [5]. The ability to provide access to such local services has been available to U.S. operators on a proprietary basis. However, the wide deployment of LTE and corresponding introduction of VoLTE creates demand for a standardized mechanism to allow a UE to access these services such as manual roaming without necessarily being successfully authenticated for access. This optional functionality of supporting access to RLOS services to unauthenticated UEs can be deployed based on operator policy. The RLOS services themselves are out of scope of 3GPP. PARLOS is an LTE capability.\nThe PARLOS requirements provide for a network to inform UEs using a 3GPP access technology that RLOS services are available and to allow access to the RLOS services when requested by the UE without requiring successful authentication of the UE first. The services are provided in an isolated manner that prevents an unauthenticated UE from accessing any other service or functionality in the network. Additional requirements also provide for collection of charging information related to the use of RLOS services.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 22.101 Requirements for access to restricted local operator services\n[2] TS 22.115 Charging for restricted local operator services\n[3] TS 22.228 Requirements for access to restricted local operator services\n[4] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B Part 20 Section 20.3\n[5] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B Part 20 Section 20.12 (Resale and Roaming)\n",

Enable the 3GPP system to support deployments where a SMF is not able / allowed to control UPF(s) throughout the same PLMN.\n-\tThis is mostly meant for very big networks which are subdivided into geographical areas with each their own management;\n-\tThis relates with the addition of I-SMF in the architecture but defines also the possibility of changing the V-SMF in case of Home-Routing.\n2. Enhance the capability of 5GS architecture for a UPF to be controlled by multiple SMF's (and many UPF's to be controlled by many SMFs) especially for the UE IP address / Prefix allocation\nThese features couldn’t be specified as part of 3GPP R15 Session Management due to lack of time.\nAddition of I-SMF in the architecture\nWhen a UE with an established PDU Session is not in a TA served by the SMF of this PDU Session, an intermediate SMF (called I-SMF) is inserted by the AMF in the signalling path of the PDU session to control the intermediate UPF (called I-UPF) terminating the N3 interface with the 5G Access Network.\nThe non-roaming architecture depicted in Figure 1 illustrates the I-SMF insertion to the PDU Session in reference point representation, with no UL-CL/BP. This figure represents the non-roaming architecture, which is a key component in the non-roaming network. The I-SMF (Intermediate Signal Multiplexer) is a device that allows for the transmission of signals from the PDU (Physical Distribution Unit) to the I-SMF, which is then used to transmit the signal to the UE (User Equipment). The figure also shows the presence of UL-CL/BP (User Local Clustering and Local Backbone) and the PDU Session, which is a crucial part of the non-roaming network.\nFigure 1: Non-roaming architecture with I-SMF insertion to the PDU Session in reference point representation, with no UL-CL/BP\n\nThe I-SMF acts in a similar way than the V-SMF of a Home Routed PDU Session: as long as the UE remains in its own I-SMF service area, the I-SMF handles the transitions between User Plane Active and Inactive for the PDU session, the Hand-Over and controls the local UPF(s) with sometimes relaying of N4 commands received from the SMF. The SMF remains responsible of the interfaces with the PCF and the CHF, of the interface with the UDM and of the overall control of the PDU Session.\nWhen the I-SMF is inserted into a PDU Session, the I-SMF provides to the SMF the list of DNAI it supports. Based on this information received from I-SMF and on PCC rules for the PDU Session, the SMF may provide the DNAI(s) of interest for local traffic steering to the I-SMF for this PDU Session. The I-SMF is thus responsible for the insertion, modification and removal of UPF(s) to ensure local traffic steering: the SMF does not need to know the mapping between DNAI(s) for local traffic offload and local UPF(s). Then the SMF provides N4 rules to the I-SMF for how the traffic for local offload shall be detected, enforced, monitored in UPF(s) controlled by the I-SMF.\nWhen the UE moves out of the service area of the I-SMF, the I-SMF may be changed or the I-SMF is simply removed. Likewise, the V-SMF may be changed upon UE mobility in case of Home-Routing.\nUE IP address / Prefix allocation\nETSUN adds the possibility for the SMF to defer to the UPF the UE IP address / Prefix allocation or to indicate to the DHCP/DN-AAA server the range (corresponding to the UPF) of IP address / Prefix to be allocated : this allows many SMF(s) to control the same UPF without having to synchronise or divide the UE IP address / Prefix space between these SMF(s).\nCharging aspects (Summary provided by China Mobile in SP-200266)\nSA2, CT3 and CT4 have studied the enhanced topology deployments of SMF and UPF in TR 23.726, TS 23.501 and 23.502.

On each carrier, the UE shall at least search for the strongest cell, read its system information and report available NPN identifiers together with their HRNN (if broadcast) to the NAS.\nFor a UE in NPN access mode, if the highest ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority reselection rules is a cell which is not suitable for UE access, for licensed spectrum, the UE shall not consider this cell and other cells on the same frequency as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300 seconds; for unlicensed spectrum, the UE shall not consider this cell as candidate for cell reselection but should continue to consider other cells on the same frequency for cell reselection.\nThe Rel-15 UEs and Non-NPN-capable Rel-16 UEs treat a cell with cellReservedForOtherUse=true as barred cell.\nFor Rel-16 and later NPN-capable UEs, if the npn-IdentityInfoList-r16 IE is present in CellAccessRelatedInfo and the cellReservedForOtherUse = true while, a cell is an NPN-only cell that is only available for normal service for NPNs’ subscriber.\nAll the R16 UEs will treat the cell as barred when the legacy IE cellReservedForOtherUse=True and this cell does not broadcast any CAG-IDs or NIDs.\nFor SNPN, Once the UE has selected an SNPN, cell selection/re-selection is only performed within the SNPN, i.e. a cell is only considered suitable if the broadcasted SNPN identifier matches the selected SNPN.\nNPN cell access control\nThere is no preliminary access check for NPN cells in CONNECTED mode. For SNPN, the UAC parameters per SNPN are configured by reusing the existing uac-BarringPerPLMN-List, and for a PNI-NPN the UAC parameter set is selected based on the PLMN ID of PNI-NPNs. The current measurement reporting procedures is extended to include NPN information to support ANR.\nDuring the access procedure, for SNPN, the SNPN ID is included in the RRCSetupComplete and Initial UE Message message, and for PNI-NPN the Allowed CAG list is provided to the gNB by the AMF. A single Cause “NPN access denied” will be sent to users when they fail to access NPN cells.\nNPN relevant mobility support\nAt mobility, the source NG-RAN node knows the NPN information supported by the candidate target cells, the target RAN node needs to be informed of the serving SNPN ID or UE allowed CAG ID list which are included in the mobility restriction list. If the serving SNPN ID or UE allowed CAG ID list does not match any of the target cell supported list of SNPN IDs or CAG IDs, target RAN node shall fail the handover.\nFor mobility in inactive state, the last serving NG-RAN node performs access control check upon the reception of RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST, the new NG-RAN node may perform access control check upon the reception of RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE which is implementation dependent.\nNPN Support over NG/Xn\nThe list of supported SNPN IDs could be exchanged between NG-RAN node and AMF via NG setup and configuration update procedures while the list of cell supported SNPN IDs and CAG IDs could be exchanged via Xn setup and configuration update procedures.\nNPN Support over F1/E1\nOver F1, the list of supported SNPN IDs can be exchanged between DU and CU, the cell supported list of CAG IDs can be signaled from DU to CU. The NID as part of the UAC Assistance Information could be signalled from gNB-CU to gNB-DU. The gNB-DU is responsible for SIB10 encoding, valueTag and areaScope associated with SIB10, and need to signal the HRNN (SIB 10) to gNB-CD. The general cause value \"NPN not supported\" is introduced for interface related messages and the general cause value \"NPN access denied” is introduced for UE-associated messages. Over E1, the list of SNPN IDs supported by CU-UP could be signalled to CU-CP.\nNPN support for RAN sharing and Dual connectivity\nIf NR access is shared, system information broadcast in a shared cell indicates a TAC and a Cell Identity for each subset of PLMNs, PNI NPNs and SNPNs. NR access provides only one TAC and one Cell Identity per cell per PLMN, SNPN or PNI NPN. In Rel-16, a Cell Identity can only belong to one network type among PLMN, PNI-NPN or SNPN.\nThe NR-DC within a single SNPN or within PNI-NPN or across PLMN and PNI-NPN is supported, EN-DC is not supported for NPN.\nEmergency Services\nFor SNPN, Emergency services are not supported.\nFor a CAG-only cell in PNI-NPN, if the cellReservedForOtherUse = false in gNB, the access attempts of Rel-15 UEs or Rel-16 non-NPN capable UEs for emergency services could be allowed; if the cellReservedForOtherUse = true, the access attempts of Rel-16 NPN capable UEs for emergency services could be allowed.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by China Mobile in [SP-200776].\nThis WI enhances the service-based architecture of 5G system to improve the service framework and support high reliability. The main features introduced by the WI include:\n1)\t support of indirect communication models of NF/NF Services via an intermediary function (Service Communication Proxy - SCP),\n2)\tNF/NF service set enabling the grouping of equivalent NF instances/NF service instances. The NF/NF Services within a NF/NF Service set can share the same context data thus improving the resiliency for processing any transaction. and\n3)\tbinding mechanism improves the flexibility and efficiency of the service based architecture by allowing the NF producer to dynamically indicate that the NF consumer, for a particular context, should be bound to an NF service instance, NF instance, NF service set or NF set for subsequent transaction depending on local policies or other criteria..\nArchitecture enhancement\nThe work has resulted in the definition of different communication models that NF and NF services can use to interact which each other via or not via a new NF named SCP as shown in the figure here below from TS 23.501 [1]\nThe figure depicts various communication models for NF/NF services interaction, illustrating how NF/NF services can be used to enhance network performance and reliability.\nFigure 1: Communication models for NF/NF services interaction\nModel A - Direct communication without NRF interaction: Neither NRF nor SCP are used. Consumers are configured with producers' \"NF profiles\" and directly communicate with a producer of their choice.\nModel B - Direct communication with NRF interaction: Consumers do discovery by querying the NRF. Based on the discovery result, the consumer does the selection. The consumer sends the request to the selected producer.\nModel C - Indirect communication without delegated discovery: Consumers do discovery by querying the NRF. Based on discovery result, the consumer does the selection of an NF Set or a specific NF instance of NF instance set. The consumer sends the request to the SCP containing the address of the selected service producer pointing to a NF service instance or a set of NF service instances. The SCP routes the request to the selected NF service producer instance.\nModel D - Indirect communication with delegated discovery: Consumers do not do any discovery or selection. The consumer adds any necessary discovery and selection parameters required to find a suitable producer to the service request. The SCP uses the request address and the discovery and selection parameters in the request message to route the request to a suitable producer instance. The SCP can perform discovery with an NRF and obtain a discovery result.\nNF/NF Service set mechanism\nThe NF Set and NF Service Set concept has been defined by grouping equivalent control plane NFs into NF Set or grouping multiple NF Service instances into NF Service Set. The NF/NF Services within a NF/NF Service set can share the same context data.\nWhen the NF producer instance is not available, another NF producer instance within the same NF Set is selected. When multiple NF Service instances within a NF Service Set are exposed to the NF Service consumer or SCP and the failure of NF Service instance is detected or notified by the NRF, the NF Service consumer or SCP selects another NF Service instance of the same NF Service Set within the NF instance, if available. Otherwise the NF Service consumer or SCP selects a different NF instance within the same NF Set.\nBinding mechanism\nA binding mechanism based on NF/NF Service set was introduced to improve the efficiency of the service-based architecture.\nBinding is used to indicate suitable target NF producer instance(s) for NF service instance selection, reselection and routing of subsequent requests associated with a specific NF producer resource (context) and NF service. This allows the NF producer to indicate that the NF consumer, for a particular context, should be bound to an NF service instance, NF instance, NF service set or NF set depending on local policies and other criteria.\nBinding is also used by the NF consumer to indicate suitable NF consumer instance(s) for notification target instance reselection and routing of subsequent notification requests associated with a specific notification subscription and for providing Binding Indication for service(s) that the NF consumer produces for the same data context and the NF service producer is subsequently likely to invoke.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System; Stage 2\".

                            "text_content": "\nSummary based on the input provided by T-Mobile USA INC in SP-200808\nIn release 15 Service-Based interfaces were introduced between the functional elements of the new 5G core systems (5GC), however no changes were made to the IMS nodes that interact with the packet core, and so Diameter-based interfaces remained between IMS functions and the 5GC. It was therefore determined that the specification of Service-Based interfaces between the IMS core and the 5GC would enable more efficient implementations. However, to enable operators the flexibility in performing the transition to Service-Based Architecture (SBA), it was determined not to remove (at this time) the option to use Diameter for IMS services interworking with 5GC.\nThis work resulted in the specification of Service-Based architecture between the IMS and 5GC. The following summarizes the enhancements made:\nThe first major change to enable SBA was an update to the PCF and Npcf services to allow the IMS functions to use the N5 interface (instead of Rx) when communicating with the PCC functions for QOS interactions. This requires IMS functions to be upgraded to support the SBA procedures and protocols, as well as the SBA protocols themselves to be updated with IMS specific parameters (including IMS public and private identifiers). The IMS functions now use similar capabilities to other SBA functional entities to perform PCF discovery, avoiding the need for interworking to perform this. One added benefit of this is that a new option for P-CSCF discovery using the NRF is provided, this may allow for some network implementations to use a single discovery method (avoiding misalignment between different systems).\nOne area of significant change was to provide SBA capabilities to the IMS portion of the HSS, this introduces Nhss services to the SBA for IMS interactions with the HSS. Service-Based equivalents to the Cx and Sh interfaces (identified as the N70 and N71 interfaces) enable the CSCF and IMS-AS to use service-based interfaces for subscription and service interactions with the HSS. No changes are made to the non-IMS portions of the HSS so that existing LTE and UMTS packet cores can continue to interact with the HSS unchanged; this also allows for UDICOM implementations.\nThe last major change from the Diameter approach to the Service-Based approach was in the method of HSS discovery. To better align with the discovery of other 5GC functional elements, the NRF and the Nnrf protocols were updated, allowing the IMS functions to discover the correct HSS instance to use for the subscription of a specific subscriber. To enable implementations where the mapping between a subscriber identifier and the HSS instance is not stored in the NRF a new service was specified allowing the UDR to store this information and for the NRF to request the mapping. These enhancements can leverage the deployment implementation options introduced with eSBA (e.g. direct or indirect discovery methods) for proxy-based network routing.\n\nAs noted earlier, the option to utilize Diameter based interactions between IMS and 5GC was retained, to enable flexible transition to SBA.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] TS 23.228 “IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS); Stage 2”.\n[2] TS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System; Stage 2\".\n[3] TS 23.502: \"Procedures for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2\".\n[4] TS 23.503 “Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2”.\n[5] TS 29.563 \"Home Subscriber Server (HSS) services for interworking with Unified Data Management (UDM); Stage 3\".\n[6] TS 29.562 “5G System; Home Subscriber Server (HSS) services for interworking with the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS); Stage 3”.\n[7] TS 29.510 “5G System; Network function repository services; Stage 3”.\n[8] TS 29.513 “5G System; Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and QoS parameter mapping; Stage 3”.\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in RP-202753 (previous version in RP-201840)\nThis work item specifies NR enhancements for a single global solution framework for access to unlicensed spectrum which enables operation of NR in the 5GHz and the 6GHz (e.g., US 5925 – 7125 MHz, or European 5925 – 6425 MHz, or parts thereof) unlicensed bands taking into account regional regulatory requirements and reusing features of NR as much as possible.\nThis work item supports NR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel access to operate in different modes where either PCell, PSCell, or SCells can be in shared spectrum and an SCell may or may not be configured with uplink. The applicable deployment scenarios are described in the following.\n-\tScenario A: Carrier aggregation between NR in licensed spectrum (PCell) and NR in shared spectrum (SCell);\no\tA.1: SCell is not configured with UL (DL only); A.2: SCell is configured with UL (DL+UL).\n-\tScenario B: Dual connectivity between LTE in licensed spectrum and NR in shared spectrum (PSCell);\n-\tScenario C: NR in shared spectrum (PCell);\n-\tScenario D: NR cell in shared spectrum and uplink in licensed spectrum;\n- \tScenario E: Dual connectivity between NR in licensed spectrum (PCell) and NR in shared spectrum (PSCell)\nPhysical Layer Signals and Channels\nInitial access signals and channels: For PRACH, to support larger PRACH transmission power under PSD limitation and/or to meet OCB requirement, longer PRACH sequences of length 1151 and 517 are introduced, applicable to 15kHz SCS and 30kHz SCS, respectively. Legacy length 839 PRACH sequence is not supported in a cell with shared spectrum channel access.\nDL signals and channels: DCI 2_0 is enhanced to provide time and frequency domain Channel Occupancy Time (COT) structure. For time domain COT, remaining COT duration can be included in DCI 2_0. If COT duration field is not configured, the UE can derive the remaining COT duration from SFI field included in DCI 2_0. For frequency domain COT, a bitmap for available RB sets can be included in DCI 2_0 to indicate if an RB set is included in the current COT.\nSearch space set group switching feature is also introduced, such that the UE can be dynamically controlled to perform PDCCH monitoring from two groups of search spaces sets. The search space set group switching can be triggered by explicit bit in DCI 2_0, a PDCCH decoding event in one of the groups, and a timer expiration.\nIn Rel-15, only length of 2, 4 and 7 OFDM symbols is supported with PDSCH mapping type B with. Additional lengths (i.e. 2-13 symbols) as well as corresponding additional DMRS positions are specified for unlicensed band operation. The feature is also specified for licensed operation.\nIn order to facilitate UE monitoring PDCCH on multiple RB sets while not significantly increasing RRC signalling overhead, a search space can be configured with multiple monitoring locations in frequency domain. The configuration of CORESET is replicated on the RB sets where these monitoring locations are located.\nUL signals and channels: For PUCCH and PUSCH, PRB interlace structure is introduced to meet OCB requirement and boost transmit power under PSD limitation. For 30KHz SCS, M=5 interlaces are defined. For 15KHz SCS, M=10 interlaces are defined.. The interlaces are defined with respect to point A, and one interlace is formed by set of resource blocks M RBs apart.\nFor PUCCH, Rel.15 NR PUCCH format 0/1/2/3 are extended to PRB interlace waveform similar to PUSCH, but constrained within one RB set. PUCCH format 0/1 in Rel.15 is single RB only, and in Rel.16, they are extended to one interlace with 10 or 11 RBs. PUCCH format 2/3 in Rel.15 are already multiple RBs but in continuous RBs up to 16 RBs. In Rel.16, they are extended to occupy one or two interlaces. If one interlace is used, frequency domain OCC and pre-DFT OCC are introduced for PUCCH format 2 and 3 respectively to improve the multiplexing capacity.\nIn Rel-15, SRS is restricted to the last 6 symbols in a slot. In Rel-16, UE is able to be configured with SRS transmission on every OFDM symbols in a slot for unlicensed band operation. The feature is also specified for licensed operation.\ngNB can schedule multiple contiguous PUSCH(s) by a single DCI format 0_1.\nPhysical Layer Procedures\nChannel access procedures: Rel.16 NR-U supports two channel access operation modes: dynamic channel access mode (corresponds to Load Based Equipment in [1]) and semi-static channel access mode (corresponds to Frame Based Equipment in [1]).\nWhen operating on a wideband (i.e. >20MHz) carrier, clear channel assessment (CCA) is performed in the unit of 20MHz or 10MHz depends on regulation requirements.\nFor dynamic channel access mode, the following LBT mechanisms are defined:\n-\tCat 4 LBT with a contention window (Type 1);\n-\tCat 2 LBT within a 25 µs sensing interval (Type 2A); Cat 2 LBT within a 16 µs gap (Type 2B)\n-\tCat 1 LBT with a gap of no more than 16 µs without channel sensing (Type 2C)\nBoth gNB and UE can acquire a COT with Cat 4 LBT, while a gNB or UE can share the COT acquired by the other node with Cat 2 or Cat 1 LBT under different conditions. The only exception is the transmission of discovery RS, which includes the transmission of SSBs and other non-unicast control and data, where under some restriction, Type 2A LTE can be used to acquire the COT.\nFor semi-static channel access, in Rel.16 NR-U, only gNB can contend for a channel as a fixed frame period boundary and a UE can share the gNB COT for transmission if gNB DL transmission is detected in an earlier part of the same COT.\nEnhancements to initial access procedures: Discovery RS is a concept introduced for NR-U to deliver critical information including PSS/SSS/PBCH blocks (SSB) and critical system information including System Information Block 1 (SIB1). In NR, for sub-7GHz bands, up to 8 SSBs can be transmitted every 20ms to support beam sweeping with different SSB positions. There is no quasi-colocation (QCL) relationship across up to 8 SSBs within one cycle, but SSBs at the same position in different cycles are assumed to be QCL’ed.\nFor unlicensed band operation, transmissions are subject to LBT. Hence, there is a chance that SSBs cannot be transmitted due to LBT failure. There are two enhancements introduced to support a more reliable delivery of critical system information:\n-\tType 2A LBT can be used to start the DRS transmission if the duty cycle of the DRS is no larger than 1/20 and the length of the DRS is no longer than 1ms\n-\tUp to 20 and 10 candidate SSB positions in a half frame are supported for 30kHz SCS and 15kHz SCS, respectively, to allow more transmission opportunities than Rel-15. SSBs on the candidate SSB positions with same SSB index are regarded as QCLed.\nThe RSSI measurement bandwidth is 20MHz regardless of the carrier bandwidth.\nHARQ enhancements: For operation in unlicensed band, a major issue with HARQ operation is scheduled ACK/NACK transmission may not happen due to LBT failure. In licensed operation, ACK/NACK transmission failure issue is not severe. If ACK/NACK is not received by the gNB, there is no mechanism to retransmit the ACK/NACK. This was acceptable for Rel-15 since the probability for gNB failing to decode ACK/NACK is small and the gNB can schedule a retransmission of PDSCH to collect ACK/NACK. For unlicensed band operation, since the channel is shared with other nodes, the transmission of PUCCH or PUSCH carrying ACK/NACK is not guaranteed, and the probability that the UE failed ACK/NACK transmission cannot be ignored anymore. To solve this problem, three features have been designed:\n-\tNon-numerical K1 indication for ACK/NACK transmission timing\n-\tEnhanced (Type 2) dynamic codebook for HARQ ACK\n-\tOne-shot (Type 3) codebook for HARQ ACK\nThe non-numerical K1 feature is introduced, such that the gNB does not provide a time to report ACK/NACK when scheduling the PDSCH. Instead a special non-numerical K1 is indicated in the DL grant scheduling the PDSCH. The UE will hold on to the ACK/NACK corresponds to the PDSCH, and report ACK/NACK when a later PDSCH is scheduled with another DL grant with proper K1 timing indicated.\nThe other two HARQ enhancement features are introduced to support UE ACK/NACK re-transmissions. For enhanced dynamic codebook design, HARQ ACK group is introduced. Within an HARQ ACK group, the already scheduled ACK/NACK (transmitted or failed to transmit) can be triggered to be retransmitted. Rel.16 NR-U also defines a type-3 HARQ ACK codebook. In this codebook design, gNB can trigger the report of ACK/NACK for all configured HARQ processes over all cells by setting a bit in -the DCI.\nConfigured grant enhancement: Rel.16 NR-U enhanced Configured grant UL transmission by allowing the UE to performing retransmission of a TB in a CG-PUSCH resource. A CG-UCI is included to indicate the HARQ process ID, NDI and RVID of the transmission. UE can acquire a COT with Cat 4 LBT for CG-UL transmission and share the COT with gNB for DL transmissions. The COT sharing information is also carried in CG-UCI. When CG is configured, gNB can feedback HARQ-ACK for UL transmission by CG-DFI. When the UE is configured with repK > 1, repetition of a TB is mapped within a configuration in the case when an UE is configured with multiple active configurations, the UE repeats the TB in the earliest consecutive transmission occasion candidates within the same configuration instead of consecutive slots, the UE terminates the repetitions if an explicit feedback indicating ACK in the DFI is received for the HARQ process.\nWideband operation: The concept of “RB set” is introduced which approximately corresponds to one 20MHz channel. For PUSCH, the resource allocation is defined by continuous RB sets and the set of interlaces. The RB sets are defined by RRC configuring the intra-cell guard band between RB sets. If the intra-cell guard band is not configured, the default values for intra-cell guard band from RAN4 will be applied. It is also possible to configure the intra-cell guard band to be 0.\nIn a DL BWP with bandwidth larger than 20MHz, gNB may transmit DL channels and signals when LBT is successful on a subset of RB sets (either contiguous or non-contiguous) in the BWP. In a UL BWP with bandwidth larger than 20MHz, UE is allowed to transmit UL channel and signals only if LBT is successful on all RB sets where UL transmission is scheduled/configured and non-zero intra-cell guard is applied in between.\nMAC Enhancements\nAt the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, several features were introduced to alleviate the impact of LBT mechanism on MAC procedures. The main ones are: Consistent LBT failure detection and recovery; Changes to RACH procedures; Configured Grant (CG) changes.\nA new mechanism to detect and recover from consistent UL LBT failures was introduced. The detection is per Bandwidth Part (BWP) and based on all uplink transmissions within this BWP. Similar to BFD, a timer is re-started with every LBT failure indication from physical layer to MAC; a counter is incremented with every LBT failure and is reset when the timer expires. When the counter exceeds a configured threshold, consistent UL LBT failure is declared on this BWP.\nFor failures on SCells, the UE reports this to the corresponding gNB (MN for MCG, SN for SCG) via a MAC CE. For SpCell (PCell or PSCell), when consistent uplink LBT failures are detected, the UE switches to another UL BWP with configured RACH resources on that cell, initiates RACH, and reports the failure via MAC CE. If failures happen on all such BWPs, SCG failure for PSCell and RLF for PCell is declared.\nIf msg1 in 4-step RACH or msgA preamble in 2-step RACH is not transmitted due to LBT failure, the UE does not increment the power of the next attempt. If the UE is configured with the above LBT failure detection/recovery, it also does not increment the transmission counter; in this case, the failure of RACH procedure is handled by the LBT failure detection/recovery.\nThe LBT failure for transmission of msg2 in 4-step RACH and msgB in 2-step RACH necessitated longer monitoring windows at the UE to receive these messages. The maximum window duration was increased from 10ms in Rel-15 to 40ms. However, this change caused possible ambiguity of determining the correct initial transmission for which the response was intended. To solve this, the gNB signals the last two-bits of SFN corresponding to msg1 transmission time for msg1 or msgA preamble in the corresponding response message.\nThe changes to configured grant transmission are mainly due to autonomous retransmission on CG resources, autonomous HARQ process ID and RV selection, and LBT failures. A new CG retransmission timer was introduced where the UE is allowed to retransmit a packet on a CG after this timer expires without any ACK from the gNB for the earlier transmission. The UE always prioritizes ongoing retransmissions over new transmissions. Since the UE signals HARQ ID and RV on CG transmissions, their selection is left to the UE implementation. Multiple CGs on a BWP are allowed where they all can use the above retransmission feature and can also share the same HARQ ID pool.\nFor uplink multi-TTI transmission, the UE is allowed to select a HARQ process and RV to transmit a generated packet to handle the scenario when the LBT fails for the initial TTI occasions. To support transmission of DL HARQ feedback during DRX operation, if the UE receives a non-numerical K1 where the actual DCI for HARQ feedback will be coming later, monitoring of downlink control channel was extended in time.\nUpper Layer Enhancements\nFor Connected mode mobility, the only change for NR-U is the support of RSSI and Channel Occupancy (CO) measurements similar to LTE-LAA. These can be reported periodically or along with other measurement reports.\nFor Idle/Inactive mode mobility, the rules for checking other cells for reselection were relaxed to handle the cases when best cell on a frequency belongs to a different PLMN. To further help the UE consider only the cells of the home or equivalent PLMN in reselection, a “white-list” of such neighbor cells is broadcasted.\nIn Rel-15 NR, the UE has a single Paging Occasion (PO) for every DRX cycle in Idle/Inactive mode. Since LBT may fail during a paging transmission attempt, multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions were introduced for NR-U. This allows the gNB to transmit the paging message when LBT is not successful at the first instance. As monitoring of multiple occasions increases UE power, gNB can let the UE stop further monitoring when there is no page for that UE by transmitting a Short Message on paging channel with a newly introduced bit for this purpose. The UE can also stop monitoring when it detects a paging for other UEs with the assumption that the gNB had access to the channel and thus there is no page for itself.\nChannel Access Priority Class (CAPC) can be configured for each data radio bearer (DRB) and SRB2. The signaling bearers (except for SRB2) always use the highest priority CAPC. The gNB assigns the CAPC by taking into account the specified mapping between 5QI (QoS indicator) of QoS flows in a DRB. The UE uses this configuration to determine the CAPC when not signaled by the gNB directly via DCI. This applies to all CG transmissions and some dynamic grants. When signaling data is transmitted, CAPC of the PDU is same as the CAPC of the highest priority signaling bearer. In all other cases, the lowest priority CAPC among the multiplexed data flows is chosen for the CAPC of the PDU\nTargeted spectrum\nTwo bands have been considered and defined in relation to this work item:\n\nNOTE 1: This band is restricted to operation with shared spectrum channel access as defined in TS 37.213.\nNOTE 2: This band is applicable in the USA only subject to FCC Report and Order [FCC 20-51]\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-192926, Revised WID on NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum\n[2]\tRP-202751, Status report for WI on NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum\n\n",

This reduces the number of interactions between the UE and network during the connection setup and connection resume, thereby enabling a lower control plane latency. In case of connected mode, a small amount of data can be sent via 2-step RACH procedure thus also enabling a lower latency for UL UP data for connected mode UEs.\n-\tChannel structure of transmitting PRACH and PUSCH in one step (i.e. without an intermediate message from the network) was developed. The PRACH and PUSCH are separated by a pre-configured guard period.\n-\tThe above enhancements are applicable to both licensed spectrum and shared spectrum (i.e. NR-U).\n\nThe general procedure of 4-step RACH and 2-step RACH are depicted in Figure 1. The first step of 2-step RACH comprises an UL MSGA transmission which includes the equivalent contents of msg1 and msg3 of 4-step RACH. The second step of 2-step RACH is a DL MSGB reception which includes the equivalent content of msg2 and/or msg4 of 4-step RACH, depending on the detection of UL MSGA.\n(a) 4-step RACH:\n\nThe 4-step RACH (Redundancy and Forwarding) protocol is a key component in 5G networks, providing redundancy and failover capabilities. It involves the use of redundant paths to ensure the continuity of communication in the event of a failure. The 4-step RACH protocol consists of four steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: Redundancy Path Selection: The network selects a redundant path for each communication. This path is chosen based on factors such as signal strength, distance, and the likelihood of interference.\n\n2. **Step 2**: Redundancy Path Forwarding: The selected redundant path is used to forward the data packets. This step ensures that the data is not lost due to a failure in the primary path.\n\n3. **Step 3**: Redundancy Path Backward: In the event of a failure in the redundant path, the data is forwarded to the primary path.

Contention free random access (CFRA) procedure with 2-step RACH is only supported for handover.\nThe UE selects the type of random access at initiation of the random access procedure based on network configuration:\n-\twhen CFRA resources are not configured, an RSRP threshold is used by the UE to select between 2-step RA type and 4-step RA type;\n-\twhen CFRA resources for 4-step RA type are configured, UE performs random access with 4-step RA type;\n-\twhen CFRA resources for 2-step RA type are configured, UE performs random access with 2-step RA type.\nIn case of random access in a cell configured with SUL, UE performs carrier selection (between SUL and NUL) before selecting between 2-step and 4-step RA type.\nMSGA structure: PRACH\nThe MSGA in 2-step RACH comprise a PRACH and a PUSCH. The PRACH resources for 2-step RACH in time/frequency domain can be either shared with 4-step RACH or can be configured to be separate. All the preamble formats and the PRACH configuration indexes defined in Rel-15 and in Rel-16 NR-U and TEI can be used. In case of shared time domain PRACH resources between 4-step RACH and 2-step RACH, different preambles are allocated to differentiate the RA types. The mapping between SSB and PRACH occasion reuses that for 4-step RACH.\nMSGA structure: PUSCH\n2-step RACH uses a specified mapping rule to determine the PUSCH resource of MSGA that is associated with the selected PRACH resource. Each PRACH slot is mapped to a number of PUSCH occasions with associated DMRS resource, once the UE selects a preamble in a PRACH occasion, the corresponding PUSCH occasion and DMRS resource can be determined by a predefined mapping order.\nMSGB\nAfter MSGA transmission, the UE monitors the downlink for a response from the network within a configured window. This response from the network is called the MSGB. The contents of MSGB depend on whether or not the gNB is able to successfully detect both the PRACH and the PUSCH parts.\n-\tIf the PRACH is detected but the decoding of PUSCH fails, network will include a fallback indication in MSGB and the subsequent UE procedure will be similar to that for a UE monitoring msg2 in the 4 step RACH.\n-\tIf both preamble and PUSCH are decoded, network will include a successRAR and reception of this at the UE completes the contention resolution. HARQ feedback is enabled for the successful reception of the successRAR.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-200085, Revised WID on 2 step RACH for NR\n[2]\tRP-200622, Status report for WI - NR 2-step RACH\n",

The UE assistance information is part of the work to enable the UE to feedback its preferred configuration to achieve desired power saving.\nThe UE power saving work in Rel-16 focuses on the power saving techniques in CONNECTED state, which includes DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, maximum MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of CONNECTED state. The RRM measurement reductions are the power saving techniques specified in idle/inactive states.UE assistance information is supported for the UE to feedback its preferred configuration of the specific power saving technique.\nPower Saving Techniques in CONNECTED state\nThe power saving techniques are dynamically triggered by L1 signaling indicated from PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel or semi-statically configured by RRC signaling.The PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel reuses the existing PDCCH search space and CORESET configurations with dynamic TCI states with DCI field indicating the adaptation to achieve UE power saving, such as UE wakeup in the DRX operation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation through BWP switching.\n-\tDRX adaptation\nThe DRX adaptation power saving technique is to configure the PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel at the active BWP before the beginning of DRX ON for UE monitoring with the indication of UE wakeup or not depending on whether there is data for UE to receive. A new DCI format 2_6 is introduced with CRC scrambled by PS-RNTI (DCP) which contains the wakeup indication as well as SCell dormancy indication if configured.A PS-offset is semi-statically configured before DRX ON defining the start of the interval for the DCP monitor occasion as shown in Figure 1.More than one monitoring occasions could be configured for DCP on PCell for CA and SpCell for DC based on the search space and CORESET configurations.Minimum time gap is specified as the UE processing time as shown in Figure 1. UE is not required to monitor DCP at the interval of minimum time gap and within Active Time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen DCP monitoring occasion collides with other procedures with higher priority in PDCCH monitoring, the monitoring occasion is considered invalid.UE follows legacy behavior when all the configured monitoring occasions are invalid.UE is configured by RRC to wake up or not when no DCP is detected with valid monitoring occasions.One DCP can be configured to control PDCCH monitoring during on-duration for one or more UEs independently. UE is also configured by RRC whether to report periodic L1-RSRP or periodic CSI/L1-SINR when UE is not indicated to wake up at the DRX ON.\n-\tCross slot scheduling\nPower saving technique with cross-slot scheduling facilitates UE to achieve power saving with the assumption that it won’t be scheduled to receive PDSCH, triggered to receive A-CSI or transmit a PUSCH at the scheduling slot within Active Time. A 1-bit minimum scheduling offset in DCI format 1_1 and 0_1 enables dynamic switching of DL and UL minimum scheduling offset values.\n-\tMaximum MIMO Layer Adaptation\nUE power saving techniques with the adaptation to the DL maximum number of MIMO layers could be achieved by dynamic switching of BWPs, which the DL maximum number of MIMO layers are configured to be different.\n-\tFast transition out of CONNECTED state\nUE can feed back the assistance information of its preference to be released/suspended for gNB to get UE transitioning out of CONNECTED state quickly when there is no further data arrival.\nPower Saving Techniques in idle/inactive state\n-\tReduced RRM measurements in idle/inactive state\nPower saving in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE can also be achieved by UE relaxing neighbour cells RRM measurements when it meets the criteria determining it is in low mobility and/or not at cell edge.\nUE assistance information\nUE assistance information allows the UE to feedback its preferred configuration, such as c-DRX configuration, aggregated bandwidth, SCell configuration, MIMO configuration, RRC state, minimum scheduling offset values in order for network to assist UE achieving power saving gain.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-200494, “WID: UE power saving in NR”, CATT, CAICT\n[2]\tTR 38.840 v15.0.0.

The following features are supported:\n•\tMulti-hop backhauling for flexible range extension for both FR1 and FR2.\n•\tTopology adaptation including redundant connectivity to optimize backhauling performance and to respond to backhaul (BH) link failure.\n•\tMapping of UE bearers to backhaul RLC channels and QoS enforcement over backhaul RLC channels to meet E2E QoS requirements.\n•\tScalability to a large number of UEs.\n•\tFlexible deployment allowing IAB-node operation in EN-DC mode with EPC or in SA-mode with 5GC.\n•\tSupport for NR-NR DC from the UE and IAB-node perspective (see NOTE 1)\n•\tEfficient operation for both inband and out-of-band relaying.\n•\tOver the air (OTA) synchronization across IAB topology.\n•\tSupport of Rel-15 UEs.\nIAB architecture\nIAB introduces the IAB-node and IAB-donor to 5G RAN. The IAB-node is the relaying node and supports access and backhauling via NR. The IAB-donor is the terminating node of NR backhauling on network side. It represents a gNB with additional functionality to support IAB. Backhauling can occur via a single hop or via multiple hops.\nThe IAB-node supports gNB-DU functionality to terminate the NR access interface to UEs and next-hop IAB-nodes, and to terminate the F1 protocol to the gNB-CU functionality on the IAB-donor. The gNB-DU functionality on the IAB-node is also referred to as IAB-DU.\nIn addition to the gNB-DU functionality, the IAB-node also supports a subset of the UE functionality referred to as IAB-MT, which includes, e.g., physical layer, layer-2, RRC and NAS functionality to connect to the gNB-DU of another IAB-node or the IAB-donor, to connect to the gNB-CU on the IAB-donor, and to the core network.\nThe IAB-MT can access the network using either SA mode or EN-DC. In EN-DC, the IAB-MT connects via E-UTRA to a MeNB, and the IAB-donor terminates X2-C as SgNB.\nAll IAB-nodes that are connected to an IAB-donor via one or multiple hops form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology with the IAB-donor as its root. In this DAG topology, the neighbour node of the IAB-DU or the IAB-donor-DU is referred to as child node and the neighbour node of the IAB-MT is referred to as parent node. The direction toward the child node is referred to as downstream while the direction toward the parent node is referred to as upstream. The IAB-donor performs centralized resource-, topology- and route management for the IAB topology.\nBackhaul transport\nThe F1 interface between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU uses the protocol stack and security protection defined in Rel-15.\nOn the wireless backhaul, the Backhaul Adaptation Protocol (BAP) has been introduced, which is a L2 sub-layer that carries the IP layer for the F1 interface and enables routing over multiple hops. The IP layer can also be used for non-F1 traffic, such as OAM traffic.\nOn each backhaul link, the BAP PDUs are carried by BH RLC channels. Multiple BH RLC channels can be configured on each BH link to allow traffic prioritization and QoS enforcement. To support a large quantity of BH RLC channels on each BH link, e.g., for fine-granular QoS support, an extended logical channel ID (eLCID) has been introduced.\nThe IAB-MT further establishes SRBs (carrying RRC and NAS) with the IAB-donor-CU. For IAB-nodes operating in ENDC, the IAB-MT also establishes one or more DRBs with the IAB-donor-CU, which can be used, e.g., to carry OAM traffic. These SRBs and DRBs are transported between the IAB-MT and its parent node over Uu access channel(s).\nOn the BAP sublayer, packets are routed based on the BAP routing ID, which is carried in the BAP header. The BAP routing ID consists of BAP address and BAP path ID, where the BAP address indicates the destination node of the packet on the BAP sublayer, and the BAP path ID indicates the routing path the packet should follow to this destination.\nThe BAP sublayer further supports flow control in downstream direction, where the IAB-node sends feedback information on available buffer size to its parent node.\nTo reduce UL scheduling latency over multiple hops, the Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE has been introduced, which can be sent by the IAB-node to its parent-node based on expected rather than the buffered data.\nFor IAB-nodes using ENDC, backhauling is only supported via the NR link.\nIAB-node integration\nA network integration procedure was defined for IAB-nodes. For IAB-nodes using SA mode, this procedure consists of three phases.\nIn phase 1, the IAB-MT selects a suitable parent node and connects to the network in the same manor as a UE including RRC connection setup with IAB-donor-CU, authentication with the core network, context management and bearer establishment. Prior to connection establishment, The IAB-MT determines if a parent node supports IAB based on an the IAB-support indicator broadcast in SIB1. The IAB-MT further indicates IAB capability to the network during the RRC connection setup. The IAB-donor-CU forwards this indicator to the core network which authorizes IAB operation in return.\nIn phase 2, the IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels and the BAP sublayer to enable transport of the backhaul to the new IAB-node. Further, IP addresses can be allocated by RAN or OAM. These IP addresses are used by the IAB-DU for backhauling of F1 traffic.\nIn phase 3, the IAB-DU is established using the Rel-15 F1 setup procedure. The IAB-node includes the BAP address it obtained via RRC in phase 2 into F1-C to indicate collocation of IAB-MT and IAB-DU to the IAB-donor-CU.\nThe network integration for IAB-nodes using ENDC uses a similar procedure. In phase 1, the IAB-node first connects to an eNB, which selects and adds the IAB-donor as a SN.\nTopology adaptation\nThe following procedures have been defined to allow the IAB network to dynamically change its topology under operation:\nIAB-node migration procedure: This procedure allows the IAB-node to change its parent node underneath the same IAB-donor. The procedure is initiated by the IAB-donor-CU. It leverages handover for the IAB-MT using SA mode and the SN-change procedure for the IAB-MT using ENDC. The IAB-donor further configures BH RLC channels and updates the BAP sublayer so that backhauling can occur via the target path. F1 may be migrated to the new IP addresses that have been allocated to the IAB-DU, if any.\nTopological redundancy procedure: This procedure enables the establishment and release of redundant paths in the IAB-topology underneath the same IAB-donor-CU. The procedure is initiated by the IAB-donor-CU. It leverages SN-addition for the IAB-MT using SA mode. The IAB-donor further configures BH RLC channels and updates the BAP sublayer so that backhauling can also occur over the SCG link. The IAB-donor can further configure multiple different routes on the BAP sublayer. This route redundancy may be used for IP multi-homing of F1-C to provide robustness. It may further be used for load balancing, where F1-U GTP tunnels are assigned to separate routes. The routes are configured by the IAB-donor-CU. For IAB-MT using ENDC, user plane traffic can only be exchanged via NR. F1-C, however, can be routed via NR and/or via LTE/X2.\nBackhaul RLF recovery procedure: This procedure enables IAB-nodes in SA mode to migrate to another parent node underneath the same IAB-donor-CU, when the IAB-MT declares backhaul RLF. The procedure is initiated by the IAB-MT upon observation of BH RLF and uses RRC Connection Reestablishment. When RLF recovery fails, the IAB-MT may send an RLF indication to its child nodes, so that they can try to perform RLF recovery.\nPHY-layer specifications\nThe following physical layer procedures have been introduced for the support of IAB:\nOver-the-air time synchronization: The IAB-nodes and IAB-donor-DUs within the IAB-topology are assumed to operate time-synchronized. The IAB-DU may use the downlink signal received by the collocated IAB-MT from a parent, as a reference to control its downlink timing using TA in conjunction with an additional Tdelta parameter signalled via MAC-CE\nInter node discovery: An IAB-node can be configured to transmit and receive SSB signals to discover neighbouring IAB-nodes. The configuration is expected to not create a conflict between the IAB-DU SSB transmissions and the SSB measurement windows configured for the collocated IAB-MT.\nRandom Access by IAB-MT: For IAB-MTs, a separate IAB-specific random access configuration can be provided in addition to the UEs’ random access configuration. The IAB-specific random access configuration may be obtained by extending the random access configurations defined for UEs via scaling the periodicity and/or offsetting the position of the RACH occasions.\nIAB Resource configuration: The IAB-donor-CU can confine the resources used by the schedulers on an IAB-DU or IAB-donor-DU to account for multiplexing constraints among BH and access links in the IAB topology. The configuration assigns an attribute of Hard, Soft or Unavailable to each symbol of each serving cell.\nScheduling can occur for symbols configured as Hard, whereas scheduling cannot occur, except for some special cases, for symbols configured as Unavailable. For symbols configured as Soft, scheduling can occur conditionally based on explicit or implicit indication by the parent node. Explicit indication refers to signalling by the parent node to the collocated IAB-MT via PDCCH, which explicitly permits the usage of a designated Soft resource. Implicit indication refers to the autonomous determination whether a Soft resource can be used by the IAB-DU without creating a conflict for the collocated IAB-MT to follow its parent’s scheduling commands.\nRF and RRM requirements\nRAN4 decided to define following RRM requirements for IAB-MT nodes:\nRRC Connected State mobility: The random access requirements of IAB-MTs were agreed to be same as those of UEs. For defining RRC re-establishment and RRC release with redirection requirements of IAB-MTs, RAN4 used the same requirements of UEs as a starting framework and then modified these further to accommodate higher periodicity of SMTC windows in IAB nodes.\nTiming: The transmit timing and timing adjust requirements of IAB-MTs are same as those of UE requirements. The cell phase synchronization accuracy requirement of IAB-DUs is same as that for Rel-15 gNBs.\nSignalling Characteristics: RAN4 agreed to define radio link monitoring, beam failure detection and candidate beam detection requirements for IAB-MTs. To define these requirements, RAN4 used the same requirements for Rel-15 UEs as a starting framework and then relaxed some of the evaluation periods by additional scaling factors because IAB-MTs are static nodes.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] \t RP-200840: WID on integrated access and backhaul\n[2] \t RP-200839: Status Report for integrated access and backhaul\n",

The UE maintains connection with source gNB after receiving CHO configuration, and starts evaluating the CHO execution conditions for the candidate cell(s). If at least one CHO candidate cell satisfies the corresponding CHO execution condition, the UE detaches from the source gNB, applies the stored corresponding configuration for that selected candidate cell, synchronises to that candidate cell and completes the RRC handover procedure by sending RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the target gNB. The UE releases stored CHO configurations after successful completion of RRC handover procedure.\nUpon failure, the UE will perform CHO if the selected cell is CHO candidate cell and it is the first time of recovery and if the network allows CHO based recovery.\nConditional PSCell Change (CPC)\nConditional PSCell Change is a PSCell change procedure that is executed only when PSCell execution condition(s) are met.\nTo improve the robustness, the network can provide the up to 8 candidate cell configuration(s) associated with execution condition (s) to UE. If CPC is configured in the RRCReconfiguration, the UE maintains connection with source PSCell after receiving CPC configuration, and starts evaluating the CPC execution conditions for the candidate PSCell(s). If at least one CPC candidate PSCell satisfies the corresponding CPC execution condition, the UE detaches from the source PSCell, applies the stored corresponding configuration for the selected candidate PSCell and synchronises to that candidate PSCell. The UE completes the CPC execution procedure by an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN which includes an embedded RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the new PSCell if SRB3 is not configured, otherwise the UE sends RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the new PSCell directly.\nUpon SCG failure, same as MR-DC, the UE will transmit the SCG Failure Information message to the MN.\nIn Rel-16, conditional handover based NR PSCell addition/change for any architecture option with NR PSCell is supported, but limit to intra SN change without MN involvement.\nT312 based fast failure recovery\nT312 based solution (same as LTE) is used for both PCell and PSCell. The motivation of T312 is to speed up RLF recovery procedure by triggering re-establishment procedure sooner using a shorter timer than T310.

Such a configuration may be particularly useful when there is not a desire to allocate downlink NR resources in a 2nd downlink carrier, e.g. for an EN-DC configuration with the SDL band as part of the secondary cell group (SCG).\nThis work item allows the uplink and downlink of the introduced bands to be from 2 different licensed spectrum blocks, and new paired bands are defined in the RF specifications as n91, n92, n93 and n94.\nSystem parameters\nSystem parameters for the new variable duplex FDD bands are defined in all the related RAN4 specifications including, operating bands, channel bandwidth, rasters, Tx-Rx separation, etc.\nOperating bands and NR-ARFCN\nNewly introduced variable duplex bands have the same UL frequency parts as in SUL bands either n81 or n82, while they also have the same DL frequency parts as in SDL bands n75 or n76.\nA note 9 is specified in the table that says ‘Variable duplex operation does not enable dynamic variable duplex configuration by the network, and is used such that DL and UL frequency ranges are supported independently in any valid frequency range for the band’. This comes from the concern that the operator may want to dynamically configure the duplex distance used in the network.\nChannel bandwidth\nSince the frequency parts of the variable duplex FDD bands are acquired independently, asymmetric bandwidths must be introduced to accommodate most of the desired deployments.\nHence other bandwidth configurations of the variable duplex FDD bands follow what was defined for the corresponding UL or DL bands that are consisted of.\nTx-Rx separation\nIt is worth noting that Tx-Rx separation is defined in a different way for the variable duplex bands since the default separation no longer applies with them.\nNote 2 says that the range of Tx-Rx frequency separation given paired UL and DL channel bandwidths BWUL and BWDL is given by the respective lower and upper limit FDL_low – FUL_high + 0.5(BWDL + BWUL) and FDL_high – FUL_low – 0.5(BWDL + BWUL). The UL and DL channel bandwidth combinations specified in Table 5.3.5-1 and 5.3.6-1 depend on the subcarrier spacing configuration μ.\nUE requirements\nUE requirements considering the characteristics when operating in the variable duplex bands and band combinations are defined including REFSENS and related configurations.\nREFSENS and UL configurations\nREFSENS requirements follow the ones defined for n75 and n76 correspondingly for the variable duplex bands but UL configurations are not necessarily the same with those defined for n8 and n20. For n20, additional restrictions on the UL RBs are specified so that the same REFSENS value can be achieved with such a narrow duplex distance. Since the variable duplex bands have much larger expected Tx-Rx separation, additional restrictions on the UL RB allocations are not specified.\nBS requirements\nIn this work item, BS requirements span among a series of specifications such as 38.104, 38.141-1, 37.104, 37.105, 37.141, 37.145-1, 37.145-2, 36.104, 36.141, etc. Mainly coexistence requirements are defined in these specs.\nAdditional spurious emission requirements\nRespective requirements which correspond to BS spurious limits for co-existence with systems operating in the new variable duplex FDD bands are introduced in the mentioned spec, with maximum measured spurious levels and bandwidth configurations.\nOut of band blocking requirements\nAnother set of Tx requirements is also defined with the similar manner as the above one. The requirements apply when co-location with other BS-s operating in the variable duplex FDD bands is observed.\nReceiver response under co-location requirements\nReceiver response requirements are defined in the mentioned specifications that the BS operating in the introduced bands should have the ability to block unwanted interband interferences from any other collocated BS.\nFor all the above mentioned BS requirements, both conducted and radiated requirements are defined.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-192820, “Revised WID: Introduction of NR FDD bands with variable duplex and corresponding framework”, Huawei, HiSilicon.\n[2]\tRP-192818, “Status report for WI: Introduction of NR FDD bands with variable duplex and corresponding framework”, Huawei, HiSilicon.\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-190144.\nRel-14 NR study showed that duplexing flexibility with cross-link interference mitigation shows better user throughput compared to static UL/DL operation or dynamic UL/DL operation without interference mitigation in indoor hotspot (4GHz and 30GHz) and urban macro scenarios (4GHz and 2GHz). Furthermore, semi-static and/or dynamic DL/UL resource assignments should also consider coexistence issues particularly among different operators where tight coordination are challenged. For efficient coexistence, not only coexistence requirements need to be understood but also advanced mechanisms to mitigate interference such as TRP-to-TRP measurement and adaptation based on measurements should be considered. The Rel-16 Work Item Cross Link Interference (CLI) handling to support flexible resource adaptation for unpaired NR cells achieves the following objectives [1]:\n•\tCLI measurements and reporting at a UE (i.e., CLI-RSSI and SRS-RSRP), and network coordination mechanism(s) (i.e., exchange of intended DL/UL configuration) are developed.\n•\tPerform coexistence study to identify conditions of coexistence among different operators in adjacent channels is accomplished.\nIn NR deployment on lower TDD frequency, the impact of the troposphere bending will continue existing if no special mechanisms are introduced. In the RIM SI, the frameworks for mechanisms for gNBs to start and terminate the transmission/detection of reference signal(s), the functionalities and requirements of the corresponding RS(s) as well as the design of the RS(s), and the backhaul-based coordination mechanisms among gNBs have been studied. It is recommended to specify RIM RS(s) to support identifying remote interference related information, it is also recommended to specify the inter-set RIM backhaul signalling via the core network for backhaul-based solution. The Rel-16 Work Item Remote Interference Management (RIM) to deal with mitigation of the remote interference caused by gNBs achieves the following objectives [1]:\n•\tRIM RS resource and configurations, and the inter-set RIM backhaul signalling via the core network to convey the messages of “RIM-RS detected” and “RIM-RS disappeared are developed.\n•\tCorresponding OAM functions to support RIM operation is identified.\n\nCLI handling\nOnce different TDD UL/DL configurations are applied among neighboring cells, UL transmission from a UE in a cell causes interference to DL reception of some other UEs in the rest of the neighboring cells. The interference is referred as inter-cell UE-to-UE cross link interference (CLI). To mitigate an inter-cell UE-to-UE CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate the intended TDD UL/DL configuration over Xn and F1 interfaces. Taking into account the exchanged information, a gNB may decide the transmission and reception pattern in order to avoid CLI to neighboring cell or from neighboring cell.\nFor CLI handling, two types of CLI measurements and reporting (i.e., CLI-Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement and SRS-Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurement) are specified. For CLI-RSSI measurement, the victim UE measures the total received power over configured CLI-RSSI measurement resource. For SRS-RSRP measurement, the victim UE measures the RSRP over configured SRS resource(s) which is/are transmitted from one or multiple aggressor UE(s). Then, Layer 3 filtering can be applied to the measurement result for both CLI-RSSI measurement and SRS-RSRP measurement. For measurement result reporting for both CLI-RSSI measurement and SRS-RSRP measurement, event triggered and periodic reporting are supported. Furthermore, CLI measurement and reporting can be configured for NR cells in multi-carrier option.\nSemi-static and/or dynamic DL/UL resource assignment causes interferers between networks on adjacent channels. It has been tasked to investigate the adjacent channel co-existence effects arising when CLI, or more generically dynamic TDD is operated in an aggressor network. The technical report captures a description of the adjacent channel interference effects that arise with dynamic TDD as well as a simulation investigation of adjacent channel interference in a number of different deployment scenarios [2].\n\nRIM\nDue to the atmospheric ducting phenomenon, the DL signals of an aggressor cell in unpaired spectrum can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell in the same unpaired spectrum bandwidth that is far away from the aggressor cell. Such interference is termed as remote interference. A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs may execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells.\nTo mitigate remote interference, RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs are specified. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. In both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set can simultaneously transmit an identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.\nIn the wireless framework, RIM-RS (RIM reference signal) type 1 and RIM-RS type 2 are specified. Upon reception of the RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement, and may send back a RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 2) carrying the aggressor set ID if configured, and may undertake interference mitigation actions. The RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 2) sent by the aggressor is able to facilitate estimation whether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon between victim and aggressor sets exists.\nIn the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement, establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul messages which carry the detection or disappearance indication are aggregated at gNB-CU via F1 interface and sent from individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim gNBs via NG interface, where the signalling is transparent to the core network.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] RP-193190\t“Revised WID on Cross Link Interference (CLI) handling and Remote Interference Management (RIM) for NR”\n[2] 3GPP TR38.828\t“Cross Link Interference (CLI) handling and Remote Interference Management (RIM) for NR”\n\n",

This enables the 5G commercial deployment requirements on FR1 fulfilled.\nIn Rel-15, almost-contiguous allocations for CP-OFDM was introduced for power class 3 UE.

In Rel-16, RAN4 continues the work and completed RF requirement for HPUE on almost-contiguous CP-OFDM allocations.\nFR1 Intra-band contiguous DL CA is up to 200MHz aggregated channel bandwidth in Rel-15. Based on commercial deployment requirement, RAN4 enhances intra-band contiguous DL CA to 300MHz in Rel-16, the corresponding RF requirements are completed within this WI. Meanwhile, intra-band non-contiguous DL CA is introduced considering latest 5G spectrum allocation is some country/region.\nIn correspondence, FR1 intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous UL CA are also introduced from Rel-16, all RF requirements are completed within the WI. Besides RF requirement, RAN4 also recognized the dependency relation among bandwidth class, PA architecture and MIMO layer for UE capability indicating. Additional DC location reporting UE capability is introduced to improve UL 256QAM performance for intra-band UL CA.\nIn Rel-15, inter-band UL CA, SA SUL and inter-band EN-DC RF requirements are specified assuming 0us switching period between 2 UL carriers when TDM operated, it leads to that UE cannot support 2Tx transmission when UE switch to one carrier if no switching period is reserved for the UE.

For which, time mask including switching period and transient period between 2 carriers are specified. For inter-band UL CA and SA SUL, the switching periods are located in either NR carrier as indicated in RRC signalling, while for inter-band EN-DC, the switching periods are only located in NR carrier. In correspondence, UE capability on uplinkTxSwithingPeriod is introduced as 35μs, 140μs and 210μs (210μs only for inter-band UL CA and SA SUL). Meanwhile, UE DL interruption is allowed when configured with difficult band combinations.\nTime masks for ULSUP-TDM that accounts for UL timing misalignment between the EUTRAN and NR cell groups are further modified in this WI, additional 2.2μs transient is added.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n",

Basis for the WI was the features that were not developed in REL15 due to lack of time.\nThe following enhancements were introduced:\n1.\tMPE: UE can report to network how much P-MPR it uses or is going to use because of MPE. Based on this reporting network can take actions to prevent sudden radio link failures.\n2.\tBeam correspondence: Requirements for SSB-based and CSI-RS based BC were developed. This allows network to efficiently deploy different beam widths for SSB and CSI-RS. This enables e.g. to deploy wider SSB based beams for idle mode UEs and narrower CSI-RS based beams for RRC connected mode UEs.\n3.\tInterband DL CA: Requirements were developed for band combination CA_n260-n261 based on independent beam management.\n4.\tDL Intra-band CA BW Enhancement: New frequency separation classes Fs were introduced for up to 2400 MHz separation. Furthermore frequency separation classes for DL-only spectrum Fsd were introduced. The DL-only frequency spectrum is the width of UE frequency spectrum available to network to configure DL CCs only, and it extends on one-side of the bidirectional spectrum in contiguous manner with no frequency gap between the two.\n5.\tNon-contiguous intra-band uplink CA: Requirements were developed for n260 for up to three uplink sub-blocks.\n6.\tMPR enhancements: Zero dB MPR range was extended to cover more allocations.\n7.\tOutput power boost when in-band emissions are suspended: 1 dB boost was introduced for QPSK modulation.\n8.\tMultiband relaxation framework enhancement: Based on RAN5 LS MBR framework was modified. REL15 retains original MBR concept but introduced a relaxation cap.

In particular, the RRM requirements for the following procedures are introduced in the scope of the work item:\n-\tSRS carrier switching\n-\tMultiple Scell activation/deactivation\n-\tCGI reading with autonomous gap for NR capable UE\n-\tBWP switching on multiple CCs\n-\tInter-band CA requirement for FR2\n-\tInter-frequency measurement without MG\n-\tMandatory measurement gap patterns\n-\tSpatial relation switch for uplink\n-\tUE specific channel BW change\nThe corresponding changes are captured in TS 38-series and 36-series specifications [3]-[8].\nSRS carrier switching RRM requirements\nSRS carrier switching functionality was defined for NR and LTE carriers in the scope of the Rel-15 NR WI [2], however, the respective requirements were not introduced in the Rel-15 scope. In the Rel-16 NR RRM Enhancements WI the specific UE interruption requirements for the SRS carrier switching are defined for the following cases:\n-\tLTE SRS carrier switching impacting NR CC\n-\tNR SRS carrier switching impacting LTE CC\n-\tNR SRS carrier switching impacting NR CC\nThe corresponding interruption RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 8.2 and TS36.133 clause 7.32.2.13.\nMultiple SCell activation/deactivation RRM requirements\nIn accordance to NR design multiple SCells can be activated/deactivated simultaneously. However, in Rel-15 only single SCell activation/deactivation NR RRM requirements were specified which resulted in an inefficient use of network resources. In the Rel-16 NR RRM Enhancements WI, te SCell activation and deactivation delay and interruption requirements for the case of multiple SCell activation/deactivation in FR1, FR2, and FR1+FR2 are introduced. The corresponding RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 8.3.7 and 8.3.8.\nCGI reading with autonomous gap for NR capable UE\nIn Rel-16, the acquisition of CGI information from a neighbouring cell using autonomous gaps is supported. The NR cell CGI reading requirements are defined for NR capable UE in LTE SA, NR SA UE, EN-DC UE, NE-DC UE, and NR-DC. Besides that, the requirements for LTE cell CGI reading for NR SA UE, EN-DC UE, NE-DC UE, and NR-DC UE are defined. The RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 8.2, 9 and TS36.133 clause 7.32.2, 7.37, 7.36.2.\nBWP switching on multiple CCs\nThe Rel-15 NR UE BWP switching requirements covered the scenario where a network configured BWP switching on a single component carrier. In practice, the network may configure BWP switching on multiple component carriers and a predictable UE behavior is important. In Rel-16 NR RRM Enhancements WI the requirements for both simultaneous and non-simultaneous BWP switching on multiple CCs, covering DCI based, timer based and RRC based BWP switching are defined. The respective RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 8.6.2A, 8.6.2B and 8.6.3A.\nInter-band CA requirement for FR2\nThe support of the FR2 inter-band CA was introduced in the scope of the FR2 RF WI [9]. In particular, the functionality to support independent beam management on the different CCs was introduced in the scope of [9]. The RRM requirements for inter-band CA requirement for FR2 UE measurement capability of independent Rx beam are defined in the scope of the NR RRM enhancements WI. The RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 9.2.5 and 9.5.6.\nInter-frequency measurement without MG\nIn Rel-15 NR, all the inter-frequency measurements have to be done within measurement gap. However, from UE implementation perspective inter-frequency measurement can be done without MG (inter-frequency RRM measurement and serving cell data reception/transmission can be done concurrently) under certain conditions. In Rel-16, RAN4 defines conditions under which UE can perform inter-frequency measurement without MG. RAN4 also introduces corresponding RRM requirement for CSSF update, which can be found in TS38.133 clause 9.1.5.\nMandatory measurement gap patterns\nOnly measurement gap patterns 0 and 1 are mandatorily supported in Rel-15. However, some other measurement gap patterns are also very important in balancing gap overhead and measurement performance. In Rel-16 additional mandatory measurement gap patterns were defined in Rel-16.\n•\tGP#17, GP#18 and GP#19 shall be additional mandatory\n•\tGP#2, GP#3 and GP#11 shall be additional mandatory for NR only measurement\nBesides, a capability to support measurement gap patterns for NR only measurements was introduced. Definition of NR only measurement gaps can be found in TS38.133 Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3.\nSpatial relation switch for uplink\nUplink spatial relation can be changed since Rel-15. However, in Rel-15 RAN4 only specified RRM requirements for downlink spatial relation change. In Rel-16, delay requirements for spatial relation switch for uplink channels and SRS are defined. Corresponding requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 8.12.\nUE specific channel BW change\nBoth active BWP and UE specific channel BW can be dynamically changed in Rel-15. However, in RAN4 RRM only active BWP change requirements were specified in Rel-15. In Rel-16, RRM requirements for UE specific channel BW change are defined. Corresponding requirement can be found in TS38.133 clause 8.2.1.2.11, 8.2.2.2.8 and 8.13.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-201112\tRevised WID: NR RRM enhancement in R16, Intel Corporation, ZTE Corporation, Apple\n[2]\tRP-191971\tRevised WID: New Radio Access Technology\n[3]\tTS 38.133\n[4]\tTS 38.331\n[5]\tTS 38.306\n[6]\tTS 36.133\n[7]\tTS 36.331\n[8]\tTS 36.306\n[9]\tRP-200668\tRevised WID on NR RF Requirement Enhancements for FR2\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in RP-202803, becoming the CR in SP-211558.\nThis work item introduces enhanced specification support for several key aspects on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) operation where Rel.15 NR was found deficient in terms of spectral efficiency, downlink/uplink transmit power efficiency, signalling latency, and signalling overhead.\nFirst, although high-resolution downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) can be made available to the gNB by the Type-II CSI (thereby facilitating high DL spectral efficiency), the associated uplink (UL) reporting overhead is prohibitively high. This would burden the system since such high-resolution DL CSI is typically used with large number of users per cell.\nSecond, Rel.15 mainly focuses on single-TRP-based transmission/reception with ideal backhaul from UE perspective. Enhancements for Multi-TRP/panel transmission are to further improve DL data rate and spectral efficiency by fully utilizing multi-TRP/panel simultaneously with non-coherent joint transmission (NCJT) in ideal/non-backhaul conditions, or further exploit spatial diversity with time/frequency domain repetition to improve transmission reliability.\nThird, although Rel.15 supports flexible beam management (BM) functionality to accommodate various implementation and usage scenarios, Rel.15 BM signaling framework could require a large amount of signaling for updating beam RS and pathloss reference RS for respective DL and UL signals when the best DL-UL beam pair is changed frequently due to UE mobility, rotation, or beam blockage. Therefore, in Rel.16, five features were introduced for the purpose of BM signaling overhead and latency reduction. Additionally, in Rel.15, L1-RSRP-based beam measurement and reporting are supported. To facilitate interference-aware beam selection, L1-SINR-based beam measurement and reporting were introduced. Finally, in Rel.15, beam failure recovery (BFR) is supported only for spCell. To improve the performance and reliability for SCell, BFR for SCell was introduced.\nFourth, a high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) issue identified for Rel.15 DM-RS for PDSCH, PUSCH and PUCCH format 3 and 4 was corrected by defining new Rel.16 DM-RS which have the same PAPR as its associated data/control channel.\nFifth, in Rel.15 UL codebook-based transmission, the non-coherent and partial-coherent codebook subsets –especially with lower rank transmission– cannot reach the maximum output power (declared by the UE) with power scaling mechanism. Three modes of UL full-power transmission and three UE capabilities are specified to accommodate different power amplifier (PA) architectures.\n\nFor Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission, the Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) codebook is designed to represent dominant channel eigenvectors for multiple SBs with high-resolution. In matrix form, this corresponds to an   channel matrix as shown in Figure 1, where  is number of SBs, and the k-th column of  corresponds to channel eigenvector for SB k.\nThe figure depicts a channel matrix, illustrating the distribution of signal strength across different channels in a 5G network. The matrix shows the signal strength at the transmitter (Tx), the receiver (Rx), and the path between the two. This helps in understanding the signal propagation and interference patterns in a 5G network.\nFigure 1 Channel matrix.\nThe Rel. 15 Type II CSI is based in compressing (columns of)  in spatial domain (SD) by performing linear combination (LC) of  SD basis vectors that comprise columns of matrix . In particular, an eigenvector e of the channel is expressed as a LC of L Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) vectors: . This is illustrated in Figure 2. The PMI codebook is used to report the following components:\n: DFT vectors  reported common for all SBs (WB reporting); and\n: amplitude and phase of coefficients  reported independently for each SB (SB reporting).\nThe figure depicts a linear combination based Rel. 15 Type II CSI feedback, illustrating the process of combining CSI data with a linear combination of the received signal strength (RSS) and the CSI feedback. This method is used to improve the accuracy of CSI feedback in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 2 Linear combination based Rel. 15 Type II CSI feedback.\nAlthough Rel. 15 Type II CSI can offer large performance gain, the overhead (number of bits) to report Type II CSI is  which can be excessively large (cf. Table 1).\nTable 1 Rel. 15 Type II CSI reporting payload (bits) for 10 SBs\n\nThe Rel.15 Type II CSI compresses (columns of)  in SD by performing LC using SD basis matrix , and there is no compression across rows of  in frequency domain (FD). The LC coefficients that combine columns of  matrix is given by columns of matrix . It is well-known that each row of  matrix (that corresponds to  FD components such as frequency SBs) comprises LC coefficients that are correlated. This correlation in FD can be exploited to reduce Type II CSI payload without significant impact on throughput performance.\nIn the Rel.16 enhanced Type II CSI,  is compressed in both SD and FD by performing LC using L SD DFT basis vectors, i.e. columns of  for SD compression, and M FD DFT basis vectors, i.e. columns of  for FD compression.

The figure shows the two-way radio (2TRP) transmission and reception equipment, including the transmitter and receiver, as well as the two-way radio (2TRP) communication system.

The figure highlights the importance of proper communication equipment and the need for reliable communication systems in various real-world applications.\nFigure 5 Two-TRP (DL) transmission/reception\n\nTo improve DL date rate, both single-DCI and multi-DCI based non-coherent joint transmission (NCJT) are supported.\nFor multi-DCI-based NCJT transmission, up to 4 transmission layers per PDSCH, a UE may expect to receive two PDCCHs scheduling two fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs respectively in time and frequency domain with same/different PDSCH scrambling ID(s). When the UE is scheduled with fully or partially overlapping PDSCHs, the UE is not expected to assume DM-RS ports in a CDM group indicated by two TCI states. Some configurations related to two received PDSCHs, e.g. active BWP, etc are expected to be same from UE perspective.  The UE can be expected to rate match around configured CRS patterns which are associated with the value of CORESETPoolIndex, i.e. per TRP basis, and applied to the corresponding PDSCH.\nFor PDCCH monitoring, two TRPs are implicitly associated with two CORESET groups, i.e. up to 3 CORESETs per TRP, respectively each of which can be identified by the value of CORESETPoolIndex. The maximum number of BD/CCE in a serving cell can be doubled for two TRPs but the maximum number of BD/CCE per TRP remains to be same as Rel.15.\nScheduling timeline can be relaxed to support out-of-ordered PDCCH to PDSCH, PDSCH to HARQ-ACK, and PDCCH to PUSCH depending on UE capability considering different backhaul conditions between two TRPs.\nBoth intra-slot separated HARQ-ACK (per TRP basis) and joint HARQ-ACK feedback (across two TRPs) are supported and specified for type-1 and type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in order to facilitate different backhaul conditions.\nLast but not least, the maximum number of active TCI states in a serving cell can be doubled by independent activation from two TRPs but the maximum number of active TCI states per TRP remains the same as Rel.15.\nFor single-DCI-based NCJT transmission, up to 8 transmission layers, each TCI code point can correspond to one or two TCI states (so as to 2-port PTRS if applicable) activated by MAC-CE. When 2 TCI states are indicated by DCI, the first TCI state corresponds to the CDM group of the first antenna port indicated by the antenna port indication table (e.g. the first TRP), and the second TCI state corresponds to the other CDM group (e.g. the second TRP). Additional new DMRS entry {0,2,3} with two CDM groups without data is supported to improve the flexibility of NCJT scheduling.\n\nThe figure depicts a single-DCI-based NCJT (Non-Circular Jetty) system, which is a type of wireless communication technology. The figure shows a single-DCI (Direct Current Interface) terminal, which is a type of wireless communication device. The NCJT system is designed to provide a reliable and efficient wireless communication solution, with a focus on reducing power consumption and improving signal quality. The figure also includes a description of the system's architecture, including the use of a single-DCI terminal, distributed nodes, and a network control unit (NCU). The figure provides a visual representation of the system's design and functionality, making it easier to understand and compare with other wireless communication technologies.\nFigure 6 Single-DCI-based NCJT\n\nTo improve DL transmission reliability with multi-TRP/panel, following transmission schemes are supported with single DCI and configured by higher layer signalling:\n'FDMSchemeA': When two TCI states, i.e. two TRPs, are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to 'FDMSchemeA', the UE shall receive single PDSCH transmission occasion of the TB with each TCI state associated to a non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation in a manner of comb-like PRGs allocation (or half/half for wideband).\n'FDMSchemeB': When two TCI states, i.e. two TRPs, are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to 'FDMSchemeB', the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with each TCI state associated to non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation in a manner of comb-like PRGs allocation (or half/half for wideband).\n'TDMSchemeA'  (Intra-slot): When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to 'TDMSchemeA', the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with each TCI state associated to a PDSCH transmission occasion which has non-overlapping time domain resource allocation with respect to the other PDSCH transmission occasion. Both PDSCH transmission (corresponding to two TRPs respectively) occasions with mapping Type B only shall be received within a given slot with a symbol-level gap configured by StartingSymbolOffsetK.\n“repetitionNumber-r16” (Inter-slot): When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionNumber-r16 in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation-r16, the UE may expect to be indicated with one or two TCI states in a codepoint of the TCI field. When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI, the UE may expect to receive multiple slot level PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with two TCI states associated to repetitionNumber-r16 consecutive slots (up to 16). Each PDSCH transmission occasion is expected to have the same SLIV. The UE may be configured with either cyclicMapping or sequentialMapping for given TCI state mapping pattern.\nEach PDSCH transmission occasion is limited to up to two transmission layers for above transmission schemes targeting at reliability improvement and indicated DMRS port(s) are expected to within one CDM group. The redundancy version for PDSCH transmission occasions associated with the second TCI state is shifted with respect to the value of by sequenceOffsetforRV-r16 if applicable.\nAdditionally, default beam assumptions for FR2 are specified for receiving PDSCH, CSI-RS and PDCCH/PDSCH overlapping in case of single-DCI and multi-DCI based multi-TRP/panel transmission.\n\nFor the purpose of BM signaling overhead/latency reduction, the following features were introduced:\nDefault spatial relation/pathloss reference RS\nDefault spatial relation/pathloss reference RS for dedicated PUCCH\nDefault spatial relation/pathloss reference RS for PUSCH\nDefault spatial relation/pathloss reference RS for SRS\nSimultaneous TCI/spatial relation update across multiple CCs\nSimultaneous TCI state ID activation for CORESET\nSimultaneous TCI state ID(s) activation for PDSCH\nSimultaneous spatial relation activation for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS\nPUCCH spatial relation activation/deactivation per PUCCH resource group\nMAC CE based spatial relation indication for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS\nMAC CE based pathloss reference RS update for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS and PUSCH\nFirst, the feature of default spatial relation/pathloss reference RS was introduced to reduce/omit UL specific beam/pathloss reference RS indication signaling, mainly targeting single beam UE that meets DL/UL beam correspondence requirement. In this mode of operation, spatial relation RS, i.e. UL beam RS, and pathloss reference RS does not need to be signalled to UE, and UE shall use a specific DL beam RS, e.g. the DL beam RS for the lowest ID CORESET, as for the spatial relation RS and the pathloss reference RS. Above operation can be enabled for dedicated PUCCH, SRS, and/or PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0_0 by respective RRC enablers.\nSecond, simultaneous update of DL/UL beam RS across multiple CCs was introduced. Up to two CC lists can be configured by RRC for DL and UL, respectively. Once a DL beam RS ID is activated for a CORESET in a CC by MAC CE, the RS(s) with the same RS ID are activated in other CC(s) in the same CC list. Once one or more DL beam RS ID(s) are activated for PDSCH in a CC by MAC CE, the RS(s) with the same RS ID(s) are activated in other CC(s) in the same CC list. Once a spatial relation RS is activated for an aperiodic or semi-persistent SRS resource in a CC by MAC CE, the same RS is activated as spatial relation RS for the SRS resource(s) with the same resource ID in other CC(s) in the same CC list.\nThird, in Rel.15, PUCCH spatial relation can be activated/deactivated per resource level, meaning that 128 MAC CEs may need to be signalled to UE for updating spatial relation for all PUCCH resources in the worst case. Based on above motivation, resource grouping based PUCCH spatial relation activation/deactivation was introduced. Up to four PUCCH resource groups can be configured by RRC per BWP, and one MAC CE can activate/deactivate a common spatial relation RS for all the PUCCH resources in the same group.\nFourth, in Rel.15, spatial relation for aperiodic SRS is configured by RRC only, which may lead to unnecessary RRC overhead for configuring a sufficient number of SRS resources or large latency for RRC reconfiguration. Based on above motivation, MAC CE based spatial relation indication for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS was introduced. One MAC CE can update spatial relation(s) of one SRS resource set, where different spatial relation can be indicated per resource within the resource set.\nFifth, in Rel.15, pathloss reference RSs for UL power control for PUSCH and SRS can only be configured by RRC. Since up to four pathloss RSs can be configured in Rel.15, it could often require RRC reconfiguration according to UE mobility and considering gNB/UE beamforming. Based on above motivation, MAC CE based pathloss reference RS update for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS and PUSCH was introduced. For this operation, the maximum configurable number of pathloss reference RSs by RRC was increased to 64, and the new MAC CE can activate up to four pathloss reference RSs among them. Two MAC CEs were introduced for SRS and PUSCH, respectively.\nTo facilitate interference-aware beam selection, L1-SINR-based beam measurement and reporting were introduced. The gNB can configure UE to measure and report L1-SINR based on SSB/CSI-RS. The following resource settings for L1-SINR measurement have been supported:\nL1-SINR measurement based on CSI-RS configured for beam management (BM) as channel measurement resource (CMR) and interference measurement resource (IMR)\nL1-SINR measurement based on SSB as CMR and CSI-IM\nL1-SINR measurement based on CSI-RS configured for BM as CMR and CSI-IM\nL1-SINR measurement based on SSB as CMR and non-zero-power (NZP) interference measurement resource (IMR)\nL1-SINR measurement based on CSI-RS configured for BM as CMR and NZP-IMR\nIn addition, to improve performance and reliability for SCell, BFR for SCell was introduced. The procedure for SCell BFR is illustrated in Figure 7 below.\nThe beam failure detection (BFD) is based on periodic 1-port CSI-RS for BM, and the procedure is the same as spCell BFD.\nThe candidate beam detection (CBD) is based on SSB and CSI-RS for BM, and the procedure is similar to spCell BFD, where cross-CC CBD is supported.\nThe BFRQ report can include two steps\nStep 1: UE sends a SR over PUCCH for BFR (which is dedicatedly configured) to indicate beam failure and request resource for BFR MAC CE report\nIf the SR is not configured, contention based PRACH can be used\ngNB’s response is the same as normal SR procedure\nStep 2: UE sends a BFR MAC CE to gNB, which conveys the following information\nFailed CC index\nWhether a new beam is identified or not\nRS resource ID representing identified new beam\nAfter receiving the BFR MAC CE, gNB can send a PDCCH to schedule a new transmission for the same HARQ process used to transmit BFR MAC CE\nAfter 28 symbols after UE receives the response, UE can apply the newly identified beam to all CORESETs and PUCCH resources in the CC reported by BFR MAC CE\nThe figure depicts a SCell BFR procedure, which is a method used in wireless communication to improve the performance of a cellular network by combining multiple base stations (BSs) into a single cell. The figure shows the steps involved in the procedure, including the selection of the optimal BSs, the placement of the SCell, and the synchronization of the network. The figure is important for understanding the complexity of the SCell BFR and its impact on the overall performance of the network.\nFigure 7 SCell BFR procedure\n\nIt was identified that Rel.15 DM-RS for the PDSCH/PUSCH using non-transform precoded (CP-) OFDM waveform has a high PAPR issue, for transmissions of rank-2 and above. The issue occurs when DM-RS ports from different DM-RS CDM groups are linearly combined through the same power amplifier. The root cause of the issue was identified to be the use of the same DMRS sequence for all DMRS ports. In addition, for transform precoded OFDM, it was identified that when pi/2-BPSK modulation is used, then the PAPR of the PUSCH or PUCCH is lower than for the associated DM-RS which is a problem as different OFDM symbols will have different PAPR.\nIn Rel.16, the above issues were resolved as follows:\nFor CP-OFDM PDSCH and PUSCH by letting the DM-RS sequence, , depend on the antenna port association to the CDM group index . This ensured that antenna ports in different CDM groups have different DM-RS sequences and this effectively removes the PAPR issue.\nFor transform precoded PUSCH or PUCCH format 3 and 4, in all cases with pi/2-BPSK modulation, the Rel-16 low PAPR DM-RS sequences are introduced by applying a DFT-spread before being mapped to the time-frequency resource grid. In this case, pseudo-random (PRBS) or computer generated based pi/2-BPSK or 8-PSK sequences are used instead of the Rel.15 direct use of (i.e. non-DFT precoded) Zadoff-Chu sequences (see Figure 8).  This means that Rel.16 DMRS will have similar sequence characteristics as the associated pi/2-BPSK modulated data/control and by then have similar PAPR, which resolves the high PAPR issue.\nThe figure depicts a low PAPR DM-RS formation in a 2-PSK modulation scheme, with a pi/2-BPSK modulation scheme. The figure illustrates the formation of a DM-RS, which is a type of modulation scheme used in wireless communication systems. The DM-RS is a combination of two different modulation schemes, allowing for more efficient use of the available bandwidth. The figure also shows the use of a pi/2-BPSK modulation scheme, which is a type of modulation scheme that uses a combination of two different modulation schemes. The figure is important for understanding the different modulation schemes used in wireless communication systems and their impact on the performance of the system.\nFigure 8 pi/2-BPSK/8-PSK low PAPR DM-RS formation\nFour related UE capabilities were introduced:\nFG 16-4 Low PAPR DMRS for PDSCH\nFG 16-6a Low PAPR DMRS for PUSCH without transform precoding\nFG 16-6b Low PAPR DMRS for PUCCH format 3 and 4 with transform precoding and with pi/2 BPSK\nFG 16-6c Low PAPR DMRS for PUSCH with transform precoding and with pi/2 BPSK\n\n2.5 \tUplink (UL) full-power transmission\nThree modes of operation are specified in Rel.16 as optional UE capabilities: fullpower, fullpowerMode1, fullpowerMode2. The UE can report one of the supported modes.\nfullpower: This mode targets the UEs with full-rated PAs. Using a 2-Tx PC3 non-coherent UE as an example, the UE is equipped with two 23dBm PAs. As shown in Figure 9, the UE transmits UL PUSCH using 1 antenna when the indicated TPMI is {1   0} with Rel.16 power scaling factor s=1. This implies that the transmit power is equally split among non-zero PUSCH antenna(s) thereby enabling the UE to deliver maximum output power.\nThe figure depicts a 'fullpower' operation, which is a critical step in the power management process of a 5G network. It illustrates the various stages of power allocation, including the initial power allocation, the power-on-load (POL) phase, and the power-off-load (POL) phase. The figure also highlights the importance of power management in ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of 5G networks.\nFigure 9 ‘fullpower’ operation\nfullpowerMode1: A new TPMI subset is added. For a UE supporting non-coherent capability, a non-antenna selection TPMI is added with the same power scaling as in Rel.15. Figure 10 shows an example of a 2-Tx PC3 UE where each PA cannot deliver maximum output power. A new codebook subset for rank=1 includes {1  0}, {0  1}, {1  1}. With precoder {1  1}, the PC3 UE can transmit with total maximum output power of 23dBm on PUSCH. However, similar to Rel.15, precoders {1  0} and {0  1} do not deliver maximum output power.\nThe figure depicts the 'fullpowerMode1' operation in a 5G network, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. It shows how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 10 ‘fullpowerMode1’ operation\nfullpowerMode2: To deliver maximum output power through TPMI reporting and antenna virtualization:\nWith multiple SRS resources configured in a set with different number of SRS ports (up to 4 SRS resources can be configured in a set): Using a 2 Tx non-coherent UE as an example, the gNB configures 2 SRS resources in a set where one SRS resource is configured with 1 port and another SRS resource is configured with 2 ports. The gNB indicates SRI corresponding to 1-port SRS while scheduling single layer transmission, and SRI corresponding to 2-port SRS while scheduling two-layer transmission.\n2) UE indicating full power TPMI/TPMI groups: Using as an example a 2-Tx non-coherent PC3 UE with PA architecture shown in Figure 11 where one PA is 23dBm and another 20dBm. The UE indicates TPMI=0 (i.e. precoder {1  0}) as full-power TPMI. When the gNB indicates full-power TPMI while scheduling PUSCH, the UE assumes power scaling factor s=1; when the gNB indicates non-full-power TPMI while scheduling PUSCH, the UE assumes Rel.15 power scaling mechanism. For 2Tx UE, UE can report 2 bits, bit-map on {TPMI=0, TPMI=1}. For a 4-Tx UE, to support non-coherent and partial-coherent implementations, seven TPMI groups {G0, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6} are specified. A 4-Tx non-coherent UE can report capability to indicate 2-port TMPIs using 2-bit bitmap and one of 4-port non-coherent TPMI groups from G0~G3. A 4-Tx partial coherent UE can report capability to indicate 2-port TMPIs using 2-bit bitmap, one of 4-port non-coherent TPMI groups from G0~G3, and one of 4-port partial-coherent TPMI groups from G0~G6.. The TPMI groups G0~G6 are defined in TS 38.306.\nThe figure depicts the 'fullpowerMode2' operation in a 5G network, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. The figure shows how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 11 ‘fullpowerMode2’ operation\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n\n[1] \tR1-1913604, Samsung, RAN1 agreements for NR_eMIMO\n",

This transfer of data over 8 releases is an exceptional case: Instead of creating Rel-8 specs and step-by-step upgrade to higher releases via CRs (which would be the normal approach), it was decided with the specs manager to bring v1.N.0 of TS 37.46x for 1-step approval to RAN #83 and instead of approving them to vN.0.0 it was decided to approve them the same version as the last 25.46x version that is created via the CRs.\n2. The text shown in TS 37.46x is taken 1:1 from the corresponding TS 25.46x showing changes of the contents via revision marks (note: spec cover and history adaptations are done without revision marks). The changes are mainly to indicate the considered RATs in the scope, to replace 25.46x references by 37.46x references and to correct obvious problems. Further technical changes of the contents of the specifications may rather be considered in a future cat.F CR (and probably just focusing on the latest releases).\n3. There is also a TS 25.463 which exists for Rel-6 and Rel-7 only. TS 25.466 replaced TS 25.463 in Rel-7 and future releases. This means for Rel-6 TS 25.463 is still valid and cannot be withdrawn. Rel-7 is no longer maintained i.e. no CRs are possible i.e. 3GPP internal references to TS 25.463 could not be corrected anymore, so also 25.463 Rel-7 will not be withdrawn but it will be clarified on the 3GPP webpage that for Rel-7 TS 25.466 should be considered instead of TS 25.463.\n4. References of Rel-16 and higher should refer to TS 37.46x instead of TS 25.46x. Changes of existing references of Rel-8 to Rel-15 specifications of TS 25.46x may be corrected to references to TS 37.46x but such a change is not mandatory as 25.46x Rel-8 to Rel-15 will remain. A further upgrade of 25.46x Iuant specs to Rel-16 and higher will not be considered. Rel-16 and higher specifications shall refer to TS 37.46x.\nFollowing this transfer, RAN3 agreed to transfer the ownership of the clauses currently owned by RAN4 in TS 37.461 back to RAN3.

Direct data forwarding encompasses the following two main features:\n-\tWhile data forwarding between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN nodes in Rel-15 foresees establishing the data forwarding path via the EPC and the 5GC, direct data forwarding allows establishing the data forwarding path directly between the involved RAN nodes, without the need to interact with user plane functions of the EPC and the 5GC.\n-\tIndirect data forwarding for inter-system handover in Rel-15 foresees transporting to be forwarded user plane data between the NG-RAN node and the UPF via PDU Session tunnels. As forwarding paths on the E-UTRAN side are established on a per-E-RAB basis, the Rel-15 solution requires interworking functions at the UPF and the NG-RAN node in order to map per-DRB / per-E-RAB packets to the per-PDU Session tunnel and vice versa. Such interworking is not necessary in case of direct data forwarding.\nIn the course of the WI RAN3 realised that direct data forwarding tunnel related information may be communicated between the NG-RAN node and the 5GC in a way that the inter-system handover signalling performance benefits from such approach, which was realised in the agreed CRs in [3] and [4].\nFurther, SA2 and CT4 where contacted to perform necessary work in their areas of responsibility [5].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] RP-182886\t\"New WID: Direct data forwarding for inter-system mobility\", approved at RAN#82\n[2] RP-191369\t\"Status report of WI: Core part: Direct data forwarding between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN nodes for inter-system mobility\"\n[3] R3-192626\t\"Support of Direct Data forwarding for handover between 4G and 5G\", agreed CR0041r4 38.413\n[4] R3-193272\t\"Introduction of direct and indirect data forwarding for inter-system HO between EPS and 5GS\", endorsed CR 38.300\n[5] R3-193284\t\"LS on Finalization of Direct Data Forwarding feature\", agreed LS out to SA2 and CT4\n",

This is addressed by introducing idle/inactive measurements for DC/CA, allowing SCG/SCell configuration during transition from idle/inactive state, introducing dormant SCell in NR, introducing fast recovery from MCG link failure, introducing support for asynchronous NR-DC operation and cross carrier scheduling with different numerologies. Changes triggered by the work item are captured into TS 36-, 37- and 38-series specifications.\nThe key functionalities introduced in this work item include the following:\n•\tSupport for asynchronous NR-DC: Allowing non-co-located deployments by relaxing synchronization requirements for gNBs involved in NR-DC operation. Both semi-static and dynamic uplink power control is supported for deployments with bands of the same frequency range in MCG and SCG.\n•\tIdle/inactive measurement reporting: Allowing the eNB to assign UE to do measurements during IDLE or INACTIVE that the network can use for when the UE enters CONNECTED mode.\no\tThis may include limitations on which cells are measured, how long the measurements are done and in which cells the measurements are applicable.\no\tUE can indicate the availability of the measurements at connection setup or resume, and network can decide whether to query them via RRC reporting.\n•\tDirect SCG/SCell configuration: Allowing the network to configure the UE to store the SCG/SCell configuration upon transition to INACTIVE state, so that it can be quickly restored upon transition back to CONNECTED, thus minimizing signaling overhead and latency.\n•\tNR SCell Dormancy: SCell dormancy is introduced for NR. The UE does not monitor PDCCH on the dormant BWP for an SCell, but continues performing RRM/CSI measurements, AGC and beam management, if configured.\no\tSwitching between dormant and normal operation is network controlled and reuses the existing Bandwidth Part (BWP) framework of NR. One dormant BWP can be configured for an SCell. DCI is used to control entering/leaving the dormant BWP.\no\tThe SpCell and PUCCH SCell cannot be configured with a dormant BWP.\n•\tFast MCG link recovery: Support fast recovery from MCG link failure by allowing the UE in MR-DC to send an MCG Failure Information message to the MN via the SCG upon the detection of a radio link failure on the MCG. Based on measurement information received in MCG Failure Information message the network can then determine the correct action to restore the MCG connection, e.g. change of PCell.\no\tFast MCG link recovery requires that both UE and network support the feature, and that the UE is configured with either split SRB or SCG SRB.\no\tThe UE initiates the RRC connection re-establishment procedure if it does not receive a reconfiguration message from the network within a certain time after fast MCG link recovery was initiated.\n•\tCross-carrier scheduling with different numerologies: Support for cross carrier scheduling in carrier aggregation, with different numerology on the scheduling and scheduled carriers.\n•\tCA with unaligned frame boundary: Support for NR inter-band carrier aggregation with slot alignment, but with unaligned frame boundary and partial SFN alignment.\n•\tEnhancements to single Tx switched uplink for EN-DC: Various improvements introduced for using the reference TDD pattern, e.g. support is added for LTE TDD PCell and for dual-Tx UL. LTE PRACH operation is not restricted by the reference TDD pattern.\n•\tAperiodic CSI-RS triggering with different numerologies: Support for triggering Aperiodic CSI-RS with different numerology between CSI-RS and triggering PDCCH is introduced.\n•\tMinimum requirements for NR-DC: RF requirements for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-200791, Revised WID on DC and CA enhancements, Ericsson, RAN#88e\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Apple Inc. in RP-202581.\nDynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) is an important feature that allows for sharing existing spectrum between the LTE and NR carriers, thus enabling smoother transition from LTE and faster adoption of NR. After the RAN#86 meeting, a new WI was agreed [1] aiming to analyse and introduce, if needed, changes to support dynamic spectrum sharing in band 48/n48 frequency range, which is also known as the CBRS band.\nThe first version of the WI had the following objectives:\n-\tChannel raster: Confirm that NR channel raster can be aligned with LTE centre frequencies [RAN4];\n-\tUL shift: Specify UL 7.5kHz sub-carrier shift for 15kHz SCS. Investigate whether the 7.5kHz sub-carrier shift has any impact on the needed guard between LTE and 30kHz SCS NR. Specify the shift only if there is a clear benefit [RAN4];\n-\tSync raster: Check mechanisms to avoid overlapping transmissions between NR SSB and LTE CRS. Apply changes to ensure non overlap of NR SSB and LTE CRS if determined that solutions with existing specifications are insufficient [RAN4].\nReferring to the sync raster discussion, no consensus was reached by the RAN4#96 meeting on whether e.g. the sync pattern B can be added into band n48 definition to mitigate the negative impact of colliding NR SSB and 4-port LTE CRS transmission. The majority of companies preferred not to introduce this change at least to band n48. And even though some companies could accept sync pattern related modifications if a new band is introduced, there were concerns on whether adding a new band is a right way forward. It was decided to remove this aspect from the scope of the WI.\nFor the UL 7.5kHz shift, it was concluded to introduce this functionality into band n48 following the CBRS Alliance agreement to add 15kHz SCS as one of the mandatory deployment options. Following the outcome of similar discussions for band n38 and n40, the UL shift is enabled only for 15kHz SCS and is not supported for 30kHz SCS.\nAs for the DL channel raster alignment, RAN4 conclusion was that it is possible to shift, if needed, the centre frequency by -/+100kHz to align LTE and NR sub-carriers when SAS allocates the channel which is not on the common 300kHz raster point. RAN4 also concluded that there is no specification impact for DL transmission, i.e. it is up to the base station how to ensure emission requirements when the centre frequency is shifted by -/+100kHz. For the UL transmission, RAN4 discussed how to ensure UE emission requirements and concluded that \"for the dynamic spectrum sharing operation in band 48/n48 frequency range, what is supported in NR for both BS and UE can ensure UE emission requirements through appropriate configuration/scheduling\".\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-192427, \"New WID: LTE/NR spectrum sharing in band 48/n48 frequency range\", Apple Inc\n[2]\tRP-202580, \"Status report for LTE/NR spectrum sharing in band 48/n48 frequency range\", RAN WG4\n",

These enhancements, obtained as a result of the study in [4], are summarized as follows:\n-\tIntroduction of a new numerology for PMCH with 100us cyclic prefix and 2.5kHz subcarrier spacing for support of high mobility scenarios (up to 250km/h).\n-\tIntroduction of a new numerology for PMCH with 300us cyclic prefix and approximately 0.37kHz subcarrier spacing for support of rooftop reception.\n-\tEnhancements to PBCH and PDCCH to increase robustness in low SINR scenarios.\nThis work item also produced a TR [5] summarizing the overall aspects of LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast.\nNumerology for high speed reception\nA new numerology for PMCH with 100us cyclic prefix, 400us OFDM core symbol duration, and 2.5kHz subcarrier spacing is introduced to support high mobility scenarios (up to 250km/h). With this numerology, each OFDM symbol uses one slot (0.5ms), and a transport block is mapped to two OFDM symbols (1ms).\nAssociated to this new numerology, a single reference signal pattern (MBSFN-RS) is introduced with a time-stagger length of 2, and a frequency separation (after de-staggering) of 4 subcarriers, which gives a maximum theoretical equalization interval of 200us.\nNumerology for rooftop reception\nA new numerology for PMCH with 300us cyclic prefix, 2700us OFDM core symbol duration, and approximately 0.37kHz subcarrier spacing is introduced to support rooftop reception, especially tailored for deployments with large inter-site distance (e.g. HPHT-1 as defined in [4], with an inter-site distance of 125km).\nWith this new numerology, a new variation of frame structure type 1 is introduced. This frame structure consists of, every 40ms:\n-\tOne subframe (1ms) with 15kHz SCS, containing synchronization and system information, also named “cell acquisition subframe” (CAS)\n-\t13 slots (3ms each) carrying the PMCH with 0.37kHz SCS. Note that the time-transmission interval (TTI) for a transport block is extended to 3ms.\nThis frame structure is depicted in Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Frame structure type 1 for transmissions using f = 0.370 kHz.\nTwo reference signal patterns are introduced associated with this new numerology, with a stagger length of 2 and 4 OFDM symbols. Both of them have a frequency separation (after de-staggering) of 3 subcarriers, which gives a maximum theoretical equalization interval of 900us.\nEnhancements to cell acquisition subframes\nAs shown in [4], in some deployment scenarios the CAS will experience significantly lower SINR than PMCH due to the former being based on 15kHz subcarrier spacing. Several enhancements are introduced to enhance the performance of the CAS, and are detailed as follows:\n-\tSemistatic CFI: A semistatic value for CFI (which determines the number of symbols to be used for PDCCH in a given subframe) is indicated in MIB. This allows the UE to skip PCFICH decoding, which can become the bottleneck in low SINR conditions.\n-\tAggregation level 16: Before Rel-16, the maximum aggregation level for PDCCH was 8. Rel-16 introduces aggregation level 16 (only for MBMS dedicated cells) to enhance performance in low SINR conditions.\n-\tPBCH repetition: Similar to the scheme defined for eMTC (but with additional symbol-level rotation for interference randomization), PBCH is repeated in CAS.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-193050: “Revised WID on LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast”, RAN#86\n[2] \tRP-160675, “New WID: eMBMS enhancements for LTE”\n[3] \tTR 38.913: \"Study on scenarios and requirements for next generation access technologies\"\n[4]\tTR 36.776: “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Study on LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast”\n[5]\tTR 36.976: “Overall description of LTE-based 5G broadcast”\n",

Results of the round robin test conducted in FS_ANTeM indicated that an alternative noise field simulation provides test results equivalent to the currently specified method, while having a more efficient equalization procedure and less variance across labs at the same time. To include this new method in TS 26.132 [4], a corresponding change request [5] was agreed.\nFor speech quality evaluation of UEs under ambient noise conditions, the technical specification TS 26.132 [4] provides test methodologies. For measurements in handset mode, the background noise playback system according to ETSI ES 202 396-1 [6] is used. Within the study item FS_ANTeM, the applicability of the more recent ambient noise simulation according to ETSI TS 103 224 [7] was investigated, which provides the advantage of a fully automated calibration routine.\nThe so-called \"flexible configurations\" of ETSI TS 103 224 [7] were found to be useful, since they can be used in conjunction with the currently specified binaural noise types of TS 26.132 [4] to provide backward compatibility with the currently used simulation according to ETSI ES 202 396-1 [6].\nThe equivalency of the two noise field simulation systems was also shown by almost identical measurement results in the round robin test (comprehensive results of this study are provided in TR 26.921 [3]).

The concept of \"configurable trace\" has been introduced where the management trace activation is represented by the act of Managed Object Instance (MOI) creation. The new TraceJob Information Object Class (IOC) also known as \"Trace control NRM fragment\" has been specified for this purpose in the Generic NRM TSs 28.622 [1] and 28.623 [2]. The creation, deletion and modification of the MOIs based on the new IOC does not require a dedicated API and is performed by the means of Provisioning Management Service (Provisioning MnS) specified in TS 28.532 [3]. The corresponding content (concepts, requirements, definitions) has been added to the family of trace specifications (TSs 32.421 [4] and 32.422 [5]), while all the dependencies on the legacy Trace Management IRP and legacy functional architecture have been eliminated.\nTR 28.806 [8] identified and documented use cases for collecting Cell and UE data for analytics, and for Collecting subscriber and equipment trace data for near-real-time diagnostics and troubleshooting. It established that enabling the capabilities for trace data to be delivered to the consumer(s) while it's still relevant to the analytics, diagnostics and troubleshooting tasks performed by the consumer is important. The normative work on streaming trace data reporting leveraged the model-driven approach to the trace management and SBMA framework (TS 28.533 [7]). It added the new use cases and requirements for streaming trace to TS 32.421 [4], addressed all relevant trace control and configuration management aspects in TS 32.422 [5] and specified the serialization format for the streaming trace records in TS 32.423 [6]. The initial work on a dedicated Streaming Trace data reporting MnS has been further extended and generalized into support of additional streaming data types such as Streaming PM, Streaming Analytics and proprietary data. The new Streaming data reporting MnS has been fully specified in TS 28.532 [3] it includes a RESTful HTTP based solution set for streaming connection establishment and connection/stream meta-data exchange and an efficient protocol stack for high volume/high speed streaming data reporting based on WebSockets. The use of SBMA framework does not limit the consumers and producers of the new MnS to 3GPP Management Functions and supports the use cases where 3GPP Network Element (NE) reports management data (Trace, PM, Analytics and proprietary) to any authorized MnS consumer.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTS 28.622 \"Telecommunication management; Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)\"\n[2]\tTS 28.623 \"Telecommunication management; Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions\"\n[3]\tTS 28.532 \"Management and orchestration; Generic management services\"\n[4]\tTS 32.421 \"Telecommunication management; Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace concepts and requirements\"\n[5]\tTS 32.422 \"Telecommunication management; Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace control and configuration management\"\n[6]\tTS 32.423 \"Telecommunication management; Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace data definition and management\"\n[7]\tTS 28.533 \"Management and orchestration; Architecture framework\"\n[8]\tTS 28.806 \"Study on non-file-based trace reporting\"\n",

Support of 5GC Service-Based Architecture (SBA)\nIn the Rel-16 NRM, ManagedNFService InformationObjectClass (IOC) is introduced to represent a Network Function (NF) Service as defined in TS 23.501. This enhancement enables configuration management, performance management, fault management, state management, as well as lifecycle management on more granular NF Service level.\nFigure 1 shows containment and inheritance relationship between the ManagedNFService IOC and other existing NRM IOCs (defined in TS 28.622 [1]).\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a Managed NF Service NRM fragment, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The diagram includes a base station (BS), a network resource manager (NRM), a network function virtualization (NFV) controller, and a network function virtualization (NFV) fabric. The NRM is responsible for managing the NFV services, while the NFV controller manages the NFV fabric. The NFV fabric is the backbone of the NFV service, connecting the various NFV services and enabling their deployment and management.\nFigure 1: Managed NF Service NRM fragment diagram\nIn addition, TS 28.541 [3] is enhanced to support NF Service configuration and registration.\n2. Support of model driven approach\nTo align with the Service Based Management Architecture (SBMA) since Rel-15, configurable Performance Management (PM), Fault Management (FM), TM (Trace Management), etc., are introduced to fully support a model driven approach. Several NRM fragments were added in TS 28.622 [1] (stage 2 definition) and TS 28.623 [2] (stage 3 definition), including Performance measurement control NRM fragment, Measurement threshold monitoring control fragment, Heartbeat notification control fragment, Notification subscription control fragment and Trace control NRM fragment. Please see the overall diagram below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overall diagram of NRM fragment for FM, PM, TM control\nNote: Managed Entity can be a subnetwork, managed network element or network function\n3. Support of NG RAN and 5GC features\nThe 5G NRM is extended to support new or existing features or functionalities of NG RAN and 5GC, e.g. Remote Interference Management, Radio Resource Management policy for radio resources sharing between network slices and operators, New Radio (NR) Automatic Neighbour Relation (NAR), QoS monitoring, configurable 5QI, and transport related information model to support end to end network slice management. Refer to TS 28.541[3]\n4. Enhancement of stage 3 codes to follow style guideline\nRefact stage 3 YAML and YANG codes in TS 28.541[3] and 28.623[2] to align with new code style guideline defined in TS 32.158 [4] and TS 32.160 [5].\n\n5. Publication and validation in 3GPP Forge\nStage 3 codes, including YAML and YANG solution sets, are uploaded to 3GPP Forge for validation and the OpenAPI code (including YAML code defined NRM) and YANG code is published.

It can be found in the table located just below the clause's header. The table has the following format:\nTable B-1: table format\n\nFor readability reasons, the table headers are omitted in the continuation of the present document.\nFor instance, for the \"Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment\", the table has to be understood as:\nTable B-2: Example of table at the introduction of each Feature\n\nThus, the UID for this Work Item is 700029.\nTwo methods are now possible to retrieve more information on a given feature: the \"Step by step method\" and the \"Direct method\". The \"direct method\" is faster but implies to know the hierarchical structure of the Work Items. The \"step by step method\" is slower but is easier to use, in particular when the hierarchical structure is unknown.\nFor instance, for retrieving all the CRs that relate to \"Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk\", the search has to be done on UID 740022 but also potentially on its children Work Items (UID 720056, 740023 and 740024).\nTable B-3: Example of a hierarchical structure and its consequences on the search procedure\n\nThese two methods are described in the following clauses.\n",
