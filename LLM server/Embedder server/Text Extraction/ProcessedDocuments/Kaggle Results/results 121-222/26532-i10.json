A given Data Reporting Configuration comprises instructions and other information to be followed/used by data collection clients in their collection, processing and reporting to the Data Collection AF of UE data for the associated application service. In addition, a Data Reporting Configuration instance may contain data exposure restrictions for use by the Data Collection AF in controlling access by consumers to event data pertaining to the UE data that it has collected.\nThe provisioning process begins with the Provisioning AF using the procedures defined in clause 4.2.3.2 to create a Provisioning Session resource as an umbrella for subsequent Data Reporting Configuration resources.\nThe process then proceeds with the Provisioning AF using the procedures defined in clause 4.2.3.3 to provide the Data Collection AF with one or more Data Reporting Configuration resources. Each set of provisioning information pertains to one application, identified by its External Application Identifier, and one type of exposed event, uniquely identified in the 5G System by its Event ID, as defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3].\nPrior to provisioning of data collection and reporting , the Provisioning AF shall create a new Provisioning Session. The following CRUD operations are used to manage Provisioning Session resources. Additional details are provided under clause 6.\nThis procedure shall be used by the Provisioning AF to create a new Provisioning Session. The HTTP POST method shall be used for this purpose.\nUpon successful creation, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a 201 (Created) response message that includes the resource identifier of the newly created Provisioning Session in the body of the reply, and along with the URL of the resource, including its resource identifier, shall be returned as part of the HTTP Location header field.\nThis procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to obtain the properties of an existing Provisioning Session from the Data Collection AF. The HTTP GET method shall be used for this purpose.\nThe Update operation is not allowed on Provisioning Session resources.\nThis procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to destroy a Provisioning Session. The Data Collection AF shall use the HTTP DELETE method for this purpose.\nAs a side-effect of destroying a Provisioning Session, the Data Collection AF shall release any associated resources, purge any cached data, and delete all UE data reporting configurations associated with this Provisioning Session.\nUpon the successful creation of a Provisioning Session, the Provisioning AF shall use the procedures defined in this clause to configure UE data collection and reporting functionality specific to an application in the Data Collection AF. This clause defines the basic procedures. Additional details are provided under clause 6.3.\nA given instance of a Data Reporting Configuration resource is identified by the dataReportingConfigurationId property of the DataReportingConfiguration resource, and applies to one type of data collection client. The properties of this resource, as defined in the following clauses, pertain to UE data collection and reporting by different data collection clients to the Data Collection AF, and control of access by different consumer entities to event data exposed by the Data Collection AF.\nThe type of a Data Reporting Configuration resource is identified by the dataCollectionClientType property of the DataReportingConfiguration resource as specified in clause 6.3.2.2.\nNOTE 1:\tThe dataCollectionClientType property corresponds to the Data collection client type parameter in table 4.6.2-1 of TS 26.531 [7].\nThe Data Reporting Configuration resource shall include one or more sets of instructions for data collection clients on the collection and reporting of UE data to the Data Collection AF, and may contain one or more sets of data exposure restrictions, expressed as Data Access Profiles (see clause 6.3.2.3), each one determining the level of access by event consumer entities to the event-related UE data reported to the Data Collection AF. A Data Access Profile defines the granularity of access to a particular subset of collected event data parameters for the Event ID of concern. This granularity is expressed as a set of data aggregation functions along the time, user, and location dimensions. The subset of parameters to be exposed is identified using a controlled vocabulary specific to the Event ID. An authorization procedure is in place to determine which Data Access Profile is granted to a particular event consumer entity.\nNOTE 2:\tThe process of matching event consumers to Data Access Profiles is implementation-specific and therefore beyond the scope of the present document.\nThis procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to create a Data Reporting Configuration resource within the scope of a particular Provisioning Session. The HTTP POST method shall be used for this purpose and the request message body may include a DataReportingConfiguration resource, as specified under clause 6.3.2.2.\nUpon success, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a 201 (Created) response message and the resource URL for the newly-created Data Reporting Configuration resource shall be returned in the Location header field.\nIf the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide an error response status code as defined in clause 5.3.3.\nThis procedure may be performed multiple times to provision different Data Reporting Configurations in the scope of a particular Provisioning Session.\nThis procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to obtain the properties of an existing Data Reporting Configuration resource from the Data Collection AF. The HTTP GET method shall be used for this purpose.\nIf successful, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a 200 (OK) and the requested DataReportingConfiguration resource shall be returned in the body of the HTTP response message.\nIf the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide an error response status code as defined in clause 5.3.3.\nThe update operation is invoked by the Provisioning AF to initially upload the representation of a Data Reporting Configuration resource created using the procedure in clause 4.2.3.3.3 or, in the case of an existing Data Reporting Configuration resource, to entirely replace or modify certain properties of that resource. All available properties may be updated. The HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT methods shall be used for the update operation.\nIf the procedure is successful, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a 200 (OK) reflecting the successful update operation.\nIf the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide a response code as defined in clause 5.3.3.\nThis operation is used by the Provisioning AF to destroy a Data Reporting Configuration resource and to terminate the related UE data reporting procedure. The HTTP DELETE method shall be used for this purpose.\nAs a result, the Data Collection AF should release any associated resources, deliver any pending data to subscribed recipients, as appropriate to the Event ID in question, and delete any corresponding configurations.\nIf the procedure is successful, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a 200 (OK) response message.\nIf the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide an error response status code as defined in clause 5.3.3.\n",

                            "text_content": "Indirect reporting operation involves first a UE Application instance sending domain-specific UE data to an Application Service Provider (ASP) server instance across reference point R8. That UE data is passed from to an Indirect Data Reporting Client function operated by the Application Service Provider to be subsequently sent as data reports, possibly in processed form, to a Data Collection AF instance. Operation of the latter procedure is conditioned upon the Indirect Data Collection Client having acquired its data collection and reporting configuration from the Data Collection AF by means of the Ndcaf_DataReporting service (either directly across the reference point R3 or via an equivalent service exposed by the NEF, depending on whether the Indirect Data Collection Client and the Data Collection AF reside in the same or separate trust domains).\nThe Indirect Data Collection Client shall obtain its configuration by invoking the Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation, as described under clause 7.2,2,3.1.\nThe configuration information is contained in a generic data collection and reporting configuration envelope that shall include at minimum the baseline configuration parameters defined in clause 4.6.3 of TS 26.531 [7]. In particular, the configuration shall specify the domain-specific parameters associated with the specified Event ID(s) to be reported to the Data Collection AF.\nThe call flow in figure 4.2.4.2-1 shows the interaction between the Indirect Data Collection Client and the Data Collection AF at the initial configuration of the Indirect Data Collection Client.\nThe figure depicts the initial configuration of an Indirect Data Collection Client (IDC) in a 5G network. It shows the client's connection to the base station (gNB) and the network's infrastructure, including the gNB, user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of SDN principles for network management.\nFigure 4.2.4.2-1: Initial configuration of Indirect Data Collection Client\nThe steps in this procedure are as follows:\n1.\tThe Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3.1). A DataReportingSession resource entity (see clause 7.3.2.1) is included in the request message body, but only properties externalApplicationId and supportedDomains are present (because the other properties are unknown to the Indirect Data Collection Client).\n2.\tIn its 201 Created response, the Data Collection AF provides a DataReportingSession resource entity in the message body, which expands the content of the request message body in step 1 by adding the properties sessionId, validUntil, reportForDomains and reportingCondition. The validUntil property of the provided DataReportingSession should be a time in the future.\nThe Indirect Data Collection Client is now configured.\nThe data collection and reporting configuration may change as a result of subscriptions to events exposed by the Data Collection AF, for example, as a result of narrower or wider filters applied to an event subscription. There are two ways for a modified data collection and reporting configuration to be acquired by the Indirect Data Collection Client:\n1.\tThe Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_RetrieveSession service operation (see clause 4.2.4.3.2).\n2.\tThe Data Collection AF supplies a DataReportingSession in response to a data report submitted by the Indirect Data Collection Client (see clause 4.2.4.3.3).\nThis operation is typically performed when the validUntil property of the current DataReportingSession stored in the Indirect Data Collection Client is about to expire.\nThe figure depicts a client interface for an indirect data collection system, with a focus on the DataReportingSession. The client retrieves up-to-date data from the DataReportingServer, which is connected to the DataReportingClient via an indirect data collection path. The DataReportingClient then sends the data to the DataReportingServer, which in turn sends the data to the DataReportingServer. The client interface includes a user interface for managing the data collection process, with options to retrieve data, update data, and delete data.\nFigure 4.2.4.3.2-1: Indirect Data Collection Client retrieves up-to-date DataReportingSession\nThe steps in this procedure are as follows:\n1.\tThe Indirect Data Collection Client requests the DataReportingSession for the current session by using the Ndcaf_DataReporting _RetrieveSession service operation (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.1).\n2.\tThe Data Collection AF provides the latest DataReportingSession in the message body of a 200 OK response. The validUntil property of the provided DataReportingSession should be a time in the future. In addition, the Data Collection AF may change properties reportForDomains and reportingCondition.\nSee clause 4.2.6.\nThe Indirect Data Collection Client may destroy a Data Reporting Session and the data collection and reporting configuration it represents by invoking the Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession service operation.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an indirect data collection client is destroying a DataReportingSession, which is a crucial component in the DataReportingSessionManager. This client is responsible for collecting data from the DataReportingSession, which is a session that is used to collect data from a network device. The figure shows the destruction of the DataReportingSession, which can lead to a loss of data and potentially affect the performance of the network.\nFigure 4.2.4.4-1: Indirect Data Collection Client destroys DataReportingSession\nThe steps in this procedure are as follows:\n1.\tThe Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.3).\n2.\tThe Data Collection AF acknowledges the destruction of the session and its configuration with a 204 No Content response.\n",

The configuration shall specify the domain-specific parameters associated with the specified Event ID(s) to be reported to the Data Collection AF.\nThe call flow in figure 4.2.5.2-1 shows the interaction between the Application Server and the Data Collection AF at the initial configuration of the Application Server.\nThe figure depicts the initial configuration of an Application Server, showing the server's IP address, port number, and the associated user and group information. The server is configured to run on a Linux operating system, with a default user account and a default group. The server is also configured to use a default IP address and a default subnet. The server is configured to use a default DNS server and a default DNS zone. The server is configured to use a default web server and a default web root.

A DataReportingSession resource entity (see clause 7.3.2.1) is included in the request message body, but only properties externalApplicationId and supportedDomains are present (because the other properties are unknown to the Application Server).\n2.\tIn its 201 Created response, the Data Collection AF provides a DataReportingSession resource entity in the message body, which expands the content of the request message body in step 1 by adding the properties sessionId, validUntil, reportForDomains and reportingCondition. The validUntil property of the provided DataReportingSession should be a time in the future.\nThe Application Server is now configured.\nThe data collection and reporting configuration may change as a result of subscriptions to events exposed by the Data Collection AF, for example, as a result of narrower or wider filters applied to an event subscription. There are two ways for a modified data collection and reporting configuration to be acquired by the Application Server:\n1.\tThe Application Server invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_RetrieveSession service operation (see clause 4.2.5.3.2).\n2.\tThe Data Collection AF supplies a DataReportingSession in response to a data report submitted by the Application Server (see clause 4.2.5.3.3).\nThis operation is typically performed when the validUntil property of the current DataReportingSession stored in the Application Server is about to expire.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with two application servers, one at the top and one at the bottom, each responsible for retrieving up-to-date DataReportingSession data. The top server is responsible for retrieving the latest data, while the bottom server is responsible for storing the data. The figure also includes a network diagram with various components such as routers, switches, and network devices.\nFigure 4.2.5.3.2-1: Application Server retrieves up-to-date DataReportingSession\nThe steps in this procedure are as follows:\n1.\tThe Application Server requests the DataReportingSession for the current session by using the Ndcaf_DataReporting _RetrieveSession service operation (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.1).\n2.\tThe Data Collection AF provides the latest DataReportingSession in the message body of a 200 OK response. The validUntil property of the provided DataReportingSession should be a time in the future. In addition, the Data Collection AF may change properties reportForDomains and reportingCondition.\nSee clause 4.2.7.\nThe Application Server may destroy a Data Reporting Session and the data collection and reporting configuration it represents by invoking the Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession service operation.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a network scenario with a focus on the application server, DataReportingSession, and its destruction. The figure shows the network topology, including the application server, DataReportingSession, and the destruction of the session. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network's layers, such as the application server, DataReportingSession, and the destruction of the session. The figure provides a clear understanding of the network's structure and the actions taking place within it.\nFigure 4.2.5.4-1: Application Server destroys DataReportingSession\nThe steps in this procedure are as follows:\n1.\tThe Application Server invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.3).\n2.\tThe Data Collection AF acknowledges the destruction of the session and its configuration with a 204 No Content response.\n",

The number of elements in the array may additionally be constrained by normative text in the Description column.\n4.\tThe Cardinality column defines whether a property is optional or mandatory. An array with cardinality 0 indicates that the array property is optional in the data structure. An array with cardinality 1 indicates that the property is mandatory in the data structure, even when the array is empty.\n5.\tThe keyword Object in the Data type column indicates a structured sub-object of an unnamed type whose properties are defined inline in the indented table rows immediately afterwards. The Object type may be combined with the Array type.\n6.\tIn the case of data types specifying RESTful resources, the additional Usage column defines the property behaviour for each CRUD Operation as follows:\n-\t\"C\" (Create), \"R\" (Read) and \"U\" (Update) refers to the CRUD procedure during which the property is present in the resource type. (The Delete operation never takes any input data type.)\n-\t\"RO\" signifies a read-only property. Only the API provider function is permitted to modify the property value. The API invoker can only read the value.\n-\t\"RW\" signifies a read/write property. The API provider and API invoker may both modify the property value.\n7.\tAn additional read-only property (denoted \"C: —\" and \"R: RO\") is included at the start of all data models defining resources that are members of a RESTful collection. This property is populated by the API provider at the point of creation with the unique identifier of the resource within its parent collection, and the value of this property corresponds to the leaf path element in the RESTful URL of the created resource.\n",
