The NF service consumer is a device that enables NF applications to run on a network. The figure shows the NF service consumer creating a configuration file, which is a text file that contains the necessary information for the NF application to function correctly. The NF service consumer is also shown creating a configuration file in the cloud, which is a virtual environment where NF applications can be hosted and managed. The figure also shows the NF service consumer creating a configuration file in the local area network (LAN), which is a network within a building or a building's network. The NF service consumer is shown creating a configuration file in the network function virtualization (NFV) environment, which is a virtualized environment where NF applications can be hosted and managed. The NF service consumer is shown creating a configuration file in the network function virtualization (NFV) environment, which is a virtualized environment where NF applications can be hosted and managed.

The NF service consumer is shown creating a configuration file in the network function virtualization (NFV) environment, which is\nFigure 4.2.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer create the configuration\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure service operation to create the configuration(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nmfaf-3dadatamanagement/<apiVersion>/configurations\" as Resource URI representing the \"MFAF Configurations\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create a configuration for an \"Individual MFAF Configuration\" according to the information in message body. The MfafConfiguration data structure provided in the request body\nshall include:\n-\ta description of the configurations as \"messageConfigurations\" attribute that, for each configuration, the MessageConfiguration data type shall include\n1)\ta notification URI of Data Consumer or Analytics Consumer or other endpoint where to receive the requested mapping data or analytics as \"notificationURI\" attribute; and\n2)-\tif the configuration is used for mapping analytics or data collection, a Notification Correlation ID for the Data or Analytics Consumer (or other endpoint) as \"correId\" attribute;\nand may include:\n1)\t the formatting instructions as \"formatIstruct\" attribute;\n2)\tthe processing instructions as \"procIntruct\" attribute or \"multiProcInstructs\" attribute if the \"MultiProcessingInstruction\" feature is supported;\n3)\tthe MFAF notification information to identify the Event Notifications received from the NWDAF or Data Source NF (e.g. AMF, SMF), which can be sent to the consumer or other notification endpoints, as \"mfafNotiInfo\" attribute;\n4)\tNF instance identifier of the ADRF as \"adrfId\" attribute; and\nx)\tthe notification endpoints within the \"notifEndpoints\" attribute, if the \"DataAnaCollect\" feature is supported.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nmfaf-3dadatamanagement/<apiVersion>/configurations\" as Resource URI and MfafConfiguration data structure as request body, the MFAF shall:\n-\tcreate a new configuration;\n-\tassign a transaction reference id;\n-\tif no MFAF notification information has been provided in the request, determine the MFAF notification information and add it to the configuration that is created and will be returned to the NF service consumer;\n-\tstore the configuration.\nIf the MFAF created an \"Individual MFAF Configuration\" resource, the MFAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, step 2.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the MFAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the MFAF to update the configuration of mapping data or analytics (as shown in 3GPP TS 23.288 [14])\nThe figure depicts a network service consumer's configuration for NF service updates. It shows the various components and their corresponding statuses, such as active, pending, and failed, to ensure efficient and timely updates.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates configuration\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure service operation to update the configuration(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nmfaf-3dadatamanagement/<apiVersion>/configurations/{transRefId}\" as Resource URI representing the \"Individual MFAF Configuration\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual MFAF Configuration\" resource identified by the {transRefId}. The MfafConfiguration data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\ta description of the configurations as \"messageConfigurations\" attribute that, for each configuration, the MfafConfiguration data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in 4.2.2.2.2.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nmfaf-3dadatamanagement/<apiVersion>/configurations/{transRefId}\" as Resource URI and MfafConfiguration data structure as request body, the MFAF shall:\n-\tupdate the configuration of corresponding transaction reference Id; and\n-\tstore the configuration.\nIf the MFAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT request, the MFAF shall update an \"Individual MFAF Configuration\" resource, and shall respond with:\na)\tHTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a representation of the updated configuration, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 2a. or\nb)\tHTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 2b.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP PUT request, the MFAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the MFAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the MFAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nThe Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Deconfigure service operation is used by an NF service consumer to stop mapping data or analytics received by the MFAF to one or more out-bound notification endpoints.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the MFAF to update the configuration to stop mapping data or analytics (as shown in 3GPP TS 23.288 [14])\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer that has stopped mapping data or analytics, indicating a potential issue with the NF service. This could be due to a network issue, a service disruption, or a user-initiated action. The figure provides a visual representation of the situation, allowing for quick identification and resolution.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer stops mapping data or analytics\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Deconfigure service operation to stop the MFAF to map data or analytics. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/nmfaf-3dadatamanagement/<apiVersion>/configurations/{transRefId}\" as Resource URI, where {transRefId} represents the \"Individual MFAF Configuration\" to be deleted, as shown in figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, step 1.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request and if the MFAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request from the NF service consumer, the MFAF shall acknowledge the request by sending a \"204 No Content\" response to the NF service consumer, as shown in figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, step 2. Further, the MFAF shall remove the individual resource linked to the delete request.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the MFAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the MFAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the MFAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n",

                            "text_content": "Table 4.3.2.1-1: Operations of the Nmfaf_3caDataManagement Service\n\nNOTE:\tNmfaf_3caDataManagement_Subscribe service operation is not used by any NF service consumers in this release.\nThe Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch service operation allows consumer to retrieves data or analytics from the MFAF as indicated by Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify Fetch Instruction.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF) sends a request to the MFAF to retrieve the data or analytics as indicated by Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify Fetch Instruction.\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer retrieving data or analytics from the MFAF, illustrating the communication between the NF service consumer and the MFAF. The NF service consumer is connected to the MFAF through a network interface card (NIC), which is a crucial component in the NF service consumer's communication setup. The MFAF is responsible for managing the NF service consumer's data and analytics, ensuring that the consumer receives the necessary information to perform its tasks effectively. The figure also highlights the importance of network functions virtualization (NFV) in enabling the NF service consumer to access the MFAF's resources and services, thereby enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the NF service consumer's operations.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer retrieve data or analytics from the MFAF\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch service operation to retrieve stored data or analytics. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the URI \"{fetchUri}\" which was previously provided by the MFAF within a FetchInstruction data structure in an MFAF notification, as shown in figure 4.3.2.2.2-1, step 1, to fetch data or analytics from the MFAF.\nThe request body shall include fetch correlation identifiers, which were also previously provided by the MFAF in the \"fetchCorrIds\" attribute within a FetchInstruction data structure in an MFAF notification.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP POST request, the MFAF shall:\n-\tfind the data or analytics according to the requested parameters.\nIf the requested data is found, the MFAF shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing the NmfafDataAnaNotification data structure. The NmfafDataAnaNotification data structure in the response body shall include one of the following:\n-\tinformation about network data analytics function events that occurred in the \"anaNotifications\" attribute;\n-\tdata collected from data sources (e.g. SMF, NEF) in the \"dataNotif\" attribute.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nIf the MFAF determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the MFAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nThis is a pseudo operation, the MFAF does not actually provide Subscribe service operation through Nmfaf_3caDataManagement service. The actual subscription is created via Nmfaf_3daDataManagement Service.\nThe Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify service operation provides data or analytics or notification of availability of data or analytics to notification endpoints.\nFigure 4.3.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the MFAF sends a request to the NF service consumer to notify it about data or analytics or fetch instructions.\nThe subscription corresponding to the notification is created by the service consumer via Nmfaf_3daDataManagement Service Operation.\nThe figure depicts a network-based MFAF (Multi-Factor Authentication for Financial Applications) system, which notifies the NF service consumer about subscribed data or analytics or fetch instructions. The system uses a combination of authentication methods, including biometric, behavioral, and behavioral-biometric, to ensure secure communication.\nFigure 4.3.2.3.2-1: MFAF notifies the NF service consumer about subscribed data or analytics or fetch instructions\nThe MFAF shall invoke the Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify service operation to notify about subscribed data or analytics, or notification about the availability of data or analytics. The MFAF shall send an HTTP POST request to the \"{notificationURI}\" received in the subscription (see clause 5.2.5 for the definition of this notificationURI), as shown in figure 4.3.2.3.2-1, step 1. The NmfafDataRetrievalNotification data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tnotification correlation Id within the \"correId\" attribute;\nand shall include one of the following:\n-\tfetch instructions indicate whether the data or analytics are to be fetched by the Consumer in the \"fetchInstruction\" attribute;\n-\tinformation about the MFAF data or analytics in the \"dataAnaNotif\" attribute, which contains one of the following:\n-\tinformation about network data analytics function events that occurred in the \"anaNotifications\" attribute;\n-\tdata collected from data sources (e.g. SMF, NEF) in the \"dataNotif\" attribute.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{notificationURI}\" as Resource URI and NmfafDataRetrievalNotification data structure as request body, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer shall:\n-\tstore the notification;\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nIf the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nAfter the successful processing of the HTTP POST request, if the MFAF requests the NF service consumer to retrieve the data or analytics with the \"fetchInstruct\" attribute, the NF service consumer may invoke the Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch service operation to retrieve the notified data or analytics as defined in clause 4.3.2.2.\n",
