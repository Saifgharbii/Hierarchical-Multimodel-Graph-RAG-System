            "description": "This Technical Specification (TS) describes the Service Principles for PLMNs specified by 3GPP. Principles and requirements for interworking with WLAN are covered in TS 22.234 [35].\n3GPP specifications provide integrated personal communications services. The system will support different applications ranging from narrow-band to wide-band communications capability with integrated personal and terminal mobility to meet the user and service requirements of the 21st century.\n3GPP specifications allow the realisation of a new generation of mobile communications technology for a world in which personal communications services should allow person-to-person calling, independent of location, the terminal used, the means of transmission (wired or wireless) and the choice of technology. Personal communication services should be based on a combination of fixed and wireless/mobile services to form a seamless end-to-end service for the user.\n3GPP specifications should be in compliance with the following objectives:\na)\tto provide a single integrated system in which the user can access services in an easy to use and uniform way in all environments;\nb)\tto allow differentiation between service offerings of various serving networks and home environments;\nc)\tto provide a wide range of telecommunications services including those provided by fixed networks and requiring user bit rates of up to 100 Mbit/s as well as services special to mobile communications. These services should be supported in residential, public and office environments and in areas of diverse population densities. These services are provided with a quality comparable with that provided by fixed networks such as ISDN and fixed broadband Internet access;\nd)\tto provide services via hand held, portable, vehicular mounted, movable and fixed terminals (including those which normally operate connected to fixed networks), in all environments (in different service environments - residential, private domestic and different radio environments) provided that the terminal has the necessary capabilities;\ne)\tto provide support of roaming users by enabling users to access services provided by their home environment in the same way even when roaming.\nf)\tto provide audio, data, video and particularly multimedia services;\ng)\tto provide for the flexible introduction of telecommunication services;\nh)\tto provide within the residential environment the capability to enable a pedestrian user to access all services normally provided by fixed networks;\ni)\tto provide within the office environment the capability to enable a pedestrian user to access all services normally provided by PBXs and LANs;\nj)\tto provide a substitute for fixed networks in areas of diverse population densities, under conditions approved by the appropriate national or regional regulatory authority.\nk)\tto provide support for interfaces which allow the use of terminals normally connected to fixed networks.\n",

                    "text_content": "Existing systems have traditionally standardised the complete sets of teleservices, applications and supplementary services which they provide. As a consequence, substantial efforts are often required to introduce new services or simply to modify the existing one (customisation). This makes it more difficult for operators to differentiate their services. At the same time however, this may reduce the complexity of providing a service across different operators' networks.\n3GPP shall therefore preferentially standardise service capabilities. In circumstances where the service is meant to be used across different operators' networks, hence a common specification set is of paramount importance, the service should be standardised to a level of detail sufficient to ensure interoperability and interworking across different operators' networks. Service capabilities consist of bearers defined by QoS parameters and the mechanisms needed to realise services. These mechanisms include the functionality provided by various network elements, the communication between them and the storage of associated data. This TS provides a conceptual description of a service architecture and architecture requirements which aim to provide service capabilities. It is intended that these standardised capabilities should provide a defined platform which will enable the support of speech, video, multi-media, messaging, data, teleservices, user applications and supplementary services and enable the market for services to be determined by users and home environments.\n",

UDC may support the ability to access necessary network elements to fetch user data on behalf of these services, while minimizing impacts on existing Network Elements in which the data is located.\nApplications can subscribe to specific events which will likely occur on specific user data, and those should be notified when those events do appear.

UDC concept is backwards compatible with 3GPP systems, i.e. it does not have an impact on traffic mechanisms, reference points and protocols of existing network elements.\nThe UDC concept preserves user authentication and authorization of services across domains, ensuring secured users' access to network.\n",

A multimedia service may involve several parties and connections (different parties may provide different media components) and therefore flexibility is required in order to add and delete both resources and parties.\nMultimedia services are typically classified as interactive or distribution services.\nInteractive services are typically subdivided into conversational, messaging and retrieval services:\nConversational services are real time (no store and forward), usually bi-directional where low end to end delays (< 100 ms) and a high degree of synchronisation between media components (implying low delay variation) are required. Video telephony and video conferencing are typical conversational services.\"\nMessaging services offer user to user communication via store and forward units (mailbox or message handling devices). Messaging services might typically provide combined voice and text, audio and high-resolution images.\nRetrieval services enable a user to retrieve rmation stored in one or many rmation centres. The start at which an rmation sequence is sent by an rmation centre to the user is under control of the user. Each rmation centre accessed may provide a different media component, e.g. high-resolution images, audio and general archival rmation.\nDistribution services are typically subdivided into those providing user presentation control and those without user presentation control.\nDistribution services without user control are broadcast services where rmation is supplied by a central source and where the user can access the flow of rmation without any ability to control the start or order of presentation e.g. television or audio broadcast services.\nDistribution services with user control are broadcast services where rmation is broadcast as a repetitive sequence and the ability to access sequence numbering allocated to frames of rmation enables the user (or the user's terminal) to control the start and order of presentation of rmation.\n",

The term 'Emergency call' henceforth refers to speech calls, and GTT Emergency calls if applicable. The term \"other media\" henceforth refers to media other than speech and GTT. Support of other media types during an emergency call when the IM CN subsystem is used is referred to as 'IMS Multimedia Emergency Session' (MES) and is specified in subclause 10.4.2. Emergency calls will be routed to the emergency services in accordance with national regulations for where the subscriber is located. This may be based upon one or more default emergency call numbers stored in the ME. It shall be allowed to establish an emergency call without the need to dial a dedicated number to avoid the mis-connection in roaming case, such as menu, by use of a 'red button', or a linkage to a car air bag control. Emergency calls shall be supported by the UE without a SIM/USIM/ISIM being present. No other type shall be accepted without a SIM/USIM/ISIM than emergency calls and subject to operator policy and regional regulations, restricted local operator service access.\nEmergency calls shall be supported by UEs that are subject to service restrictions, e.g. for UEs camping on a cell in a forbidden PLMN or in a forbidden LA (see 3GPP TS 22.011 [11]), or on a CSG cell without the subscriber being a member of that CSG (see 3GPP TS 22.220 [48]). Such emergency calls shall be accepted by the network if required by local regulation.\nThe Emergency service is required only if the UE supports voice.\nNote 1: \tIt will be left to the national authorities to decide whether the network accepts emergency calls without the SIM/USIM/ISIM.\nIt shall be possible to initiate emergency calls to different emergency call centres, depending on the type of emergency. The following types of emergency calls shall be possible:\n-\tPolice\n-\tAmbulance\n-\tFire Brigade\n-\tMarine Guard\n-\tMountain Rescue\n-\tManually Initiated eCall (MIeC)\n-\tAutomatically Initiated eCall (AIeC)\n-\tSpare\nWhen a SIM/USIM is present, subscriber specific emergency call set-up MMI shall be provided. The Home Environment operator shall specify preferred emergency call numbers (e.g. 999 for UK citizens or 110, 118 and 119 for Japanese citizens). These emergency call numbers shall be stored in the SIM/USIM and the ME shall read this and use any entry of these digits to set up an emergency call. It shall be possible to store more than one instance of this field.\nNote 2: \tRelease '98 and earlier SIM cards have the capability to store additional emergency call numbers. However in many cases this has not been used.\nIt shall be possible to tie any emergency call number to any single emergency call type or to any combination of emergency call types.

This shall be allowed both with and without SIM/USIM being present.\nWhen emergency call establishment is initiated, the emergency call type shall be sent by the UE if it is available.\nThe serving network may download emergency call numbers to the UE in order to ensure that local emergency call numbers are known to the UE. In case of PLMN, the UE shall regard these emergency numbers as valid in that country only (as identified by the MCC) and shall discard them when a new country is entered.\nNote 3:\tThe UE can rm the user if the emergency call type for an emergency number received from the serving network differs from that configured on the USIM/SIM for the same number. How this is implemented is outside the scope of 3GPP and takes into consideration operator policy and regulatory requirements.\nIf permitted by local regulation, it shall be possible for the user to prevent the sending of his public user identifiers and the location rmation to the PSAP (i.e. emergency response centre).\nNote 4:\tOperator policies (e.g. requirements for support of emergency communications) may over-ride the user request for suppression.\nEmergency calls over WLAN shall be supported as above with the following caveats:\nThe UE issues an Emergency session over WLAN access to EPC only when 3GPP access for emergency call is not possible or available (e.g. no 3GPP coverage).\nUEs shall only be able to establish an Emergency session over WLAN when the UE has been provisioned with the WLAN access parameters.\nService continuity for an Emergency voice call moving from 3GPP access CS domain to WLAN access IMS domain is not supported.\nThe level of security should not be less than that which is currently applied to authenticated and unauthenticated CS or IMS emergency calls.\nEmergency call numbers downloaded to the UE over WLAN from untrusted sources shall not be used by the UE.\nNOTE 5:\tTS 23.402 [57] establishes when WLAN is trusted or not.\nSubject to local 3GPP operator policy, the UE may use additional emergency call number(s) received via WLAN access for emergency calls via 3GPP access or WLAN access, while in the country for which the numbers were received.\n",

Subject to operator setting the call may be prioritized.\nNote 1:\tThe above does not preclude the network rejecting the call and requesting the UE to setup a new emergency call to the same emergency service.\nThe serving network may download emergency call numbers and emergency call types, together with a validity indication of this list, for use in the IM CN subsystem so that local emergency call numbers are made known to the UE.

A UE capable of IMS emergency calls and capable of supporting the other media types should also be able to support initiation of an IMSMES.\nAn IMS MES from an unauthenticated UE (as far as the IM CN is concerned) shall be supported by the IM CN subsystem, if required by local regulation.\nIMS MES shall be supported by UEs that are subject to service restrictions, e.g. for UEs camping on a cell in a forbidden PLMN or in a forbidden LA (see 3GPP TS 22.011 [11]), or on a CSG cell without the subscriber being a member of that CSG (see 3GPP TS 22.220 [48]). Such IMS MES shall be accepted by the network if required by local regulation.\nAn IMS MES shall support providing the location of the UE, in a manner similar to IMS emergency voice calls.\nAn IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a valid emergency number utilizing the same mechanisms as used for IMS emergency voice calls as defined in subclause 10.1.1.\n\nNote 2:\tThis capability supports the general public, including facilitating emergency communications by individuals with disabilities (e.g. persons who are deaf, deaf-blind, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability).\nAn originating network and UE may support some or all of these other media types, and support of any specific media by an originating network or UE may be subject to regulatory requirements.\nVoice call continuity per clause 21 shall be supported when a UE with an active IMS MES with voice and other media moves out of IMS voice coverage and voice call continuity is supported by the UE and network. The remaining media (i.e. voice call) then becomes a CS emergency call e.g. TS12 call for 3GPP systems as defined in 3GPP TS 22.003 [14].\nOther media shall be dropped when a UE with an active IMS MES moves out of IMS voice coverage, irrespective of whether or not there is an active voice session.\nWhen IMS MES are supported by the UE, the following apply:\n-\tAn IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall also support IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tOnce a UE is aware that an IMS MES has been initiated, the UE shall be able to (subject to user configuration) avoid drawing unnecessary attention to the user (e.g., playing audible tones or flashing brightly) and should confirm this to the user in as private a manner as is reasonable e.g. using text on the screen or audio if headphones are already connected. UE behaviour in an IMS MES may need to be different relative to the normal configuration.\n-\tThe UE should clearly differentiate IMS emergency session-mode text based instant messaging from IMS non-emergency session-mode text based instant messaging on the user display.\n-\tThe IMS UE supporting video transfer during an IMS MES should be able to deliver recorded media in a form that allows progressive playback. (It is desirable that all pre-recorded media sent during an emergency session be progressively viewable.)\n-\tWhen an IP PSAP attempts to add additional media to an existing IMS MES, the user shall be made aware of this. When additional media is requested by the PSAP, the user shall be able to permit or deny it.\n-\tThe UE shall provide an indication to the user for each requested media, whether it was successfully or unsuccessfully established.\n-\tFurther notifications of added and removed media shall be indicated to the user while the IMS MES is active.\n-\tIf none of the media requested by the UE is successfully established, the IMS MES will fail and an IMS MES failure indication shall be provided to the user.\n-\tIn handover of an IMS MES where other media is dropped when IMS MES is not supported, the UE shall indicate to the end user that the other media is not supported in this area.\nThe following requirements for IMS emergency voice calls also apply when an IMS MES is supported by the UE:\n-\tAn IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall indicate to the network that the call is an IMS emergency call as is done for an IMS emergency voice call.\n-\tAn IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall be able to receive an IMS call-back from a PSAP per clause 10.1.3 with voice, GTT or other media per clause 10.4.2.1.\n-\tAn IMS UE that supports MES shall utilize the same trust and security mechanisms for the other media as utilized for an IMS emergency voice call.\n-\tWhen roaming, a UE shall originate an IMS MES in the serving network in the same manner as for IMS emergency voice calls.\nWhen an IMS MES is enabled by the originating network, the following apply:\n-\tOther media shall only be supported in packet-based networks that support IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tThe originating network shall deliver all media to the same IP PSAP throughout the duration of the IMS MES.\n-\tThe network shall indicate to the UE, for each requested media, whether it was successfully or unsuccessfully established.\n-\tFurther notification of added and removed media shall be provided to the UE while the IMS MES is active.\n-\tIf none of the media requested by the UE is successfully established, the IMS MES will fail and an IMS MES failure indication will be provided to the UE.\nThe following requirements for IMS emergency voice calls also apply when IMS MES is supported by the network:\n-\tSubject to regional regulatory requirements, the network shall be able to authenticate the UE using the same procedures as for IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tThe originating network shall provide the capability to enable an IMS UE supporting IMS MES to obtain local emergency numbers or other emergency address(es) (e.g. destination address) utilizing the same mechanism as used for IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tAn IMS MES shall be provided in the local serving network.\n-\tFor an IMS MES, any kind of emergency addressing (e.g. SIP URIs, Tel URIs) and special indications for emergency sessions shall be treated in the same manner as IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tThe originating network should detect all IMS MESs regardless of the UE emergency call indication. According to operator policy, the originating network may either rm the UE to enable re-origination as an IMS MES or support origination of the initial call.\n-\tThe originating network shall be responsible for routing the IMS MES towards the appropriate PSAP (e.g., based on emergency service type, location, or policy).\n-\tThe network shall be able to provide integrity protection, and/or privacy for other media similar to that provided for IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tAn IMS MES shall utilize the same priority mechanisms as IMS emergency voice calls.\n-\tDetailed log records of the IMS MES shall be generated by the originating network in a similar manner to IMS emergency voice calls and subject to regulatory requirements.\n-\tAll media content within the IMS MES shall be carried with an indication of the source, in a similar manner as for IMS emergency voice calls.\n",

These possibilities include simple terminals with a single on/off button through to complex terminals providing support to hearing/visually impaired users.\nControl of CS CN Domain supplementary services (3GPP TS 22.004 [5]), may use MMI procedures specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [6] and existing MMI related UE features (Annex A) may also be used.

            "description": "3GPP specifications should support a wide variety of user equipment, i.e. setting any limitations on terminals should be avoided as much as possible. For example user equipment like hand-portable phones, personal digital assistants and laptop computers can clearly be seen as likely terminals.\nIn order not to limit the possible types of user equipment they are not standardised. The UE types could be categorised by their service capabilities rather than by their physical characteristics. Typical examples are speech only UE, narrowband data UE, wideband data UE, data and speech UE, etc.\nIn order to enhance functionality split and modularity inside the user equipment the interfaces of UE should be identified. Interfaces like UICC-interface, PCMCIA-interface and other PC-interfaces, including software interfaces, should be covered by references to the applicable interface standards.\nUEs have to be capable of supporting a wide variety of teleservices, multimedia services and applications provided in PLMN environment. Limitations may exist on UEs capability to support all possible teleservices, multimedia services and rmation types (speech, narrowband data, wideband data, video, etc.) and therefore functionality to indicate capabilities of a UE shall be specified.\nThe basic mandatory UE requirements are:\n-\tSupport for USIM. Optional support of GSM phase 2, 2+, 3GPP Release 99 and Release 4 SIM cards [34]. Phase 1, 5V SIM cards shall not be supported. Support for the SIM/ISIM is optional for the UE, however, if it is supported, the mandatory requirements for SIM/ISIM shall be supported in the UE;\nNote 1: \tThere is no Release 5 specification for the SIM, and therefore references to \"SIM\" apply to earlier releases.\nNote 2:\tIt is strongly recommended that manufacturers implement SIM support on terminals supporting GERAN until the population of SIMs in the market is reduced to a low level.\n-\tHome environment and serving network registration and deregistration;\n-\tLocation update;\n-\tOriginating or receiving a connection oriented or a connectionless service;\n-\tAn unalterable equipment identification; IMEI, see 3GPP TS 22.016 [12];\n-\tBasic identification of the terminal capabilities related to services such as; the support for software downloading, application execution environment/interface, MExE terminal class, supported bearer services.\n-\tTerminals capable for emergency calls shall support emergency call without a SIM/USIM/ISIM.\n-\tSupport for the execution of algorithms required for encryption, for CS and PS services. Support for non encrypted mode is required;\n-\tSupport for the method of handling automatic calling repeat attempt restrictions as specified in 3GPP TS 22.001 [4];\n-\tAt least one capability type shall be standardised for mobile terminals supporting the GERAN,UTRAN and E-UTRAN radio interfaces.\n-\tUnder emergency situations, it may be desirable for the operator to prevent UE users from making access attempts (including emergency call attempts) or responding to pages in specified areas of a network, see 3GPP TS 22.011 [11];\n-\tCiphering Indicator for terminals with a suitable display;\n-\tThe ciphering indicator feature allows the UE to detect that the 3GPP radio interface ciphering (user plane) is not switched on and to indicate this to the user. The ciphering indicator feature may be disabled by the home network operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. The default terminal behaviour shall be to take into account the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. However, terminals with a user interface that can allow it, shall offer the possibility for the user to configure the terminal to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. If this feature is not disabled by the SIM/USIM or if the terminal has been configured to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM, then whenever a user plane connection is in place, which is, or becomes un-enciphered, an indication shall be given to the user. In addition, if this feature is not disabled by the SIM/USIM or if the terminal has been configured to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM, then additional rmation may also be provided about the status of the ciphering. Ciphering itself is unaffected by this feature, and the user can choose how to proceed;\n-\tSupport for PLMN selection.\n-\tSupport for handling of interactions between toolkits concerning the access to UE MMI input/output capabilities;\n-\tWhenever an application (e.g. a SAT/MExE/WAP application) requires the access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities (e.g. display, keyboard,… ), the UE shall grant this access subject to the capabilities of the UE. This shall not cause the termination of any other applications (e.g. WAP browser or MExE/SAT application) which were previously using these UE resources. The UE shall give the user the ability to accept or reject the new application. In the case that the application request is rejected, the access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities is returned to the applications which were previously using these UE resources. If the user decides to continue with the new application, then when this new application is terminated, the access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities shall be returned to the UE to be re-allocated to applications (e.g. the preceding application which was interrupted). Subject to the capabilities of the UE, the user shall have the ability to switch the MMI input/output capabilities between applications.\nNOTE:\tRejecting a request to access the UE MMI input/output capabilities by an application does not necessarily mean that it is terminated, but only that the access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities are not granted to this application. Handling of rejection (termination, put on hold,…) is the responsibility of the application.\nAnnex A describes a number of features which may optionally be supported by the UE.\n",

Additionally, an estimate may be given when the high traffic load is expected to be mitigated.\nInforming the 3rd party about UE status\n-\tThe 3GPP Core Network shall be able to provide the following information about a UE that is served by the 3rd party service provider:\n-\tIndication of the of the roaming status (i.e. Roaming and No Roaming) and the serving network, when the UE starts/stops roaming,\n-\tLoss of connectivity of the UE,\n-\tChange or loss of the association between the ME and the USIM,\n-\tCommunication failure events of the UE visible to the network (e.g. for troubleshooting).\n-\tReporting when the UE moves in/out of a geographic area that is indicated by the 3rd party,\n-\tReporting when the UE changes Routing Area / Tracking Area / Location Area / Cell.\n-\tReporting when the UE changes the status of 3GPP PS Data Off.\nNOTE: \tThe area indicated by a 3rd party service provider can be mapped to the area used in the 3GPP network, i.e. a list of LAs/RAs/TAs/cells. The 3rd party service provider can define a geographical area as shapes (e.g. polygons, circles) or civic addresses (streets, districts…) as referenced by OMA Presence API [53] e.g. defined by shape areas of IETF RFC-5491 [54] or by civic addresses defined in IETF RFC-5139 [55].\n-\tThe 3rd party service provider shall be able to request a one time reporting or reporting at defined times (e.g. regular intervals, certain pre-defined time points) on the number of UEs present in a certain area and the location of each UE as for a Location Based Service.\n-    Subject to user consent, operator policy and regulatory constraints, the user privacy shall be maintained when passing location information to a 3rd party service provider.\nInforming the 3rd party about a UE’s connection properties\n-\tThe 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform a 3rd party about a UE’s connection properties.\nNOTE:\tConnection properties of a UE describe the average data rate range or non-absolute value (e.g. high, medium or low) that the UE is likely to be able to obtain at the current location. The connection properties can, for example, be generated from the UE’s RAT type the UE is currently attached to, the load conditions at its current location and/or other parameters.\nSupport for non-IP small data transfer with a 3rd party\n-\tThe 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3rd party for submiting a small amount of non-IP data for delivery to a UE.\n- \tThe 3GPP Core Network shall  support a 3rd party application server for receiving a small amount of non-IP data delivered from a UE.\n-\tThe 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3rd party to configuring non-IP data delivery for a particular UE (e.g. destination address, maximum number of messages, duration for which configuration applies).\nNOTE: \tThe use of the Non-IP Data Delivery feature via Service Capability Exposure Function assumes that the UE has indicated support for ‘non-IP data transfer’ and in case the Service Capability Exposure Function is used there will be no user plane EPS bearer established.\n",

These indications are sent by the network and received by the UE:\n-\tThree of these indications are used as levels, reflecting some kind of urgency: level 0 indicates that the UE shall not alert the user for USSD and remain silent in the case of call, level 2 shall be considered by the UE as more important than level 1 for the purpose of alerting the user.\n-\tThe five other indications are used as categories, identifying different types of terminating traffic. The UE shall rm the user in a specific manner for each of these five categories. Nevertheless, the possible forms of the alert (different ringing tones, displayed text, graphical symbols...) is still up to the mobile manufacturer (some forms of alerts can be simultaneously used, e.g. ringing tones and text on the display).\nThe management of the feature by the UE requires for the handling of categories that:\n-\tthe SIM/USIM stores for each category an rmative text (maximum 25 characters per category) describing the type of terminating traffic associated with the category. This rmation could be used by the UE when alerting the user (display on the screen). It is necessary for the network operator to be able to change the meaning of each category.\n-\tThe user has the ability to set up his/her own association between the type of terminating traffic (identified by each category) and the different types of alert provided by the UE. To help the user in this choice, the UE uses the rmative text associated with each category (as stored in the SIM/USIM). The UE should keep this association when switched off.\nDefault settings should also be defined in the ME for the following cases:\n-\t when the UE receives a call, USSD or a request for a network-initiated MO connection with no alerting indication,\n- \twhen the UE receives a call, USSD or a request for a network-initiated MO connection with a category of alerting not defined in the SIM/USIM.\nThese default settings should be separated per type of mobile terminated traffic received (call, USSD or request for a network-initiated MO connection).\nA UE supporting the feature shall act according to the following points in case of mobile terminating traffic:\n-\twhen a mobile terminating traffic is received without any indication (level or category), the ME shall act as if it was not supporting the feature, i.e. use a default alert (e.g. associated with this type of mobile terminating traffic).\n-\tif a level is indicated, the UE shall use an alert enabling the user to differentiate between the three levels.\n-\tif a category is indicated, then:\n-\tif the SIM/USIM used in the UE does not store any rmation on that feature, the UE shall ignore the category received with any mobile terminating traffic and act as if it was not supporting the feature, i.e. use a default alert (e.g. associated with this type of mobile terminating traffic).\n-\tif the category is not defined in the SIM/USIM, the UE shall act as if it was not supporting the feature, i.e. use a default alert (e.g. associated with this type of mobile terminating traffic).\n-\tif the category is defined in the SIM/USIM, the UE shall use the alert associated with this category. In addition, it would be very useful for the user to be notified of the rmative text associated with this category (e.g. on the display).\nSome interactions between this feature and other services related to alerting are described below:\n-\tthe call waiting service has priority on this feature, i.e. the call waiting tone will be played and not the alert derived by this feature. If possible, two different indications should be given to the user (e.g. the call waiting tone and a text on the display indicating call waiting, and in addition a text relative to the type of the new call received).\n-\tthe presentation of the calling line identity takes priority on this feature, if it is not possible to display this rmation and another rmation related to this feature.\n-\tIn case of interaction between this feature and UE specific features to alert the user (e.g. whole silent mode), the user should still be able to differentiate between the different levels or different types of terminating traffic, even if the alert itself may be changed.\n",

The \"ICE rmation\" shall list the type of rmation which is to be configured by the mobile operator as described in the table below.\nTable A.28.1: \"ICE rmation\" description\n\nThe following table provides an example of ICE rmation stored on the UICC:\nTable A.28.2: \"ICE rmation\" example\n\nProvision is made for direct and unambiguous read access from the UE to ICE rmation stored on the UICC.\nThe subscriber may choose not to enter any ICE rmation.\nThe default configuration for this rmation shall be that they are accessible even when the security features on either the UE or UICC have been enabled (e.g. the keypad is locked). It shall be possible for the subscriber to change this default setting to prevent accessibility to the ICE rmation (i.e. a user configurable setting in the UICC indicates whether the ICE rmation on the UICC shall be displayed or not, if the ICE access procedure described in TS 22.030 [6] is invoked).\nThe unlocking of ICE rmation shall not allow access to other secure rmation on the UICC or UE. The ICE rmation value should not be accessible to ME or UICC applications.\nThe ICE access procedure is described in TS 22.030 [6].\nCompany X is customer of operator Z and has a subscription for voice and data with 10 SIM cards. The company also decides to subscribe to the private numbering plan feature of operator Z. A certain corporate phone number is assigned to company X, e.g. +43 676 88888 xx (with xx being the extensions of the users), and they can freely choose the extensions for up to 100 SIM cards.\nInitially company X take the existing 10 SIM cards (with the existing MSISDNs) and integrate them into the private numbering plan by assigning the extensions 11 to 20 to these cards via a web portal. This is not a permanent assignment, the extensions can be changed easily any time, old SIMs can be deleted from the private numbering plan and new ones can be integrated whenever necessary. Special privileges or restrictions can be chosen on a per SIM basis via the portal and special tariffs apply.\nThe CEO of company X calls a customer. The customer's phone displays the corporate number + extension of the CEO as CLI. After a while the customer decides to call back the CEO and uses the corporate number + extension as MSISDN. Later they also exchange some short messages, again the corporate number + extension of the CEO is used as sender's MSISDN.\nFor all these calls and short messages operator Z is able to collect charging records containing the corporate number + extension.\nThe CEO also uses her smart phone to establish PS connections to browse the internet and to access the intranet via the operator's gateway. The corporate number + extension is used for authentication and authorisation in the company's intranet and its web applications. Charging for PS connections by operator Z is also based on this number.\nIn general the users in company X are not aware of their \"real\" underlying MSISDNs in the system, they only see the corporate number + their extension and there is no need for them to know the underlying MSISDN.\n\n\n\n\n",
