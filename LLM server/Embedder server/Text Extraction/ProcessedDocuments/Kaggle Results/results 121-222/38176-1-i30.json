The ON period represents the time at which the transmitter starts transmitting, the OFF period represents the time at which the transmitter stops transmitting, and the transient period represents the time at which the transmitter experiences a change in signal strength or phase.

N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.\n4) For a TAB connector supporting contiguous CA, measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the aggregated IAB channel bandwidth BWChannel_CA centred on (Fedge_high+Fedge_low)/2. 70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next transmitter ON period – 10 μs.

In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe out-of-band emissions requirement for the IAB-DU and IAB-MT transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).\nThe maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the operating band edge is ΔfOBUE. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink operating band of IAB-DU and uplink operating band of IAB-MT, plus the frequency ranges ΔfOBUE above and ΔfOBUE below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.\nThe values of ΔfOBUE are defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2 for the NR operating bands.\nTable 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink operating band of IAB-DU\n\nTable 6.6.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink operating band of IAB-MT\n\nFor IAB type 1-H the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the TAB connector TX min cell groups for all the supported configurations. The basic limits and corresponding emissions scaling are defined in each relevant clause.\nThere is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.\n",

For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT are co-located with IAB-MT and/or IAB-DU.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with same class.\nThe basic limits are in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 for an IAB-DU and IAB-MT. Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared IAB-DU and IAB-MT class. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.5.3-1: IAB-DU and IAB-MT spurious emissions basic limits for co-location with BS or IAB-node\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 do not apply for the frequency range extending ΔfOBUE immediately outside the transmit frequency range of a IAB-MT and IAB-DU. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [8].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.5.2.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nThe Tx spurious emissions requirements for IAB type 1-H are that for each TAB connector TX min cell group and each applicable basic limit in clause 6.6.5.2, the power summation of emissions at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell group shall not exceed a limit specified as the basic limit + X, where X = 10log10(NTXU,countedpercell), unless stated differently in regional regulation.\nNOTE:\tConformance to the IAB type 1-H spurious emission requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:\n1)\tThe sum of the emissions power measured on each TAB connector in the TAB connector TX min cell group shall be less than or equal to the limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.\nOr\n2)\tThe unwanted emissions power at each TAB connector shall be less than or equal to the type 1-H limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log10(n), where n is the number of TAB connectors in the TAB connector TX min cell group.\n",

Each NACK bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.3.\n8.1.3.6.1.1.2\tMinimum requirement\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2] clause 8.1.3.7.2.1.\n8.1.3.6.1.1.3\tTest purpose\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability not to falsely detect NACK bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\n8.1.3.6.1.1.4\tMethod of test\n8.1.3.6.1.1.4.1\tInitial conditions\nTest environment: Normal; see annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.\n8.1.3.6.1.1.4.2\tTest procedure\n1)\tConnect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all IAB-DU TAB connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D. 3.\n2)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the combinations of SCS and channel bandwidth defined in Table 8.1.3.6.1.1.4.2-1.\nTable 8.1.3.6.1.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the IAB-DU input\n\n3)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to TS 38.211 [9], and the specific test parameters are configured as below:\nTable 8.1.3.6.1.1.4.2-2: Test parameters for multi-slot PUCCH format 1\n\n4)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex F.\n5)\tAdjusting the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.1.3.6.1.1.5-1 is achieved at the IAB-DU input during the transmissions.\n6)\tThe tester sends random codeword from applicable codebook, in regular time periods.

                            "text_content": "The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.\nPfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only noise.\nPd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.\nFor AWGN and TDLC300-100, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 8.1.4.1.1-1.\nTable 8.1.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN and TDLC300-100\n\nThe test preambles for normal mode are listed in A.2.5-1.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.4.\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2] clause 8.1.4.1 and 8.1.4.2.\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\n8.1.4.1.4.1\tInitial conditions\nTest environment: Normal; see annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.\n8.1.4.1.4.2\tTest procedure\n1)\tConnect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all IAB-DU TAB connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D. 3.\n2)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel bandwidth.\nTable 8.1.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the IAB-DU input\n\n3)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameter msg1-FrequencyStart is set to 0.\n4)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex F.\n5)\tAdjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table 8.1.4.1.5-1 or 8.1.4.1.5-2 or 8.1.4.1.5-3 or 8.1.4.1.6-1 or 8.1.4.1.6-2 or 8.1.4.1.6-3 or 8.1.4.1.6-4.\n6)\tAdjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.1.4.1.5-1 or 8.1.4.1.5-2 or 8.1.4.1.5-3 or 8.1.4.1.6-1 or 8.1.4.1.6-2 or 8.1.4.1.6-3 or 8.1.4.1.6-4 is achieved at the IAB-DU input during the PRACH preambles.\n7)\tThe test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed preambles.\nThe figure depicts a PRACH preamble test pattern, which is a key component of a 5G network's radio interface. The pattern is used to test the functionality of the radio interface and ensure that it is functioning correctly. The figure shows the different components of the PRACH preamble, including the start symbol, stop symbol, and the carrier frequency. The presence of the carrier frequency is crucial for the proper functioning of the radio interface in a 5G network.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is presented in figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-2.\nThe figure depicts a timing offset scheme for the PRACH preamble format 0, which is used in 5G communication systems. The scheme is crucial for ensuring accurate timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. The figure shows the timing offset values for each phase of the preamble, which are essential for the proper functioning of the communication system.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8 us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is presented in figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-3.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1 A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2,\" depicts a timing offset scheme for the PRACH preamble format. This scheme is used in the PRACH (Phase-Locked Loop) protocol, which is a key component in wireless communication systems. The figure shows the timing offset values for each of the preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0, and C2, which are used to synchronize the transmission of the PRACH signal. The figure is important for understanding the timing requirements of the PRACH protocol and ensuring accurate synchronization of the signal.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1 A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2\nPfa shall not exceed 0.1%. Pd shall not be below 99% for the SNRs in tables 8.1.4.1.5-1 to 8.1.4.1.5-3.\nTable 8.1.4.1.5-1: PRACH missed detection test requirements for Normal Mode, 1.25 kHz SCS\n\nTable 8.1.4.1.5-2: PRACH missed detection test requirements for Normal Mode, 15 kHz SCS\n\nTable 8.1.4.1.5-3: PRACH missed detection test requirements for Normal Mode, 30 kHz SCS\n\n",
