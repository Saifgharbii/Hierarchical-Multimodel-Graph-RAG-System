Additionally, SMS delivery via the CS core network is realized without CS fallback.\nThe present document specifies the procedures and the SGs Application Part (SGsAP) messages used on the SGs interface between the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the EPS and the Visitor Location Register (VLR), to allow location management coordination and to relay certain messages related to GSM circuit switched services over the EPS system.\nThe present document also specifies the use of Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) for the transport of SGsAP messages.\nThe present document is applicable to the MME in the EPS and to the VLR. The functional split between the MME and the VLR is defined in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7].\n",

This interface is called SGs interface.\nNOTE:\tWithin this specification, the term VLR refers to MSC/VLR or MSC Server/VLR.\nThe SGs interface connects the databases in the VLR and the MME.

The SGs interface is also used to convey some circuit switched related procedures via the MME.\nThe basis for the interworking between a VLR and an MME is the existence of a SGs association between those entities per UE. The SGs association is applicable to UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only. The SGs association is not applicable if the subscriber data indicates that the subscription is for packet only. The SGs association is also not applicable if the MME is registered for SMS for the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7].\nIn NB-S1 mode, the SGs association is also applicable to UEs supports NB-S1 mode only to use SMS over SGs only.\nThe behaviour of the VLR and the MME entities related to the SGs interface are defined by the state of the SGs association for a UE.

                            "text_content": "The VLR shall handle the timers, queuing and retransmission for sending the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message on the SGs interface in the same way that it handles the sending of a PAGING message on the A or Iu interface.\nWhen a VLR has to page a UE, the VLR shall check whether the VLR has a SGs association for that UE. The VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages to the MME if the MME is in service and the state of the SGs association for the UE is in any of the following states:\n-\tSGs-ASSOCIATED;\n-\tLA-UPDATE-PRESENT or\n-\tSGs-NULL and the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to \"false\".\nIf the VLR detects that the MME serving the UE is no longer in service and the VLR supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in the MME pool as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 [4], the VLR shall send the SGs-PAGING-REQUEST message to one alternative MME in the same MME pool. The VLR shall set the CS restoration indicator in the Additional paging indicators information element.\nNOTE 1:\tThe VLR can detect that an MME is no longer in service if there are no SCTP associations in service with that MME.\nThe sending of the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not change the state of the SGs association with the MME.\nIf the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to \"true\", the VLR shall include the Location area identifier information element into the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, otherwise (i.e. after a VLR failure), the VLR shall not include the Location area identifier information element. When sending the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, the VLR shall start timer Ts5.\nIf the state of the SGs association is SGs-NULL and the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to \"false\", the VLR shall also perform a search procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [5].\nIn this message, the VLR includes the Service indicator information element which will be used to indicate the type of CS service. If the SGs paging request is sent as a result of reception of Provide Subscriber Information Request message, the VLR sets the Service indicator information element to either \"SMS indicator\" or \"CS call indicator\" as specified in subclause 7.2.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.018 [5]. For SMS, SMS indicator is used. For all the other CS services, CS call indicator is used.\nIf the network supports CSFB priority call handling (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]) and the call was received with an eMLPP priority level indication (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [8], 3GPP TS 22.067 [24] and 3GPP TS 23.067 [25]), the VLR shall include the value of the received priority level indication in the eMLPP priority information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nThe eMLPP priority information element may be used to derive the appropriate priority of a SCTP association for the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nIf the Calling Line Identification of the service (see 3GPP TS 24.081 [12]) is available in the VLR, the VLR may include the CLI information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. The conditions specified in 3GPP TS 23.081 [5A] and 3GPP TS 29.011 [15A] apply also here.\nIf the paging is due to a NW-initiated Call Independent SS procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 24.010 [9], the VLR may include the SS code in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15].\nNOTE 2:\tThe SS code used by the VLR does not link to a specific supplementary service. The VLR can use any SS code defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15], in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nIf the paging is due to a Mobile Terminated Location Request as defined in 3GPP TS 24.030 [11], the VLR shall include LCS indicator in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. Additionally, the VLR may include LCS client identity as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15] in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nFor Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]), if the paging was due to SMS and the SM Delivery Timer and SM Delivery Start Time IEs were received from the SMS-GMSC as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15], the VLR may include these IEs in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nFor Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]), if the paging was due to SMS and the Maximum Retransmission Time IE was received from the SMS-GMSC as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15], the VLR may include the received Maximum Retransmission Time IE in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nWhile domain specific access control of the PS domain is ongoing, the VLR shall be configured to send paging messages on both the SGs and the A/Iu interface.\nThe VLR may apply implementation specific rules for sending the paging on the A/Iu interface. Dependent on network configuration or operator policy, if the UE does not respond to a first paging on SGs interface or the VLR considers UE fallback was failed as described in subclause 5.15.1, and A/Iu paging has not been initiated already, the VLR shall page on the A/Iu interface.\nThe VLR stops the paging procedure towards the MME on expiry of timer Ts5 or on receipt of a SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message from the MME.\nOn receipt of an SCCP connection establishment containing the Initial L3 message from the UE via the A or Iu interface, the VLR shall stop the paging procedure.\nUpon receiving the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message with the UE EMM mode information element indicating \"EMM-CONNECTED\", if the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message indicates \"CS call indicator\" and Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy) is activated for the subscriber, the VLR shall start the CFNRy timer as specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [5B].\nIf the paging response is received via the A or Iu interface from a location area which differs from the one stored in the VLR, the VLR shall move the SGs association to the SGs-NULL state after the UE has been authenticated successfully.\nNOTE 2:\tUE sends this paging response as a result of receiving paging request with IMSI and with CN domain indicator set to \"CS\" (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]).\nOn receipt of an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message before the timer Ts5 expires, the VLR stops timer Ts5. If the SGs cause information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message does not indicate \" terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\", the SGs association is moved to the SGs-NULL state and within this state the SGs association is marked with the contents of the SGs cause information element. If the SGs cause information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message indicates \"IMSI detached for EPS services\" the VLR shall send the paging message on the A/Iu interface. If the SGs cause information element indicates \" terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\", the SGs association state shall not be changed.\nWhen the VLR receives the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message with the SGs cause information element indicating \" terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\", the VLR shall trigger User Determined User Busy (UDUB) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.082 [13].\nOn receipt of an SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message before the timer Ts5 expires, the VLR stops timer Ts5, and the paging procedure for that paging request towards the  is stopped. The state of the SGs association at the VLR is unchanged.\nFor Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]), if the paging was due to SMS and the VLR included the SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST, and if the SM Buffer Request Indicator bit is set in the Additional UE Unreachable indicators IE in the SGsAP_UE_UNREACHABLE message, the VLR may buffer the Short Message until the time indicated in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST or until receipt of any earlier SGsAP message for the UE.\nFor Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]), if the Retransmission Time IE was included in the SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message, the VLR may forward the received Requested Retransmission Time IE to the SMS-GMSC as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15]. In this case, the VLR shall not set the MNRF flag.\nNOTE 1:\tA/Iu paging can be ongoing.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the VLR considers the paging procedure completed, and no response from the UE has been received, and CFNRc has been configured and activated for the terminating UE, the VLR applies the equivalent handling as for Call Forwarding on Not Reachable, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [5B] and 3GPP TS 29.011 [15A].\n",

On receipt of an ATTACH REQUEST message or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message from the UE, the MME handles the EPS related request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14].\nWhen the MME receives the Update Location Answer message containing subscription data from the HSS, the MME determines whether it needs to perform location update for non-EPS services procedure. For the cases identified below, if the MME is configured with ability not to perform registrations with a VLR for the UE, the MME sends response message to the UE without starting the location update for non-EPS services procedure:\n-\tif the Network Access Mode (NAM) subscription data indicates that the subscription is for packet only (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [17]); or\n-\tif the Network Access Mode (NAM) subscription data indicates that the subscription is for packet and circuit (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [17]) and the MME is registered for SMS as specified in annex C of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7] for this UE.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the MME supports both SMS in MME feature and SMS over SGs, depending on UE capability and/or network configuration and/or “PS and SMS only” subscription, it can be preferred to provide SMS services via SMS in MME to avoid the VLR registration.\nOtherwise, the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure and shall wait for the outcome of both location update procedures towards the VLR and the HSS before sending the response message to the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the combined attach or tracking area update procedure is for both EPS services and non-EPS services and the MME is not registered for SMS for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]) and the UE has \"PS and SMS only\" subscription, the MME starts the location update for non-EPS services procedure for SMS over SGs only.\nIf timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:\n-\tan attach request indicating combined EPS/IMSI attach;\n-\ta combined tracking area update request indicating Combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach;\n-\ta combined tracking area update request and the MME detects that the LAI has changed;\n-\ta combined tracking area update request and the state of the SGs association is SGs-NULL; or\n-\ta combined tracking area update request and the MME serving the UE has changed.\nIf timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME may start the location update for non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:\n-\ta combined tracking area update request or a periodic tracking area update , if the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" for the UE is set to \"false\" (see subclause 5.7.3).\nIf multiple PLMNs are available for the CS domain, the MME shall select a PLMN for CS domain as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]. If the MME cannot select any PLMN for CS domain for the UE, the MME informs the UE that the CS domain is not available.\nThe MME shall determine the new location area identification as follows:\n-\tif the MME received a combined attach request or combined tracking area update request from the UE with an indication for \"SMS only\", or the network only supports \"SMS only\" or the network only has a few VLRs that support SGs interface, the MME may allocate a default location area identification specifically configured for that case;\n-\telse the MME derives the location area identification from the current tracking area identity where the UE is located. For this the  may take any access restrictions provided by the HSS into account, if the network is using separate location areas for GERAN and UTRAN cells.\nThe MME shall derive the VLR name from the location area identification which was determined. For networks supporting the feature 'Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes', the VLR name is derived as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A].The MME shall include the location area identification in the new location area identifier information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\nNOTE 1:\tThe selection of the VLR in the MME follows the same rule as the selection of the VLR in the SGSN, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A].\nIn networks supporting the feature 'Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes' (3GPP TS 23.236 [6A]), if the TMSI based NRI container is not received from the UE, and the MME determines that the serving VLR of the UE is changed, the MME shall include in the Old location area identifier a specific LAI value which is not broadcasted in the network and not associated with any VLR.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MME determines that the serving VLR of the UE is changed when the SGs association changes from one serving VLR to a different one, or based on implementation dependent criteria.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the VLR receives the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message with the specific LAI value, the VLR retrieves the MM context of the UE from the HLR.\nIn networks supporting the feature \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" as defined in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A], the MME shall support load re-distribution of UEs to another VLR than the current one. When the MME receives a periodic tracking area update request or a combined tracking area update request, the MME shall check whether for this UE there is a SGs association to a VLR for which load re-distribution has been initiated in the MME by O&M. If this is the case and\n-\tif a combined tracking area update request is received, the MME shall derive the new VLR name as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A] and then send the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected VLR; or\n-\tif a periodic tracking area update request is received, dependent on network configuration and operator policy, the MME shall take one of the following actions:\n-\tperform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\" immediately after the completion of the periodic tracking area update procedure; or\n-\tderive the new VLR name as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 [6A] and then send the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected VLR.\nIf the VLR is configured for gateway core network (GWCN), the MME shall select a CS domain operator as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [7] and proceed as follows:\n-\tIf the preferred RAT of the selected CS domain operator is GERAN and the UE does not support GERAN network sharing (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [8], subclause 10.5.5.12), the MME shall include the selected CS domain operator in the selected CS domain operator information element, and the common PLMN in the new location area identifier information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; or\n-\tIf only common PLMN ID and no multiple PLMN IDs are provided in CS domain for selection by the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [7A], subclause 4.2.3.1), the MME shall include the selected CS domain operator in the selected CS domain operator information element, and the common PLMN in the new location area identifier information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\nIf multiple PLMN IDs are provided in CS domain for selection by the UE and the UE supports GERAN network sharing (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [8], subclause 10.5.5.12), the MME shall include the selected PLMN for CS domain in the new location area identifier information element as specified in 3GPP TS 23.251 [7A].\nThe SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message includes the type of location update performed by the UE in the EPS location update type information element. If the UE has performed a combined attach or a combined tracking area update indicating \"combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach\", the MME indicates \"IMSI attach\", otherwise the MME indicates \"Normal location update\".\nThe MME shall include the TMSI status in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if the UE indicates in the ATTACH REQUEST or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that it has no valid TMSI available. The MME shall also include the old location area identifier in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if the UE included the old location area identification in the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.\nThe MME shall include the TMSI based NRI container in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if received from the UE.\nIf the MME supports the \"Automatic Device Detection\" (see 3GPP TS 22.101 [2]) or the \"Trace for Management Based Activation/Deactivation\" (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [18]), the MME shall include the IMEISV in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\nThe MME shall add the UE's current TAI and E-CGI to the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\nWhen the MME sends the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST, the MME shall start timer Ts6-1.\nIf timer Ts6-1 is running and the MME receives from the UE:\n-\tan attach request indicating combined EPS/IMSI attach; or\n-\ta combined tracking area update with or without IMSI attach.\nThen:\n-\tif the LAI determined by the MME is the same as in the outstanding request, the MME shall not process this new request and shall wait for the VLR response to the ongoing procedure;\n-\tif the LAI determined by the MME is different but the VLR name is the same as for previous LAI, any response from the VLR to the outstanding request is ignored, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1 and the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure; or\n-\tif the LAI determined by the MME is different and the VLR name is different as for previous LAI, any response from the previously addressed VLR to the outstanding request is ignored, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1, and the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure.\nWhen the MME receives from the UE a tracking area update request and the MME serving the UE has changed, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1.\nIf the MME supports restoration for CS services via an alternative VLR as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 [4] and, upon reception of a combined tracking area update request or a periodic tracking area update request from the UE, the MME determines that the VLR serving the UE is no longer in service, the MME may:\n-\tif a combined tracking area update request is received, select an alternative VLR that is in service for the UE and immediately perform the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2; or\n-\tif a periodic tracking area update request is received, dependent on network configuration and operator policy,\n-\tperform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\" immediately after the completion of the periodic tracking area update procedure and then select an alternative VLR that is in service for the UE during the subsequent combined tracking area update procedure, before performing the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2; or\n-\tselect an alternative VLR that is in service for the UE and immediately perform the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2.\nIf the MME supports restoration for CS services via an alternative VLR as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 [4] and, upon reception of an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]) from the UE, the MME determines that the VLR serving the UE is no longer in service, the MME may:\n-\trequest the UE to re-attach for non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14] and then select an alternative VLR that is in service for the UE during the subsequent combined tracking area update procedure, before performing the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2.\nNOTE 1:\tHow an MME detects a VLR is no longer in service and triggers selection of alternative VLR is implemention dependent.\nNOTE 2:\tTo avoid large amounts of UEs initiating re-attach for non-EPS services simultaneously, the MME can ignore some MO-SMS. Selection of MO-SMS to ignore is implementation dependent.\nIf the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message from the VLR, the MME shall stop timer Ts6-1 and:\n-\tmove the state of the SGs association to SGs-ASSOCIATED;\n-\tset the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" to \"true\"; and\n-\tindicate to the UE the acceptance of the VLR to the location update procedure. The message sent to the UE includes the Location Area Identity (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]).\nThe MME shall wait for the outcome of the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the VLR before sending a response to location update procedure to the UE. When the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the VLR, it will map the reject cause received to the appropriate reject cause as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14], and report this reject cause to the UE.\nIf the VLR included the  identity information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message, the MME shall relay the information received to the UE. If the  identity information element contains a new TMSI, this will cause the UE to perform a TMSI reallocation procedure. In this case, the MME shall send to the VLR the SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message when the MME receives the ATTACH COMPLETE or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message from the UE. If the  identity information element contains an IMSI, this will cause the UE to deallocate its TMSI.\nIf the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the VLR, the MME\n-\tshall stop timer Ts6-1;\n-\tshall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL; and\n-\tindicates to the UE the rejection of the Location Update procedure by the VLR as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]. The Reject cause value sent by the VLR shall be mapped to the appropriate reject cause as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14], and the latter is forwarded to the UE.\nNOTE:\tUpon receiving an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message with MM cause #11 or MM cause #13, if the MME is configured to know that the VPLMN has a suitable roaming agreement for E-UTRAN with the HPLMN of the UE, the MME can map the MM cause to EMM cause #18 as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14].\nIf timer Ts6-1 expires, the MME shall abort the Location Update for non-EPS service procedure and indicate this to the UE with the Reject cause value 'MSC temporarily not reachable'. The state of the SGs association to the VLR shall be SGs-NULL.\nIf the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message and timer Ts6-1 is not running then:\n-\tif timer Ts8 is running (see subclause 5.4), the message shall be ignored;\n-\tif timer Ts9 is running (see subclause 5.5), the message shall be ignored; or\n-\tif timers Ts8 and Ts9 are not running:\n-\tif the state of the SGs association to the VLR is SGs-ASSOCIATED, the message shall be ignored; or\n-\tif the state of the SGs association to the VLR is different than SGs-ASSOCIATED, the message shall be treated as a message incompatible with the protocol state of the MME (see subclause 7.3).\nThis subclause applies when the UE supporting NB-S1 mode only requests SMS services via a normal attach request or tracking area update request.\nIf the UE supporting NB-S1 mode only requests SMS services using normal attach request or tracking area update request, the location update for non-EPS services procedure can be initiated by the MME when SMS over SGs is used.\nIf timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:\n-\tan attach request indicating EPS attach and \"SMS only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available and SMS over SGs is used for the UE;\n-\ta tracking area update request indicating TA updating and \"SMS only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available, SMS over SGs is used for the UE and the MME detects that the LAI has changed;\n-\ta tracking area update request indicating TA updating and \"SMS only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available, SMS over SGs is used for the UE and the state of the SGs association is SGs-NULL; or\n-\ta tracking area update request indicating TA updating and \"SMS only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available, SMS over SGs is used for the UE and the MME detects that the MME serving the UE has changed.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the MME supports both SMS in MME feature and SMS over SGs, depending on UE capability and/or network configuration and/or \"PS and SMS only\" subscription, it can be preferred to provide SMS services via SMS in MME to avoid the VLR registration.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE does not include the MS Classmark 2 IE in a normal attach request or normal tracking area update request, and the MME does not store this information or include it in subsequent messages to the VLR. Services that use information part of MS Classmark 2, e.g. CAMEL, can therefore fail when SMS over SGs is provided via normal procedures.\nIf the MME has a stored TMSI for the UE, the MME may include this TMSI in the TMSI based NRI container IE in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message. Otherwise the MME shall indicate \"no valid TMSI available\" in the TMSI status IE in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\nIf the MME received a normal attach request or normal tracking area update request from the UE with an indication for \"SMS only\", the MME may allocate a default location area identification specifically configured for that case.\nIf the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message from the VLR, the MME shall:\n-\tstop timer Ts6-1 and move the state of the SGs association to SGs-ASSOCIATED;\n-\tset the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" to \"true\"; and\n-\tindicate to the UE the acceptance of SMS services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14].\nNOTE 3:\tThe message sent to the UE does not include the Location Area Identity or the Mobile identity information element if received from the VLR.\nIf the VLR included the Location area identifier or the Mobile identity information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message, the MME may store the received Location area identifier or the Mobile identity information element for the subsequent location update for non-EPS services procedure for the UE. If the Mobile identity information element contains a new TMSI, the MME may send to the VLR the SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message when the MME indicates to the UE the acceptance of SMS services. If the Mobile identity information element contains an IMSI, the MME may delete any stored TMSI for the UE.\nIf the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the VLR, the MME shall:\n-\tstop timer Ts6-1 and move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL; and\n-\tindicate to the UE the rejection of SMS services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14]. The MME maps the location update reject cause received from the VLR to an appropriate value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14] and forwards to the UE.\nIf timer Ts6-1 expires, the MME shall abort the Location Update for non-EPS service procedure. The MME indicates to the UE the rejection of SMS services by setting an appropriate value and shall as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14] and forwards to the UE. The state of the SGs association to the VLR shall be SGs-NULL.\n",

If the IMSI is not known, the VLR retrieves the MM context of the UE from the HSS.\nIn networks supporting the feature 'Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes' (3GPP TS 23.236 [6A]), if the TMSI based NRI container is received in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the VLR derives the NRI value. If the NRI value is not allocated by the VLR, the VLR retrieves the MM context of the UE from the HSS.\nWhen the VLR is configured for gateway core network (GWCN), the VLR shall select the serving CS domain operator as follows:\n-\tIf the selected CS domain operator information element is received in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the VLR shall select the serving CS domain operator as specified in the selected CS domain operator information element;\n-\tIf the selected CS domain operator information element is not received in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the PLMN ID included in the new location area identifier information element identifies a CS domain operator, the VLR shall select the serving CS domain operator as specified in the new location area identifier information element;\n-\tOtherwise, the VLR selects the serving CS domain operator based on local policies.\nIf the location update is accepted by the VLR and, if necessary, by the HSS, the VLR shall:\n-\tmove the SGs association to the SGs-ASSOCIATED state;\n-\tset the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to \"true\";\n-\tupdate the SGs association by storing the MME address included in SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and\n-\tsend an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message to the sending MME. This message includes the location area identifier received in the New location area identifier information element in the previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\nAfter the VLR has updated the SGs association, if Ts5 is still running for a MT service for this UE, the VLR shall repeat SGs Paging Request towards the updated SGs association.\nIf the location update is rejected by the VLR, the VLR shall:\n-\tsend an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message to the MME with the appropriate reject cause as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8] and shall indicate to the MME the Location area identifier received in the corresponding SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and\n-\tmove the SGs association to SGs-NULL.\nIf the VLR decides to allocate a new TMSI to the UE, the VLR shall include the new TMSI in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message. After sending the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message with a new TMSI the VLR shall start timer Ts6-2. If the VLR decides to deallocate the TMSI of the UE, the VLR shall include the IMSI of the UE in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message.\nUpon receipt of the SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message, the VLR shall stop the timer Ts6-2 and consider the new TMSI as valid.\nIf the IMSI was sent to the UE, the VLR considers the old TMSI if available, as deleted.\nIf no SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message is received by the VLR before the timer Ts6-2 expires, the VLR shall abort the TMSI reallocation procedure. The VLR shall consider the old TMSI if available, occupied until the new TMSI is used in a subsequent A/Iu message, or for an implementation dependent time. The outcome of the TMSI reallocation procedure does not change the state of the SGs association. The VLR uses the IMSI or a TMSI, either the new TMSI or the old TMSI if available, for paging.\nNOTE:\tWhether the new TMSI or old TMSI is used in the SGs paging request does not impact the paging procedure or UE response.\nThe following abnormal cases can be identified:\ni)\tMM signalling via A or Iu interface\nIf the VLR receives a Location Update request or an IMSI detach indication from the UE by the A or Iu interface when the state of the SGs association in the VLR is not SGs-NULL, the VLR shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL.\nii)\tAdditional Location Update Request\nIf the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT and an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message is received, then:\n-\tif the message is from the same MME and indicates the same New location area identifier information element as the outstanding location update request, then the VLR shall ignore this additional SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message;\n-\tif the message is from the same MME but indicates a different New location area identifier information element to the outstanding location update request, then the VLR shall treat this additional SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the VLR shall not send any response to the previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; or\n-\tif the message is from a different MME (indicating either the same or different New location area identifier information element) to the outstanding location update request, then the VLR shall treat this additional SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the VLR shall not send any response to the previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.\niii)\tDetach signalling from the MME\nIf the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT and either an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION or an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message is received, then the VLR shall abandon the Location Update for non-EPS services procedure (neither an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT messages is sent) and the further actions described in subclauses 5.4 or 5.5 or 5.6 are followed.\niv)\tSignalling via Gs interface\nIf the VLR receives for a UE a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.018 [16]) from an SGSN when the state of the SGs association for this UE in the VLR is not SGs-NULL, the VLR shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL.\nv)\tNew Location Update Request during TMSI reallocation procedure\nIf the VLR receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message while Ts6-2 is running, the VLR shall stop timer Ts6-2, abort the TMSI reallocation procedure and proceed with the new location update for non-EPS services procedure. If the VLR needs to page the MS during the new location update for non-EPS services procedure, the VLR uses the IMSI or a TMSI, either the new TMSI from the aborted TMSI reallocation procedure or the old TMSI if available, for paging.\nNOTE:\tWhether the new TMSI or old TMSI is used in the SGs paging request does not impact the paging procedure or UE response.\nvi)\tReset signalling from the MME\nIf the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT and an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message is received from the MME, then the VLR shall abandon the Location Update for non-EPS services procedure (neither an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT messages is sent) and the further actions described in subclause 5.8 are followed.\nvii)\tCollision between A or Iu paging and Location Update Request\nIf the VLR receives Location Update Request when A or Iu paging is ongoing, then the VLR may abort paging procedure over A or Iu interface and may initiate paging procedure over SGs interface after location updating procedure has successfully completed.\n",
