The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%.

The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.\nFor AWGN and NTN-TDLA100-200, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.\nTable 8.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN and NTN-TDLA100-200\n\nThe test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.4-1.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.4.1.2.\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.\n1)\tConnect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in D.6 for SAN  type 1-H.\n2)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel bandwidth.\nTable 8.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input\n\n3)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameter msg1-FrequencyStart is set to 0.\n4)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex G.\n5)\tAdjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table 8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3.\n6)\tAdjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 is achieved at the SAN input during the PRACH preambles.\n7)\tThe test signal generator sends a preamble, and the receiver tries to detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed preambles.\nThe figure depicts a PRACH preamble test pattern, which is a key component of a 5G network's radio interface. The pattern is used to test the functionality of the radio interface and ensure that it is functioning correctly. The figure shows the different components of the PRACH preamble, including the start symbol, stop symbol, and the carrier frequency. The presence of the carrier frequency is crucial for the proper functioning of the radio interface in a 5G network.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs.

The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and format 2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.\nThe figure depicts a timing offset scheme for the PRACH preamble format 0 and format 2, illustrating the timing offset between the two formats. The scheme is crucial for ensuring the correct timing of the preamble in the PRACH protocol, which is used in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and format 2\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8 us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-3.\nThe figure depicts a timing offset scheme for the PRACH preamble format B4 and C2, which is used in 5G communication systems. The scheme is crucial for ensuring accurate timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. The figure shows the timing offset values for each PRACH preamble format, which are used to adjust the timing of the transmitted signal. This scheme is essential for maintaining the integrity of the communication system and ensuring reliable transmission.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2\nPfa shall not exceed 0.1%.

The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the SAN.\nThe radiated performance requirements for SAN type 1-O are limited to two OTA demodulation branches as described in clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 demodulation branches depending on the number of polarizations supported by the SAN, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.\nUnless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a single carrier only.

The test pattern is used to evaluate the demodulation performance of the PUCCH format, with the goal of identifying any errors or issues that may arise during the demodulation process.\nFigure 11.3.3.1.4.2-1: Test signal pattern for PUCCH format 2 demodulation tests\n11.3.3.1.5.1\tRequirements for SAN type 1-O\nThe fraction of falsely detected ACKs shall be less than 1% and the fraction of correctly detected ACKs shall be larger than 99% for the SNR listed in table 11.3.3.1.5.1-1 and table 11.3.3.1.5.1-2.\nTable 11.3.3.1.5.1-1: Required SNR for PUCCH format 2 with 15 kHz SCS 5MHz channel bandwidth\n\nTable 11.3.3.1.5.1-2: Required SNR for PUCCH format 2 with 30 kHz SCS 10MHz channel bandwidth\n\nThe UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is sent.

When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.\nThe TTOTA values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TTOTA values may sometimes be set to zero.\nThe TTOTA values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).\nNote that a formula for applying TTOTA values is provided for all OTA tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2.

For FDD, there are  FFTs performed where  is the number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.\nThe position in time for the FFT shall be determined.\nFor the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).\nIn an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window W < CP. There are three different instants for FFT:\n-\tCentre of the reduced window, called ,\n-\t, and\n-\t.\nThe value of EVM window length W is obtained from tables 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS and the transmission bandwidth.\nThe SAN shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.\nThe timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as follows, using  and :\n1.\tThe measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are also spread and the timing is not obvious.\n2.\tIn the ideal signal , the timing is known.\nCorrelation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse response\" of the TX filter.\n3.\tThe meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation of the ideal signal  is a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal  and the data in the measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.\nThe number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to . This subset of  samples is called .\nFrom the acquired samples one timing can be derived.\nThe timing of the centre  is determined according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP, there are two values for  in a 1 ms period:\n-\t = length of cylic prefix / 2,\n-\t = Longer CP length - length of cylic prefix / 2,\nWhere the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS, and the longer CP length is obtained from table H.2.4-1.\nAs per the example values:\n-\t = 144 within the CP of length 288 for OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,\n-\t = 208= 352 - 144) within the CP of length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.\n",
