To meet these additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table 6.2B.1.1.3-1. Unless stated otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.\n6.2B.3.1.2 \tTest applicability\nThe requirements of this test apply in test case 6.5B.2.1.2 Additional spectrum emission mask for network signalled values NS_04 and NS_35 to all types of E-UTRA power class 3 and power class 2 UE release 15 and forward, supporting intra-band contiguous EN-DC.\n6.2B.3.1.3\tMinimum conformance requirements\nFor intra-band contiguous EN-DC band combinations with additional requirements the allowed A-MPR is specified in table 6.2B.3.1.3-1 for UEs configured with EN-DC and combinations of network signalling values indicated in the E-UTRA and NR cell groups.\nUnless otherwise stated the A-MPR specified in clause 6.2B.3.1 for intra-band contiguous EN-DC configurations is the total power reduction allowed including MPR.\nTable 6.2B.3.1.3-1: Additional maximum power reduction for Intra-band contiguous EN-DC\n\nThe normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-3 [4] clause 6.2B.3.1.\nException requirements for both NR and E-UTRA are defined for this test when transmission on E-UTRA overlap in time with NR.LTE anchor agnostic approach is not applied for this case. E-UTRA test point analysis is included and E-UTRA measurements are performed.\nException requirements for both NR and E-UTRA are defined for this test when transmission on E-UTRA doesn't overlap in time with NR, for a UE that doesn't support dynamic power sharing.

This difference is called the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset.

For the carrier in frequency range 2, requirements can be verified in OTA mode with E-UTRA connecting to the network by OTA without calibration.\nFor NR FR2 Rx test cases the identified beam peak direction can be stored and reused for a device under test in various configurations/environments for the full duration of device testing as long as beam peak direction is the same.\nThe requirements defined in this clause are the extra requirements compared with the single carrier requirements defined in TS 38.521-1 [8] and TS 38.521-2 [9].\nUnless otherwise stated, the UL and DL reference measurement channels are the same with the configurations specified in TS 38.521-1 [8] and TS 38.521-2 [9].\nUnless otherwise stated, requirements for NR receiver written in TS 38.521-1 [8] and TS 38.521-2 [9] apply and are assumed anchor agnostic.

All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each intra-band contiguous EN-DC configuration specified in clause 5.3B.1.2, and are shown in table 7.4B.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2.for E-UTRA RMC for TDD, TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.2 for E-UTRA RMC for FDD , and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 for NR RMC Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex C.2 and in TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.\nTable 7.4B.1.4.1-1: Test configuration table\n\n1.\tConnect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1 A.3.1.1 for SS diagram and A.3.2 for UE diagram.\n2.\tThe parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the NR cell are set up according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.\n3.\tDownlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex C.0, C.1,C.2,C3.1 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.0,C.1,C.2,C3.1for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and uplink signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H.0,H.1,H.2,H.3.1 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex G.0,G.1,G.2,G.3.1 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.\n4.\tThe UL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.2 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.\n5.\tPropagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.\n6.\tEnsure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer MCG and SCG, Connected without release On according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5.

The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.\n2.\tSS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 and PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.4B.1.4.1-1 on the E-UTRA CC and NR CC. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.\n3.\tSS sets the Downlink signal level for the E-UTRA CC and NR CC to the value defined in Table 7.4B.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in Table 7.4B.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement, where:\n-\tMU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW\n-\tFor NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1 [2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.\n-\tFor E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101 [5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of TS 36.521-1 [10].\n4.\tMeasure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.\nNOTE:\tThe purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.\nTable 7.4B.1.4.2-1: Void\n7.4B.1.4.3\tMessage Contents\nMessage contents are according to TS 36.508-1 [11] clause 4.6.1 and TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.6 Table 4.6.3-118 with condition TRANSFORM_PRECODER_ENABLED.\n7.4B.1.5\tTest Requirement\nThe throughput measurement of each CC derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels with parameters specified in Table 7.4B.1.5-1\nTable 7.4B.1.5-1: Maximum input level requirement for each CC\n\nTable 7.4B.1.5-2: Test Tolerance (Maximum input level)\n\n",

The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.\n2.\tSS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 and PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.5B.1.4.1-1 on the E-UTRA CC and NR CC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.\n3.\tSet the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5B.0.1-1 (Case 1). For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in Table 7.5B.0.1-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement, where:\n-\tMU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.\n-\tFor NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1 [2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.\n-\tFor E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101 [5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of TS 36.521-1 [10].\n4.\tSet the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5B.0.1-1 (Case 1) and frequency below the aggregated component carriers, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D.\n5.\tMeasure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.\n6.\tRepeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated component carriers in Case 1 at step 4.\n7.\tSet the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5B.0.1-2 (Case 2). For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in Table 7.5B.0.1-2 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement, where MU and Uplink power control window size are defined above.\n8.\tSet the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5B.0.1-2 (Case 2) and frequency below the aggregated component carriers, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D.\n9.\tMeasure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.\n10.\tRepeat steps from 7 to 9, using an interfering signal above the aggregated component carriers in Case 2 at step 8.\n11.\tRepeat for applicable channel bandwidths and operating band combinations in both Case 1 and Case 2.\nNOTE:\tThe purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.\n7.5B.1.4.3\tMessage Contents\nMessage contents are according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.6 Table 4.6.3-118 with condition TRANSFORM_PRECODER_ENABLED\nMessage contents exceptions are according to TS 36.521-1 [10] clause 7.3.4.3 for each network signalling value..\n7.5B.1.5\tTest requirement\nThe throughput measurement of each CG derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.3 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively under the conditions specified in Table 7.5B.0.1-1, and also under the conditions specified in Table 7.5B.0.1-2.\n",

The over all Pass /Fail conditions are defined in clause H.2.6and H.2A.6\nHaving observed   0  errors, pass the test at      67+    samples,                                                 otherwise continue\nHaving observed   1  error,   pass the test at     95+  otherwise continue\nHaving observed   2  errors,  pass the test at     119+  samples, fail the test at       2- samples,  otherwise continue\nEtc. etc.\nHaving observed 151 errors,  pass the test at  2452+  samples, fail the test at 2433- samples,  otherwise continue\nHaving observed 152 errors,  pass the test at  2466+  samples, fail the test at 2451- samples.\nWhere x+ means: x or more,        x- means x or less\nNOTE 1:\tan ideal DUT passes after 67 samples. The maximum test time is 2466 samples.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is allowed to deviate from the early decision concept  by  postponing  the decision (pass/fail or continue). Postponing the decision to or beyond the end of Table H.2.4-1 requires a pass fail decision against the test limit: pass the DUT for ER<0.0618, otherwise fail.\nPlease refer to Annex J in TS 38.521-1 [8] and 38.521-2 [9] for appropriate details as needed for test cases in this test specification. Exceptions for EN-DC may be added as needed.\nPlease refer to Annex K in 38.521-2 [9] for appropriate details as needed for test cases in this test specification. Exceptions for EN-DC may be added as needed.\nUE is mandated to support operation in dual and triple uplink mode for EN-DC configuration in NR FR1 listed in Table 5.5B.2-1, Table 5.5B.3-1, and Table 5.5B.4.1-1 and indicated by column single uplink allowed, Table 7.3B.2.0.3.5.1-1, Table 7.3B.2.0.3.5.2-0, Table 7.3B.2.0.3.5.2-1 or NE-DC configuration in NR FR1 listed in Table 5.5B.4a.1-1 and indicated by column single uplink allowed if the intermodulation products caused by the dual uplink operation do not interfere with its own primary downlink transmission channel bandwidth. For intermodulation products falling into LTE secondary downlink channel bandwidth, UE single UL capability is not considered.\nFormula for determining if the EN-DC in NR FR1 configuration with dual uplink operation interferes with its own downlink reception.\nInterference bandwidth: IBW = |a| * CBW1 + |b| * CBW2\n-\t|a| + |b| = 2 (or 3)\n-\tCBW1 and CBW2 are the transmission bandwidth configurations of the UL channels\nCenter frequency of IBW:  fIBW = |a * f1 + b * f2|\n-\tf1 and f2 are center frequency of the transmission bandwidth configurations of each UL channel\nThe range of IMD 2 (or 3): [fIBW – IBW/2, fIBW + IBW/2]\nNOTE 1:\tUE shall be able to apply operations which are configured by RRC reconfiguration and corresponding HARQ timing on the transmission bandwidth.\nNOTE 2:\tFor identified difficult band combination, during two adjacent RRC reconfiguration, the changing of transmission bandwidth should not introduce IM2 and IM3, which will result in UE changing from 2Tx to 1Tx. Otherwise, UE behavior is not specified.\nFor DC_3A_n3A intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC combination, only single switched UL is supported in Rel-15.\nFor DC_2A_n2A, DC_66A_n66A intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC combination, only single switched UL is supported.\nEditor’s note: The modifiedMPRbehavior is given in the Annex H.1 of TS 38.101-3.\n",
