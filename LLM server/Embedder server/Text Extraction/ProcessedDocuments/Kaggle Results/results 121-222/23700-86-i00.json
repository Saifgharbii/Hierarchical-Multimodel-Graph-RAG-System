A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].\nApplication Layer ID: An identifier identifying a Ranging/SL Positioning-enabled UE within the context of a specific application, is used by the SL Positioning Client UE, the application of the Target UE/SL Reference UE or the Application server to identify the target UE and the SL Reference UE in the service request.\nAssistant UE: A UE supporting Ranging/Sidelink Positioning between a SL Reference UE and a Target UE over PC5, when the direct Ranging/Sidelink positioning between the SL Reference UE and Target UE cannot be supported. The measurement/result of Ranging/Sidelink Positioning between the Assistant UE and the SL Reference UE and that between the Assistant UE and the Target UE are determined and used to derive the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning result between Target UE and SL Reference UE.\nNOTE 1:\tAssistant UE is understood as \"Anchor UE\" in RAN WG1 TR 38.859 [21] when it performs the AS layer operation.\nLocated UE: A SL Reference UE of which the location is known or is able to be known using Uu based positioning. A Located UE can be used to determine the location of a Target UE using Sidelink Positioning.\nNetwork-assisted Operation: Operation of Ranging/Sidelink Positioning with the involvement of 5GC NFs for the service request handling and result calculation.\nPositioning: A functionality, which detects a geographical location and optionally, velocity (of e.g. a mobile terminal).\nRanging: Refers to the determination of the distance between two UEs or more UEs and/or the direction of one UE (i.e. Target UE) from another UE (i.e. Reference UE) via PC5 interface.\nRelative position: An estimate of the UE position relative to other network elements or relative to other UEs.\nSL Reference UE: A UE, supporting positioning of target UE, e.g. by transmitting and/or receiving reference signals for positioning, providing positioning-related information, etc. using sidelink.\nNOTE 2:\tSL Reference UE is understood as \"Anchor UE\" in RAN WG1 TR 38.859 [21].\nNOTE 3:\t\"Reference UE\" mentioned in KIs and Solutions of this TR refers to \"SL Reference UE\".\nSidelink Positioning: Positioning UE using PC5 to obtain absolute position, relative position, or ranging information.\nSL Positioning Client UE: A third-party UE, other than SL Reference UE and Target UE, which initiates Ranging/Sidelink positioning service request on behalf of the application residing on it.\nNOTE 4:\tThe SL Positioning Client UE does not have to support Ranging/Sidelink positioning capability, but a communication between the SL Positioning Client UE and SL Reference UE/Target UE has to be established, either via PC5 or via 5GC, for the transmission of the service request and the result.\nSL Positioning Server UE: A UE offering method determination, assistant data distribution and/or location calculation functionalities and/or location calculation functionalities for Sidelink Positioning and Ranging based service. It interacts with other UEs over PC5 as necessary in order to determine Ranging/SL Position method, distribute assistant data and calculate the location of the Target UE. Target UE or SL Reference UE can act as SL Positioning Server UE if any of the functionalities is supported.\nTarget UE: A UE whose distance, direction and/or position is measured with the support from one or multiple SL Reference UEs using Sidelink in the Ranging based service and Sidelink positioning.\nUE-only Operation: Operation of Ranging/Sidelink Positioning in which the service request handling and result calculation are performed by UE.\nNOTE 5:\tFor UE-only Operation, the communication among UEs are over PC5.\nEditor's note:\tDefinition on the terminology of Ranging and Sidelink positioning will be aligned with RAN WGs, and will be revisited when there's any conclusion in RAN WGs.\n",

Therefore, it is beneficial to design a common framework and system to support all these types of operations.\nThe control signalling part of the Ranging and Sidelink Positioning operation may occur between the UEs before and after the transmission of the Ranging/Sidelink positioning signals.

The PC5 Capability for Ranging/SL positioning indicates whether the UE is capable of Ranging/SL positioning service over PC5 reference point.\n-\tIf the UE does not have valid authorisation and policy/parameters for Ranging/SL positioning, the UE includes the UE Policy Container with indicating the Policy Provisioning Request for Ranging/SL positioning during registration procedure.\n-\tIf the UE indicates the Policy Provisioning Request for Ranging/SL positioning in the UE Policy Container, the PCF determines whether to provision Policy/parameters for Ranging/SL positioning to the UE, as specified in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS 23.503 [15], and the PCF provides the Policy/parameters for Ranging/SL positioning to the UE by using the procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.3 \"UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy Delivery\" in TS 23.502 [9].\nThe followings reflect the additions of the 5GC processing w.r.t Ranging/SL positioning:\n-\tIf the AMF receives the PC5 Capability for Ranging/SL positioning in the Registration Request message from UE, the AMF selects the PCF which supports Ranging/SL positioning and establishes a UE policy association with PCF for Ranging/SL positioning service Policy/Parameter delivery.\nThe followings reflect the additions provided to the UE from PCF w.r.t Ranging/SL positioning:\n-\tA \"Ranging/SL positioning service authorized\" indication, indicating the UE is authorized to use Ranging/SL positioning service in the PLMN(s).\n-\tThe authorized Ranging/SL positioning service types, authorized application IDs, authorized user IDs.\n-\tThe authorized Ranging/SL positioning parameters.\nEditor's note:\tthe Ranging/SL positioning parameters are FFS and may be coordinated with RAN WGs.\n-\tThe authorized Ranging/SL positioning role, e.g. target UE, reference UE, assistant UE.\n-\tThe authorized discovery mode and UE role in discovery for Ranging/SL positioning.\nThe followings reflect the additions provided to the NG-RAN from AMF w.r.t Ranging/SL positioning:\n-\tA \"Ranging/SL positioning service authorized\" indication based on UE subscription from UDM, indicating the UE is authorized to use Ranging/SL positioning service in the serving PLMN.\n-\tThe authorized Ranging/SL positioning parameters used by the NG-RAN for the resource management of UE's PC5 transmission for Ranging/SL positioning services in network scheduled mode, which is from PCF and stored in AMF.\nEditor's note:\tthe Ranging/SL positioning parameters are FFS and may be coordinated with RAN WGs.\n-\tThe authorized Ranging/SL positioning role based on UE subscription from UDM, e.g. target UE, reference UE, assistant UE.\nThe parameters may be preconfigured in ME/UICC, the UE can work without provision of configuration parameters from the network, especially in the use case of out-of-coverage. Or when the UE with Ranging/SL positioning capability is in coverage, the UE can access to the network to obtain the necessary configuration data from the network (e.g. PCF). One the other hand, the network will also provide RAN-related configuration data (e.g. Ranging/SL positioning authorized) to RAN node so as to enable RAN node to allocate PC5 resource once UE initiates Ranging/SL positioning operation.\n",

The SL Positioning Client UE may suggest the initiator UE (i.e. which is used to perform signalling exchange with the LMF) based on implementation and indicate which UE is the initiator UE to the AMF.\n\n3.\tThe AMF may select a GMLC based on NRF query or configuration in AMF, and then acts as an LCS client to request the GMLC for Ranging/SL positioning result, the AMF further includes the SL Positioning Client UE ID in the request.\n4. The GMLC determines the initiator UE (e.g. UE2) from UE1 and UE2 and sends the Namf_Location_ProvidePositioningInfo request to the UE2’s AMF2. GMLC can performs the authorization on the Ranging/SL positioning operation request from SL Positioning Client UE.\nNOTE:\tThe security and privacy consideration for the Ranging/SL positioning operation should be studied by SA WG3.\n5. The AMF2 selects the LMF (e.g. LMF2) and sends the Nlmf_Location_DetermineLocation request (UE1 ID, UE2 ID) to the LMF2 for the Ranging/SL positioning result between the UE1 and UE2.\n6. The LMF2 triggers the UE2 to perform Ranging/SL positioning with the UE1 via AMF2. The measurement request message may include the Ranging/SL positioning demand, UE1 ID, UE2 ID, etc. The UE2 performs the Ranging/SL positioning operation with the UE1, and reports the Ranging/SL positioning measurements to the LMF for calculation.\n7. The LMF2 makes calculation based on the Ranging/SL positioning measurements and returns the Ranging/SL positioning result to the AMF2.\n8. The AMF2 returns the Ranging/SL positioning result to the GMLC.\n9. Then the GMLC returns the result to the AMF3.10.\tThe AMF3 returns the result to the SL Positioning Client UE.\n",

The Reference UE uses the direct discovery procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2.1 of TS 23.304 [4] to expose its Ranging/Sidelink positioning service for the SL Positioning Client UE. The SL Positioning Client UE is not required to be Ranging/Sidelink positioning capable. As described in the following Figure 6.10.1.1-1, the SL Positioning Client UE performs the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider (e.g. a Reference UE) discovery and selection based on the Ranging information in the discovery message. The Ranging information may include the role indication (i.e. \" Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider \"), Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider's ranging capability, the level of ranging accuracy, ranging method and info of the list of UE that the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider can range with. After that, the SL Positioning Client UE invokes the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provided by the selected Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider, and request Ranging result between UE1 and UE2. The Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider performs the Ranging procedure with UE1 and with UE2 respectively based on the solutions of KI#4, and calculates the ranging result between UE1 and UE2 based on the ranging result between UE1 and itself and the ranging result between UE2 and itself. This ranging service exposure can be simplified for the following figure if SL Positioning Client UE can reach UE#1 or UE#2 directly and trigger any one of them to performing ranging with each other. Thus in this case the reference UE in the figure below can be UE#1 or UE#2 and then there are only 3 roles.\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for ranging service exposure via a Reference UE, illustrating the steps involved in the process. The figure includes a diagram of the UE, a reference signal, and a signal source, with arrows indicating the path of the signal. The figure also includes a legend to explain the symbols used in the diagram.\nFigure 6.10.1.1-1: High-level procedure for ranging service exposure via Reference UE\nFurthermore, in this solution, the SL Positioning Client UE can be replaced by UE1 or UE2. For this case, the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider mentioned on above is considered as the Assistant UE and the procedures of the Ranging service exposure can be reflected by the following figure 6.10.1.1-2.\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for ranging service exposure via an Assistant UE, illustrating the steps involved in enabling the service and ensuring proper communication.\nFigure 6.10.1.1-2: High-level procedure for ranging service exposure via Assistant UE\n",

Ranging exposure info may include the list of UEs info that the Reference UE can perform the Ranging and Sidelink positioning with, and the level of the ranging accuracy.\n2.\tIf a SL Positioning Client UE has the requirement to invoke the ranging service to obtain the ranging result between UE#1 and UE#2, based on the Ranging exposure info, the SL Positioning Client UE performs the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service providers' discovery and selection. For the selected Reference UE, the SL Positioning Client UE may perform the direct link establishment procedure with Assistant UE.\n3.\tTo invoke the selected Reference UE's ranging service, the SL Positioning Client UE sends a ranging service request to Assistant UE via the PC5 message to request the requesting Ranging estimation/result between UE1 and UE2. In addition, the PC5 message may include the SL Positioning Client UE info.\n4.\tAfter receiving the Ranging service request from the SL Positioning Client UE, the Reference UE may perform the authentication procedure to determine whether the SL Positioning Client UE is authorised to invoke this Ranging service (e.g. to obtain the ranging result between UE1 and UE2).\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS on authentication procedure.\n5.\tIf the SL Positioning Client UE is authorised, the Assistant UE performs the ranging and positioning procedure with the UE#1 and UE#2 based on the solutions of KI#4.\n6.\tThe Reference UE obtains the ranging measurement of UE#1 and UE#2 and calculates the Ranging result between UE#1 and UE#2.\n7.\tAfter that, the Reference UE responses to the SL Positioning Client UE with the Ranging service response. The ranging service response includes the ranging result between UE#1 and UE#2.\nThe above procedure of Ranging/Sidelink Positioning exposure also is applied to model B discovery for SL Positioning Client UE as described in the following figure 6.10.2.1-1b. During the reference UE discovery and selection (as described in the following step1~3), the SL Positioning Client UE sends the solicitation message to initiate the Reference UE to discover the Target UEs using the solution of KI#3. Only the Reference UE who successfully discover the Target UE will response the SL Positioning Client UE. After that, the SL Positioning Client UE selects one or more Reference UE to consume the Ranging service as described in the following step5~9 which are same as step3~7 in the Figure 6.10.2.1-1a.\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for ranging/sidelink positioning in a 5G network, with a focus on the Model B discovery process. The figure illustrates the steps involved in positioning, including the use of a 100 MHz frequency, 100 MHz bandwidth, and 100 MHz sampling rate. The figure also includes a 100 MHz frequency, 100 MHz bandwidth, and 100 MHz sampling rate, and a 100 MHz frequency, 100 MHz bandwidth, and 100 MHz sampling rate.

In this case, the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service provider (e.g. above Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2) mentioned above is considered as the Assistant UE.\nThe figure depicts the various stages of the ranging service exposure to the SL Positioning Client UE, including the initiation of the ranging service, the transmission of the ranging request, the reception of the ranging response, and the subsequent processing of the response.\nFigure 6.10.2.2-1: Deferred procedures of Ranging service exposure to the SL Positioning Client UE\n1~7.\tThe step1~5 are similar to the step1~5 of the clause 6.10.2.1. Difference is that the Ranging service request from the SL Positioning Client UE may include the deferred event. The event may be as follows:\n-\tPeriodic ranging: An event where a defined periodic timer expires, then activates a ranging procedure and ranging result report.\nEditor's note:\tWhat are the other events that may trigger Ranging/Sidelink positioning service is FFS.\n8.\tAfter the step 6, the Reference UE detects the event.\n9.\tWhen the event is detected, the Reference UE performs the Ranging/Sidelink positioning procedure with UE1/UE1 based on the solution of KI#4.\n10.\tReference UE re-calculate the ranging result and reports the ranging result between UE1 and UE2 included in the ranging service response to the SL Positioning Client UE via the PC5 message.\n",

The service operation can be Namf_Location_ProvidePositioningInfo with the same enhancements described above for Ngmlc_Location_ProvideLocation or a new service operation could be defined if needed.\n-\tStep 10: an LMF must be selected that supports ranging/sidelink positioning.\n-\tStep 11: either the Nlmf_Location service operations should be extended to support ranging/sidelink positioning with the enhancements described for Ngmlc_Location_ProvideLocation service operation or a new service operation should be defined for that purpose.\n3.\tIf not done yet, the LMF checks the ProSe capabilities registered for the UEs in step 0 with the AMF.\n4.\tFor the UEs supporting ProSe capabilities including also location reporting, the LMF interacts with the ProSe application server (or PCF) to initiate Relay operation for location reporting.\n5.\t[OPTIONAL] If not done previously, the ProSe AS may authorize and/or configure UE1 as the reference UE through which the other UEs (similar to ProSe Remote UEs) can relay location information to LMF.\nThe reference UE (acting similar to a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay as specified in TS 23.304 [4]) may be configured or provisioned with special Relay Service Codes (RSCs) authorized for location reporting. This is provided by the PCF, already provisioned in the ME or configured in the UICC.\nUE1 in Figure 6.12.3-1 is configured as ProSe L2 NW relay\nEditor's note:\tWhether UE1 in Figure 6.12.3-1 can be configured as ProSe L3 NW relay is FFS.\n6.\tIf not done previously, the ProSe application server authorizes the target UEs. It also configures or provisions target UEs with special RSCs authorized for location reporting. This is provided by the PCF, already provisioned in the ME or configured in the UICC.\n7-8.\tThe ProSe Relay Discovery on the UEs identified in Steps 3-5 is conducted with special RSCs based on either model A or Model B as specified in cl. 6.3.2.3 of TS 23.304 [4]. The discovery between the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and target UEs is triggered based on UE pre-configuration. Once discovered, the connections between the reference UE and the other UEs are established over PC5. It is not necessary to establish any UP PDU session for such special RSCs between the reference UE (or other UEs) and network as such RSCs may not be associated with any specific PDU session parameters.\n9.\tThe ProSe application server (or PCF) responds or notifies the LMF when the relay configuration is complete.\n10.\tThe LMF sends a ranging/sidelink positioning request to UE1. The request may contain multiple target UEs.\nNOTE 1:\tUE1 is assumed to be the located UE acting as reference UE, in coverage for this solution. UE1 is also acting as ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\n11\tUE1 initiates side-link based positioning over PC5 for the multiple target UEs (as instructed by the LMF in step 11). This may include obtaining position estimates from a multiple UEs, which e.g. would carry out UE based positioning, obtain positioning assistance data from these UEs or execute a sidelink based positioning method (and gaining relative or absolute position information of the set of UEs). Whichever method is used, the reference UE will collect this data through the side-link in this step.\n12.\tUE1 sends the ranging/sidelink positioning measurements and/or results to the LMF. The location information from multiple UEs can be concatenated into a fewer positing protocol messages at the reference UE, in order to save signalling overhead. If requested by the server, the LMF may combine the location information of UE1 with the ranging/sidelink positioning information related to the target UEs to derive absolute location information for the target UEs.\n13.\tThe LMF forwards the ranging/sidelink positioning and location results to the AMF.\n14.\tThe AMF forwards the ranging/sidelink positioning and location results to the GMLC.\n15.\tThe GMLC exposes the ranging/sidelink positioning and location results to the ranging application server via NEF with the response operation of the service employed in step 1.\n",

The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the Ranging operation and its components.\nFigure 6.16.3-1: High-level procedure for Ranging operation with assistant UE\n1.\tUE1 and UE2 get the ranging authorization policy from PCF during the registration procedure. The ranging authorization policy may include whether the UE is authorized to perform ranging operation with assistant UE.

The ranging authorization policy may include whether the UE is authorized to act as an assistant UE for ranging operation.\n2.\tWhen the UE1 gets the ranging request from the application layer, but the direct ranging operation between the UE1 and UE2 cannot be supported, so UE1 will perform assistant UE discovery procedure. Specifically, there are two options:\nOption A (Assistant UE selection by UE2): the UE1 sends a discovery message including the ranging indication and UE2 User Info, and if the UE receives the message including the ranging indication and supports as Assistant UE based on the authorization policy in step 1 or its ranging capability, it will generate and send a discovery message including UE2 User Info. After UE2 performs the Assistant UE selection based on e.g. signal strength or whether LOS path exists, and responses to the selected Assistant UE(s).

Then the ranging request includes Ranging accuracy 2.\nNOTE 2:\tCoordination with RAN WGs is needed for the determination of Ranging accuracy 1 and Ranging accuracy 2.\nUE1 may get a scheduled ranging time from application layer or generate a scheduled ranging time locally. The ranging request includes the scheduled ranging time, and then step 4 and step 5 can be performed at the same scheduled ranging time.\n4.\tThe UE1 obtains the relative position of the Assistant UE(s) (named as relative position 1), by triggering the direct ranging procedure defined by the solutions for KI#4 and using Ranging Method 1 based on Ranging accuracy 1. If multiple Assistant UEs are used, the direct ranging procedure can be performed for each Assistant UE.\n5.\tThe UE2 obtains the relative position of the Assistant UE (named as relative position 2), by triggering the direct ranging procedure defined by the solutions for KI#4 and using Ranging Method 2 based on Ranging accuracy 2.

No ranging service requirement for a long time may affect that the device turn off or de-activate the ranging device discovery and ranging measurement. If current the peer device (UE#2) has ranging requirement with UE#1, direct discovery over PC5 seems not work. In this regard, it is proposed to use the Network triggered ranging service discovery to activate the peer UE device discovery procedure.\nIn this solution, for the network triggered ranging device discovery, as described in figure 6.18.1-1, the UE#1 sends the ranging device discovery request to the network, then the network notifies that the UE#2 turns on or activate the ranging device discovery. After receiving the notification from the network, UE#2 initiates the ranging device discovery with UE#1.\nThis solution has 2 alternatives as following:\n-\t5GC based network triggered ranging device discovery.\n-\tApplication layer-based Network triggered ranging device discovery.\nFor the 5GC-based Network triggered ranging device discovery, the above-mentioned procedure is performed over the Control plane as descried in clause 6.18.2 and this procedure is designed for UEs from same PLMN.\nFor the Application layer-based Network triggered ranging device discovery, the above-mentioned procedure is performed over the application layer as described in clause 6.18.3, which may be not in the SA2 scope for some interactions. This procedure can work for UEs from different PLMN.\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for network-triggered ranging device discovery in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps involved in identifying and locating network-triggered ranging devices, which are essential for enhancing network performance and security.

Specifically, this solution focused on supporting the control signalling over different PC5 access technologies, with minimum AS layer impacts and on supporting sidelink positioning with or without assistance from an LMF.\nAs described by solution#14 (clause 6.14), the system architecture supports interactions between the UEs (e.g. UE-A and UE C, UE A and UE B, or UE C and UE-D) and between UE and 5GC. For the interactions between the UEs, the operation over the SR5 reference point is carried over the PC5 reference point. Due to different deployment scenarios and operations, PC5 reference point may utilize different type of access technologies, including LTE PC5 and NR based PC5 for V2X use (as of TS 23.287 [3]), and 5G ProSe based PC5 (as of TS 23.304 [4]).

The architecture shown in Figure 6.19.2.1-1 is aligned with that for Solution #14 clause 6.14.4 but includes more details for each upper protocol layer.\nThe figure depicts the architecture and functions of an UE (User Equipment) for sidelink positioning and ranging services in a 5G network. It illustrates the various components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths for failover reliability.\nFigure 6.19.2.1-1: UE functions and architecture for sidelink positioning and ranging service\nThe function elements identified in clause 6.19.1 are defined as follows:\n-\tDevice and Service Discovery Function (DSDF):\n-\tDSDF provides the following services to the upper layer, e.g. Application Layer:\n-\ta unique identifier of the UE(s) in proximity that can participate in Sidelink Positioning and Ranging service;\n-\tservices supported by each of the UE identified, e.g. signaling protocols, pairwise ranging, group ranging;\n-\tcommunication channel and sessions with the identified UEs.\n-\tDSDF may receive the following information from the upper layer:\n-\ttrigger for the discovery of UEs to participate in Sidelink Positioning and Ranging services;\n-\t(optional) attributes of the UEs to be discovered;\n-\tindication of discovery by other UEs and corresponding attributes of the other UEs;\n-\tRequest/permission for the corresponding Sidelink Positioning and Ranging services.\n-\tOperation performed by DSDF:\n-\tPerforming device and service discovery using PC5 communication service provided by ProSe or V2X layer. For example, it may perform application layer discovery using broadcast service over PC5 reference point.\n-\tGroup Support Service Function (GSSF):\n-\tGSSF may be part of the Application Layer (e.g. for V2X) or may be a layer below the Application layer (e.g. for MC services);\nEditor's note:\tit is FFS whether GSSF is in scope for 3GPP for V2X or whether GSSF for V2X remains out of scope and part of the Application Layer.\n-\tGSSF (when below the Application Layer) provides the following services to the upper layer, e.g. Application Layer:\n-\tcreating a Sidelink Positioning and Ranging service group, when the upper layer has specified the group. GSSF needs to provide group ID and group local member IDs to the upper layer. GSSF needs to also manage the group members, e.g. addition or removal of group members, splitting or merge of groups, etc. as decided by the upper layer;\n-\twith upper layer application layer managed group function, e.g. V2X platooning application, the GMSF provides the needed support for the group member status monitoring, i.e. indication of group members of presence and capability/status of the group members. GSSF may make use of the service of DSDF for the needed operation.\n-\tGSSF may receive the following information from the upper layer:\n-\trequest for the creation or deletion of a group containing identified UEs for Sidelink Positioning and Ranging service;\n-\trequest for the operation of a specific group member, e.g. add or remove a group member;\n-\trequest for the management of a group, e.g. merge 2 groups or split a group into 2 separate groups.\n-\tOperation performed by GSSF:\n-\tPerforming group management requested by upper layer using the PC5 communication service provided by ProSe Layer or V2X layer. The messages generated by GSSF are sent as data traffic over the PC5 reference point and does not require additional enhancements to PC5 reference point.\nNOTE 1:\tThe group support is only for the control signalling, e.g. to determine which UE should be part of the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging session. It does not affect how AS layer positioning/ranging signal operates.\n-\tSidelink Positioning and Ranging Function (SPRF):\n-\tSPRF provides the following services to the upper layer, e.g. Application Layer:\n-\tcreate a Sidelink Positioning/Ranging session between a specified group of UEs;\n-\ton-demand Sidelink Positioning/Ranging, direction, or relative location of another UE or a specified group of UEs;\n-\tperiodic Sidelink Positioning/Ranging, direction, or relative location of another UE or a specified group of UEs;\n-\ttriggered Sidelink Positioning/Ranging, direction, or relative location of another UE or a specified group of UEs.\n-\tSPRF may receive the following information from the upper layer:\n-\trequest for current range/direction or relative location of another UE or a specified group of UEs;\n-\trequest for periodic range/direction or relative location of another UE or a specified group of UEs;\n-\trequest for triggered range/direction or relative location of another UE or a specified group of UEs.\nNOTE 2:\tThe request from upper layers may originate on the UE itself (e.g. due to a user request or in support of an autonomous UE function like driving assistance for V2X) or may be received by the UE from the network (e.g. an LMF) or from an external client.\n-\tOperation performed by SPRF:\n-\tPerforming control signaling between 2 UEs or among a group of 2 of more UEs to manage and coordinate the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operations. The messages generated by SPRF are sent as data traffic over the PC5 reference point and does not require additional enhancements to PC5 reference point.\n-\tIf the network supports Sidelink Positioning and Ranging, SPRF exchange may happen between UE and the LMF (e.g. using NAS signaling), similar to that defined in TS 23.273 [11].\n-\tService Exposure Function:\n-\tThis function allows the UE to interact with the application layer, or the AF and external client.\n-\tIf the network supports the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging, the interactions may happen between the UE and the LMF as defined in TS 23.273 [11].\n-\tThe exact operation of service exposure to an external client or AF is out of scope of SA WG2.\nIn order to support the operation over different PC5 RATs, each of the SR5 service elements is assigned a V2X Service Type (e.g. PSID, ITS-AID, or AID as of TS 23.287 [3]) and a ProSe Identifier (e.g. Application ID as of TS 23.304 [4]). For example:\n-\tDevice and Service Discovery Function (DSDF) is assigned PSID_ DSDF, and ProSe_AppID_DSDF;\n-\tGroup Support Service Function (GSSF) is assigned PSID_GSSF, and ProSe_AppID_GSSF;\n-\tSidelink Positioning and Ranging Function (SPRF) is assigned PSID_SPRF, and ProSe_AppID_SPRF.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is also possible that all the three services are sharing the same V2X Service Type and ProSe Identifier.\nSome lower layer functions might be combined to improve efficiency of operation. For example, the GSSF and SPRF might be combined to improve efficiency and reduce complexity in creating both a group of UEs (GSSF service) and a sidelink positioning/ranging session between the UEs in the group (SPRF service).\nFor a V2X capable UE (as defined in TS 23.287 [3]), it would be configured with the corresponding information in the V2XP for the service types. The following element would be included in the Policy/Parameters for V2X communications over PC5 reference point, as in clause 5.1.2.1 of TS 23.287 [3]:\n3)\tPolicy/parameters for PC5 RAT selection and for PC5 Tx Profile selection:\n-\tthe mapping of PSID_DSDF/PSID_GSSF/PSID_SPRF to PC5 RAT(s) (e.g. LTE PC5, NR PC5 or both), and:\n-\tfor LTE PC5, to the corresponding Tx Profiles (see TS 36.300 [19] for further information);\n-\tfor NR PC5, to the corresponding NR Tx Profiles for broadcast and groupcast (see TS 38.300 [8] and TS 38.331 [20] for further information).\nThe other configuration parameters in clause 5.1.2.1 of TS 23.287 [3] may also apply accordingly. For example, when NR PC5 RAT is selected, the configuration may further determine the support of cast types, e.g.:\n6)\tPolicy/parameters when NR PC5 is selected:\n-\tThe mapping of PSID_DSDF/PSID_GSSF/PSID_SPRF to the default mode of communication (i.e. broadcast mode, groupcast mode or unicast mode).\nIn order to carry the SR5 signaling, the non-IP PDCP SDU type is utilized AS layers over the user plane PC5 reference point (as shown in clause 6.1.1 of TS 23.287 [3]).\n\nLegend:\n-\tPC5-U: The SDAP/PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY functionality is specified in TS 38.300 [8].\n-\tFor PDCP SDU type \"Non-IP\", a \"Non-IP Type\" header included in the SDU by upper layer to indicate the type of non-IP messages carried will be specified in stage 3 specification.\n\nFigure 6.19.2.2-1: User Plane Lower Protocol Layers for NR PC5 reference point\nIn this approach, the SR5 signaling is handled as V2X Application (with PSID_DSDF/PSID_GSSF/PSID_SPRF). The non-IP PDCP SDU type is supported by both LTE PC5 and NR PC5. Therefore, regardless of the RAT selected based on policy 3) above, the transport can be supported.\nThe Non-IP PDCP SDU contains a Non-IP Type header, which indicates the V2X message family used by the application layer. The non-IP Type header and allowed value is defined TS 24.587 [17]. To support the signalling for SR5, a new non-IP Type header value can be added, e.g. \"SR5\".\nNOTE:\tAlternatively, each of the three SR5 services, e.g. DSDF, GSSF, SPRF, can have its own non-IP Type header value.\nWith the use of non-IP PDCP SDU type, there is no need to change the AS layer for carrying the SR5 signaling.\nWhen NR PC5 is selected, broadcast, groupcast, or unicast mode can be also supported without change of AS layer.\nFor a 5G ProSe capable UE, configuration regarding the SR5 signaling is configured using ProSeP, as defined in clause 5.1.3.1 of TS 23.304 [4]. For example, the policy could include the mapping of the corresponding ProSe Identifier for the SR5 services to the cast mode and the Layer-2 ID to use:\n5)\tPolicy/parameters when NR PC5 is selected:\n-\tThe mapping of ProSe services (e.g. ProSe_AppID_DSDF/ ProSe_AppID_GSSF/ ProSe_AppID_SPRF) to radio frequencies with Geographical Area(s).\n-\tThe mapping of ProSe services (e.g. ProSe_AppID_DSDF/ ProSe_AppID_GSSF/ ProSe_AppID_SPRF) to Destination Layer-2 ID(s) for broadcast.\n-\tThe mapping of ProSe services (e.g. ProSe_AppID_DSDF/ ProSe_AppID_GSSF/ ProSe_AppID_SPRF) to Destination Layer-2 ID(s) for groupcast.\n-\tThe mapping of ProSe services (e.g. ProSe_AppID_DSDF/ ProSe_AppID_GSSF/ ProSe_AppID_SPRF) to default Destination Layer-2 ID(s) for initial signalling to establish unicast connection.\nTo carry the SR5 signaling messages over the PC5-U reference point as defined in clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.304 [4], there are two options:\n-\tUse the same non-IP PDCP SDU type as in the case of V2X UEs. Although 5G ProSe does not use the non-IP PDCP SDU type, the AS layer of 5G ProSe is shared with NR based V2X defined in TS 38.300 [8]. Therefore, the non-IP PDCP SDU type is supported without any AS layer impact.\n-\tUse the \"unstructured\" PDCP SDU type. This is supported by 5G ProSe UEs, and the separation of the DSDF, GSSF, SPRF signaling can be achieved with Destination L2 IDs as configured in ProSeP item 5) above.\n",

Such configuration will also determine the communication modes to use, e.g. broadcast, groupcast, or unicast.\nIf it is determined that more than two UEs need to participate in the operation, the GMSF service is invoked to form the group or determine the group members' presence and status for the operation.\nSPRF signaling is used for the control signaling between the UEs to determine the corresponding Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operation, e.g. the channel to use for the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging reference signal, the sequence and time slot for each of the UE to perform the signal transmission and measurements.\nThe UEs, e.g. UE A and UE B, or in other cases a group of UEs, carry out the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging reference signal transmission and measurements.\nBased on the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging services negotiated by the SPRF signaling in the earlier phase, the UEs uses the SPRF signaling to exchange the measurement results. This enables the UEs to perform the calculation of the range/direction, or relative locations.\nDepending on the SPRF signaling support, some UEs may also provide a location computation service to other UEs.\nFigure 6.19.3.1-1 shows an example of a UE-only operation for sidelink positioning/ranging procedure with a group of n UEs labelled 1 to n, where n ≥ 2. In this example, the n UEs may all have network coverage, may have partial network coverage or may all be out of coverage.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for sidelink positioning and ranging for UE-only operation, illustrating the steps involved in positioning and ranging for a single user device.\nFigure 6.19.3.1-1: Procedure for Sidelink Positioning/Ranging for UE-only operation\n1.\tUEs 1 to n discover one another. The discovery may or may not be network assisted and may use the DSDF in each UE.\n2. A sidelink positioning/ranging session may be established between the UEs 1 to n. This may be supported by the GSSF and/or SPRF. This signalling exchange happens over PC5 reference point.\n3.\tUEs 1 to n exchange sidelink positioning/ranging capabilities – e.g. using SPRF signalling over PC5.\n4.\tTransmission and measurement of Sidelink Reference Signals is configured in UEs 1 to n – e.g. by one coordinating UE or in a distributed manner.\n5.\tTransmission and measurement of Sidelink Reference Signals are performed by each of UEs 1 to n according to the configurations at step 4.\n6.\tUEs 1 to n exchange the sidelink measurements obtained at step 5 - e.g. using SPRF signalling.\n7.\tUEs 1 to n calculate sidelink positioning/ranging location results from the sidelink measurements obtained at steps 5 and 6. The sidelink positioning/ranging location results may include absolute locations, relative locations and/or ranges for the UEs 1 to n. The calculation may be distributed over all UEs 1 to n or may be centralized in one UE or in a few UEs.\n8.\tUEs 1 to n may exchange the sidelink positioning/ranging location results obtained at step 7 - e.g. using SPRF signalling. Steps 5-8 or steps 4-8 may be repeated.\nSidelink positioning/ranging of a group of 2 or more UEs that are in network coverage or partial network coverage may be instigated by the UEs themselves and assisted by an LMF using the 5GC-MO-LR procedure in clause 6.2 of TS 23.273 [11] with some enhancements. A reason to reuse and enhance the existing MO-LR procedure is to reduce new impacts to UEs, 5GCN and LCS Client and AF. Figure 6.19.3.2-1 shows the enhanced MO-LR procedure applied to n UEs labelled 1 to n, where n ≥ 2. The procedure is invoked by one UE, assumed to be UE1 in Figure 6.19.3.2-1. At least one of the UEs (UE1 in this example) must be in network coverage though other UEs may or may not be in coverage.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for sidelink positioning and ranging with LMF assistance, which is a method used in 5G networks to improve signal quality by using multiple frequency bands. The figure shows the steps involved in the procedure, including the use of a reference signal, the positioning and ranging process, and the assistance from the LMF system.\nFigure 6.19.3.2-1: MO-LR Procedure for Sidelink Positioning/Ranging with LMF Assistance\n1.\tUE1 discovers UEs 2 to n. The discovery may or may not be network assisted and may be supported by the DSDF in each UE.\n2.\tUE1 obtains the sidelink positioning capabilities of UEs 2 to n – e.g. using SPRF.\n3.\tIf UE1 determines that assistance data from LMF is needed and/or location calculation assistance from the LMF is needed and/or whether the sidelink positioning/ranging location results should be transferred to an LCS Client or AF, it sends a supplementary services MO-LR request to the serving AMF as in steps 1 and 2 of clause 6.2 of TS 23.273 [11]. The MO-LR request includes a request for sidelink positioning/ranging and indicates the other UEs 2 to n. The MO-LR Request indicates the request to LMF, e.g. assistance data, location calculation assistance, results transfer to LCS client or AF.  For transfer to an LCS Client or AF, details of the LCS Client or AF (and possibly of a GMLC) and global identities for all UEs are also included. For location calculation assistance from the LMF, the preferred type of sidelink positioning/ranging location results (e.g. absolute locations, relative locations or ranges between pairs of UEs) are included and QoS.\n4.\tThe serving AMF selects an LMF (e.g. an LMF that supports sidelink positioning/ranging) and sends an Nlmf_Location_DetermineLocation service operation towards the LMF with the information from the MO-LR Request.\n5.\tThe LMF sends a request (e.g. an SPRF request) to UE1 for the capabilities of all UEs 1 to n.\n6.\tUE1 returns its capabilities and the capabilities for UEs 2 to n obtained at step 2 to the LMF. This could instead occur as part of step 3 - e.g. if an SPRF message carrying the capabilities is embedded in the MO-LR Request. The capabilities may include the RATs and frequencies supported by each of the UEs 1 to n for sidelink positioning/ranging.\n7.\tIf UE1 indicates assistance data is needed at step 3, UE1 sends a request for specific assistance data to the LMF. As with step 6, this step could also occur as part of step 3 - e.g. if an SPRF message indicating the requested assistance data is embedded in the MO-LR Request\n8.\tIf step 7 occurs, the LMF returns the requested assistance data to UE1. The assistance data may assist UEs 1 to n to obtain sidelink location measurements and/or may assist UE1 to calculate sidelink positioning/ranging location results.\n9.\tIf the MO-LR request at step 3 indicated location calculation assistance is needed and/or indicated transfer of sidelink positioning/ranging location results to an LCS Client or AF, the LMF sends a request for location information to UE1.\n10.\tUE1 instigates a sidelink positioning/ranging procedure among UEs 1 to n, e.g. as in steps 2-6 of Figure 6.19.3.1-1. This step can be supported using any assistance data received at step 8. As part of this step, the UEs 1 to n obtain sidelink location measurements of sidelink signals transmitted by other UEs.\n11.\tIf UE1 did not request location calculation assistance from the LMF at step 3, UE1 calculates sidelink positioning/ranging location results for itself and possibly for each of the other UEs 2 to n based on the sidelink location measurements obtained at step 10 and possibly using any assistance data received at step 8, The sidelink positioning/ranging location results can include absolute locations, relative locations or ranges between pairs of the UEs 1 to n. Some or all of the location calculation might be performed by some or all of the UEs 2 to n with the location results then transferred to UE1.\n12.\tIf UE1 received a request for location information at step 9, UE1 sends a response to the LMF and includes either the sidelink location measurements obtained at step 10 or the sidelink positioning/ranging location results obtained at step 11 if step 11 occurred.\n13.\tIf step 12 occurred and if location calculation assistance from the LMF was requested at step 3, the LMF calculates sidelink positioning/ranging location results for UEs 1 to n from the sidelink location measurements received at step 12. The sidelink positioning/ranging location results can include absolute locations, relative locations or ranges between pairs of the UEs 1 to n.\n14.\tThe LMF returns an Nlmf_Location_DetermineLocation service operation response to the AMF and includes any sidelink positioning/ranging location results received at step 12 or calculated at step 13.\n15.\tIf sidelink positioning/ranging location results were received at step 14, the AMF performs steps 7-12 of clause 6.2 of TS 23.273 [11] to send the sidelink positioning/ranging location results to the GMLC and to an AF or LCS Client if this was requested at step 3. The sidelink positioning/ranging location results include the global identities for UEs 2 to n received at step 3 (and the global identity of UE1).\nNOTE:\tSending location results and global identities for UEs 2 to n to an AF or LCS Client may require privacy verification from UEs 2 to n and/or from the HPLMNs of UEs 2 to n (as well as privacy verification for UE1).\n16.\tThe LMF returns a supplementary services MO-LR response to UE1 and includes any sidelink positioning/ranging location results calculated at step 13 if step 13 was performed. UE1 may then transfer any sidelink positioning/ranging location results to UEs 2 to n.\nSidelink positioning/ranging location results for a group of 2 or more UEs that are in network coverage or partial network coverage may be requested by an LCS Client or AF and assisted by an LMF using the 5GC-MT-LR procedure in clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [11] with some enhancements. A reason to reuse and enhance the existing MT-LR procedure is to reduce new impacts to UEs, 5GCN and LCS Client and AF. Figure 6.19.3.3-1 shows the enhanced MT-LR procedure applied to n UEs 1 to n where n ≥ 2. Typically this requires the LCS Client or AF to be aware that UEs 1 to n are or may be nearby to one another. This may be possible in some IIoT scenarios (e.g. factory or warehouse) or when the AF or LCS Client has other information indicating this. At least one the UEs (UE1 in this example) must be in network coverage though other UEs may or may not be in coverage.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for sidelink positioning and ranging with LMF assistance, illustrating the steps involved in positioning and ranging a satellite using a low-power frequency (LMF) signal. The figure includes a schematic representation of the satellite's structure, including the satellite dish, antenna, and the satellite itself. The figure also shows the satellite's position relative to the ground, and the LMF signal's path through the satellite. The figure is used to demonstrate the process of positioning and ranging a satellite using a low-power frequency (LMF) signal, which is a method of positioning and ranging satellites that uses a low-power signal to estimate the satellite's position and velocity.\nFigure 6.19.3.3-1: MT-LR Procedure for Sidelink Positioning/Ranging with LMF Assistance\n1.\tAn LCS Client or AF initiates an MT-LR procedure as in steps 1-11 of clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [11]. The LCS Client or AF includes global identities of the n UEs 1 to n and may indicate one UE (assumed to be UE1 here) as the principal target UE. If the LCS Client or AF does not indicate a principal target UE that is in network coverage, the GMLC or AMF selects a principal target UE from among UEs 1 to n. The principal target UE must have network coverage and preferably with the PLMN that is serving the LCS Client or AF. The principal target UE later receives the MT-LR request and coordinates sidelink positioning/ranging among the other UEs. Therefore, in step 5 of clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [11], the location request is sent to the serving AMF of the principal target UE. The MT-LR location request at step 1 of clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [11] includes the type of sidelink positioning/ranging location results needed (absolute locations, relative locations or ranges between pairs of UEs), QoS and includes conditions for cancelling the location request when not all UEs 1 to n can be discovered for positioning. The conditions for cancelling the location request may include:\n-\tOne or more specific identified UEs cannot be discovered; and/or\n-\tThe total number of UEs 1-n that are discovered is less than a quorum q, where 1 ≤ q ≤ n.\nNOTE 1:\tPrivacy verification may need to be performed for all n UEs 1 to n. If all n UEs have the same HPLMN, this can be performed by the H-GMLC at step 2 of clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [11]. If all n UEs are in network coverage and have the same serving AMF, privacy notification/verification for each of the UEs 1 to n (if  needed) can be performed by the common serving AMF at steps 7 and 8 in clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.273 [11]. If some of the UEs 1 to n have a different HPLMN, are not in network coverage or have a different serving AMF, some additional support not defined here may be needed.\n2.\tThe LMF sends a supplementary services MT-LR request to the principal target UE1 and includes the global identities of the other UEs 2 to n, the conditions for cancelling the location request when not all UEs 1 to n can be discovered and may include the types of sidelink positioning/ranging location result needed.\n3.\tUE1 attempts to discover the other UEs 2 to n if not already discovered. If not all UEs 2 to n are discovered and if the conditions for cancelling the location request when not all UEs 1 to n can be discovered are met, UE1 returns a negative response at step 5 and the procedure terminates after the LMF returns the negative response to the LCS Client or AF via the AMF and GMLC.\n4.\tUE1 obtains (e.g. requests and receives) the sidelink positioning capabilities of UEs 2 to n if not already obtained.\n5.\tUE1 returns a supplementary services MT-LR response to the LMF indicating if the MT-LR request can be supported and which of UEs 2 to n have been discovered and are available for positioning.\n6.\tSidelink positioning/ranging of the UEs 1 to n occurs as for an MO-LR as described for steps 5-13 of Figure 6.19.3.2-1 with the difference that sidelink positioning/ranging location results are always obtained and the LMF indicates to UE1 at step 8 or step 9 of Figure 6.19.3.2-1 whether the sidelink positioning/ranging location results will be calculated by the LMF or by UE1 (and/or by other UEs).\n7.\tThe LMF returns the sidelink positioning/ranging location results for UEs 1 to n to the LCS Client or AF as in steps 13-24 of clause 6.1.2 in TS 23.273 [11].\nNOTE 2:\tThe additional privacy check at steps 16-23 of clause 6.1.2 in TS 23.273 [11] is possible if all UEs 1 to n have the same HPLMN and same serving AMF but could otherwise require some extension of the procedure in clause 6.1.2 in TS 23.273 [11].\nSidelink positioning/ranging results for a group of 2 or more UEs that are in network coverage or partial network coverage may be requested periodically or when certain trigger events occur by an LCS Client or AF and may be assisted by an LMF using the periodic or triggered 5GC-MT-LR procedure in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11] with some enhancements. A reason to reuse and enhance the existing periodic or triggered MT-LR procedure is to reduce new impacts to UEs, 5GCN and LCS Client and AF. Figure 6.19.3.4-1 shows the enhanced periodic or triggered MT-LR procedure applied to n UEs 1 to n where n ≥ 2. Typically this requires the LCS Client or AF to be aware that UEs 1 to n are or may be nearby to one another over the whole duration of location reporting. This may be possible in some IIoT scenarios (e.g. factory or warehouse) or when the AF or LCS Client has other information indicating this. At least one the UEs (UE1 in this example) must be in network coverage though other UEs may or may not be in coverage.\nThe figure depicts a periodic or triggered MT-LR procedure for sidelink positioning and ranging with LMF assistance. It illustrates the steps involved in the procedure, including the use of a reference marker (RM) and the positioning and ranging of the reference marker (RM) with the help of the Local Motion Filter (LMF). The figure also shows the positioning and ranging of the reference marker (RM) with the help of the Local Motion Filter (LMF).\nFigure 6.19.3.4-1: Periodic or Triggered MT-LR Procedure for Sidelink Positioning/Ranging with LMF Assistance\n1.\tAn LCS Client or AF initiates a periodic or triggered MT-LR procedure as in steps 1-14 of clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11]. The LCS Client or AF includes additional information in the location request for step 1 in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11] as described for step 1 of Figure 6.19.3.3-1. A principal target UE (UE1 here) is also selected as described for step 1 of Figure 6.19.3.3-1. For triggered location reporting, different trigger events may be supported than for clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11]. Some examples of different trigger types are as follows:\n-\tarea event trigger where any one UE (or all UEs) enters an area, remains in an area or leaves an area;\n-\tmotion event trigger where any one UE (or all UEs) moves by more than a threshold distance from a previous position; and\n-\trange trigger where a particular type of range rises above a threshold, falls below a threshold and/or increases or decreases by more than a threshold amount. The particular type of range could be any of the following:\n-\tthe maximum range of all ranges between all pairs of the UEs 1 to n.\n-\tthe minimum range of all ranges between all pairs of the UEs 1 to n.\n-\tthe minimum range between any UE and each of the other n-1 UEs (there are n minimum ranges corresponding to the n UEs and the trigger occurs when any of the n minimum ranges crosses a threshold)\n-\tthe maximum range between any UE and each of the other n-1 UEs (there are n maximum ranges corresponding to the n UEs and the trigger occurs when any of the n maximum ranges crosses a threshold)\nNOTE:\tPrivacy verification may be supported as described for NOTE 1 in clause 6.19.3.3.\n2.\tThe LMF instigates MT-LR sidelink positioning/ranging of the UEs 1 to n as in steps 2-6 of Figure 6.19.3.3-1. The LMF may verify whether the conditions are met for cancelling the location request when not all UEs 1 to n are discovered (in which case the location request is cancelled by the LMF) and may obtain the capabilities of the UEs 1 to n but may not always obtain immediate sidelink positioning/ranging location results.\n3.\tThe LMF sends a supplementary services LCS Periodic-Triggered Invoke Request to UE1 as in step 16 for clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11] and includes the event trigger(s) provided in step 1 and indicates sidelink positioning/ranging of the UEs 1 to n.\n4.\tUE1 may establish a periodic or triggered sidelink positioning session with UEs 2 to n (e.g. using GSSF and/or SPRF) which can enable UEs 2 to n to participate in detecting trigger events for step 7 (e.g. events which affect some or all of UEs 2 to n) and speed up sidelink positioning/ranging at step 8 by configuring UEs 2 to n in advance.\n5.\tUE1 returns an LCS Periodic-Triggered Invoke Response to the LMF as in step 17 for clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11] and may indicate which of UEs 2 to n can support the periodic or triggered sidelink positioning/ranging.\n6.\tThe LMF sends a confirmation of whether periodic or triggered sidelink positioning/ranging was successfully activated in UE1 (and UEs 2 to n) to the LCS Client or AF using steps 18-21 in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11].\n7.\tUE1 waits for an event to be detected, may then obtain sidelink positioning/ranging measurements and possibly calculate sidelink positioning/ranging location results, sends a supplementary services event report to the LMF and receives back an event report acknowledgement as for steps 22-26 for clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11]. Differences here are that detection of an event by UE1 may depend on detecting an event related to one or more of UEs 1 to n and that any sidelink positioning/ranging measurement and calculation of location results may require interaction between UEs 1 to n (e.g. using SPRF).\n8.\tIf sidelink positioning/ranging location results for UEs 1 to n are needed and were not provided to the LMF as part of step 7, the LMF performs sidelink positioning/ranging of UEs 1 to n as in steps 5-13 of Figure 6.19.3.2-1.\n9.\tThe LMF sends an event report to the LCS Client or AF as in steps 28-30 in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.273 [11] and includes any sidelink positioning/ranging location results obtained at step 7 or step 8. If sidelink positioning/ranging location results are provided for only some of UEs 1 to n (e.g. in several successive event reports), the GMLC or LCS Client or AF may cancel the periodic or triggered sidelink positioning/ranging as in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.273 [11] with some additional steps to propagate the cancellation to the other UEs 2 to n.\n10.\tSteps 7-9 are repeated until the periodic or triggered sidelink positioning/ranging is cancelled or has attained a maximum duration or maximum number of event reports.\n",

With SL positioning and Ranging aiming at enabling UE-only Operation without necessarily having any network involvement, the current architecture is not sufficient.\nTo perform a Ranging/SL Positioning procedure, the following functionalities have to be supported\n-\tPRS measurement\n- \tCo-ordination and scheduling of resources required for Ranging/SL Positioning\n- \tDetermine type and number of Ranging/SL Position methods-\tResult calculation\nSome of the above functionalities are mandatory for Target UE and SL Reference UE. However, the Target UE and SL Reference UE in a Ranging/SL Positioning session is not assumed to be capable of supporting all those functionalities. In that case, a SL Positioning Server UE needs to be involved for UE-Only Operation, who can provide the required functionalities missing from Target UE and SL Reference UE in a Ranging/SL Positioning session. The Target UE or the SL Reference UE selects a SL Positioning Server UE after capability exchange.\nThis solution therefore proposes that\n-\tthe functionality offered towards the UE by a Location Server can also reside in a UE able to host such functionality as not all UEs supporting SL positioning may be able to position themselves; and\n-\ta Positioning Protocol be defined that can operate;\n-\tbetween a Target UE and a SL Positioning Server UE (if a Target UE needs assistance from a SL Positioning Server UE);\n-\tbetween a SL Positioning Server UE and a Reference UE, so the SL Positioning Server UE can gain additional reference information to help position a Target UE (similar to a Location Server NF getting information from base stations);\n-\tbetween a Target UE and a Reference UE, at least for the case when a Target UE need not rely on a SL Positioning Server UE to position itself.\nIt is also important to consider that SL Positioning or Ranging can operate with a Location Server Platform/NF. Synergies must therefore be sought between UE-only Operation and Network-Assisted operation in terms of the related Positioning Protocol.\n",

The diagram illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, highlighting the multi-path signal path and beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The fiber-optic backbone architecture is shown, with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. Redundancy paths are depicted in dashed lines, ensuring failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 6.29.2-1\nIn these scenarios, if the direct ranging/sidelink positioning between the target UE and the reference UE cannot be supported, or if the ranging/sidelink positioning is not sufficiently accurate, the assistance of another UE (e.g. assistant UE, deployed as RSU) is needed, and direct communication between the assistant UE and the target UE/reference UE should be supported. During the periodic ranging operation with assisted UE, when the distance between the assistant UE and the target UE and/or the distance between the assistant UE and the reference UE increases to an extent that the assistant UE cannot continue the assistance, the ranging service operation might go through a disruption. This solution is proposed to solve the problem of maintaining service continuity of periodic ranging with assistant UE.\nDuring each cycle of the periodic ranging process, after obtaining the ranging measurements, UE1 immediately performs a ranging service check according to all the measurement data collected so far to determine whether the current assistant UE can continue the assistance in the next cycle, and if not, UE1 would restart the device discovery procedure to find another assistant UE.

                            "text_content": "Involving multiple Reference UEs can improve the position accuracy and is sometimes essential to be able to calculate a position through triangulation/tilateration, e.g. if the Target UE is out of coverage.\nThe following deployment scenarios are being considered:\n-\tMultiple Reference UEs are part of a \"fixed\" installation, for example to cover a e.g. room, building or factory floor.\n-\tMultiple Reference UEs are close to a Target UE, but not necessarily have a fixed position or role.\nAn example of how this could look like is illustrated below. The Target UE is able to perform ranging with both Reference UE 1 and Reference UE 2. The results can be combined to estimate the Target UE's position in a relative coordinate system or possibly geographical coordinate system (if the geographical positions of the Reference UEs are known). By collecting the ranging measurements/results from the various UEs involved,  the sidelink position can be calculated more accurately than when only a single Reference UE would be used. Not only because the ranging measurements with multiple Reference UEs can be used in the calculation, but also e.g. if a Target UE can discover one reference UE of a \"fixed\" installation, but is not able to discover another reference UE that is part of the same installation, it tells something about the Target UE's location, since certain areas can be excluded from the location calculation. Also Reference UEs may be instructed to perform ranging between themselves to further improve the accuracy, in particular in case their position is not always fixed.\nThese multiple Reference UEs may form some kind of \"constellation\" similar to a satellite constellation for GNSS.\nThe figure depicts a fixed installation of Reference UEs in a room or factory floor, illustrating the placement of these devices in a typical indoor environment. The illustration shows the UEs in a row, with each UE having a distinct color and a label indicating its type (e.g., \"Reference UEs\"). The layout is designed to ensure that the UEs are easily identifiable and can be monitored or controlled by the network operator. The figure also includes a label indicating the room or factory floor, which helps in locating the installation and ensuring that the UEs are within the intended range.\nFigure 6.32.1-1: Illustration of a fixed installation of Reference UEs in a room or factory floor\nIn this solution, the above scenarios are considered for in-coverage, partial-coverage and out-of-coverage situations, whereby the LMF (or a subset implemented by a reference UE/SL Positioning Server UE) is considered to have the central coordinating role of the sidelink positioning involving multiple Reference UEs and is also responsible for determining the position of the Target UE. The case of a Target UE performing UE-based positioning and coordinating individual ranging sessions with multiple reference UEs is not described as part of this solution.\nIn this solution the term Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Protocol (RSPP) is used as defined in solution #26.\nBelow each of the coverage situations is described in more detail:\n-\tIn-coverage: Both the Target UE and Reference UEs can connect to an LMF to coordinate and configure the ranging between the Target UE and the Reference UEs. The LMF may keep track of Reference UEs and in particular Located UEs in a certain area to be able to determine a group of Reference UEs that could serve a Target UE, or be provisioned by an external application e.g. through NEF with information about a \"constellation\" of Reference UEs in a certain area and their locations. If the location of the Reference UEs is not yet known, the LMF may initiate a location request with those Reference UEs.\nIf the position of the Target UE needs to be determined, the Target UE may send a location request to the LMF or vice-versa. After this, the Target UE initiates a ranging discovery procedure as described in the various solutions for KI#3, and initiate a ranging session with a discovered Reference UE by transmitting a Direct Connection Request. The Target UE or Reference UE can report information about the ranging session (such as session identifier, and identifiers of the Target UE and Reference UE) to the LMF. Based on the information about ranging constellations or other Reference UEs in the area, the LMF can invite other Reference UEs to join the ranging session (with the indicated identifier) or ask the Target UE or a Reference UE to do so, and in this way coordinate the joint ranging of a Target UE for improved location estimation.\nIn the figure below, the Target UE discovers and initiates a ranging session with Reference UE 1, after which Reference UE 2 is also invited to join the same ranging session.\nThe figure depicts a high-level overview of the in-coverage scenario in a 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP 32x16x1 3GPP\nFigure 6.32.1-2: High-level overview of in-coverage scenario\nOnce the ranging session with multiple Reference UEs is properly set up, the UEs involved can perform ranging to measure/calculate distances and/or angles between them, and report these to the LMF to estimate the location of the Target UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe details of these procedures will be defined by RAN WGs.\n-\tPartial coverage: In this situation, the Target UE is out-of-coverage, but at least one of the Reference UEs is in coverage and can connect to the LMF. In this situation, the Reference UEs can operate in a very similar way as the in-coverage case. The Target UE can initiate a ranging discovery procedure similarly as for the in-coverage case. The only difference is that the Target UE cannot contact the LMF directly to initiate a location request, receive configuration information or send its measurements. Instead, one or more the Reference UEs that are connected with LMF have to do this on behalf of the LMF. To this end, the Reference UE may act as a SL Positioning Server UE by implementing part of the LMF's functionality, or may perform forwarding of messages between the Target UE and the LMF, or a combination thereof.\nIn the figure below, the Target UE is out of coverage, and Reference UE 2 as well. Reference UE 1 will perform the communication with the LMF on behalf of the Target UE and Reference UE 2.\nThe figure depicts a high-level overview of a partial coverage scenario in a 32-1-3 network, illustrating the various elements and their interactions. The network consists of a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, with key components such as the fiber-optic backbone, core switches, and distributed nodes. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure 6.32.1-3: High-level overview of partial coverage scenario\n-\tOut-of-coverage: In this situation, the Target UE as well as the Reference UEs are out of coverage. To not deviate too much from the previous situations, a solution is for one or more of the Reference UEs to act as a SL Positioning Server UE by implementing a subset of the LMF's functionality and support the same protocols (e.g. Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Protocol (RSPP) as in Solutions #26). Such Reference UE would need to be provisioned beforehand with the necessary policies and information by the LMF (of PCF) once it was still in coverage. This may include e.g. information about other Reference UEs in the area and their position, or ranging \"constellation\" information. It may also include information about position methods and procedures supported by the PLMN, accuracy settings, etc. The solutions for KI#1 can be extended to support the provisioning of such additional policies and information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe details of the authorization aspects and procedures for such out-of-coverage deployment need to be studied by SA WG3.\nA Reference UE that implements part of the LMF's functionality, i.e. a SL Positioning Server UE, may also by itself gather the necessary information about nearby Reference UEs or ranging \"constellations\" by performing ranging discovery, exchange capabilities and location information or perform ranging with such nearby Reference UEs. This information can then be used to invite other Reference UEs to join a ranging session for sidelink positioning of a Target UE. It may also configure the Target UE and other Reference UEs to transmit the ranging measurements to this Reference UE, so that it can calculate the position of the Target UE based on it. For the Target UE, the ranging discovery and session setup are similar to the ranging discovery and session setup for the partial coverage case. Note that this deployment can in principle also be used for partial coverage situations.\nIn the figure below, the Target UE, Reference UE 1 and Reference UE 2 are all out of coverage. Reference UE 1 implements a subset of the LMF's functionality.\nThe figure depicts a high-level overview of an out-of-coverage scenario in a 5G network. It illustrates the various components involved, such as base stations (BSs), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, as well as the signal propagation paths. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of optical fiber-optic backbone for redundancy and failover.\nFigure 6.32.1-4: High-level overview of out-of-coverage scenario\nNote that the role of being a Reference UE and in particular Located UE may not always stay the same. This depends on several factors, such as whether or not the UE has a position fix and whether or not its position is stable. For example, even if a UE includes a GNSS module in order to get a position fix, it may be out of coverage of the GNSS satellite network (e.g. driving into a tunnel or if it is deployed indoors), and hence may not be able to be a Located UE or Reference UE. Similarly if the UE is out-of-coverage of the NG-RAN it may not be able to be a Located UE or Reference UE because it cannot connect to the LMF. Also, the position of a UE may be too unstable to be used as Located UE or Reference UE (e.g. UE is moving too fast or shaking too much). If the role changes, the LMF and other UEs (e.g. Target UE, Reference UEs) involved in ranging need to be notified of such change.\nNOTE 3:\tHow the possible roles (e.g. Reference UE, Located UE) are determined and the criteria for this are out-of-scope for SA WG2 and would need to be studied by RAN WGs.\n",

In these procedures, it is assumed that the Target UE and all involved Reference UEs are served by the same PLMN.\nCase 1: Target UE and all Reference UEs are in coverage\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for involving multiple Reference UEs in a ranging session for an in-coverage situation. It illustrates the steps taken to establish a range, including the use of a reference signal, the selection of reference UEs, and the establishment of a range. The figure also includes a diagram of the setup, with the reference signal, reference UEs, and the range setting.\nFigure 6.32.2-1: High-level procedure for involving multiple Reference UEs to a ranging session for in-coverage situation\n1.\tThe LMF may receive information about ranging \"constellations\" in an area from the GMLC, which may have received this information from an AF (via NEF), LCS client or another PLMN (see description of Figure 6.32.2-2 for more details)\n2.\tThe LMF collects data about potential Reference UEs/Located UEs in an area (possibly based on the ranging \"constellation\" information from the AF), including receiving data about the capabilities and location information for these potential Reference UEs/Located UEs, and maintains this information in a storage unit/database. This may also include keeping track of potential role changes, e.g. if a UE is not able to be a Reference UE/Located UE anymore (e.g. because it lost its position fix). To this end, the GMLC may issue a Periodic MT-LR for the respective Reference UEs/Located UEs. The location information of the Reference UEs/Located UEs will also be updated every time the Reference UE/Located UE issues a MO-LR.\n3.\tThe Target UE (3a) or the GMLC (3b)transmit a Location Request to trigger the initiation of the ranging/sidelink positioning procedures for the Target UE. The AMF then selects (3c) an LMF that supports ranging/sidelink positioning procedures. Preferably, the LMFs are deployed to serve a particular area, so that the LMF selection can be based on area information of the Target UE, such as TAI or Cell-Id.\n4.\n6.\tBased on area information, such as TAI or Cell-Id of the Target UE provided by the AMF to the LMF, the LMF determines one or more Reference UEs to get involved in the ranging session, e.g. based on the information about ranging constellations or Reference UEs in the area (that have a stable position).\nNOTE 1:\tIn case in steps 2 and 3b different LMFs have been selected for the Target UE and one or more Reference UEs, if an LMF discovers that it does not have UE context information for each of these UEs, then it may use the NL7 reference point (as specified in TS 23.273 [11] and which may need to be extended for this purpose) to request other LMFs to perform a UE context transfer of the \"missing\" UE context information to this LMF (or vice versa), for example using steps 5-10 of the LMF Change Procedure in clause 6.4 of TS 23.273 [11]. If none of the LMFs have UE context information available for the \"missing UE\", then the LMF may issue a request to the AMF to assign the \"missing\" UE to the same LMF. If the AMF does not yet serve the \"missing UE\", it may verify if another AMF is serving that UE, and if not, issue a network triggered service request to that UE. Otherwise, it may align with the serving AMF of that \"missing\" UE to select the same LMF.\n5.\tThe LMF configures the Target UE and the Reference UEs, in this case Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2 to enable both Reference UE#1 and UE#2 to join the ranging session with the Target UE. The configuration information may include a session identifier for the joint ranging session. Such message could be an extension to the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Protocol (RSPP). The LMF may also configure the respective UEs with other relevant information to enable ranging (if this has not been done beforehand) in this step.\n6.\tThe Target UE and Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2 can perform ranging discovery (if not done yet) and setup a ranging connection with each other, using the session identifier for the joint ranging session as input, and initiate ranging.\n7.\tOptionally, the Reference UEs (in this case Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2) will also perform ranging discovery and setup a ranging connection with each other.\n8.\tIn this step, the Target UE will perform ranging with all Reference UEs involved in the ranging session (in this case both with Reference UE#1 and with Reference UE#2) to determine a distance/angle between the respective UEs. Optionally the Reference UEs are configured by the LMF to perform ranging amongst each other for additional accuracy (in this case Reference UE#1 may perform ranging with Reference UE#2).\n9.\tAll UEs involved in the joint ranging session, in this case the Target UE and Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2 report their ranging measurements/results to the LMF.\n10.\tThe LMF calculates the location of Target UE based on the received ranging measurements/results from all UEs involved in the joint ranging session. The LMF may report the estimated location to the Target UE or AF.\nAdditional details on how the LMF receives or determines information about ranging \"constellations\":\nLMF (Local Multiplexer Function) in the 6.32.2-2 constellation receives ranging information from an external entity.\nFigure 6.32.2-2: Example procedure of how the LMF receives ranging \"constellation\" information from external entity\nAs indicated, the LMF may receive information about ranging \"constellations\" in an area from an external application or an LCS client. Such information would consist at least of a list of identifiers (e.g. GPSI) of known/preferred Reference UEs/Located UEs, but may also contain additional information such as (last known) location information of such UEs, capabilities of these UEs, or area related information.\n1a:\tIn the case of an LCS client, information about ranging \"constellations\" may be sent as part of a location request for a target UE.\n1b:\tIn case of an AF, information about ranging \"constellations\" may be transmitted first to an NEF which forwards the information to the GMLC.\n2:\tAfter the GMLC has received the ranging \"constellation\" information it selects an AMF. This can be done in a similar way as in step 2 of solution#21, whereby information provided about the ranging \"constellations\" (e.g. identifier of Reference UE/Located UE, location of one or more Reference UEs/Located UEs, or area information) may be used in addition to information about a target UE. In case the GPSI is used as identifiers of Reference UEs/Located UEs, the GMLC may request the UDM to provide the SUPI of those UEs. The GMLC may also send the ranging \"constellation\" information to all known AMFs of the 5GC.\n3:\tThe GMLC sends the information about ranging \"constellations\" to the selected AMF(s).\n4:\tBased on the ranging \"constellation\" information, the AMF selects a ranging/SL position capable LMF that serves most (if not all) of the UEs of the ranging \"constellation\", e.g. based on whether the area or location information provided in the ranging \"constellation\" information is within an LMF Service Area. The AMF may also select one or more other LMFs for which the ranging \"constellation\" information could be relevant, such as LMFs with partially overlapping service area or that are currently serving one or more Reference UEs/Located UEs in the constellation.\n5:\tThe AMF provides the ranging \"constellation\" information to the selected LMF(s).\nNOTE 2:\tThe above procedure of providing ranging \"constellation\" information is optional. The LMF can have its own implementation specific means to determine ranging \"constellations\".\nNOTE 3:\tAn HPLMN can use steps 2-5 of this procedure to provide the LMF(s) of one or more VPLMNs with ranging \"constellation\" information and other ranging related configuration information, whereby the GMLC in steps 2-5 is the VGMLC and the HGMLC can provide the ranging \"constellation\" information and other ranging related configuration information via the NL3 reference point (as specified in TS 23.273 [11] and which may need to be extended for this purpose) in an alternative step 1.\nNOTE 4:\tThe LMF (via AMF) or AMF may provide ranging \"constellation\" information to a SL Positioning Server UE and the Target UE as part of their ranging configuration.\nCase 2: Target UE is out of coverage and at least one Reference UE is in coverage (i.e. partial coverage case)\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for involving multiple Reference UEs in a ranging session for partial coverage situation. It illustrates the steps taken to establish a range, including the use of multiple Reference UEs, the selection of a reference signal, and the establishment of a range. The figure also includes a visual representation of the range calculation process, which involves calculating the distance between the transmitter and receiver, and the use of a reference signal to establish the range.\nFigure 6.32.2-3: High-level procedure for involving multiple Reference UEs to a ranging session for partial coverage situation\n1-2.\tSteps 1 and 2 are the same as for Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage).\n3.\tThe out-of-coverage Target UE can implicitly or based on a configured policy initiate a MO-LR procedure by starting ranging discovery and connection setup with a nearby Reference UE (in this case Reference UE#1).\n4a.\tThe Target UE may (4a1) use the ranging connection with the nearby Reference UE to transmit a Location Request, which the Reference UE (which is in coverage) can forward (4a2) to the AMF\nThe Target UE may (4a1) use the ranging connection with the nearby Reference UE to transmit a Location Request to trigger the initiation of the ranging/sidelink positioning procedures, but since the Target UE is out-of-coverage this message needs to be forwarded (4a2) by a Reference UE that is in coverage (in this case Reference #1) to the AMF.\n4b.\tThe Location Request may (4b1) also be issued by the GMLC. If the Target UE is registered to the network (e.g. through ProSe UE-to-Network Relay functionality offered by a Reference UE or by the Reference UE acting as a gateway) or is otherwise known by the network how to reach it (e.g. by the Reference UE providing discovery information or connection setup information related to the Target UE to the AMF), the Location Request may be forwarded (4b2) by the AMF to the respective Reference UE near the Target UE, which may forward it (4b3) onwards to the Target UE. In case the Target UE is not registered to the network or otherwise not known by the network how to reach it, the AMF may find a Reference UE near the Target UE by using the Target UE's last known location (as described in Solution #21).\nNOTE 5:\tFor the forwarding of the messages in steps 4a2 and 4b3, e.g. (a subset of) ProSe UE-to-Network Relay functionality or some gateway functionality (e.g. for repackaging RSPP from PC5 to Uu) could be considered. This can be decided during normative phase and/or as part of the conclusions depending on other partial coverage solutions.\n4c.\tBased on the incoming Location Request, the AMF selects the LMF.\n5.\tThe Target UE or the Reference UE can report that a ranging connection was set up to the LMF, if this information was not provided yet via the Location Request. This report may include identifiers of the Target UE and Reference UE and a session identifier.\n6.\tThis step is the same as step 4 of Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage).\n7.\tThe LMF configures the Target UE and the Reference UEs (in this case Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2) to enable Reference UE#2 to join the ranging session. The configuration information may include a session identifier for the joint ranging session. This is the same as step 5 of Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage) except that since the Target UE is out-of-coverage, the Reference UE that is in coverage (in this case Reference #1) needs to provide or forward this message to the Target UE on behalf of the LMF. Similar if Reference UE#2 is out-of-coverage.\nNOTE 6:\tFor the forwarding of the messages, e.g. (a subset of) ProSe UE-to-Network Relay functionality or some gateway functionality (e.g. for repackaging RSPP from PC5 to Uu) could be considered. This can be decided during normative phase and/or as part of the conclusions depending on other partial coverage solutions.\n8-10.\tSteps 8 through 10 are the same as for Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage).\n11.\tAll UEs involved in the joint ranging session, in this case the Target UE and Reference UE#1 and Reference UE#2 need to report their ranging measurements/results to the LMF. However, since the Target UE is out-of-coverage, it may report its ranging measurements/results to the Reference UE that is in coverage (in this case Reference UE#1), which may (collect and) forward the ranging measurements/results to the LMF. Similar if Reference UE#2 is out-of-coverage.\n12.\tStep 12 is the same as step 10 for Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage).\nCase 3: Target UE as well as the Reference UEs are out of coverage\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for involving multiple Reference UEs in a ranging session for out-of-coverage situations. It illustrates the steps taken to establish a range communication link between the reference UEs and the primary network. The figure includes a diagram of the network topology, a flowchart of the communication process, and a list of steps to be followed. The steps involve setting up the reference UEs, establishing a range communication link, and ensuring the link is functional in the out-of-coverage situation.\nFigure 6.32.2-4: High-level procedure for involving multiple Reference UEs to a ranging session for out-of-coverage situation\n0.\tStep 0 is the same as step 1 for Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage) and Case 2 (i.e. partial coverage). Reference UE#1 is a SL Positioning Server UE.\n1.\tOptionally the LMF configures the SL Positioning Server UE, when that UE is in coverage.\n2.\tStep 2 is the same as for Case 1 (i.e. in coverage) and Case 2 (i.e. partial coverage), but is now executed by the SL Positioning Server UE instead of the LMF.\n3.\tThe Target UE or SL Positioning Server UE may transmit a Location Request to trigger the initiation of the ranging/sidelink positioning procedures.\n4.\tStep 4 is the same as for Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage), but is now executed by the SL Positioning Server UE, and NOTE 1 does not apply.\n5-10.\tSteps 5 through 10 are the same as for Case 1 (i.e. in-coverage), but are now executed by the SL Positioning Server UE instead of the LMF.\n",

In UE-only scenario, without any network entity to rely on, it should be considered whether a UE could host Vetting functionality. A key question is then whether a UE has authority to verify a) that SL Positioning Client UE is authorized and b) the Target UE privacy with respect to the SL Positioning Client UE obtaining the location of the Target UE.\nThis solution proposes that no distinct GMLC/UDM UE be introduced. Instead, it proposes that the necessary Vetting functionality be hosted either in the Target UE (Case I.) or the SL Positioning Server UE (Case II.) as follows:\nI.\tTarget UE (with Vetting functionality): the Target UE interacts directly with SL Positioning Client UEs. The Target UE itself vets any incoming location requests addressed to it and only responds to requests it successfully vets, such that \"illicit\" requests do not cause undue signalling, given that:\n-\tIn network-based scenarios, an LCS Client is verified to be authorized, or not, to retrieve the UE location, as a function of the Subscriber LCS Privacy Profile (SLPP) that is stored as part of the subscription data in the UDM, and LCS Client Data (e.g. location request type, client identity). The SLPP is subscriber-specific and can be updated by the UE, e.g. depending on user input; and\n-\tIn UE-only scenario, it can therefore be expected that the Target UE itself holds its own Subscriber SL Positioning Privacy Profile, and using this information and SL Positioning Client UE data (such as location request type e.g. positioning/ranging, accuracy, client identity, SL Reference UE ID(s), etc.) is able to decide whether or not to authorize the Client to retrieve its location.\nFurthermore, without an AMF, the Target UE will need taking on the \"role\" of the AMF. In particular, the Target UE itself will select and interact with the SL Positioning Server UE (if the Target UE determines it needs assistance from a SL Positioning Server UE for positioning of the Target UE).\nThis solution proposes that the selection of the SL Positioning Server UE by the Target UE is performed using direct discovery. Both models A and B discovery can be used as follows (see TS 23.303 [22] for definitions of models A and B):\n-\tModel A: a SL Positioning Server UE (\"announcing UE\") announces itself at least as a SL Positioning Server UE. Target UEs (\"monitoring UE\") monitor such announcements.\n-\tModel B: a Target UE (\"discoverer UE\") issues requests including information it wishes to discover a SL Positioning Server UE (\"discoveree UE\").\nOnce a suitable SL Positioning Server UE is identified by the Target UE, direct communication between these UEs can thereafter take place to complete the positioning/ranging procedure.\nII.\tSL Positioning Server UE (with Vetting functionality): the SL Positioning Server UE interacts with SL Positioning Client UEs i.e. it acts as a \"proxy\" between these SL Positioning Client UEs and Target UEs. Unlike Case I. the Target UEs would not interact directly with SL Positioning Client UEs in this case. However like Case I. it can be expected here as well that the Target UE itself holds its own Subscriber LCS Privacy profile information which can be queried/used when necessary by the SL Positioning Server UE when interacting with SL Positioning Client UEs. The SL Positioning Server UE may be able to store this information.\nA SL Positioning Client UE selects a SL Positioning Server UE (with Vetting functionality) in order for the SL Positioning Client UE to be able to issue Location Service Request.\nThe selection of the SL Positioning Server UE by the SL Positioning Client UE is performed using direct discovery. Both models A and B discovery can be used as follows (see TS 23.303 [22]), noting Model B discovery may be more adequate:\n-\tModel A: a SL Positioning Server UE (\"announcing UE\") announces itself at least as a SL Positioning Server UE (with Vetting functionality). Client UEs (\"monitoring UE\") monitor such announcements.\n-\tModel B: a SL Positioning Client UE (\"discoverer UE\") issues requests including information it wishes to discover a SL Positioning Server UE (with Vetting functionality) (\"discoveree UE\").\nThe SL Positioning Client UE needs to select a SL Positioning Server UE which is able to discover the Target UE/SL Reference UE.\nOnce a suitable SL Positioning Server UE is identified by the SL Positioning Client UE, direct communication between these UEs can thereafter take place to perform the necessary positioning/ranging procedure.\nA SL Positioning Server UE (with Vetting functionality) uses Subscriber SL Positioning Privacy Profile information from a Target UE, and SL Positioning Client UE data (such as location request type e.g. positioning/ranging, accuracy, identity, etc.) to determine whether a SL Positioning Client UE is authorized and whether this SL Positioning Client UE is authorized to retrieve the location information of the Target UE.\nResulting from the above, a signalling framework for PC5-MO-LR and PC5-MT-LR procedures in UE-only scenario are proposed in clause 6.X.3 below for both Cases I and II described above. No NI-LR procedure is deemed applicable in UE-only scenario.\nAll signalling transactions depicted in clause 6.X.3 between Target UE, SL Positioning Server UE, SL Reference UE operate using the RSPP protocol (see e.g. Solutions #4, #26).\nEditor's note:\tFuture coordination with RAN WG2 is expected to ensure alignment of the procedure details over the RSPP protocol.\nEditor's note:\tThe protocol used for signalling transactions with the SL Positioning Client UE (i.e. Service Request/Response, Location Info/Info Ack) is FFS.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS if the MT-LR and MO-LR model described hereafter would be further optimized for UE-only operation.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS which functionalities need to be standardized for SL Positioning Server UE.\nEditor's note:\tDiscovery Models A and B are referred to in clause 6.X.3. It is FFS how Model A, Model B discovery over PC5 will be used to discover UE \"roles\" (e.g. Target UE, SL Positioning Server UE). Whether another channel (e.g. communication channel) is needed for discovery is FFS and should be discussed in RAN groups.\nEditor's note:\tDetails of discovery will be addressed at a future meeting in alignment with KI#3 solutions\nEditor's note:\tAny Authentication/Authorization will be aligned with SA WG3.

Step 6) that includes one or more SL Reference UEs, then th SL Reference UE(s) are also identified in the Determine Location Request message.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 7 may be skipped if the Target UE does not determine to involve SL Positioning Server UE.\n8.\tThe UE Positioning (/ranging) is performed by the Target UE or with support of the SL Positioning Server UE in order to determine the Target UE location, depending on the outcome of step 6.\nNOTE 3:\tSL Reference UE(s) may also be invoked at this point to assist the Target UE or SL Positioning Server UE in determining the Target UE location.\nIf support from a SL Positioning Server UE was requested in step 6, step 9 follows, else step 10.\n9.\tThe SL Positioning Server UE reports the calculated Target UE location information in a Determine Location Response message to the Target UE.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 9 may be skipped if the Target UE does not determine to involve SL Positioning Server UE.\n10.\tThe Target UE reports its location information in a Service Response message to the SL Positioning Server UE which in turn forwards it to the SL Positioning Client UE.\nThe figure depicts a PC5-MO-LR procedure, which is a method used in the field of optical communication to transmit data over long distances. The figure shows a step-by-step process for implementing this procedure, including the use of a PC5-MO-LR optical transmitter, a MO-LR optical receiver, and a LR optical line terminal. The figure is important for understanding the technical aspects of optical communication systems and the steps involved in implementing these procedures.\nFigure 6.34.3.2.2-1: PC5-MO-LR procedure\n1.\tThis step is triggered in the Target UE e.g. by an application running in the UE, to retrieve its position (absolute or relative) and, possibly, to share it with a SL Positioning Client UE (e.g. at regular intervals). If the location operation requires SL positioning or ranging with a SL Reference UE, the Target UE verifies that this SL Reference UE is in proximity (e.g. by using the discovery procedure (Model A) with this other UE). If the Target UE determines it requires support from a SL Positioning Server UE, the Target UE selects a SL Positioning Server UE. The selection of the SL Positioning Server UE by the Target UE is performed using direct discovery. Both models A and B discovery can be used as follows (see TS 23.303 [22] for definitions of models A and B):\n-\tModel A: a SL Positioning Server UE (\"announcing UE\") announces itself at least as a SL Positioning Server UE. Target UEs (\"monitoring UE\") monitor such announcements.\n-\tModel B: a Target UE (\"discoverer UE\") issues requests including information it wishes to discover a SL Positioning Server UE (\"discoveree UE\").\nFor the selection of the SL Positioning Server UE, the Target UE needs to verify that the candidate SL Positioning Server UE is allowed to be involved based on the Subscriber SL Positioning Privacy Profile information.\nOnce a SL Positioning Server UE is selected, direct communication is established between the Target UE and this SL Positioning Server UE allowing the procedure to proceed (step 2).\nIf the Target UE determines instead it does not need support from a SL Positioning Server UE it proceeds to step 3.\n2.\tThe Target UE issues a Determine Location Request message to the SL Positioning Server UE, incl. necessary information as required by the intended location operation. If the type of location request requires SL positioning or ranging with one or more SL Reference UEs, the SL Reference UE(s) are also identified in the Determine Location Request message. The SL Positioning Server UE verifies that the location operation with the other UE is authorized (following if necessary similar steps as steps 3, 4 and 5 in clause 6.34.3.2.1, i.e. Subscriber SL Positioning Privacy Info Req/Resp with, and Vetting of the SL Reference UE).\nNOTE 1:\tStep 2 may be skipped if the Target UE does not determine to involve SL Positioning Server UE.\n3.\tThe UE Positioning (/ranging) is performed by the Target UE or with support of the SL Positioning Server UE in order to determine the Target UE location, depending on the outcome of step 1.\nNOTE 2:\tSL Reference UE(s) may also be invoked at this point to assist the Target UE or SL Positioning Server UE in determining the Target UE location.\nIf support from a SL Positioning Server UE was requested in step 1, step 4 follows, else step 5.\n4.\tThe SL Positioning Server UE reports the calculated Target UE location information in a Determine Location Response message to the Target UE.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 2 may be skipped if the Target UE does not determine to involve SL Positioning Server UE.\n5.\tIf necessary (i.e. if reporting to a SL Positioning Client UE is necessary), the Target UE reports the calculated Target UE location information to the SL Positioning Server UE, with necessary information allowing identification of the SL Positioning Client UE. The Target UE includes its SLPP information, which, together with the Client information allows the SL Positioning Server UE to determine whether the SL Positioning Client UE is authorized. If so, the SL Positioning Server UE forwards the location information to the authorized SL Positioning Client UE.\n6.\tThe SL Positioning Client UE acknowledges receipt of the Target UE location information from the SL Positioning Server UE which in turn forwards it to the Target UE.\n",

The Registration Procedure, UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy Delivery, UE Policy Association Establishment procedure, and UE Policy Association Modification procedure are used with some necessary enhancement.

The solutions can be summarized and evaluated in detail as the following.\n-\tSol#10 (related to KI#2 and KI#6) proposes that a SL Positioning Client UE consumes the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service from an Assistant UE which performs the Ranging procedure with UE1 and UE2 respectively and calculate the ranging result. The ranging and positioning procedure with UE1 and UE2 is based on other solutions of KI#4\n-\tSol#14 and Sol#19 propose a general reference architecture for Sidelink positioning and ranging-based services, which are related to all KIs. Conclusions from RAN WGs are needed to discuss the feasibility of the proposed architecture.\n-\tSol#16 proposes that the direct ranging procedure defined by the solutions for KI#4 can be directly used for the direct ranging between Assistant UE(s) and UE1, and the direct ranging between Assistant UE(s) and UE2. And the two direct ranging procedures can be performed at the same scheduled ranging time to get more accuracy ranging result. UE1 and UE2 can send the ranging request/response to each other over PC5 direct connection or UE-to-UE Relay connection. The ranging procedure between Assistant UE(s) and UE1 is triggered by UE1 and the ranging procedure between Assistant UE(s) and UE2 is triggered by UE2. The solution applies to multiple Assistant UEs case. Two options on Assistant UE selection are proposed, and the selection of Option A (Assistant UE selection by UE2) or Option B (Assistant UE selection by UE1) can consider the UE-to-UE Relay selection mechanism for a consistent UE action. The Ranging measurement/result between the Assistant UE(s) and UE1 and that between the Assistant UE(s) and UE2 are used to derive the Ranging result between UE1 and UE2, by UE1 as initiator UE, instead of Assistant UE(s). The benefit is that the Assistant UE(s) just assists the ranging operation but does not get the ranging result of the around UEs.\n-\tSol#17 proposes that UE1 selects Assistant UE and triggers Assistant UE to perform ranging procedure with UE2. In this solution, UE1 broadcast the Ranging/Sidelink positioning request, and if no response from UE2 is received, it selects one or multiple assistant UE who sends the response first. After that, UE1 initiates Ranging/Sidelink positioning procedure with the selected Assistant UE(s), which then also trigger the Assistant UE(s) to perform ranging with UE2. The measurement data are finally shared among UE1, UE2 and the Assistant UE(s) for result calculation.\nThe main difference between Sol#16 and Sol#17 includes\n-\tAssistant UE selection: UE1 or UE2 selects Assistant UE (Sol#16), UE1 selects Assistant UE (Sol#17)\n-\tRanging procedure between Assistant UE(s) and UE2: initiated by UE 2 (Sol#16), initiated by Assistant UE (Sol#17)\n-\tResult calculation: UE1 calculates raging result (Sol#16), Assistant UE or UE1 or UE2 calculates raging result (Sol#17),\n-\tSol#26 proposes a functional split and positioning protocol to enable the support of SL positioning and ranging. It focuses on the concept of \"Location Server\", and proposes that the functionality offered to the UE by a location server can also reside in a UE (no longer limited as a \"network\" entity), termed as a \"SL Positioning Server UE\", to support ranging/SL positioning operations between UEs without any network involvement. The SL Positioning Server UE can provide assistant info to Target UE or obtain reference info from Reference UE. Security issues should be considered by SA3 WG for this newly introduced UE type.\n-\tSol#27 mainly discusses LMF selection for its involvement in Ranging/Sidelink positioning, and is related to KI#2, KI#3, KI#4, KI#5, KI#6, and KI#7.\n-\tSol#28 specifies the LMF involved Ranging/Sidelink positioning procedures. 3 modes of ranging result calculation are defined, which are UE-based, LMF-based and hybrid calculation. LMF determines the result calculation mode based on LMF/UE capability, UE preference and operator policy. This solution provides a general procedure of LMF triggered Ranging/Sidelink positioning, which can be applied to Ranging/Sidelink positioning with assistant UE, Network assisted Sidelink positioning, and Ranging/Sidelink positioning exposure to a SL Positioning Client UE, AF or 5GC NF.\n-\tSol#29 addresses Assistant UE involved periodic ranging. It specifies a common scenario for V2X applications where fixed Assistant UEs (e.g. RSUs) help to track the relative position of two moving cars on a highway with another car in-between. To maintain the assistive ranging service when the working Assistant UE is too far from the targets to continue its ranging assistance, the solution proposes that during each cycle of the periodic ranging, the Target UE itself performs ranging service check to determine whether it is necessary to initiate a new round discovery for a new Assistant UE. This solution can be compatible with other solutions, and serve as a supplement to address the periodic ranging scenarios.\n-\tSol#30 proposes that the UE1 and UE2 perform ranging measurement with the selected assistant UEs independently, and share the ranging result to complete ranging calculation. The Assistant UEs are discovered and selected by UE1 and UE2 by any solutions for KI#3, and are only involved in measuring but not in result collection or calculation. Sol#16 and Sol#30 shares same principles, such as UE2 is reachable by UE1 via direct communication or relay, UE2 initiates ranging procedure with Assistant UE and the Assistant UE is not involved to final ranging result calculation for privacy protection. The main difference between Sol#16 and Sol#30 is Assistant UE discovery and selection:\n-\tSol#30 reuses discovery solutions of KI#3 and enhance Ranging/Sidelink positioning request/response for Assistant UE selection, no additional impact Assistant UE\n-\tSol#16 proposes that Assistant UE needs to discover UE2 based on discovery message received from UE1, and Assistant UE is selected during discovery procedure.\n",

For Model A discovery, it is proposed Target UE sends an Announcement message containing the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning related parameters and Reference UEs monitor the Announcement message. For Model B discovery, it is proposed Reference UE sends a Solicitation message containing Ranging/Sidelink Positioning related parameters and Target UE responds to the Reference UE with a Response message containing Ranging/Sidelink Positioning related parameters. Discovery mechanism for V2X usage is not mentioned.\n-\tSol#5 proposes the Reference UE or Target UE broadcasts a Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Request message that contains the parameters provided by application layer, and the Reference UE/Target UE responds if the Application Layer ID is matched.\n-\tSol#14 introduces a new reference point SR5 that is used to control the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operation over the PC5 reference point between the UEs. Device and Service Discovery Function (DSDF) over the V2X/5G ProSe layer is introduced to discover and identify the UE(s) in proximity that can participate in Sidelink Positioning and Ranging service sessions. The discovery is carried out over SR5 over PC5 reference point between the UEs using PC5 communication service provided by ProSe or V2X layer.\n-\tSol#18 focuses on the network triggered ranging device discovery. It proposes one UE sends the ranging device discovery request to the network, then the network notifies the peer UE to turn on or activate the ranging device discovery. After receiving the notification from the network, the peer UE initiates the ranging device discovery with the UE. This solution includes two alternatives, i.e. 5GC based network triggered ranging device discovery and Application layer-based Network triggered ranging device discovery. The former is performed over the Control plane assuming same LMF is selected for the 2 UEs and the 2 UEs are from same PLMN, and the latter is performed over the application layer which is out of SA2 scope. This solution allows the Ranging/SL Positioning UEs to switch off the discovery functionality, e.g. for the purpose of power saving, and switch on based on the network instruction, applying only to the In Coverage case to trigger and receive network instruction.\n-\tSol#26 focuses on the functional split and positioning protocol to enable the support of Sidelink (SL) positioning (and Ranging), implying that Ranging/Sidelink Positioning device discovery is part of RSPP protocol.\n-\tSol#27 focuses on LMF selection for Ranging/Sidelink positioning by the AMF.

The ranging configuration includes the Ranging role (Reference UE or Target UE), one time or periodic ranging, ranging for distance or direction measurement or both. It addresses the case of direct Ranging/Sidelink positioning between 2 UEs, assuming that either Reference UE or Target UE performs as SL positioning server UE.\n-\tSolution #4 proposes Ranging/SL Positioning layer on top of V2X/ProSe layer for Ranging/SL Positioning control, i.e. to exchange the coordination & configuration information (i.e. Ranging capability, Ranging assistant data and measurement results) and the Ranging/Sidelink positioning signal measurement results using RSPP. RSPP is over PC5-S. It addresses the case of direct Ranging/Sidelink positioning between 2 UEs, assuming that either Reference UE or Target UE performs as SL positioning server UE.\n-\tSolution #5 assumes there's an Application layer on top of a Ranging layer. The application layer provides Ranging/Sidelink Positioning parameters to Ranging layer. The Ranging layer triggers the service, and provides the result to the Application layer, assuming Sidelink Positioning procedure defined by RAN.\n-\tSolution #14 introduces SR5 interface to control the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operation over the PC5 reference point between the UEs. Device and Service Discovery Function (DSDF), Group Support Service Function (GSSF), Sidelink Positioning and Ranging Function (SPRF) are introduced on top of ProSe/V2X Layer. In order to be supported over PC5, the three services, i.e. DSDF, GSSF, and SPRF, should obtain a V2X Service Type (e.g. PSID, ITS-AID, or AID) or a ProSe Application ID. LMF may be involved when all the UEs are in coverage. For out of coverage and partial coverage cases, no involvement of LMF. Whether measurement results or Sidelink Positioning or Ranging results are exchanged over the SR5 depends on the negotiation during the control signalling.\n-\tSolution #19 introduces information exchanged between Application layer and Device and Service Discovery Function (DSDF)/ Group Support Service Function (GSSF)/ Sidelink Positioning and Ranging Function (SPRF). PC5-U is used for SR5 with non-IP PDCP SDU type in the case of V2X UEs and non-IP PDCP SDU type/ \"unstructured\" PDCP SDU type in the case of 5G ProSe UEs. It supports multiple UEs to participate in the operation. SPRF signalling is introduced for the control signalling between the UEs to determine the corresponding Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operation (e.g. the channel to use for the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging reference signal, the sequence and time slot for each of the UE to perform the signal transmission and measurements), to exchange the measurement results and to provide the computing service either by a central SL Positioning Server UE or by all UEs.\n-\tSolution #26 introduces SL Positioning Server UE. RSPP shall be able to operate between a Target UE and a SL Positioning UE, between a Reference UE and a SL Positioning UE and between a Target UE and a Reference UE. RSPP is considered to be over PC5-S. RSPP shall be able to operate over the Control-Plane between a Target UE and a LMF. RSPP should be defined as a \"standalone\" extension of LPP i.e. RSPP can be supported (esp. in a SL Positioning Server UE) without having to support the entire LPP, while LMF already supporting LPP can be upgraded with the RSPP extension.\n-\tSolution #27 defines AMF selects a Ranging/SL positioning capable LMF when LMF needs to be involved based on service request and LMF capabilities.\n-\tSolution #28 introduces Ranging/Sidelink positioning result calculation modes (UE based, LMF based, Hybrid), and the mode is determined based on LMF Ranging/Sidelink positioning capability, UE Ranging/Sidelink positioning capability, UE preference and Operator policy. Information of LMF Ranging/Sidelink positioning capability, UE Ranging/Sidelink positioning capability and UE preference are exchanged between UE and LMF and between UEs.\n-\tSolution#32 defines how to position a Target UE by multiple Reference UEs, in which control signalling is exchanged between the Target UE and the LMF for providing the list of selected Reference UEs/Located UEs and between the Reference UEs and the LMF for providing the measurement data for calculation. When the target UE is out of coverage, the control signalling exchange is through the Reference UE who are in coverage. When none of the Target UE and the Reference UEs are in coverage, a SL Positioning Server UE has to be discovered for the result calculation.\nThe commonalities and differences are summarized as the following:\n-\tA new layer is introduced between application layer and lower layers to handle service request received from application layer and to control the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operation. (Solution #3, #4, #5, #14 and #19).\n-\tA new protocol is introduced for SR5 over the PC5 reference point between the UEs, and this new protocol can be over PC5-S (Solution #4 and #26) or PC5-U (Solution #14 and #19).\n-\tA LMF may be involved when at least one of the Target UE and the Reference UE are in the network coverage (Solution #14, #19, #26, #28 and #32). In that case a suitable LMF needs to be selected by the AMF based on the LMF capabilities and the service requests (Solution #27). The protocol used between UE and LMF will be decided by RAN and could be an extension of LPP, a new protocol or both.\n-\tA SL Positioning Server UE can be discovered and selected for result calculation for the case of partial coverage and out of coverage (Solution #14, #19, #26 and #32).\n-\tMultiple UEs may be involved in a single Ranging/Sidelink Positioning session. (Solution #14, #19 and #32).\n-\tWhether measurement results or Sidelink Positioning/Ranging results are exchanged over the SR5 depends on the negotiation during the control signalling (Solution #14 and #28).\n",

The Request goes to the GMLC which forwards the location request to the AMF that serves the Target UE. The AMF pages the Target UE(s) and each AMF selects a LMF that can provide the ranging/SL positioning service. The AMF send a location request to the LMF. The LMF checks the UE(s) ProSe Capabilities with the AMF. The LMF interacts with PCF to initiate Relay operation for location Reporting. PCF configures the UE(s) with RSC(s). The UEs involved perform discovery and set up PC5 connection. The PCF reports to the LMF that the relay configuration is complete. The LMF selects one Located UE to act as a location relay and perform ranging/SL positioning with one or more Target UEs. The Located UE provides the ranging and SL positioning measurement reports to the LMF and the LMF calculates the location of all the Target UEs and provide this information to the AMF(s), then AMF to GMLC, then GMLC to AF (via NEF). In this solution the LPP location Request to locate the Target UE goes to the Located UE instead of the Target UE, even if the AMF paged the Target UE to secure NAS connection with the Target UE.\nSolution #19\nMO-LR: A target UE that is in network coverage may discover one or more other UEs (e.g. assistant UEs and/or located UEs) and sends an MO-LR request to a serving AMF requesting location information (absolute locations, relative locations or ranges) for itself and possibly the other UEs. The AMF transfers the request to an LMF which obtains the capabilities of all the UEs, may provide assistance data to the UEs, and instigates sidelink positioning among the UEs. Location results can be calculated by the target UE if capable or by the LMF which then returns the results to the target UE.\nMT-LR: An LCS Client or AF requests location information (absolute locations, relative locations or ranges) for a group of two or more UEs known to be nearby to one another and with at least one of the UEs in network coverage. A normal Uu MT-LR procedure is used to send the location request to a serving AMF for one of the UEs that is in network coverage. The AMF then forwards the request to an LMF. The LMF sends the MT-LR request to the UE that is in network coverage with identities for the other UE(s). This UE then discovers the other UE(s) and responds to the LMF on whether the MT-LR is possible. Location of the group of UEs then occurs using the same procedure as for the MO-LR and location result information is returned to the LCS Client or AF. A periodic or triggered MT-LR for a group of two or more UEs can be supported by extending the MT-LR procedure similarly to the periodic or triggered MT-LR procedure for Uu positioning in TS 23.273 [11].\nSolution#20\nMT-LR: The Target UE receives a DL positioning message instructing the target UE to discover a Located UE. The Target UE discovers a Located UE and returns the ID of the Located UE to the LMF. The LMF triggers the GMLC to retrieve the location of the Located UE at a certain time T and returns the location to the LMF. In parallel the LMF triggers the Target UE to perform ranging procedure with the Location UE at time T. The Target UE returns the ranging measurement result to the LMF. The LMF uses the results and calculates the location of the Target UE.\nMO-LR: Target UE discovers a Located UE and sends an MO-LR including the ID of the Located UE and a certain time T. The LMF triggers the GMLC to determine the Location UE location at time T and receives the Location UE location from the GMLC. The LMF sends a DL positioning message to the Target UE to perform the ranging procedure (at time T). The Target UE returns the ranging result to the LMF. The LMF uses the results and calculates the location of the Target UE. The location result is returned to the Target UE in the MO-LR Response.\nMT-LR with Target UE out of coverage: When GMLC does not get the Target UE’s AMF address from UDM or get the unreachable indication from Target UE’s AMF, GMLC determines to use Network assisted sidelink positioning to locate the target UE and GMLC selects a Located UE (i.e., UE2) based on the target area. GMLC triggers the LCS procedure of Located UE defined in TS 23.273 [11] to get the location of the Target UE.\nSolution#21\nMT-LR: This solution addresses the case where Target UE is out of coverage of the network (i.e. no direct NAS connection). GMLC receives the LCS service request from AF/LCS client, and GMLC determines the serving AMF based on UE status and information in the LCS service request, and sends the request to the selected AMF. AMF determines the list of Located UEs, and sends the LCS service request to the LMF including the Target UE ID and IDs of one or Multiple Located UEs. The LMF sends a LCS service request to the one or more Located UEs. The Located UE(s) discovers the Target UE, performs ranging procedure with the Target UE and report the result or measurement data to the LMF. The LMF triggers the location determination of the Located UE(s). The LMF uses the measurement results/data to calculate the location of the Target UE and returns the location result to the AMF.\nSolution#31\nMT-LR: Deferred MT-LR is proposed to trigger location report from target UE when it enters out of coverage through located UE or UE2NW relay UE. The AMF provides together with Location Request a list of Located UEs that the LMF can use as Located UEs. The AMF also includes a Security Container to be used by the Target UE to validate the ranging/SL positioning request from the Located UE. The LMF sends a SL positioning request to one of the Located UEs. The Located UE performs PC5 discovery of the Target UE and setup a PC5 unicast connection. The Located UE send a SL positioning request including the security container to the Target UE. After the Target UE have validated the request, the Located UE proceeds with the SL positioning and reports the measurement to the LMF. The LMF uses the measurement results and calculates the location of the Target UE and returns the location result to the AMF. In this solution there is no NAS connection with the Target UE as the Target UE is out-of-coverage.\nSolution#32\nAn AF may provide constellation information related to Located UEs. The LMF stores data on potential Located UE including e.g. geographical info, location related capabilities.\nCase 1: The LMF triggers MT-LR of the Target UE or the Target UE triggers MO-LR. The Target UE initiates discovery and PC5 connection with one of the Located UEs, the Located UE ID to which the Target UE has established a ranging connection to are reported to the LMF. The LMF instructs the Target UE and Located UE to invite other Located UEs to the location session. The Target UE can then try to perform ranging/SL positioning with all of them. Optionally the Located UEs will perform ranging/SL positioning with the other Located UEs also (for additional accuracy). All UEs involved in the session report their measurement data to the LMF. The LMF calculates the location and reports the location to the requesting node. In this case the Target UE has a NAS connection with the AMF.\nCase 2: MT-LR: This is the same as case 1, but in this case one of the Located UEs service as a relay for the NAS signalling between the AMF and the Target UE.\nCase 3: MO-LR: In this case the LMF configures a Located UE with the constellation info, when the Located UE was in-coverage. This Located UE has the functionality to calculate the position of the Target UE, based on ranging/SL positioning data and its own location. The Located UE has the capability of a SL Positioning Server UE.\n",

                    "text_content": "This clause evaluates the solutions captured in Table 6.0-1 for KI#6 as following.\n-\tSol#9 gives 2 potential cases for ranging service exposure to UE which includes Two UEs case and Three UEs case. For the Two UEs case, UE1 initiates the Ranging/SL positioning operation with the UE2 directly over PC5 and then calculate the Ranging result locally. For the Three UEs case, the SL Positioning Client UE consumes the Ranging/SL positioning service of UE#1 either through PC5 directly or through 5GC. When to invoke the ranging services via PC5 directly, UE#1 triggers ranging process with UE#2 and calculates the ranging result for the SL Positioning Client UE. For the service exposure to the SL Positioning Client UE via 5GC, 5GC is responsible for invoking the ranging service of UE#1 and calculating the ranging result for SL Positioning Client UE. For this process, it potentially needs the involved UEs should belong to same PLMN. If belonging to different severing 5GC NFs, interactions among 5GC NFs are necessary needed.\n-\tSol#10 gives a procedure for ranging service exposure and invocation over PC5 directly. This solution takes the Assistant UE or a reference UE as the ranging service provider who needs to be discovered and selected first. After that, the Ranging service consumer (e.g. UE#1, SL Positioning Client UE) sends request to ranging service provider to invoke the ranging services for obtaining the ranging result between Target UEs. Ranging service provider performs the ranging procedure with Target UEs based on solution of KI#4 and returns the ranging result to the Ranging service consumer.\n-\tSol#11 proposes to use exposure API over user plane to access the Ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure. In this solution, Registration procedure needs to be enhanced so the AMF checks the UE subscription if the UE is allowed to use the service API for Ranging service exposure and provides the UE with the onboarding information. After that, the UE performs the Onboarding of an API Invoker procedure in clause 8.1 of TS 23.222 [12] with setting the Service API to the Ranging and SL positioning service exposure API. Then, the UE uses the Service API as specified for Ranging and SL positioning service exposure.\n-\tSol#14 and#19 proposes a general reference architecture for Sidelink positioning and ranging-based services. In this solution, the functionalities of new reference points (e.g. SR1, SR5) and existing reference points enhancement for ranging are defined. For ranging operations, it proposes to use PC5-U to carry the SR5 signalling such as the Ranging control signalling and discovery message. The Ranging services, including Device and Service Discovery Function (DSDF), Group Support Service Function (GSSF) and Sidelink Positioning and Ranging Function (SPRF), are considered as 3 kinds of V2X/ProSe services from the V2X/ProSe layer perspective and use existing PC5 communication to realize the SR5 interactions. Whether SR5 will be over PC5-U will be subject to RAN WGs conclusions.\n-\tSol#22 is related to KI#6 and KI#7. This solution invokes the Ranging service via 5GC. LMF is enhanced to determine the positioning methods with UE capability consideration after receiving the ranging request. After determination, LMF initiates the Ranging/SL positioning between UE1 and UE2, and/or Uu positioning of UE#1 and UE#2. Then LMF calculates the ranging result between UE#1 and UE#2 based on Uu position and SL ranging measurement. This solution potentially requires that all the involved UEs are belong to same PLMN and 5GC NFs interaction between each other due to different serving NFs.\n-\tSol#25 has similarly thinking to So#9 on the SL Positioning client UE consuming the ranging services through Uu or PC5. For invoking the ranging service via 5GC, there is not LMF involvement and the AMF is responsible for invoking the ranging service of UE. In addition, this solution enhances the GMLC functionality which requires to maintain the mapping between Application Layer ID(s) and SUPI of the UE for later corresponding NFs querying. Similarly, this solution also requires that all the involved UEs are belong to same PLMN and 5GC NFs interaction between each other due to different serving 5GC NFs.\n-\tSol#26 proposes a functional split and positioning protocol to enable the support of Sidelink (SL) positioning (and Ranging). This solution proposes to introduce the location server UE to help the calculation of Ranging result. Considering that the Location server UE is involved to the ranging and SL positioning, security issues need to be considered and subject to SA3 groups conclusions.\n-\tSol#27 more focuses on the LMF selection with taking the Ranging and SL positioning requirements into account.\n-\tSol#28 proposes the LMF to be involved in Ranging/Sidelink positioning. In this solution, 3 modes on ranging result calculation are introduced including UE based, LMF based and Hybrid. when to decide ranging result mode, capability interaction between UE and LMF is needed.\n-\tSol#33 mainly introduces the usage of Location server UE for ranging result calculation when ranging UEs are not able to calculate the ranging result. The ranging result calculation is proposed to be performed in Location server UE firstly, if it fails, then LMF is determined to be involved.\nAmong current solutions above, the Ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure to a UE can be invoked:\na)\tThrough PC5 directly (Sol#9, #10, #14, #25, #26 and #33):\ni.\tMeans the UE can invoke the Ranging service from another UE via PC5 directly.\nb)\tThrough Network (Sol#9, #11, #22, #25, #26, #27, #28 and #33):\nii.\tMeans the UE can not invoke the Ranging service from another UE via PC5 directly, which requests network assistant to invoke the Ranging service from another UE and response the Ranging result.\nSo, the Ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure to a UE can be supported via PC5 directly or network.\nFor ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure to UE over PC5 directly:\nThe basic procedure for ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure to UE over PC5 directly can be performed by the following order (See Sol#9, #10, #25, #26 and #33):\n-\tStep1: UE#1 (e.g. SL positioning client UE) invokes the ranging and sidelink positioning service from UE#2 (Assistant UE, Reference UE) by sending a ranging and sidelink positioning service request to the UE#2 for obtaining the Ranging and SL positioning result of/between Target UEs. In this request at least the SL positioning client UE, the UE#1 info, UE#2 info and target UEs info should be included.\n-\tStep 2: Authentication for the ranging and sidelink positioning service invocation from UE#1\n-\tStep3: UE#2 receives the ranging and sidelink positioning service request from UE#1, UE#2 initiates the ranging and sidelink positioning procedure with Target UEs based on the process in conclusion of KI#4 and obtaining the ranging and sidelink positioning result.\n-\tStep4: UE#2 responds to the UE#1 with ranging and sidelink positioning result of/between Target UEs in the respond message.\nIn addition, considering capability of Ranging result calculation as described in Sol#33, during the ranging and sidelink positioning service procedure as described above, the SL Positioning Server UE can be involved in before responding to UE#1 with ranging and sidelink positioning result.\nFor ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure to UE via Network:\nThis ranging service exposure and invocation through network can be realized by the following 2 methods:\n-\tRanging service exposure and invocation through 5GC, the ranging service consumer sends the ranging request to the 5GC (e.g. AMF or LMF) as described in Sol#9, #22, #25, #27, #33.\n-\tRanging service exposure and invocation through Application layer as described in sol#11, this mechanism reuses the solution for KI#7.\nFor the ranging and sidelink positioning service exposure to UE via 5GC, the SL positioning client UE invokes ranging and sidelink positioning service by sending NAS message to the 5GC, the LCS architecture and LPP messages can be reused with small enhancements, i.e. defining new IEs for ranging/sidelink positioning service. It only needs to enhance the AMF logic to select an appropriate LMF, or act as the consumer of GMLC service for ranging/sidelink positioning service (the following procedure is same to that of AF requesting for ranging/sidelink positioning service). All the captured solutions have to enforce the involved UEs to belong same PLMN.\nDepend on UE implementation, the SL positioning client UE can also invoke the ranging service exposure from UE via the Application exposure API, then the subsequent processes rely on the conclusion of KI#7.\n",

The LMF is enhanced to interact with ProSe application server (or PCF) to configure the Located UE/Reference UE as ProSe-based UE-to-Network Relay to report the Target UE location and configures the Target UE with remote UE with special RSCs.\n-\tIn Sol#13, the AF invokes the ranging service via 5GC. AMF is responsible for triggering the UEs to initiate the ranging procedure between each other. The service interface for AMF needs to be enhanced to support Ranging invoking. The service request and result between UE and AMF are delivered over NAS messages.\n-\tSol#14 addresses all KIs by proposing a general reference architecture for Sidelink positioning and ranging-based services. In this solution, the functionalities of new reference points (e.g. SR1, SR5) and existing reference points enhancement for ranging are defined. When either UE is in coverage, it may communicate with LMF, re-using enhanced procedures of LCS. When the UEs are out of coverage, or with partial network coverage, the Sidelink Positioning and Ranging services can be performed without the network involvement.\n-\tSol#22 addresses both KI#6 and KI#7. It reuses the LCS architecture and proposes the LMF to combine Uu positioning with Ranging/Sidelink Positioning capabilities to satisfy the Ranging/Sidelink positioning service request. The LMF selects the appropriate positioning methods based on the service requirements, UE capability, UE status, and operator policy.\n-\tSol#23 is similar to Sol#12, it also leverages the LCS architecture and takes the MT-LR procedure as baseline for Ranging Service Exposure. The LMF is enhanced to obtain the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning capability of the 2 UEs, determine the role of the 2 UEs, obtain the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning location information from UE, and calculate the result.\n-\tSol#24 is a pure application layer procedure for AF invoked Ranging service exposure.

It proposes a functional split and positioning protocol to enable the support of Sidelink (SL) positioning and Ranging. This solution proposes a SL Positioning Server UE to help the calculation of Ranging result. It further proposes a Positioning Protocol (i.e. RSPP) that can operate between a Target UE and a SL Positioning Server UE, between a SL Positioning Server UE and a Reference UE, and between a Target UE and a Reference UE.\n-\tSol#27 reuses the LCS architecture and focuses on the LMF selection by taking the Ranging and SL positioning requirements into account.\n-\tSol#28 proposes to reuse the LCS architecture and the MT-LR procedure for Ranging Service Exposure to AF. The result calculation can be performed at UE or LMF or both. LMF determines the Ranging/Sidelink positioning result calculation mode. In this solution, 3 modes on ranging result calculation are introduced including UE based, LMF based and Hybrid.\n-\tSol#33 addresses both KI#6 and KI#7 by proposing a common Ranging/Sidelink positioning service exposure that consists of both network based solution and non-network based solution. In both cases, the solution introduces the usage of SL Positioning Server UE for ranging result calculation. If the attempt to involve a SL Positioning Server UE fails, then LMF is to be involved.\n",
