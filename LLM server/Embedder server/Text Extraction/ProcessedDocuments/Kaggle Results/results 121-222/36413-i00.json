                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. \nA term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].\nACL functionality: A functionality controlling the access to network nodes. In case of Access Control Lists (ACL) functionality is applied in a network node the network node may only accept connections from other peer network nodes once the source addresses of the sending network node is already known in the target node.\nCSG Cell: an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to true and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Closed Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [28].\nDAPS Handover: as defined in TS 36.300 [14].\nDCN-ID: DCN identity identifies a specific decicated core network (DCN).\nDual Connectivity: as defined in TS 36.300 [14].\nElementary Procedure: S1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between eNBs and the EPC. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several S1AP EPs together or together with EPs from other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 23.401 [11] and TS 36.300 [14]).\nAn EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:\n-\tClass 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).\n-\tClass 2: Elementary Procedures without response.\nFor Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:\nSuccessful:\n-\tA signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.\nUnsuccessful:\n-\tA signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.\n-\tOn time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).\nSuccessful and Unsuccessful:\n-\tOne signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.\nClass 2 EPs are considered always successful.\neNB UE S1AP ID: as defined in TS 36.401 [2].\nHybrid Cell: an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to false and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Hybrid Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [28].\nMME UE S1AP ID: as defined in TS 36.401 [2].\nE-RAB: as defined in TS 36.401 [2].\nNOTE 1:\tThe E-RAB is either a default E-RAB or a dedicated E-RAB.\nE-RAB ID: the E-RAB ID uniquely identifies an E-RAB for one UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe E-RAB ID remains unique for the UE even if the UE-associated logical S1-connection is released during periods of user inactivity.\nData Radio Bearer: the Data Radio bearer transports the packets of an E-RAB between a UE and an eNB. There is a one-to-one mapping between the E-RAB and the Data Radio Bearer.\nSecondary Cell Group: as defined in TS 36.300 [14].\nUE-associated signalling: When S1-AP messages associated to one UE uses the UE-associated logical S1-connection for association of the message to the UE in eNB and EPC.\nUE-associated logical S1-connection: The UE-associated logical S1-connection uses the identities MME UE S1AP ID and eNB UE S1AP ID according to definition in TS 23.401 [11]. For a received UE associated S1-AP message the MME identifies the associated UE based on the MME UE S1AP ID IE and the eNB identifies the associated UE based on the eNB UE S1AP ID IE. The UE-associated logical S1-connection may exist before the S1 UE context is setup in eNB.\n",

The source eNB may reattempt the handover but only for the E-RABs that do not require User Plane Integrity Protection.\nThe figure depicts a handover preparation scenario where the mobile network operator (MNO) is unable to complete the handover due to a failed handover procedure. The figure shows the handover process from the mobile network to the fixed network, with the mobile network operator (MNO) initiating the handover and the fixed network operator (FNO) receiving the signal. The figure also includes a visual representation of the handover process, such as the handover signal, the handover signal path, and the handover signal strength. The figure is important for understanding the handover process and ensuring that it is completed correctly.\nFigure 8.4.1.3-1: Handover preparation: unsuccessful operation\nIf the EPC or the target system is not able to accept any of the bearers or a failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the MME sends the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to the source eNB.\nIf the CSG Id IE and no Cell Access Mode IE are received in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message and the access control is unsuccessful and none of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 [11]) the MME shall send the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to the source eNB, except when one of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 [11]). Upon reception, the source eNB may decide to prevent handover for that UE towards CSG (Closed Access Mode) cells with corresponding CSG Id.\nInteraction with Handover Cancel procedure:\nIf there is no response from the EPC to the HANDOVER REQUIRED message before timer TS1RELOCprep expires in the source eNB, the source eNB should cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by initiating the Handover Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for the Cause IE. The source eNB shall ignore any HANDOVER COMMAND message or HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message received after the initiation of the Handover Cancel procedure.\nIf the eNB receives at least one E-RAB ID included in the E-RABs Subject to Forwarding List IE without at least one valid associated tunnel address pair (in either UL or DL), then the eNB shall consider it as a logical error and act as described in subclause 10.4.

In case the Aggressor E-CGI List IE is not present, the eNB may consider the request applicable to all cells.\nIf the eNB receives the SON Information IE containing the SON Information Reply IE including the Muting Pattern Information IE as an answer to a former request, it may use it for over-the-air synchronisation by means of network listening. The Muting Pattern Information IE may apply to all cells that were requested to mute.\nIf the eNB receives the SON Information IE containing the SON Information Request IE set to “Deactivate Muting”, the eNB may consider deactivating muting for over-the-air synchronisation that was activated by a former muting request from the corresponding eNB.\n",

The E-RAB ID shall remain the same for the duration of the E-RAB even if the UE-associated logical S1-connection is released or moved using S1 handover.\n\nThe purpose of the Cause IE is to indicate the reason for a particular event for the S1AP protocol.\n\nThe meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, “not supported” cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, “not available” cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the RRC Establishment Cause IE is to indicate to the MME the reason for RRC Connection Establishment or RRC Connection Resume as received from the UE in the EstablishmentCause IE, EstablishmentCause-NB IE or ResumeCause IE as defined in TS 36.331 [16].\n\nDefines parameters related to a trace activation.\n\nVoid.\nThe Target ID IE identifies the target for the handover. The target ID may be, e.g., the target Global eNB-ID (for intra SAE/LTE), the RNC-ID (for SAE/LTE-UMTS handover) or the Cell Global ID of the handover target (in case of SAE/LTE to GERAN A/Gb mode handover).\n\nThe Source eNB to target eNB Transparent Container IE is an information element that is produced by the source eNB and is transmitted to the target eNB. For inter-system handovers to E-UTRAN, the IE is transmitted from the external handover source to the target eNB.\nThis IE is transparent to the EPC.\n\n\n\nThe Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container IE is an information element that is produced by the target eNB and is transmitted to the source eNB. For inter-system handovers to E-UTRAN, the IE is transmitted from the target eNB to the external relocation source.\nThis IE is transparent to EPC.\n\n\nThis IE is used to transparently pass radio related information between the handover source and the handover target through the EPC. This container is used for inter 3GPP RAT handovers from SAE/LTE to UTRAN.\nThis IE defined in TS 25.413 [19].\nThis container is used to transparently pass radio related information between the handover target and the handover source through the EPC.

X.681 [6].\nThe ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of S1AP messages. S1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a S1AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:\n-\tIEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.\n-\tObject set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value \"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.\nNOTE:\tIn the above “IE” means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.\nIf a S1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.\nSubclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of S1AP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.\n",

Thereafter the two APIDs are included in all messages over the UE-associated logical connection unless otherwise allowed by the specification. The “last ssage” is a ssage sent by a node in order to complete the termination of a given UE-associated logical connection, such that no other ssages for the sa connection are expected in either direction.\nIf a node receives a first message that includes a remote AP ID which is erroneous, e.g., an AP ID which has been stored previously for another UE-associated logical connection for the sa peer node, the receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of only the previously received AP ID from the peer node and an appropriate cause value. In this case, both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-associated logical connection having the erroneous AP ID as local or remote identifier.\nIf a node receives a first returned ssage that includes a remote AP ID which has been stored previously for another UE-associated logical connection for the sa peer node, or that includes an AP ID pair which is inconsistent (e.g., the local AP ID is unknown or already allocated to another UE-associated logical connection), the receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of the received AP IDs from the peer node and an appropriate cause value.

Depending on the particular scenario the behaviour of both involved RAN nodes may be either specified according to the same radio system or according to different radio systems. During an inter-system handover the source RAN node has to adopt to the target RAN node and its requirements. Therefore the container content is encoded according to the rules which are specified for the target radio system.\nIn S1AP, there is a single transparent container defined for transporting information from the source to the target RAN node and a single transparent container for transporting information from the target to the source RAN node during handover preparation: the Source to Target Transparent Container IE and the Target to Source Transparent Container IE, which may carry either NG-RAN, E-UTRAN, UTRAN or GERAN specific information.\nNOTE:\tThe definition of generic transparent containers for handover purposes allows to transport them through the core network in a RAT-agnostic way.\nIn subclause 8.4.1.2, it is described how the transparent container shall be encoded with respect to the scenario in which it is used.\nThe table below is showing all possible scenarios and definitions according to which the content of the transparent container shall be encoded. Additionally the reference to the specification defining particular IE is given.\nTable A.1. Specification of Transparent Containers referenced in S1AP.\n\nThis annex defines IEs used by the SON Transfer RIM application (TS 48.018 [18]).\n",
