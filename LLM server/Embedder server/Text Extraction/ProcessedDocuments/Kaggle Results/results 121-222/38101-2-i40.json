A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].\nAggregated Channel Bandwidth: The RF bandwidth in which a UE is configured to transmit and receive multiple contiguously aggregated carriers.\nBidirectional spectrum: UL/DL common spectrum in which the UE supports the configuration of uplink or downlink CCs.\nBeam correspondence: the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam for UL transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on UL beam sweeping.\nCarrier aggregation: Aggregation of two or more component carriers in order to support wider transmission bandwidths.\nCarrier aggregation band: A set of one or more operating bands across which multiple carriers are aggregated with a specific set of technical requirements.\nCarrier aggregation bandwidth class: A class defined by the aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration and maximum number of component carriers supported by a UE.\nCarrier aggregation configuration: A combination of CA operating band(s) and CA bandwidth class(es) supported by a UE.\nNOTE:\tCarriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or non-contiguous.\nCumulative aggregated channel bandwidth: The cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth is defined as the frequency band from the lowest edge of the lowest CC to the upper edge of the highest CC of all UL and DL configured CCs inside the bidirectional spectrum of the UE.\nEIRP(Link=Link angle, Meas=Link angle): measurement of the UE such that the link angle is aligned with the measurement angle. EIRP (indicator to be measured) can be replaced by EIS, Frequency, EVM, carrier Leakage, In-band eission and OBW.\nEIRP(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle): measurement of the EIRP of the UE such that the measurement angle is aligned with the beam peak direction within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty. EIRP (indicator to be measured) can be replaced by Frequency, EVM, carrier Leakage, In-band emission and OBW\nEIRP(Link=Spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link  angle): measurement of the EIRP spherical coverage of the UE such that the EIRP link and measurement angles are aligned with the directions along the spherical coverage grid within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty. Alternatively, the spherical coverage grid can be replaced by the beam peak search grid as the results from the Tx beam peak search can be re-used for spherical coverage.\nEIS (effective isotropic sensitivity): sensitivity for an isotropic directivity device equivalent to the sensitivity of the discussed device exposed to an incoming wave from a defined AoA\nEIS(Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle): measurement of the EIS of the UE such that the measurement angle is aligned with the RX beam peak direction within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty.\nNOTE 1:\tThe sensitivity is the minimum received power level at which specific requirement is met.\nNOTE 2:\tIsotropic directivity is equal in all directions (i.e. 0 dBi).\nEIS(Link=Spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link  angle): measurement of the EIS spherical coverage of the UE such that the EIS link and measurement angles are aligned with the directions along the spherical coverage grid within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty. Alternatively, the spherical coverage grid can be replaced by the Rx beam peak search grid as the results from the Rx beam peak search can be re-used for spherical coverage.\nFallback group: Group of carrier aggregation bandwidth classes for which it is mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to lower order CA bandwidth class configuration. It is not mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to lower order CA bandwidth class configuration that belong to a different fallback group.\nFWA UE: A UE intended to be used in fixed wireless access scenario.\nHandheld UE: A UE intended to be used in hand held scenario.\nIBM(Independent Beam Management): A UE that supports inter-band CA with IBM selects its DL and UL beam(s) for all CCs in each configured band based on DL reference signals measurements made in that band.\nInter-band carrier aggregation: Carrier aggregation of component carriers in different operating bands.\nNOTE:\tCarriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or non-contiguous.\nIntra-band contiguous carrier aggregation: Contiguous carriers aggregated in the same operating band.\nIntra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation: Non-contiguous carriers aggregated in the same operating band.\nLink angle: a DL-signal AoA from the view point of the UE, as described in Annex J. If the beam lock function is used to lock the UE beam(s), the link angle can become any arbitrary AoA once the beam lock has been activated.\nMeasurement angle: the angle of measurement of the desired metric from the view point of the UE, as described in Annex J\nradiated interface boundary: operating band specific radiated requirements reference point where the radiated requirements apply\nradiated requirements reference point: for the RF measurement setup, the radiated requirements reference point is located at the centre of the quiet zone. From the UE perspective the reference point is the input of the UE antenna array\nRedCap UE: The UE with reduced capabilities as defined in clause 4.2.21.1 from TS38.306 [14]\nRX beam peak direction: direction where the maximum total component of RSRP and thus best total component of EIS is found\nSub-block: This is one contiguous allocated block of spectrum for transmission and reception by the same UE. There may be multiple instances of sub-blocks within an RF bandwidth.\nTX beam peak direction: direction where the maximum total component of  EIRP is found\nTRP(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid): measurement of the TRP of the UE such that the measurement angles are aligned with the directions of the TRP grid points within an acceptable measurement uncertainty while the link angle is aligned with the TX beam peak direction\nNOTE:\tFor requirements based on EIRP/EIS, the radiated interface boundary is associated to the far-field region\nUE transmission bandwidth configuration: Set of resource blocks located within the UE channel bandwidth which may be used for transmitting or receiving by the UE.\nVehicular UE: A UE embedded in a vehicle\n",

The UE does not need to be aware of the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS allocates bandwidth to different UEs.\nThe placement of the UE channel bandwidth for each UE carrier is flexible but can only be completely within the BS channel bandwidth.\nThe relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guardband and the transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in Figure 5.3.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a detailed diagram of the channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth configuration for one NR channel, illustrating the various parameters that define the channel characteristics. The figure includes the channel bandwidth, which is the maximum frequency range over which the signal can propagate, and the transmission bandwidth, which is the minimum frequency range over which the signal can be transmitted. The figure also includes the channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth configuration for the 3GPP NR channel, which is a reference for the design of NR channels.

For each carrier aggregation configuration, requirements are specified for all aggregated channel bandwidths contained in a bandwidth combination set, UE can indicate support of several bandwidth combination sets per carrier aggregation configuration. The requirements are applicable only when Uplink CCs are configured within the frequency range between lower edge of lowest downlink component carrier and upper edge of highest downlink component carrier.\nFor intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation configuration is a single operating band supporting two or more sub-blocks, each supporting a carrier aggregation bandwidth class.

It illustrates the time-division multiplexing (TDM) scheme used in NR UL transmission, where the time slots are divided into multiple time intervals. This design allows for efficient use of spectrum resources and supports the transmission of multiple services simultaneously.

The mask is used to ensure that the system can continue to operate even when a power change is required or when 60kHz SCS is used. The figure shows the time slots in a row, with each slot corresponding to a specific time period when the system can continue to operate. The mask ensures that the system can continue to function even when a power change is required or when 60kHz SCS is used.\nFigure 6.3.3.6-3: Consecutive SRS time mask for the case when power change is required and when 60kHz SCS is used in FR2\nThe figure depicts a time mask for consecutive SRS (Synchronized Redundancy Scheduler) time slots in a 2.5G network, illustrating the required power change and the use of 120kHz SCS (Synchronized Code Switching) in the case of a power change.

The time masks apply for all types of frame structures and their allowed PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS transmissions unless otherwise stated.\nThe figure depicts a time mask for PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS, which is used to determine the timing of transmission and reception. The mask shows the timing of transmission and reception for each of the three paths, including the SRS. This is important for ensuring that the signal is transmitted at the correct time and that it is received correctly.\nFigure 6.3.3.7-1: PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS time mask when there is a transmission before or after or both before and after SRS\nWhen there is no transmission preceding SRS transmission or succeeding SRS transmission, then the same time mask applies as shown in Figure 6.3.3.7-1.\nThe transmit power time mask for consecutive slot or long subslot transmission and short subslot transmission boundaries defines the transient periods allowed between such transmissions.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of the transmission time mask used in 3GPP LTE networks.

The transmit modulation quality is specified in terms of:\n-\tError Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)\n-\tEVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process\n-\tCarrier leakage\n-\tIn-band emissions for the non-allocated RB\nAll the parameters defined in clause 6.4.2 are defined using the measurement methodology specified in Annex F.\nAll the requirements in 6.4.2 are defined as directional requirement. The requirements are verified in beam locked mode on beam peak direction, with parameter maxRank (as defined in TS 38.331 [13]) set to 1. The requirements are applicable to UL transmission from each configurable antenna port (as defined in TS 38.331 [13]) of UE, enabled one at a time.\nIn case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter txDirectCurrentLocation in UplinkTxDirectCurrentList IE (as defined in TS 38.331 [13]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause 6.4.2.2 and 6.4.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the calculation of transmit modulation quality.\nThe Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the error vector. Before calculating the EVM, the measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM.\nThe measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified in sub-clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.\nThe basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence for the PRACH and one slot for PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain. The EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval as as defined in clause 6.3.3.\nThe RMS average of the basic EVM measurements over 10 subframes for the average EVM case, and over 60 subframes for the reference signal EVM case, for the different modulation schemes shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.1-1 for the parameters defined in Table 6.4.2.1-2 or 6.4.2.1-3, depending on UE power class. For EVM evaluation purposes, all 13 PRACH preamble formats and all 5 PUCCH formats are considered to have the same EVM requirement as QPSK modulated.\nThe requirement is verified with the test metric of EVM (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).\nTable 6.4.2.1-1: Minimum requirements for error vector magnitude\n\nTable 6.4.2.1-2: Parameters for Error Vector Magnitude for power class 1 in FR2-1\n\nTable 6.4.2.1-2a: Parameters for Error Vector Magnitude for power class 1 in FR2-2\n\nTable 6.4.2.1-3: Parameters for Error Vector Magnitude for power class 2, 3, 4 and 7 in FR2-1\n\nTable 6.4.2.1-3a: Parameters for Error Vector Magnitude for power class 3 in FR2-2\n\nTable 6.4.2.1-3b: Parameters for Error Vector Magnitude for power class 2 in FR2-2\n\nTable 6.4.2.1-4: Parameters for Error Vector Magnitude for power class 5 in FR2-1\n\nCarrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform. The carrier leakage requirement is defined for each component carrier. The measurement interval is one slot in the time domain. The relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive sinusoid waveform to the power in the modulated waveform.\nThe requirement is verified with the test metric of Carrier Leakage (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).\nWhen carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum confined within the configured UL and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2.2-1 and Table 6.4.2.2.2-2 for power class 1 UEs.\nTable 6.4.2.2.2-1: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 1 in FR2-1\n\nTable 6.4.2.2.2-2: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 1 in FR2-2\n\nWhen carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum occupied by the configured UL CCs and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2.3-1 and Table 6.4.2.2.3-2 for power class 2.\nTable 6.4.2.2.3-1: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 2 in FR2-1\n\nTable 6.4.2.2.3-2: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 2 in FR2-2\n\nWhen carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum occupied by the configured UL CCs and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2.4-1 and Table 6.4.2.2.4-2 for power class 3 UEs.\nTable 6.4.2.2.4-1: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 3 in FR2-1\n\nTable 6.4.2.2.4-2: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 3 in FR2-2\n\nWhen carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum occupied by the configured UL CCs and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2.5-1 for power class 4.\nTable 6.4.2.2.5-1: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 4 in FR2-1\n\nWhen carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum occupied by the configured UL CCs and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2.6-1 for power class 5.\nTable 6.4.2.2.6-1: Minimum requirements for relative carrier leakage power for power class 5 in FR2-1\n\nFor power class 6, the carrier leakage requirement specified in clause 6.4.2.2.6 for power class 5 applies.\n\nWhen carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum occupied by the configured UL CCs and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power specified in subclause 6.4.2.2.4 applies.\n\nThe in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in a non–allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB. The IBE requirement does not apply if UE declares support for mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16, UL transmission is QPSK,MPRf,c = 0 and when NS_200 applies,  and the network configures the UE to operate with mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16.\nThe basic in-band emissions measurement interval is identical to that of the EVM test.\nThe requirement is verified with the test metric of In-band emission (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).\nThe average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3.2-1 for power class 1 UEs.\nTable 6.4.2.3.2-1: Requirements for in-band emissions for power class 1\n\nThe average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3.3-1 for power class 2.\nTable 6.4.2.3.3-1: Requirements for in-band emissions for power class 2\n\nTable 6.4.2.3.3-2: Void\n\nThe average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3.4-1 for power class 3 UEs.\nTable 6.4.2.3.4-1: Requirements for in-band emissions for power class 3\n\nThe average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3.5-1 for power class 4 UEs.\nTable 6.4.2.3.5-1: Requirements for in-band emissions for power class 4 in FR2-1\n\nThe average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3.6-1 for power class 5 UEs.\nTable 6.4.2.3.6-1: Requirements for in-band emissions for power class 5 in FR2-1\n\nFor power class 6, the in-band emissions requirement specified in clause 6.4.2.3.6 for power class 5 applies.\n\nThe average of the in-band emission specified in subclause 6.4.2.3.4 applies.\n\nThe EVM measurement process (as described in Annex F) entails generation of a zero-forcing equalizer. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple of the equalizer coefficients (dB) across the allocated uplink block. The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM.\nFor Pi/2 BPSK modulation, the minimum requirements are defined in Clause 6.4.2.5.\nThe peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained within the frequency range of the uplink allocation shall not exceed the maximum ripple specified in Table 6.4.2.4-1 for normal conditions. For uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the coefficients evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet the corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional requirements: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 (Table 6.4.2.4-1) must not be larger than 7 dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 8 dB (see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).\nThe requirement is verified with the test metric of EVM SF (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).\nTable 6.4.2.4-1: Minimum requirements for EVM equalizer spectrum flatness (normal conditions)\n\nTable 6.4.2.4-2: (Void)\n\nThe figure depicts the limits for EVM equalizer spectral flatness with the maximum allowed variation of the coefficients indicated under normal conditions. The figure shows the relationship between the maximum allowed variation of the coefficients and the spectral flatness, which is an important parameter in the design of EVM equalizers. The figure is a visual representation of the mathematical relationship, allowing engineers to understand the performance characteristics of the EVM equalizer under different conditions.\nFigure 6.4.2.4-1: The limits for EVM equalizer spectral flatness with the maximum allowed variation of the coefficients indicated under normal conditions\nThese requirements are defined for Pi/2 BPSK modulation. The EVM equalizer coefficients across the allocated uplink block shall be modified to fit inside the mask specified in Table 6.4.2.5-1 for normal conditions, prior to the calculation of EVM. The limiting mask shall be placed to minimize the change in equalizer coefficients in a sum of squares sense.\nTable 6.4.2.5-1: Mask for EVM equalizer coefficients for pi/2 BPSK (normal conditions)\n\nThe figure depicts the limits for EVM equalizer spectral flatness with the maximum allowed variation, F_center, which denotes the center frequency of the allocated block of PRBs. The figure illustrates the relationship between F_center and the maximum allowed variation, providing a visual representation of the spectral flatness of the equalizer.\nFigure 6.4.2.5-1: The limits for EVM equalizer spectral flatness with the maximum allowed variation. F_center denotes the center frequency of the allocated block of PRBs.\nThis requirement does not apply to other modulation types. The UE shall be allowed to employ spectral shaping for Pi/2 BPSK. The shaping filter shall be restricted so that the impulse response of the transmit chain shall meet\n│ãt(t,0)│ ≥ │ãt(t, τ)│    ∀τ ≠ 0\n20log10│ãt(t,τ)│< -15 dB    1< τ < M - 1,\nWhere:\n│ãt(t,τ)│=IDFT{│ãt(t,f)│ejφ (t,f)} ,\nf  is the frequency of the M allocated subcarriers,\nã(t,f) and φ(t,f) are the amplitude and phase response, respectively of the transmit chain\n0dB reference is defined as 20log10│ãt(t,0)│\nFor bands that UE indicates the support of DMRS bundling, when the UE is configured with DMRS bundling, the maximum allowable difference between the measured phase value in any slot p-1 and slot p shall satisfy the requirements as listed in Table 6.4.2.6-1 for the measurement conditions defined in Table 6.4.2.6-2, within a measurement time window limited by the UE capability of maximum duration for DMRS bundling [maxDurationDMRS-Bundling-r17], and defined for each frequency band separately. The phase value for each slot is measured as shown in Annex F.8. These requirements apply to PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions with DFT-s-OFDM and CP-OFDM waveforms.\nTable 6.4.2.6-1: Maximum allowable phase difference for DMRS bundling\n\nThe above requirements are applicable when all the following conditions are met within the measurement time window.\n-\tRB allocation in terms of length and frequency position does not change, and intra-slot and inter-slot frequency hopping is not activated.\n-\tModulation order does not change.\n-\tNo network commanded TA takes effect.\n-\tThe TPMI precoder does not change.\n-\tThere is no change in UE EIRP level, and no change in the level of P-MPR applied by the UE.\n-\tUE is not scheduled with uplink transmission of other physical channel/signal in-between the PUSCH or PUCCH transmissions.\n-\tFor TDD, no downlink slot(s) or downlink symbol(s) or flexible symbol(s) with/without DL monitoring occasion configured in-between the PUSCH or PUCCH transmissions.\n-\tNo uplink beam switching occurs.\nTable 6.4.2.6-2: Measurement conditions for the maximum allowable phase difference\n\nNOTE: Phase continuity requirements for DMRS bundling is defined only within FR2-1 in this release of the specification.\n\n",

Spectral emission mask requirements do not apply at any frequency where IBE requirements of clause 6.4A.2.3 apply.\nThe requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction).\nFor intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (ΔfOOB) starting from the ± edge of the UL aggregated channel bandwidth (Table 5.3A.4-1). For any bandwidth class defined in Table 5.3A.4-1, the UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5A.2.1.1-1.\nTable 6.5A.2.1.1-1: General NR spectrum emission mask for intra-band contiguous CA in FR2-1 and FR2-2\n\nFor intra-band non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spectrum emission mask requirement is defined as a composite spectrum emissions mask. Composite spectrum emission mask applies to frequencies up to  ΔfOOB starting from the edge of each UL sub-block. Composite spectrum emission mask is defined as follows:\na)\tComposite spectrum emission mask is a combination of individual spectrum emissions masks defined for each sub-block. If for some frequency, spectrum emission masks from multiple sub-blocks overlap, the spectrum emission mask allowing the highest power spectral density applies for that frequency\nb)\tIn case a sub-block comprises of multiple component carriers, the spectrum emissions mask is defined in subclause 6.5A.2.1.1 or in case of a single component carrier, the sub-block spectrum emission mask is defined in subclause 6.5.2.1\nc)\tIf for some frequency the spectrum emission mask of one sub-block overlaps another sub-block, the emission mask does not apply for that frequency.\nd)\tIf carrier leakage or I/Q image lands inside the spectrum occupied by the configured UL and DL CCs, exception to the general spectrum emission mask limit applies. For carrier leakage the requirements specified in section 6.4A.2.2 shall apply. For I/Q image the requirements specified in section 6.4A.2.3 shall apply.\nFor inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands, and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the spectrum emission mask is specified in Table 6.5.2.1-1 for each CC separately while both CCs are active with non-zero UL RB allocation. If for some frequency spectrum emission masks of CCs overlap, then spectrum emission mask allowing higher power spectral density applies for that frequency. If for some frequency a CC spectrum emission mask overlaps with the channel bandwidth of another CC, then the emission mask does not apply for that frequency.\nIn case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC, the adjacent channel leakage ratio defined in subclause 6.5.2.3 applies. For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the carrier aggregation NR adjacent channel leakage power ratio (CA NRACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the UL aggregated channel bandwidth to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent UL aggregated channel bandwidth at spacing equal to the UL aggregated channel bandwidth. The assigned UL aggregated channel bandwidth power and adjacent UL aggregated channel bandwidth power are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-1. If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than -35 dBm then the CA NRACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-1.\nTable 6.5A.2.3.1-1: General requirements for contiguous UL CA NRACLR\n\nFor intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, adjacent channel leakage power ratio (CA NRACLR) is the ratio of the sum of the filtered mean powers centred on each sub-block bandwidth to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent sub-block frequency at nominal spacing equal to the sub-block bandwidth. The power in the configured UL CCs and power in the sub-block bandwidth adjacent to each sub-block of configured UL CCs are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-2. In case a sub-block consists of a single component carrier, the measurement bandwidths and adjacent frequency offset from subclause 6.5.2.3 shall be used. If the measured adjacent sub-block power is greater than -35 dBm then the CA NRACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-2.\nNo requirement applies in the gap between neighbouring sub-blocks if the frequency span between the lowest edge of the upper sub-block and the highest edge of the lower sub-block is smaller than the bandwidth of either sub-block.\nTable 6.5A.2.3.1-2: General requirements for NC UL CA NRACLR\n\nFor inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands, and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NRACLR) is applicable for each CC while both CCs are active with non-zero UL RB allocation and the requirement is specified in clause 6.5.2.3.\n\n",

The probability (see Annex L) is defined as the spatial average over the full sphere around the UE of the probability of any one direction to support 2 AoA reception. In the applicable test system (see Annex L), the probability of any one direction of the UE to support 2 AoA reception for any specific AoA separation is the ratio of the number of unique AoA pairs that include that direction and can support 2 AoA reception to the total number of verified unique AoA pairs that include that direction.\nThe requirement applies only for the UE’s declared orientation in the positioner of the test system. The requirement for each AoA separation condition applies only for the UE’s declared orientation in the positioner of the test system for that AoA separation. The minimum required overall probability to support 2 AoA reception for power class 3 UEs for any channel bandwidth is specified by AoA separation in table 7.3K.3-1.
