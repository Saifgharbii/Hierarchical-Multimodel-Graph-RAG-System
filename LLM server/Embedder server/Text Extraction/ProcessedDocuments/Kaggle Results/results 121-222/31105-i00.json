Updating of certain EFs \"over the air\" could result in unpredictable behaviour of the UE; these are marked \"Caution\" in the table below. Certain EFs are marked \"No\"; under no circumstances should \"over the air\" changes of these EFs be considered.\nTable A-1: File change advised\n\n\n\nIf EFs have an unassigned value, it may not be clear from the main text what this value should be. This annex suggests values in these cases.\nTable B-1: Suggested content\n\n\nThis annex lists SFI values assigned in the present document.\n",
