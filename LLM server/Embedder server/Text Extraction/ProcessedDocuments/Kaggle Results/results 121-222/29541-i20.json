The figure illustrates the various components involved in the service, such as the status server, status monitor, and status controller, as well as the communication paths and signaling protocols used. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing management in ensuring efficient and reliable service delivery.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1: Status Notify Service Operation\n1.\tThe NEF shall send a POST request towards the Notification URI received in the Create service operation request (See clause 5.2.2.2).

Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and network elements such as base stations (BSs), mobile stations (MSs), and network elements (NEs). The figure highlights the importance of network management and the role of the network operator in ensuring the smooth operation of the network.\nFigure 5.2.2.5.1-1: Update Service Operation\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the URI of \"update\" custom operation on an Individual SM Context resource, with a \"SmContextUpdateData\" object in request body containing the attributes to be updated, e.g.:\n-\tURI of the resource to receive downlink data delivery for NIDD;\n-\tNotification URI to receive the SM Context notifications;\n-\tmodified configuration parameters, e.g. serving PLMN rate control, small data rate control, etc.\nNOTE:\tIf both the NEF and the NF service consumer (i.e. the SMF) supports \"BIUMR\" feature, the SMF can include the updated binding indication(s) for multiple PDU session resources (for NIDD downlink data delivery) and/or notification URIs (for SM Context notifications), as specified in clauses 6.12.1 and 5.2.3.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.3.4.3.2-2 shall be returned, the response body should contain a ProblemDetails object with \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.4.3.2-2.\nThe Deliver service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. a SMF, to transport Mobile Originated data packet via NEF.\nThe NF Service Consumer (e.g. the SMF) shall deliver Mobile Originate data via NEF by invoking the \"deliver\" custom operation of the Individual SM Context resource as shown in Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1.\nThe figure depicts the delivery service operation of a telecommunications network, illustrating the various stages and components involved in the delivery of services.
