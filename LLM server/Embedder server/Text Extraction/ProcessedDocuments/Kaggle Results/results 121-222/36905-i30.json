The number of test points should be realistic.\nTable 4.1.1-1: NS value specific test points for A-MPR\n\nThe analyses for UE category M1 and category M2 are performed per NS-value in table 4.1.1-2 for category M1, table 4.1.1-2a for category M1 with subPRB allocation and in table 4.1.1-3 for category M2. The general principles for selection of test points are:\n-\tFor Additional spurious emissions, requirements are the same for all bandwidths. Since channel bandwidth is not judged to have any impact on the UE transmit signal for category M1, only one bandwidth needs to be tested. The lowest bandwidth with emissions requirement has lowest guard band and is therefore the most stringent. For category M2 the same applies, with the exception that channel bandwidth 5 MHz is always additionally selected, even if this is not the smallest bandwidth. Because maximum RB allocation of 24 resource blocks requires at least 5 MHz channel bandwidth.\n-\tFor NS-values with Additional SEM requirement and without any allowed A-MPR, same test points as in SEM test case 6.6.2.1EA for category M1 and same test points as in SEM test case 6.6.2.1EC for category M2 can be used.\n-\tFor NS-values with Additional Spurious requirement and without any allowed A-MPR, same test points as in spurious test case 6.6.3EA.1 for category M1 and same test points as in spurious test case 6.6.3EC.1 for category M2 can be used\n-\tFor Additional SEM, test frequency is selected as in SEM test case.\n-\tFor Additional spurious emissions, test frequency selection depends on if protected range is above or below the UE transmit signal in frequency. If protected range is above UE transmit frequency, then High frequency range is selected. If protected range is below UE transmit frequency, then Low frequency range is selected.\nTable 4.1.1-2: NS value specific test points for A-MPR UE category M1\n\nTable 4.1.1-2a: NS value specific test points for A-MPR UE category M1, subPRB allocation\n\nTable 4.1.1-3: NS value specific test points for A-MPR UE category M2\n\nTable 4.1.1-3a: NS value specific test points for A-MPR UE category M2, subPRB allocation\n\n",
