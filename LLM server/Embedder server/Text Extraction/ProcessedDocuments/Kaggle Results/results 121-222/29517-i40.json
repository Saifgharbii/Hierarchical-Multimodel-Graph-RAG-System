The service is designed to handle event exposure, which is a critical aspect of network security. The architecture includes a set of services, such as the Naf_EventExposure_Service, that are responsible for handling event exposure. These services are designed to ensure the security of the network by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. The architecture also includes a set of components, such as the Naf_EventExposure_Service_Controller, that are responsible for managing the service and ensuring its proper functioning. Overall, the Naf_EventExposure service architecture is designed to provide a secure and efficient way to handle event exposure in the network.\nFigure 4.1.2-1: Naf_EventExposure service Architecture, SBI representation\nThe figure depicts the architecture of the Naf_EventExposure service, illustrating the reference point representation used in the service. The service is designed to handle event exposure, ensuring that the reference point is accurately represented in the event data.

\"{apiRoot}/naf-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".\nThe \"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data type content shall contain the representation of the created \"Individual Application Event Subscription\".\nWhen the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the AF, it represents AF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time received in the request.\nWhen the \"immRep\" attribute is included and sets to \"true\" in the subscription and the subscribed events are available, the AF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response.\nWhen the sampling ratio as, \"sampRatio\" attribute, is included in the subscription without a \"partitionCriteria\" attribute, the AF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs. If the \"partitionCriteria\" attribute is additionally included, then the AF shall first partition the UEs according to the value of the \"partitionCriteria\" attribute and then select a random subset of UEs from each partition according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected subsets of UEs.\nWhen the group reporting guard time as the \"grpRepTime\" attribute is included in the subscription, the AF shall accumulate all the event reports for the target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires.

When a muting exception occurs, the AF may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute (if provided) and/or local configuration to determine its actions.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the AF accepts the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the AF does not accept the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".\nFigure 4.2.2.3-1 illustrates the modification of an existing subscription.\nThe figure depicts a modification of an existing subscription, showing how a user can modify their subscription plan to include additional services or features. The figure includes a graphical representation of the subscription plan, with different options for the user to choose from. The user can select the desired plan, and the system will automatically update the subscription plan to reflect the selected options. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different options available for their subscription plan.\nFigure 4.2.2.3-1: Modification of an existing subscription\nTo modify an existing subscription to event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/naf-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as request URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.3-1, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the subscription correlation ID of the existing subscription.

Then, the AF shall notify the NF service consumer using the Naf_EventExposure_Notify service operation, as described in clause 4.2.4.2.\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included, and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the AF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, the AF may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute (if provided) and/or local configuration to determine its actions; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to \"RETRIEVAL\" in the request, the AF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, and mute the event notification again and store available events; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the AF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the AF accepts the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the AF does not accept the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".\n",
