A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].\nCommon Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (C-TEID): Unambiguously identifies a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP-U protocol entity for a given UDP/IP endpoint. The sending end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the C-TEID value used in the TEID field and signals it to the destination Tunnel Endpoint using a control plane message.\nGTP-U Message: GTP-U (user plane) messages are either user plane messages or signalling messages. User plane messages are used to carry user data packets between GTP-U entities. Signalling messages are sent between network nodes for path management and tunnel management.GTP-U peer: node implementing at least one side of any of the GTP user plane based protocols. RNC, SGSN, GGSN, eNodeB, SGW, ePDG, gNB, N3IWF, UPF, PGW or TWAN or MME.\nGTP-U Tunnel: A GTP-U tunnel is identified in each node with a TEID, an IP address and a UDP port number. A GTP-U tunnel is necessary to enable forwarding packets between GTP-U entities.\nGTP-U Tunnel Endpoint: A GTP-U tunnel endpoint identifies a user plane context (e.g EPS bearer, PDU session or a RAB) for which a received GTP-U packet is intended. A given GTP-U tunnel endpoint may receive GTP-U packets from more than one source GTP-U peer (See clause 4.3.0).UDP/IP Path: Connection-less unidirectional or bidirectional path defined by two end-points. An IP address and a UDP port number define an end-point. A UDP/IP path carries GTP messages between network nodes related to one or more GTP tunnels.\nGTP-PDU: GTP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is a GTP-U message, which may be either a G-PDU or a signalling message.\nG-PDU: User data packet (T-PDU) plus GTP-U header, sent between GTP network nodes.\nSignalling Message: A GTP-U message (GTP-PDU that is not a G-PDU) sent between GTP network nodes. These may be Path Management messages or Tunnel Management messages.\nT-PDU: A user data packet, for example an IP datagram, sent between a UE and a network entity in an external packet data network. A T-PDU is the payload that is tunnelled in the GTP-U tunnel.\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID): Unambiguously identifies a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP-U protocol entity for a given UDP/IP endpoint. The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the TEID value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID values are exchanged between tunnel endpoints using control plane message.\nTrusted WLAN Access Network: see 3GPP TS 23.402 [23].\n",

This is optional at the SGSN for UTRAN access. The GTP-U protocol entity shall deliver to the user plane entity only in sequence T-PDUs and notify the sequence number associated to each of them. The notification of the sequence number is not necessary at the GGSN, but it is mandatory at the SGSN and RNC. The user plane entity shall provide a sequence number to the GTP-U layer together with T-PDUs to be transmitted in sequence. GTP-U protocol entities at the GGSN may optionally generate autonomously the sequence number, but should be able to use sequence numbers provided by the user plane entity. The sequence number is handled on a per GTP-U Tunnel (that is TEID) basis. During relocations and handovers, if a buffered packet is forwarded from the source to the target GTP-U protocol entity along with PDCP T-PDU extension headers, the source of the T-PDU may be considered different and may not relay the sequence numbers.\nWhen the sequence number is included in the GTP-U header, a user plane entity acting as a relay of T-PDUs between GTP-U protocol entities, or between PDCP (or SNDCP) protocol entities and GTP-U protocol entities, shall relay the sequence numbers between those entities as well. In this way it is possible to keep consistent values of sequence numbers from the GGSN to the UE (MS in GPRS) by relaying the sequence number across the CN GTP-U bearer, the Iu GTP-U bearer and the Radio bearer (via PDCP or SNDCP N-PDU numbers). This functionality is beneficial during SRNS relocation.\nFor GTP-U signalling messages having a response message defined for a request message, Sequence Number shall be a message number valid for a path. Within a given set of continuous Sequence Numbers from 0 to 65535, a given Sequence Number shall, if used, unambiguously define a GTP-U signalling request message sent on the path (see clause Reliable delivery of signalling messages). The Sequence Number in a signalling response message shall be copied from the signalling request message that the GTP-U entity is replying to. For GTP-U messages not having a defined response message for a request message, i.e. for messages Supported Extension Headers Notification and Error Indication, the Sequence Number shall be ignored by the receiver.\n",

                    "text_content": "The GTP-U header is a variable length header whose minimum length is 8 bytes. There are three flags that are used to signal the presence of additional optional fields: the PN flag, the S flag and the E flag. The PN flag is used to signal the presence of N-PDU Numbers. The S flag is used to signal the presence of the GTP Sequence Number field. The E flag is used to signal the presence of the Extension Header field, used to enable future extensions of the GTP header defined in this document, without the need to use another version number. If and only if one or more of these three flags are set, the fields Sequence Number, N-PDU and Extension Header shall be present. The sender shall set all the bits of the unused fields to zero. The receiver shall not evaluate the unused fields. For example, if only the E flag is set to 1, then the N-PDU Number and Sequence Number fields shall also be present, but will not have meaningful values and shall not be evaluated.\nAlways present fields:\n-\tVersion field: This field is used to determine the version of the GTP-U protocol. The version number shall be set to '1'.\n-\tProtocol Type (PT): This bit is used as a protocol discriminator between GTP (when PT is '1') and GTP' (when PT is '0'). GTP is described in this document and the GTP' protocol in 3GPP TS 32.295 [8]. Note that the interpretation of the header fields may be different in GTP' than in GTP.\n-\tExtension Header flag (E): This flag indicates the presence of a meaningful value of the Next Extension Header field. When it is set to '0', the Next Extension Header field either is not present or, if present, shall not be interpreted. When it is set to '1', the Next Extension Header field is present, and shall be interpreted, as described below in this clause.\n-\tSequence number flag (S): This flag indicates the presence of a meaningful value of the Sequence Number field. When it is set to '0', the Sequence Number field either is not present or, if present, shall not be interpreted. When it is set to '1', the Sequence Number field is present, and shall be interpreted, as described below in this clause.\nFor the Echo Request, Echo Response, Error Indication and Supported Extension Headers Notification messages, the S flag shall be set to '1'. Since the use of Sequence Numbers is optional for G-PDUs, the PGW, SGW, ePDG, eNodeB and TWAN should set the flag to '0'. However, when a G-PDU (T-PDU+header) is being relayed by the Indirect Data Forwarding for Inter RAT HO procedure, then if the received G-PDU has the S flag set to '1', then the relaying entity shall set S flag to '1' and forward the G-PDU (T-PDU+header). In an End marker and Tunnel Status messages the S flag shall be set to '0'.\n-\tN-PDU Number flag (PN): This flag indicates the presence of a meaningful value of the N-PDU Number field. When it is set to '0', the N-PDU Number field either is not present, or, if present, shall not be interpreted. When it is set to '1', the N-PDU Number field is present, and shall be interpreted, as described below in this clause.\n-\tMessage Type: This field indicates the type of GTP-U message.\n-\tLength: This field indicates the length in octets of the payload, i.e. the rest of the packet following the mandatory part of the GTP header (that is the first 8 octets). The Sequence Number, the N-PDU Number or any Extension headers shall be considered to be part of the payload, i.e. included in the length count.\n-\tTunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID): This field unambiguously identifies a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP-U protocol entity. The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the TEID value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID value shall be assigned in a non-predictable manner for PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b interfaces (see 3GPP TS 33.250 [32]). The TEID shall be used by the receiving entity to find the PDP context, except for the following cases:\n-\tThe Echo Request/Response and Supported Extension Headers notification messages, where the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier shall be set to all zeroes.\n-\tThe Error Indication message where the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier shall be set to all zeros.\n-\tWhen setting up a GTP-U tunnel, the GTP-U entity shall not assign the value 'all zeros' to its own TEID. However, for backward compatibility, if a GTP-U entity receives (via respective control plane message) a peer's TEID that is set to the value 'all zeros', the GTP-U entity shall accept this value as valid and send the subsequent G-PDU with the TEID field in the header set to the value 'all zeros'.\n\nOptional fields:\n-\tSequence Number: If Sequence Number field is used for G-PDUs (T-PDUs+headers), an increasing sequence number for T-PDUs is transmitted via GTP-U tunnels, when transmission order must be preserved. For Supported Extension Headers Notification and Error Indication messages, the Sequence Number shall be ignored by the receiver, even though the S flag is set to '1'.\n-\tN-PDU Number: This field is used at the Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure and some inter-system handover procedures (e.g. between 2G and 3G radio access networks). This field is used to co-ordinate the data transmission for acknowledged mode of communication between the MS and the SGSN. The exact meaning of this field depends upon the scenario. (For example, for GSM/GPRS to GSM/GPRS, the SNDCP N-PDU number is present in this field).\n-\tNext Extension Header Type: This field defines the type of Extension Header that follows this field in the GTP-PDU.\n\n\nNOTE 0:\t(*) This bit is a spare bit. It shall be sent as '0'. The receiver shall not evaluate this bit.\nNOTE 1:\t1) This field shall only be evaluated when indicated by the S flag set to 1.\nNOTE 2:\t2) This field shall only be evaluated when indicated by the PN flag set to 1.\nNOTE 3:\t3) This field shall only be evaluated when indicated by the E flag set to 1.\nNOTE 4:\t4) This field shall be present if and only if any one or more of the S, PN and E flags are set.\n\nFigure 5.1-1: Outline of the GTP-U Header\n",

This can happen when the PGW does not have an accurate knowledge of the current RAT of the user e.g. after a handover from GERAN to (E)UTRAN.\nIt is 4 octets long and therefore the Length field has the value 1.\n\n\nNOTE:\tThe value of this field is 0 if no other Extension header follows.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.3-1: Service Class Indicator Extension Header\nIf the bit 8 of octet 2 is set to 0, this indicates an operator specific Service Class Indicator value is included. Otherwise, it shall indicate that a standardised SCI is included.\nNOTE 2:\tNo standardized SCI value is defined in this release, it is intended to standardize SCIs in a future release.\nBits 8 to 1 of the octet 2 represent the binary coded value of the SCI, applications with similar Radio Resource Management treatment in GERAN shall be represented by the same value.\nThe octet 2 is coded as shown in Table 5.2.2.3-1.\nBits 8 to 1 of the octet 3 are spare bits and shall be set to zero.\nTable 5.2.2.3-1: Service Class Indicator\n\nThis extension header may be transmitted in a G-PDU over the X2 user plane interface between the eNBs.
