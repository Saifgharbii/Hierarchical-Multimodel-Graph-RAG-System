In general cells are combined along with AWGN, so the signal and noise seen by the UE may be determined by more than one cell.\nSince several cells may contribute towards the overall power applied to the UE, a number of test system uncertainties affect the signal and noise seen by the UE. The aim of the superposition method is to vary each controllable parameter of the test system separately, and to establish its effect on the critical parameters as seen by the UE receiver. The superposition principle then allows the effect of each test system uncertainty to be added, to calculate the overall effect.\nThe contributing test system uncertainties shall form a minimum set for the superposition principle to be applicable.\n",

The effect of each controllable parameter of the test system on the critical parameters as seen by the UE receiver shall therefore be established. As a consequence of the sensitivity scaling factors not necessarily being unity, the test system uncertainties cannot be directly applied as test tolerances to the critical parameters as seen by the UE.\nEXAMPLE:\tIn many of the tests described, the Ês / Iot is one of the critical parameters at the UE. Scaling factors are used to model the sensitivity of the Ês / Iot to each test system uncertainty. When the scaling factors have been determined, the superposition principle then allows the effect of each test system uncertainty to be added, to give the overall variability in the critical parameters as seen at the UE.\nThere are often constraints on several parameters at the UE. The aim of the sensitivity analysis, together with the acceptable test system uncertainties, is to ensure that the variability in each of these parameters is controlled within the limits necessary for the specification to apply. The test has then been conducted under valid conditions.\n",

In the RRM and UE radio transmission and reception conformance tests covered by the present document, the Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified range, with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.\nThe method given in the present document combines the acceptable uncertainties of the test system, to give the overall variability in the critical parameters as seen at the UE. Since the process does not add any new uncertainties, the method of combination should be chosen to maintain the same tolerance interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the contributing test system uncertainties.\nThe basic principle for combining uncertainties is in accordance with ETR 273-1-2 [4]. In summary, the process requires 3 steps:\na)\tExpress the value of each contributing uncertainty as a one standard deviation figure, from knowledge of its numeric value and its distribution.\nb)\tCombine all the one standard deviation figures as root-sum-squares, to give the one standard deviation value for the combined uncertainty.\nc)\tExpand the combined uncertainty by a coverage factor, according to the tolerance interval required.\nProvided that the contributing uncertainties have already been obtained using this method, using a coverage factor of 2, further stages of combination can be achieved by performing step b) alone, since steps a) and c) simply divide by 2 and multiply by 2 respectively.\nThe root-sum-squares method is therefore used to maintain the same tolerance interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the contributing test system uncertainties. In some cases where correlation between contributing uncertainties has an adverse effect, the method is modified in accordance with clause 4.4.5 of the present document.\nIn each analysis, the uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated, and are added result root-sum-square unless otherwise stated.\nThe combination of uncertainties is performed using dB values for simplicity. It has been shown that using dB uncertainty values gives a slightly worse combined uncertainty result than using linear values for the uncertainties. The analysis method therefore errs on the safe side.\n",

In this example the UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint would be -5.45dB, as the gain is lower than in the Rx Beam peak direction. Variation about the midpoint is handled as a UE uncertainty.\n\nThe figure A.2.1.2-1 illustrates a variation within spherical coverage directions, Fine beams, which demonstrates the impact of variation on the performance of a wireless communication system. The figure shows how the variation in the coverage direction affects the performance of the system, with different beam patterns and their corresponding performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and energy efficiency.

Interference to Cell 1 comes from the applied AWGN, from the UE internal noise, and from Cell 2. The values are chosen for illustration, and not taken from any specific test case.\nCell 1 SSB Es/IotBB = 10Log10 ((Cell 1 SSB power) / (Applied AWGN power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power))\nWhere Applied AWGN power, UE internal noise, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in W, per subcarrier.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a scenario with AWGN and two intra-frequency cells. The figure illustrates the transmission of signals through a wireless network, with the base station (gNB) acting as the central node. The signal is transmitted through a series of optical fibers, which are connected to the gNB and distributed to the other nodes. The figure also includes a depiction of the signal path, showing how the signals are reflected off buildings and combined at the receiver. The figure is used to illustrate the concept of multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network, where signals are transmitted through different paths to reach the receiver.\nFigure A.2.4.2-1: Example Es/IotBB scenario, applied AWGN and two intra-frequency cells\n\nIn this case, the calculation gives Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB = 10Log10 (0.139 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = -0.67dB\nThe main point is that the Es/Iot at UE baseband is lower than the applied Es/Iot, because the UE internal noise adds to the interference, and can be a significant contribution for the parameters used in some test cases.\nThe presence of UE internal noise also affects the calculation of Es/Iot sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis. The UE internal noise is a fixed (worst) value, being based on the UE minimum requirement, and is taken into account in the scaling which uses linear powers:\n-\tCell 1 SSB Es/IotBB sensitivity to applied AWGN absolute power = UE internal noise /(Applied AWGN power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power).

In this example, (0.070 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = -0.429\nA positive sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity produces an increase in Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB, for example increasing Cell 1 Es/Noc. A negative sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity produces a decrease in Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB, for example increasing Cell 2 Es/Noc. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the uncertainties.\nWhere the uncertainties are uncorrelated, as here, they are added root-sum-square so the sign of the sensitivity factor does not have any effect. In special cases where the uncertainties are correlated, they may be added arithmetically and the sign affects the result, as in clause A.2.7.\n",

The values are chosen for illustration, and not taken from any specific test case.\nCell 1 SSB Es/IotBB = 10Log10 ((Cell 1 SSB power) / (UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power))\nWhere UE internal noise, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in W, per subcarrier.\nThe figure depicts an example of an Es/Iot BB (Base Station-to-Base Station) scenario, where two intra-frequency cells are present. The figure illustrates the communication paths between the base station and the two intra-frequency cells, highlighting the use of frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) techniques. The figure also shows the use of power control and frequency hopping to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure A.2.7.2-1: Example Es/IotBB scenario, two intra-frequency cells\n\nIn this case, the calculation gives Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB = 10Log10 (0.139 / (0.037 + 0.070)) = 1.14dB\nThe presence of UE internal noise also affects the calculation of Es/Iot sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis. The UE internal noise is a fixed (worst) value, being based on the UE minimum requirement, and is taken into account in the scaling which uses linear powers:\n-\tCell 1 SSB Es/IotBB sensitivity to Cell 1 Es = +1.000\n-\tCell 1 SSB Es/IotBB sensitivity to Cell 2 Es = -Cell 2 SSB power /(UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power). In this example, (0.070 / (0.037 + 0.070)) = -0.651\nA positive sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity produces an increase in Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB, for example increasing Cell 1 Es. A negative sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity produces a decrease in Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB, for example increasing Cell 2 Es. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the uncertainties.\nWhere the uncertainties are correlated, as here, they are added arithmetically and the sign affects the result. In this example, increasing Cell 1 Es increases the Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB, but the correlated increase in Cell 2 Es decreases the Cell 1 SSB Es/IotBB.

In a test case it is further restricted by downlink power level uncertainty or uplink power measurement uncertainty, which are both larger for radiated signals than for conducted signals.

The example path under investigation consists of four SPDT switches, one SP6T switch and one DPDT switch and microwave cable interconnects with PC2.4 mm connectors. The attenuation and reflectance of typical components suitable for frequencies ranging up to 43.5 GHz have been considered in the calculation of the mismatch uncertainty.\nFigure B1.1.4.4-3 shows a sample system setup for an EIRP/EIS test case with rather simple complexity of the switch box similar to a current sub 6GHz test setup. It should be noted that the switch unit is significantly less complex than a state-of-the-art switch unit currently used for conformance tests.\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of an EIRP/EIS test case, illustrating the components from the gNB to the antenna.

Typically, a single-polarized reference antenna with known gain is placed at the centre of the quiet zone and the total attenuation, L, between the reference antenna terminal and the feed antenna terminals is determined as part of the range reference calibration procedure.\nThe figure depicts a calibration setup for a 5G network, illustrating the various components involved in signal calibration. The setup includes a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and a set of calibration tools. The diagram highlights the importance of proper calibration to ensure accurate signal transmission and reception.\nFigure B.2.1.10-1: Calibration Setup\n\nSince the reference antenna is considered a single-polarized antenna, the XPD effect is negligible. Since the measurement probe is assumed to be a dual-linearly polarized antenna, leakage from one terminal/polarization to the other, i.e., XPD, needs to be considered.\nThe dual-linearly polarized measurement probe has two terminals corresponding to a set of orthogonal polarizations,  and  which match the orientations of the reference antenna. The most thorough calibration procedure would determine the path losses between the four different combinations of signal paths: , and , e.g., the power received by the measurement probe at the  polarization/terminal, PFeed,, is attenuated by L with respect to the power delivered to the reference antenna oriented in the  polarization and placed in the centre of quiet zone, PQZ,.\nThe most common calibration approach, however, is based on calibrating the polarization matched paths in Figure B.2.1.10-1 (thick solid lines), i.e.,  and . In this case, as illustrated in Figure B.2.1.10-2, the normalized pathlosses L and L are 1 and the pathlosses of the crossed components become the XPD terms of the measurement probe:\n(1.1)\nand\n(1.2)\nThe figure depicts a common calibration approach based on calibrating the polarization matched signal paths, which is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure B.2.1.10-2: Common calibration approach based on calibrating the polarization matched signal paths\n\nIn the remainder of this analysis, it is assumed that the leakage between the two polarization ports of the measurement probe is assumed to be the same, i.e., XPD = XPD = XPD and  =  = .\nThe normalized powers at the measurement probe terminals can then be written as\n(1.3)\n(1.4)\nThe normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre of the quiet zone is therefore\n(1.5)\nThis simple analysis shows that the XPD of the measurement probe introduces a small error of the total power measured by the measurement probe and that the conservation of measured powers is not guaranteed, i.e., the MU based on the XPD can be expressed as\n(1.6)\nThis XPD MU is tabulated for different levels of XPD in Table B.2.1.10-1.\nTable B.2.1.10-1: XPD MU for different XPD values\n\nWhen the range reference calibration is based on a full matrix-based approach, i.e., all signal paths are calibrated, the conservation of measured powers is guaranteed. As shown in Figure B.2.1.10-3, the polarization-matched signal paths take into account the leakage of power into the cross paths.\nThe figure depicts a calibration approach based on calibrating all signal paths, illustrating the importance of accurate signal measurements in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure B.2.1.10-3: Calibration approach based on calibrating all signal paths\n\nThe powers at the measurement probe can now be written as\n(1.7)\n(1.8)\nThe normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre of the quiet zone is then\n(1.9)\nThis simple analysis now shows that for a matrix-based calibration of all signal paths the XPD of the measurement probe no longer introduces any error and that the conservation of measured powers is guaranteed, i.e., the MU based on the XPD is 0dB.\nThe derivation of the XPD MU based on powers is a more straightforward and less complex approach than with electric fields as attempted in [2].

This uncertainty is considered to have a rectangular distribution so the standard uncertainty is calculated by dividing the uncertainty by √3.\nThe same equation applies to log periodic antennas with dm being 0.5 the length of the boom.\nFor a dipole antenna, given that the phase centre of the antenna is easily aligned with the centre of the set up the measurement uncertainty is zero.\nIf the calibration antenna (i.e. horn) is adjusted during the calibration to align the phase centre to the setup centre then this uncertainty term can be considered to be zero.\nAs an example a horn with a taper length of 50 mm, at 43.5 GHz and a measurement distance of 72.55 cm the uncertainty term is 0.62, with a rectangular distribution the standard uncertainty is 0.358 dB.\nFor DFF systems this uncertainty contribution must be included.\n",

Therefore to provide a feature of the spurious emission measurement by FR2 test system, the system has to equip a capability to switch corresponding measurement antennas in an anechoic chamber. One of the mechanical antenna switching methods can be a structure of a slider. Then a repeatability of a bending loss of a feeder cable which is connected to the measurement antennas shall be taken into account. On the other hand for electrical antenna switching, since multiple antennas need to be aligned in a chamber with a different position, the quiet zone characteristics might receive an influence by a displacement from the ideal focal point.

Coarse TRP measurement is introduced to reduce the measurement time by applying sparser grids and/or wider measurement BW than fine TRP measurement while having offset dB more stringent test requirement in order not to cause additional misjudgement risk. For the frequency ranges for which coarse TRP measurement does not PASS, the measurement is continued with fine TRP measurement procedure.\nTable B.25-1 summarizes the MU threshold for fine TRP measurements for General spurious emissions. The origin MU values for fine TRP measurement for different test setups can be found in following subclauses.\nTable B.25-1: MU threshold for TRP measurement for Rx spurious emission\n\nTable B.25-2 provides valid coarse TRP measurement grids and corresponding offset dB value that may be used for UE general spurious emission test case.  The offset value is derived as 95%-tile TRP measurement uncertainty including the effect from uncertainty due to Coarse TRP measurement grid, excluding influence of noise.\nTable B.25-2: Coarse TRP measurement grids and offset values for UE Rx spurious emission\n\n",

This EVM value is agreed across companies to align simulations, and is normally lower than the gNB EVM requirement, to represent “typical” conditions. The EVM used for simulations is therefore built in to the requirement points, normally specified as the SNR required to meet a specified throughput, with a defined modulation and Reference channel, under defined propagation conditions.\nFor a conformance test, the EVM defined for the simulations is taken as a maximum allowed value for the test system, as a worse gNB emulator EVM would make the signal harder to demodulate, and disadvantage the UE. In a test system the EVM cannot normally be set to a specific value, but is specified to be no higher than a defined value.\nFollowing this approach, the uncertainty from gNB emulator Downlink EVM is a one-sided distribution, with beneficial effect. Without treating the positive and negative uncertainties separately, and as it would not make the SNR worse, the effective uncertainty is 0dB.\n",

The calculation of noise level is described in clause 7.2.1.3 of TR 38.810 [13]. Under fading conditions the backoff is [17.71] dB instead of 13 dB when no fading applies.\nFFS\nBased on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine how high the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the maximum SNR is set by the test system power amplifier and the channel bandwidth to be tested.\nThe SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Indirect Far field (IFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and is based on the “IFF 100MHz ( n257, n258, n261)” tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.\nThe process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in the diagram.\nThe figure depicts a single band UE SNR range estimation for indirect far field (IFF) scenarios when no fading is applied. It shows the SNR range for different distances between the UE and the base station (BS), with the BS being located at a distance of 100 meters. The figure illustrates the impact of fading on the SNR, with the SNR decreasing as the distance between the UE and the BS increases. The figure is useful for understanding the performance of wireless communication systems in different scenarios, such as indoor and outdoor environments.\nFigure D.3.2.2-1: Estimation of single band UE SNR range for Indirect far field (IFF) when no fading applies\n\nThe test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.\nFor mode2 (noise free) scenarios, the expected SNR at the UE reference point is determined by the level of wanted signal power set by the TE above the UE REFSENS point.\nThe accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as ±5.19 dB.\nInclusion of this contribution directly reduces the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth.\nTo find the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a specific Channel BW, the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased until the value “Wanted signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW” is just below the “Available DL power at CW 1dB compression at QZ, dBm” value. For fading conditions, the “Backoff from P1dB” with a value of -11.08 dB valid for modulations up to 64 QAM has been applied. In the case without fading with added noise, the “Backoff from P1dB” is [-13] dB valid for modulations up to 64 QAM. The resulting values for SNRBB are given in Table D.3.2.2-1 for tests cases making use of fading, D.3.2.2-2 for test cases without fading with added Noise.\nSingle band UE values are obtained by setting the UE multi-band relaxation factor to 0 dB.\nTable D.3.2.2-1: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC3, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 64 QAM under fading conditions\n\nTable D.3.2.2-2: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC3, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 64 QAM when no fading conditions apply\n\nFor mode2 (noise free) scenarios, the maximum baseband SNR that can be achieved by a test system is calculated in the spreadsheet “Mode2 100MHz”. For other channel bandwidths the respective NRB and EISPC3, band are to be used.\nFor the “Backoff from P1dB” a value of -13dB has been applied which is valid for modulations up to 64QAM. The resulting values for SNRBB are given in D.3.2.2-3 for test cases without fading and without added noise.\nTable D.3.2.2-3: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC3, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 64 QAM when no fading conditions and no added noise apply\n\nNote that these are UE baseband SNR values (SNRBB), so the Reference point figures used in TS 38.101-4 [19] will be 1 dB higher.\nTable D.3.2.2-4: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC3, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 256 QAM under fading conditions for DEMOD scenarios\n\nTable D.3.2.2-5: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC1, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 256 QAM under fading conditions for DEMOD scenarios\n\nTable D.3.2.2-6: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC3, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 256 QAM under fading conditions for CSI scenarios\n\nTable D.3.2.2-7: Predicted SNRBB upper bound values for Indirect far field (IFF) with 30cm QZ, PC3, 100MHz CHBW, modulation up to 256 QAM with no fading conditions for CSI scenarios\n\nAn example of SNR calculation for IFF method is provided in “38.521-4 Spreadsheet - Demod SNR range calculator.zip” file attached to the TR.\n",

Simulations were run for 4*10^8 samples.\nIn figure D.4-1, Hx denotes the actual RAN4 signal per Rx after fading is applied. The value in dB against each legend correspond to the computed PAPR for that signal and faded signal\nThe figure depicts the CCDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) of Test2-6 signal power and signal power after fading, illustrating the signal's behavior over time. The figure shows the signal's power distribution, which is crucial for understanding the signal's characteristics and its impact on the system.\nFigure D.4-1: CCDF of Test2-6 signal power and signal power after fading\n\nConsidering the max PAPR value of the faded signal allowed some more test points to be testable. In order to make more test points testable, higher probability of saturation of faded signal needed to be considered.\nIn order to determine how much faded signal clipping probability did not adversely impact the UE’s capability to successfully decode the PDSCH signal, simulations were run for most of the 64QAM and 256QAM test points defined in TS 38.521-4.\nTwo companies participated in providing the simulation results. Below tables and figures capture the simulation results from the 2 companies that was used to determine the faded signal clipping probability to be used for the “backoff from P1 dB” term.\n\nTable D.4-1: Faded signal PAPR at different clipping probability for all test points defined in TS 38.521-4 (Company 1)\n\nTable D.4-2: Throughput values for key test points at different faded signal clipping probabilities (Company 1)\n\nTable D.4-3: Faded signal PAPR at different clipping probability for 256QAM test 1-4 (Company 2)\n\nThe figure depicts the relationship between throughput and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for a 64QAM test at different faded signal clipping probabilities for a company 2. The figure illustrates the impact of fading on the signal quality, with different clipping probabilities leading to different levels of signal degradation. The SNR is a key metric for evaluating the quality of a signal, and the figure provides a visual representation of how it changes with fading.\nFigure D.4-2: Throughput vs SNR for 64QAM test 2-6 at different faded signal clipping probabilities (Company 2)\n\nThe figure depicts the relationship between throughput and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for a 256QAM test at different faded signal clipping probabilities for Company 2. The test involves a 256-QAM signal with fading, and the SNR is measured at different clipping probabilities. The figure provides insights into the impact of fading on the performance of the 256QAM signal, allowing for better understanding of the system's robustness to fading conditions.\nFigure D.4-3: Throughput vs SNR for 256QAM test at different faded signal clipping probabilities (Company 2)\n\nBased on the above simulation results,\nFor 64QAM scenarios (both Demod and CSI), fading backoff margin of 11.08 dB corresponding to the 1e-3 faded signal clipping probability was considered.\nFor 256QAM Demod, fading backoff margin of 12.62 dB corresponding to 1e-3 fading signal clipping probability was considered.\nFor 256QAM CSI scenarios, fading backoff margin of 15.36 dB corresponding to 1e-4 fading signal clipping probability was considered.\nThis annex contains suggested uncertainties for each test case or MU quantity in TS 38.533 [10].\n",
