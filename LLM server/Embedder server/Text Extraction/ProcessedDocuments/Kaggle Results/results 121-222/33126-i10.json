Which CSP services are subject to Lawful Interception is defined by national regulations.\nThe presence of a requirement in the present document does not in itself imply or mandate that a 3GPP operator has an obligation to implement any network service capability, which is not otherwise required to meet LI obligation compliance in relation to specific regulated services, offered by that 3GPP operator. Only those specific requirements and sub-clauses of the present document which are applicable to specific network and/or service capabilities implemented in a 3GPP operator's network will be considered in scope for that operator. In all cases, laws and regulations define which requirements are applicable to 3GPP operators in each country relative to the services offered by each 3GPP operator.\nAs such not all requirements in the present document will apply in all national jurisdictions or to all 3GPP operator deployments (e.g. if an operator does not offer voice services, then voice LI requirement in the present document do not apply).\nThe interception system defined in the present document provides LI based on specific target identifiers.\n",

                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].\nactivation/deactivation: The large time scale action (i.e. on the same order as subscription lifetimes, that encompass multiple sessions, e.g. subscribing to “call hold” service) that turns on/off a service or feature for a user so that it is ready to act or will no longer be available to act. In the case of lawful interception, this may apply to all or a particular subset of communications. (See also Invocation).\nArtificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence is typically considered to be a system that performs some form of reasoning, planning or object management, using knowledge as well as perceived information that, in the past, required human intervention. (Definition from ATIS-I-0000068, White Paper \"Evolution to an Artifical Intelligence Enabled Network\" [8]).\ncapture: The action taken by the CSP to separate and copy the communications associated with a target identifier.\nContent of Communication (CC): Information exchanged between two or more users of a communications service, excluding intercept related information. This includes information which may, as part of some communications service, be stored by one user for subsequent retrieval by another.\ncontext of communication: Information needed to recreate the state known in the CSP's network of the Target Communication. For example the direction of initiation on communication (to or from), direction of data flow (to or from), direction association with the identifiers to and from addresses), actions taken by the CSP on behalf of the target or identity translations.\nCommunication Service Provider (CSP): The entity that owns or operates the network that provides a service to a subscriber.\ndelivery: The action taken by the CSP to perform the necessary correlation and processing of communications associated with a target, and delivering the result to the LEA.\nde-provisioning: The action taken by the CSP, that may be in response to an interception termination request from the LEA, or automatically once the warrant period has expired, to remove from its network functions the information and reporting pertaining to the target.\ndetection: The action taken by the CSP to identify communications associated with a target identifier.\nedge interception: Interception performed in less secure locations that could be at customer's premises e.g. H(e)NB, ProSe relays.\ngroup identifier: A group identity provides a reference to a defined group of one or more users. The use of this group identity applies to all users in the group.\ninterception: The actions of Provisioning, Detection, Capture, Delivery, and De-Provisioning.\ninterception product: The Intercept Related Information (IRI) and/or Content of Communication (CC) generated as a result of isolating the target's communications or identities for the purpose of delivery to the requesting LEA.\nIntercept Related Information (IRI): Information or data associated with communication services involving the target identity, specifically communication associated information or data (e.g. unsuccessful communication attempts), service associated information or data, and location information.\ninvocation: The short, intra-session time scale action (i.e. the application of the hold feature in the middle of a call session) in which a service or feature is called to act. In the case of lawful interception, this may apply to all or a particular subset of communications. (See also Activation).\nLawful Access Location Services (LALS): A service provided by a CSP to an LEA in which action is performed by a CSP to obtain a target's location information by means of Location Services (LCS), and to provide that information to an LEA.\nLawful Interception (LI): Actions taken by the CSP that include: provisioning the target identity in the network to enable isolation of target communications (separating it from other users' communications), duplicating the communications for the purpose of sending the copy to the LEA, and handing over the Interception Product to the LEA that served the CSP with the warrant. An interception is associated with exactly one warrant.\nlawful interception identifiers: Target identifying details as defined in ETSI TS 103 280 [5].\nLI delivery latency: The time between isolation in the Point of Interception and delivery of the Product of Interception at the LEA at the agreed point of handover.\nlocation information: Information relating to the geographic/ physical or logical location of a target.\nMediation and Delivery Function (MDF): Functions that convert the CSP internal formats and protocols to the agreed formats and protocols for handover from the CSP to the LEA.\nparty role: The role of a user identifies whether the user was for example the initiating party or the addressed party or intermediate addressed party in a communication.\nproduction: The actions of Detection, Capture, and Delivery.\nprovisioning: The action taken by the CSP to insert into its network functions information that identifies the target and the specific communication services of interest to the LEA, sourced from the LEA provided warrant.\ntarget communication: All communications, communication attempts (successful or not), and network interactions that originate from, are directed to, are controlled by, or are associated with, the target's identifiers, equipment, facilities or services, including actions taken by the network on behalf of the target, that are available in the CSP's network.\ntarget identity: A network or service identity that uniquely identifies a target for interception from all other non-targets within one or more CSP services. One target may have one or several target identities. The target identity can be a long term subscription based identity, a short term network identity, a public identity or an internal (private) identity.\nthird party: A resource or entity which is not fully owned and fully controlled by the CSP.\nwarrant: The formal mechanism to require Lawful Interception from an LEA served to the CSP on a specific target. Depending on jurisdiction also known as: intercept request, intercept order, lawful order, court order or judicial order (in association with supporting legislation).\n",

The figure provides a visual representation of the various stages involved in the LIA process, highlighting the importance of proper detection and response strategies to mitigate the risk of cyber attacks.\nFigure 5.1: Generic Lawful Interception lifecycle\nAfter a LEA Warrant is delivered to the CSP, the interception is provisioned. In the ACTIVE state, the Lawful Interception system elements detect, capture and deliver Interception Product to the LEA (labelled \"production\" in Figure 5.1). These three production actions occur each time a targeted communication is identified, and therefore may happen many times during the lifecycle.\nDepending on requirements, once provisioned, the LI system can enter directly into the ACTIVE state, or enter into the INACTIVE state, in which it still requires a RESUME transition to enter the ACTIVE state. The \"production\" activities of detect, capture, and deliver from figure 5.1 happen only in the ACTIVE state. It is in this ACTIVE state only that Interception Product is delivered to the requesting LEA.\nA transition from INACTIVE to ACTIVE will resume the process from the detect action. Conversely, a transition from ACTIVE to INACTIVE will immediately suspend delivery to the LEA (i.e., if there are communications that have been detected or captured, they will be discarded and not delivered to the LEA).\nIf provisioning enters the INACTIVE state, the RESUME transition is the equivalent of a delayed start.\nSome jurisdictions may not support the INACTIVE state of the interception.  In such cases, the production actions start directly upon provisioning, and stop directly upon de-provisioning.\n",
