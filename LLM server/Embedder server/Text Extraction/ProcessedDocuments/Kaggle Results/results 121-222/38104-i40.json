TX OFF and TX IMD are mandatory requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as it represents the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.\nNOTE:\tDue to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious emissions and TX OFF level co-location is the most suitable method to show conformance.\nThe co-location reference antenna shall be a single column passive antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency range, polarization, as the composite antenna of the BS type 1-O and nominal 65° horizontal half-power beamwidth (suitable for 3-sector deployment) and is placed at a distance d from the edge of the BS type 1-O, as shown in figure 4.9-1.\nThe figure depicts a BS type 1-O enclosure and a co-location reference antenna, illustrating the design and layout of a typical 5G network. The BS type 1-O enclosure is a crucial component of the network, housing the base station (gNB) and supporting the signal propagation. The co-location reference antenna is an essential part of the network, providing a reference point for the signal to be reflected off and combined at the receiver. The figure also highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4.9-1: Illustration of BS type 1-O enclosure and co-location reference antenna\nEdge-to-edge separation d between the BS type 1-O and the co-location reference antenna shall be set to 0.1 m.\nThe BS type 1-O and the co-location reference antenna shall be aligned in a common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction, as shown in figure 4.9-1.\nThe co-location reference antenna and the BS type 1-O can have different width.\nThe vertical radiating regions of the co-location reference antenna and the BS type 1-O composite antenna shall be aligned.\nFor co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at the co-location reference antenna is different from the BS type 1-O, a co-location reference antenna suitable for the frequency stated in the requirement is assumed.\nOTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted interface of a co-location reference antenna, depending on the requirement this interface is either an input or an output. For BS type 1-O with dual polarization the co-location reference antenna has two conducted interfaces each representing one polarization.\n",

For some operating bands, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5th harmonic limit of the downlink operating band, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 [2].\nFor a multi-band connector, for each supported operating band together with ΔfOBUE around the band is excluded from the transmitter spurious emissions requirement.\nThe requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.\nThe requirements shall also apply if the BS supports NB-IoT operation in NR in-band.\nUnless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).\nThe basic limits of either table 6.6.5.2.1-1 (Category A limits) or table 6.6.5. 2.1-2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4.\nTable 6.6.5.2.1-1: General BS transmitter spurious emission limits in FR1, Category A\n\nTable 6.6.5.2.1-2: General BS transmitter spurious emission limits in FR1, Category B\n\nThis requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to prevent the receivers of the BSs being desensitised by emissions from a BS transmitter. It is measured at the transmit antenna connector for BS type 1-C or at the TAB connector for BS type 1-H for any type of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna connectors / TAB connectors.\nThe spurious emission basic limits are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1.\nTable 6.6.5.2.2-1: BS spurious emissions basic limits for protection of the BS receiver\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nThe spurious emission basic limits are provided in table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-1: BS spurious emissions basic limits for BS for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.5.2.3 -1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor NR Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 5:\tFor NR Band n29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for NR BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band. ΔfOBUE is defined in clause 6.6.1.\nThe spurious emission basic limit for this requirement is:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-2: BS spurious emissions basic limits for BS for co-existence with PHS\n\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-3: Void\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR BS operating in Band n50 and n75 within the 1432 – 1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and Band n76. The basic limit is specified in Table 6.6.5.2.3-4. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-4: Additional operating band unwanted emission basic limit for NR BS operating in Band n50 and n75 within 1432 – 1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and n76\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating in NR Band n50 and n75 within 1492-1517 MHz and in Band n74 within 1492-1518 MHz. The maximum level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies Ffilter with filter bandwidth according to Table 6.6.5.2.3-5, shall be defined according to the basic limits PEM,n50/n75,a nor PEM,n50/n75,b declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-5: Operating band n50, n74 and n75 declared emission above 1518 MHz\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band n13 and n14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-6: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR BS operating in Band n30. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-7: Additional NR BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n30\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n48 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-8: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n48\n\nNOTE 1:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\n\nNOTE 2:\tThe regional requirement, included in [12], is defined in terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.\nThe following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-9: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS for Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-10: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n41 and n90\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in 3.45-3.55 GHz in Band n77 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\n\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-11: Additional BS spurious emissions limits for Band n77\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\n\nThe following requirement shall apply to BS operating in Band n101 in CEPT countries. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-12: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n101\n\nThe following requirement shall apply to BS operating in Band n100 in CEPT countries. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-13: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n100\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to BS operating in Band n54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.5.2.3-14 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,n54,a, PEM,n54,b, PEM,n54,c, PEM,n54,d, PEM,n54,e and PEM,n54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-14: Declared Band n54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements is defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419.\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nThe basic limits are in table 6.6.5.2.4-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.2.4-1 shall apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.2.4-1: BS spurious emissions basic limits for BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.4-1 do not apply for the frequency range extending ΔfOBUE immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see table 5.2-1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [4].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.5.2.4-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nThe Tx spurious emissions for BS type 1-C for each antenna connector shall not exceed the basic limits specified in clause 6.6.5.2.\nFor Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over all antenna connectors for BS type 1-C shall not exceed the basic limits defined in clause 6.6.5.2.\nThe Tx spurious emissions requirements for BS type 1-H are that for each TAB connector TX min cell group and each applicable basic limit in clause 6.6.5.2, the power summation emissions at the TAB connectors of the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell group shall not exceed a limit specified as the basic limit + X, where X = 10log10(NTXU,countedpercell), unless stated differently in regional regulation.\nNOTE:\tConformance to the BS type 1-H spurious emission requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:\n1)   The sum of the emissions power measured on each TAB connector in the TAB connector TX min cell group shall be less than or equal to the limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.\nOr\n2)   The unwanted emissions power at each TAB connector shall be less than or equal to the BS type 1-H limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log10(n), where n is the number of TAB connectors in the TAB connector TX min cell group.\n",

For BS with Rx diversity, the Doppler shift time variation is the same for each antenna at each time instant.\nDoppler shift for all three scenarios is given by:\n(G.3.1)\nwhere  is the Doppler shift and  is the maximum Doppler frequency.\nFor Sceanrio 1 and Scenario 3, he cosine of angle  is given by:\n, \t(G.3.2)\n, \t(G.3.3)\n, \t(G.3.4)\n\nwhere  is the initial distance of the train from BS, and  is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters;  is the velocity of the train in m/s,  is time in seconds.\nFor Sceanrio 4, the cosine of angle  is given by:\n(G.3.5)\n(G.3.6)\n(G.3.7)\nwhere  is the initial distance of the train from BS, and  is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters;  is the velocity of the train in m/s;  is time in seconds.\nThe required input parameters are listed in table G.3-1 and G.3-2. The resulting time varying Doppler shift is shown in Figure G.3-1, G.3-2, G.3-3, G.3-4 and G.3-9 for 350km/h scenarios, and in Figure G.3-5, G.3-6, G.3-7 and G.3-8 for 500km/h scenarios. For 350km/h scenarios, the Doppler shift was derived such that it corresponds to a velocity of around 350km/h for band n1 for the 15kHz SCS, for band n77 for the 30kHz SCS, and for band n257 for the 120kHz SCS.

The figure provides a visual representation of the Doppler effect, which is a phenomenon that occurs when a signal is received at a frequency that is different from the original frequency.

This can be important for understanding the propagation of signals in different environments and for designing communication systems.\nFigure G.3-7: Doppler shift trajectory for scenario 1-NR500 (30 kHz SCS)\nThe figure depicts the Doppler shift trajectory for scenario 3-NR500 (30 kHz SCS), illustrating the effect of the carrier frequency on the received signal. The trajectory shows the path of the signal as it travels through the air, with the carrier frequency at 30 kHz and the SCS at 30 kHz. The figure provides a visual representation of the Doppler shift, which is a key concept in the study of wireless communication systems.\nFigure G.3-8: Doppler shift trajectory for scenario 3-NR500 (30 kHz SCS)\n\nThe figure depicts the Doppler shift trajectory for a scenario involving a 120 kHz SCS (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and a 100 dB SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) at 120 kHz. The figure illustrates the path of the signal as it travels through the system, highlighting the impact of the SCS on the signal quality.\nFigure G.3-9: Doppler shift trajectory for scenario 4-BI-NR350, FR2 (120 kHz SCS)\n\n",

The time difference between the reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (G.4-1). The timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (TA 31)1664Tc for 15kHz SCS, Δτ - (TA 31)1632Tc for 30kHz SCS and Δτ - (TA 31)168Tc for 120kHz SCS. The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving propagation conditions are shown in Table G.4-1.\nFigure G.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions in a 5G network, showing how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure G.4-1: Moving propagation conditions\n(G.4-1)\nTable G.4-1: Parameters for UL timing adjustment\n\nNOTE 1: Doppler shift is not taken into account in UL TA scenario Y and Z.\n\n\n\n",
