Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nOTA unwanted emissions for OTA AAS BS in single RAT E-UTRA operation and MSR operation using E-UTRA consist of an OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement.

Emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by OTA spurious emissions requirement.\nThe values of ΔfOBUE are defined for OTA AAS BS for E-UTRA, NR and UTRA FDD operating bands in Table 6.7.1-1.\nTable 6.7.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink operating band\n\nOTA unwanted emissions for OTA AAS BS in single UTRA operation and MSR operation using UTRA consist of OTA spectrum emission mask requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement.\nNOTE:\tFor definitions of conducted unwanted emissions requirements refer to clause 6.6 in TS 37.145-1 [9].\nThe unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the configurations supported by OTA AAS BS.

An alternative method to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 [38] the measurement methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the test facility.\n1)\tPlace the AAS BS at the positioner.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.\n3)\tThe measurement devices characteristics shall be:\n-\ta 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.\n-\tMeasurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515 MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4.0 MHz and (f_offsetmax - 500 kHz) shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth.\n-\tdetection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.2-1.\nAs a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\n4)\tFor single carrier operation, set the AAS BS to transmit according to the applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.12.2 at manufacturers declared rated carrier TRP (Prated,c,TRP).\nFor an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.\n5)\tFor UTRA FDD multi-band RIB or RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest Base Station RF Bandwidth or sub block edge.\n6)\tOrient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex F).\n7)\tSweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges with the specified measurement bandwidth.\n8)\tRepeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid needed for TRPEstimate (see Annex F).\n9)\tCalculate TRPEstimate using the measurements made in Step 7.\nIn addition, for multi-band RIB, the following steps shall apply:\n10)\tFor multi-band RIB and single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.\nThe measurement result shall not exceed the test requirements specified in Tables 6.7.4.5.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1-11 for the appropriate Prated,c,TRP, where\n-\tf is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the centre of the measurement filter;\n-\tf_offsetmax is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge as defined in clause 3.4.1 of TS 25.141 [10], whichever is the greater.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nInside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with Wgap < 2×ΔfOBUE for a multi-band RIB, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The minimum requirements for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in the tables below, where in this case:\n-\tf is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\n-\tf_offset is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge, whichever is the greater.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor a multi-band RIB, the operating band unwanted emission minimum requirements apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in another supported operating band.

For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5th harmonic limit of the downlink operating band, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 [16]. In some exceptional cases, requirements apply also closer than 10 MHz from the downlink operating band; these cases are highlighted in the requirement tables in respective referenced UTRA, E-UTRA, NR or MSR specifications. For operating bands supported by multi-band RIB each supported band including the ΔfOBUE around the band are excluded from the spurious emissions requirements.\nThe requirements apply for both single band RIBs and multi-band RIBs (except for frequencies at which exclusion bands or other multi-band provisions apply) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification. Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.\nFor operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in [17] is applicable, the emissions limits are the same regardless of the number of transceiver units so the limits are equivalent to those for a single transceiver unit as specified in the as the corresponding applicable non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement specified in TS 25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3], TS 36.104 [4], TS 37.104 [5] or TS 38.104 [33]. For E-UTRA and NR the limits will be 9dB lower and for UTRA FDD the limits will be 6dB lower, unless stated differently in regional regulation.\nThe AAS BS requirements for spurious emissions limits which are specified for Band 46 in TS 37.104 [5], are applicable for AAS BS.\nFor BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission limits that might be applicable in the spurious emissions frequency domain are specified in clause 6.7.5.5.4.6.\nThe OTA spurious emissions mandatory requirements include the CAT A, CAT B and additional minimum requirements for BC2, limits are specified as TRP per cell unless otherwise specified.\nFor AAS BS in MSR operation the minimum requirement is defined in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.7.6.2.1.\nFor AAS BS in single RAT UTRA operation the minimum requirement is defined in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.7.6.3.1.\nFor AAS BS in single RAT E-UTRA operation the minimum requirement is defined in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.7.6.4.1.\nThe test purpose is to verify the radiated spurious emissions from the AAS BS at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.\n6.7.6.2.4.1\tInitial conditions\nTest environment: normal, see annex G.2.\nRF channels to be tested for single carrier:\nB when testing from 30 MHz to FDL_low - ΔfOBUE\nT when testing from FDL_high + ΔfOBUE to 12.75 GHz (or to 5th harmonic)\nRF bandwidth positions to be tested: in single-band operation, see clause 4.12.1.\nBRFBW when testing from 30 MHz to FDL_low - ΔfOBUE\nTRFBW when testing from FDL_high + ΔfOBUE to 12.75 GHz (or 5th harmonic)\nRF bandwidth positions to be tested in multi-band operation, see clause 4.12.1.\nBRFBW_T'RFBW when testing from 30 MHz to FDL_Blow_low - ΔfOBUE\nB'RFBW_TRFBW when testing from FDL_Bhigh_high + ΔfOBUE to 12.75 GHz (or to 5th harmonic)\nBRFBW_T'RFBW and B'RFBW_TRFBW when testing from FDL_Blow_high + ΔfOBUE to FDL_Bhigh_low - ΔfOBUE\nDirections to be tested\nAs the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex F).\n6.7.6.2.4.2\tProcedure\nThe following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 [38] the measurement methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the test facility.\n1)\tPlace the AAS BS at the positioner.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.\n3)\tMeasurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the conditions in clause 6.7.6.2.5.\n4)\tThe measurement device characteristics shall be:\n-\tDetection mode: True RMS.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.2-1.\n5)\tSet the AAS BS to transmit\na)\tFor MSR:\n-\tSet the RIB to transmit maximum power according to the applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.11.\nb)\tFor UTRA:\n-\tFor a RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the RIB to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause 4.12.2, at the manufacturer's declared rated carrier TRP, Prated,c,TRP.\n-\tFor a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the set the RIB to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.\nc)\tFor E-UTRA:\n-\tRIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the RIB to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1 in clause 4.12.2, at manufacturer's declared rated carrier TRP, Prated,c,TRP.\n-\tFor a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation, set the set the RIB to transmit according to E-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test

The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.\nTable 6.8.5.2.1-1: Interfering and wanted signal frequency offset for OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement\n\nIn the frequency range relevant for this test, the transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission limits in clauses 6.7.6 (OTA spurious emission, except co-location spurious emission), 6.7.5 (OTA OBUE) and 6.7.3 (OTA ACLR) in the presence of an E-UTRA interfering signal according to according to table 6.8.5.3.1-1.\nThe requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or radio bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or radio bandwidth edges.\nFor RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.\nFor multi-band RIBs, the requirement applies relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each supported operating band. In case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the inter Base Station RF Bandwidth gap.\nTable 6.8.5.3.1-1: Interfering and wanted signals for the OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement\n\nTable 6.8.5.3.2-1: Void\n\n",

The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.\nFor multi-band RIBs, the intermodulation requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\nFor multi-band RIBs, the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables 7.8.5.3-3, 7.8.5.3-4 and 7.8.5.3-5. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.\nThe OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets ΔOTAREFSENS and ΔminSENS.\nTable 7.8.5.3-1: Intermodulation performance requirement\n\nTable 7.8.5.3-2: Interfering signal for Intermodulation performance requirement\n\nTable 7.8.5.3-3: Narrowband intermodulation performance requirement for Wide Area BS\n\nTable 7.8.5.3-4: Narrowband intermodulation performance requirement for Local Area BS\n\nTable 7.8.5.3-5: Narrowband intermodulation performance requirement for Medium Range BS\n\n",

The procedures for an accurate estimate can be applied to all TRP requirements. However, if a TRP requirement does not need accurate TRP estimate then the procedures for over-estimate of TRP may be used in order to have a reasonable OTA test time. Pre-scan does not provide an accurate TRP estimate or over-estimate of TRP. Pre-scan is a fast but coarse method that is used to identify the spurious emission frequencies with emission power as described in annex F.13. A sequential measurement is then made at the emission frequencies, to assess the TRP as described in annex F.2 to annex F.9.\nWhen making TRP measurements the alignment between EUT and measurement antenna is important to achieve expected measurement uncertainty;\n1.\tThe measurement antenna needs to be aligned tangential to the measurement surface forming a sphere around the EUT, in order to measure the TRP properly.\n2.\tTest methods described in clauses F.5.1, F.5.2, F.10, F.11 and F.12 require angular alignment between the selected measurement grid and EUT radiation pattern in order to measure peak values in the main beams. Angular misalignment can lead to differences in the actual and measured angular positions of the intended maximum EIRP.\n3.\tTest methods described in clause F.5.3, F.6 and F.9 are designed to be independent of rotations of the angular grid, and hence angular alignment between the measurement grid and EUT is not needed.\n",

Hence the system should be calibrated in all tested directions.\nNOTE.\tCurrently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing so a single calibration direction is sufficient.\nConformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δsample) or by measuring Pmax,c,EIRP, extreme directly.\nMeasure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.\n",

                    "text_content": "The AAS BS under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field chamber) anechoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for environmental conditioning. The RF conditionals inside the chamber are absorptive and capable of dissipating the power the AAS BS when radiating. A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field response is measured. For this method test components are exposed to the full temperature range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc. may change as a function of temperature.\nUsing the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near field) test range to obtain Pmax,c,EIRP.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for extreme conditions, specifically for EIRP accuracy using the difference method. It shows a set of equipment and tools necessary for accurately measuring the electric impedance of a transmission line, which is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient communication systems.\nFigure F.7.2-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy using difference method\nMeasurements from the test antenna/ probe are taken under nominal conditions and extreme conditions to calculate (Δsample). The difference between the nominal and extreme conditions (Δsample) is then used along with the nominal EIRP measurement (Pmax,c,EIRP) made in the appropriate far field or near field chamber and compared against the extreme requirement. As follows:\nPmax,c,EIRP, extreme = Pmax,c,EIRP + Δsample.\nMeasure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.\n\nAs the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (PUEM) for co-location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure relative noise change instead of absolute noise level. The relations between measured noise change 1, noise floor N0 and the relation to PUEM with respect to the noise floor denoted 2 is visualized in Figure H-1.\nFigure H-1 illustrates the relative noise measurement in a 5G network, showing the signal strength at various locations within the network. The figure demonstrates the impact of various factors on signal quality, such as the distance between the transmitter and receiver, the presence of obstacles, and the presence of other signals. The figure highlights the importance of noise suppression techniques to maintain high-quality communication in a 5G network.

The figure highlights the importance of noise suppression techniques to maintain high-quality communication in a 5G network.\nFigure H-1: Relative noise measurement\nThe absolute emission level in decibel scale is calculated as:\n, where N0 is the noise floor of the measurement receiver and 2 is plotted s function of 1 in Figure H-1. The absolute noise floor of the measurement receiver, including probe antenna, cables, filter and LNA is determined by a calibration procedure. The calibration will determine the absolute emission level (N0) accuracy of measuring out-of-band unwanted emission close to the thermal noise floor.\n\n\n\n",
