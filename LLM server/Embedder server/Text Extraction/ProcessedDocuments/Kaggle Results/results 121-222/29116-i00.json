If the service with given service resource identifier exists at the BM-SC, the BM-SC shall create the requested session for that service with default session property values described in clause 5.2.2.1. Upon successful creation of requested session, the BM-SC shall respond to the Content Provider with a 201 success message indicating that the session is successfully created along with the session resource identifier of the created session. The session resource identifier is the identifier that uniquely identifies the session within that service. When the Content Provider receives the session resource identifier, it shall use this identifier in subsequent requests to the BM-SC to refer to this session. If the creation of session failed, the BM-SC shall send a 403 message. If the service was not found for which the session creation is sought, the BM-SC shall send a 404 message.\nThe possible response messages from the BM-SC, depending on whether the POST request is successful or unsuccessful, are shown in Table 5.2.2.2.2-1.\nTable 5.2.2.2.2-1: Response status code, message, and contents for session creation\n\n5.2.2.2.3.0\tGeneral\nSessions created using the session creation methods described in clause 5.2.2.2.2 can be updated when the Content Provider wishes to modify the session properties.\n5.2.2.2.3.1\tPartial Modification of Session Properties\nPATCH /xmb/v1.0/services/{service-res-id}/sessions/{session-res-id}\nAssuming that a session has been created using the session creation method described in clause 5.2.2.2.2, partial updating of its properties can be performed by the Content Provider by using the HTTP PATCH method on the “session” instance resource as follows:\n-\tthe request URI with the \"path\" part is set to: /xmb/v1.0/services/{service-res-id}/sessions/{session-res-id}\n-\tthe Host field is set to the address of the BM-SC\n-\tthe Content-Type header field is set to \"application/json\"\n-\tthe body of the message is encoded in JSON format\nThe {service-res-id} in the request URI is the service resource identifier of the service whose session is being modified.\nThe {session-res-id} in the request URI is the session resource identifier of the session that is being modified.\nThe content body of the session update request shall contain updated partial representation of the session resource. The representation of the session is based on the JSON schema of session resource as described in clause 5.2.2.1. Furthermore, one or more properties of the session listed in table 5.2.2.1-1 with the exception that the session properties \"id\", \"session-state\", \"qoe-report-url\", \"delivery-session-description-parameters\" and \"push-url\" cannot be modified.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP PATCH request from the Content Provider to update a session, the BM-SC will check whether the Content Provider is authenticated and authorized to update sessions as described in clause 7. If the authorization fails, the BM-SC shall send a 401 message as described in table 5.2.2.2.3.1-1. If the authorization is successful, the BM-SC shall verify that the service already exists with the given service resource identifier, and a session already exists with the given session resource identifier. If both of them exist, BM-SC shall update the session as requested for that service. Upon successful update of the requested session, the BM-SC shall respond to the Content Provider with a 200 success message indicating that the session is successfully updated along with the updated session resource. As alternative to the 200 OK message, BM-SC may send a 204 No Content success message without any message content to the Content Provider. If the session cannot be updated, the BM-SC shall send a 403 message.

            "description": "This procedure example describes the xMB procedures for the delivery of a DASH Live service (see clause 11 of 3GPP TS 26.247 [18] for the specification of DASH Live services) , to a single broadcast area. A push interface like WebDAV is used here as the ingestion method for the user-plane data (xMB-U). The push interface is identified by a unique URI. The source of the user plane data (CP Source) are the DASH Media Segments as produced by a Live Encoder / Segmenter and the source pushes each new Segment when it becomes available. The Media Presentation Description (MPD) URL and Initialization Segment (IS) for the Live DASH session is provided to BM-SC during Session creation or in a subsequent update request to the BM-SC.\nThe figure depicts two procedures for a live DASH service, xMB-C and xMB-U, which are used to ensure the smooth operation of the service. The procedures involve the use of xMB-C and xMB-U protocols, which are designed to handle live DASH traffic efficiently. The figure illustrates the steps involved in each procedure, including the use of xMB-C and xMB-U protocols, and the use of xMB-C and xMB-U protocols, which are designed to handle live DASH traffic efficiently.\nFigure A.2-1: xMB-C and xMB-U Procedures for a Live DASH Service\n1:\t The operator and the Content Provider agree on a Service Level Agreement (SLA), which entitles the Content Provider to use the MBMS system (in accordance to some rules) for content delivery. For instance, the SLA can include day/time ranges, during which the Content Provider can distribute its content. The SLA can also include geographical areas in which the Content Provider is allowed to distribute its content. The SLA also includes target bitrates and likely definitions of tolerable losses per service.\n2:\t The BM-SC administrators (operator) apply the agreed ranges. This can imply the provisioning of additional Service Areas, and other system related configurations.\nThe following steps describe Content Provider provisioning of a single Live DASH session in a single broadcast area.\n3:\t The Content Provider authenticates itself as authorized user. The Content Provider can only see those configurations, sessions and services which belong to the Content Provider.\n4:\t The Content Provider creates a new Service. Optionally, the Content Provider may provide properties for the service like service class, service languages, service names, notification configuration as well as consumption reporting configuration. The Content Provider can select whether the Content Provider or the operator distributes service announcement by providing a list of Service Announcement Channel (SACH, as defined in Annex L.2 / L.3 of 3GPP TS 26.346 [3]) services used for operator-driven service announcement.\nNOTE 1:\t BM-SC derives the required UE capabilities from the provided service and session properties.\n5:\t Upon successful service creation by the BM-SC, the BM-SC will provide a unique id for the service resource which is expected to be used by the Content Provider for subsequent requests.\n6:\t The Content Provider retrieves the current service properties.

Optionally, the Content Provider may provide common session properties  such as maximum ingestion bitrate (excluding any FEC redundancy and transport overhead), scheduling information (start time, stop time), QoE Reporting configuration and session type (set to Application) as input. DASH specific session properties provided as input by the Content Providerinclude MIME-type of MPD fragment (here, set to application/dash+xml), Application Entry Point URL (here, the MPD URL), xMB-U ingest mode (push/pull), Unicast Delivery Indicator, etc.\nNOTE 2:\t BM-SC allocates the following parameters for the session description of the MBMS User Service: TMGI, FLUTE IP Multicast Address, UDP Port and TSI (see IETF RFC 3926 [19]).\nNOTE 3:\t BM-SC derives the SAI list for the MBMS Service Area from Geographical Area provided in Content Provider request and from PLMN id negotiated in step 1. FEC information (codec and ratio) and MBMS Bearer QoS (ARP, QCI) are also negotiated in step 1.\nNOTE 4:\t The Service Announcement start time can be provided in the request. If not, BM-SC is expected to start announcing the service as soon as all required service and session properties are provided by the Content Provider.\nNOTE 5:\t In the case of regionalized services, i.e. ones whose contents are region- specific, a session can be cloned so that all sessions of the user service share the same FLUTE parameters.\n9:\t A unique resource id of the session, which identifies the created session, is returned by the BM-SC to the Content Provider. Additionally, the push URL ( whereby the required xMB-U ingest mode is set to push) and QoE Report URL are added to the response.\n10:\t The Content Provider queries the session configurationby providing the resource ids of the session and service. The Content Provider needs the Push URL to configure the DASH segmenter. The BM-SC provides the information in the response, which includes all readable session properties.\n11:\t The Content Provider updates the session by providing the DASH MPD URL (Application Entry Point URL). The BM-SC sends a response with update status.\n12:\t Once all information for service announcement is available, and if service announcement start time has elapsed, the BM-SC starts announcing the service automatically. Service announcement is automatically updated following subsequent session updates.\nThe following steps pertain to the BM-SC activating automatically the MBMS Bearer at session start time. See 3GPP TS 26.346 [3] and 3GPP TS 29.061 [20] for further details.\n13:\t The BM-SC activates the MBMS bearer by providing the TMGI, the Flow ID, the MBMS Service Area (MSA), the GBR and other parameters to the MBMS-GW.\n14:\t When the Content Provider has configured a Notification URL for the service, the BM-SC delivers service/session related notification messages to the Content Provider.\n15:\t When the MBMS bearer is activated, the BM-SC will start forwarding the xMB-U user plane data (push interface here). Any xMB-U user plane data received before activation of the MBMS bearer can be discarded.\n16:\t At session stop time, the MBMS bearer is terminated.\n17:\t The BM-SC can notify the Content Provider about the termination of the MBMS Bearer.\nNOTE 6:\t The Content Provider terminates the service, when the service is not needed anymore.

Service continuity allows UEs to enter or leave the MBMS service areas while receiving a Live DASH service. UEs can switch to unicast as defined in clause 7.6 of 3GPP TS 26.346 [3] when leaving the MBMS service area.\nIn case of service continuity support, the system offers representations via unicast and via MBMS Bearers. A unified MPD (cf. clause 7.6 of 3GPP TS 26.346 [3]) contains the corresponding retrieval information. When service continuity is supported, the Content Provider provides MPD and Initialization Segments for both unicast and MBMS bearer access and also the associated Media Segments. The Content Handler functions forwards the content to a DASH (unicast) Server. The DASH (unicast) server can use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for unicast delivery.\nA push interface is used here as ingestion method for the xMB-U user-plane data. The source of the user plane data (Content Provider Source) are the DASH Media Segments as produced by a Live Encoder / Segmenter, which produces the content for unicast and MBMS bearer delivery. The Media Presentation Description and Initialization Segment for the Live DASH session are provided separately to the BM-SC.\nThe Service Announcement Function (SAF) of the BM-SC creates the needed metadata fragments for the MBMS User Service. To support service continuity, the SAF adds base pattern elements to the userServiceDescription element. The MBMS Client in the UE matches the base pattern against a portion of the entire request URL. The SAF creates unified MPD by adding information specific elements to it. The SAF makes the service announcement information available via unicast and via MBMS.\nA content handler function of the BM-SC handles the separation of unicast and MBMS bearer content. The content handler function makes the content available in operators CDN for unicast access.\n",

The fileSchedule element contains transmission timing information for each file by its file URL. Consequently, the file URLs must be present when creating service announcement information.\nThis example assumes that the BM-SC automatically fetches the file using a pull method (xMB-U mode) and prepares the transmission. File URLs can be provided in the session creation request or any subsequent session update request. When file preparation ends after the session start time, the file is automatically added to user plane flow. It is up to Content Provider to ensure that session scheduling is large enough to allow files preparation and transmission according to bitrate between BM-SC and file location, and bitrate of user plane.\n\nThe figure depicts two procedures for a file delivery service, xMB-C and xMB-U, which are used to manage file delivery in a network. The xMB-C procedure involves the use of a central file server, while the xMB-U procedure involves the use of a distributed file server. The figure illustrates the steps involved in each procedure, including the use of a file transfer protocol (FTP) and a file transfer protocol (FTP) for the central file server, and a file transfer protocol (FTP) and a file transfer protocol (FTP) for the distributed file server.
