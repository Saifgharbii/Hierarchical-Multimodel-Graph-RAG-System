The request contains the callbackReference URI as previously received in the SubscriptionData.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a subscription data change notification system, illustrating the various components and their interactions. The system includes a subscription data change notification (SDCN) server, a subscriber, and a network operator. The SDCN server processes the subscription data change notifications, while the subscriber receives and processes the notifications. The network operator manages the network and ensures the system's functionality. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the system's architecture and its components, making it easier to understand and interpret.\nFigure 5.3.2.5.2-1: Subscription Data Change Notification\n1.\tThe HSS sends a POST request to the callbackReference as provided by the NF service consumer during the subscription.\n2a.\tThe NF service consumer responds with \"204 No Content\".\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the POST response body.\nIn the case of redirection, the NF Service Consumer shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to an alternative notification endpoint.\nThe following procedures using the ModifySubscription service operation are supported:\n-\tModification of a Subscription to notification of data change\nFigure 5.3.2.6.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the HSS to modify a subscription to notifications of data changes.

The request contains the UE's identity which shall be an IMSI.\nThe figure depicts a 4G network with various network elements such as base stations (BSs), mobile stations (MSs), and network elements. It illustrates the deregistration process for a specific SN (Service Number) in the network.\nFigure 5.4.2.2.2-1: SN Deregistration\n1.\tThe NF service consumer sends a POST request (custom method: deregister-sn) to the HSS; the request body contains the UE identity (IMSI) and the deregistration reason.\nThe HSS, based on the value indicated in the deregistration reason, initiates a Cancel Location towards the serving node, including a Cancellation Type value (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [17] and 3GPP TS 29.002 [20]) as follows:\n-\t\"UE_INITIAL_AND_SINGLE_REGISTRATION\": S6a/S6d/Gr(S4/Gn/Gp) Cancel Location sent towards MME/SGSN, with a Cancellation-Type set to MME_UPDATE_PROCEDURE/SGSN_UPDATE_PROCEDURE; the HSS shall delete the stored MME/SGSN address and MME/SGSN number.\nAdditionally, a MAP D Cancel Location (IMSI) shall be sent towards MSC/VLR if a VLR number was found in the HSS/HLR for the user; the HSS/HLR shall delete the stored MSC/VLR number.\n-\t\"UE_INITIAL_AND_DUAL_REGISTRATION\": S6d/Gr(S4) Cancel Location sent towards SGSN, with a Cancellation-Type set to SGSN_UPDATE_PROCEDURE; the HSS shall delete the stored SGSN address and SGSN number.\nNOTE 1:\tAs described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], a UE operating in dual-registration mode indicates that it is moving from EPS, which implies that there is an MME registered in HSS.\n-\t\"EPS_TO_5GS_MOBILITY\": S6a Cancel Location sent towards MME, with a Cancellation-Type set to MME_UPDATE_PROCEDURE; the HSS shall delete the stored MME address and MME number.\nAdditionally, a MAP D Cancel Location (IMSI) shall be sent towards MSC/VLR if a VLR number was found in the HSS/HLR for the user; the HSS/HLR shall delete the stored MSC/VLR number.\n-\t\"EPS_TO_5GS_MOBILITY\": S6d/Gr(S4) Cancel Location sent towards SGSN, with a Cancellation-Type set to SGSN_UPDATE_PROCEDURE; the HSS shall delete the stored SGSN address and SGSN number.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on operator policy, and the presence of GUAMI in the DeregistrationRequest, the HSS can decide whether a registered VLR in the VPLMN needs to be cancelled. It should be noted that keeping the VLR registration can impact terminating services (e.g. T-ADS, MT-SMS…) causing failed paging attempts.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds with \"204 No Content\". If the HSS has a valid subscription for the UE, but the UE is not registered in EPS network, the HSS shall respond with \"204 No Content\".\n2b.\tIf there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" should be returned including additional error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the POST response body.\nIn the case of redirection, the HSS shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint of another HSS (service) instance.\nFigure 5.4.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (UDM) requests HSS to update the IMEI of the UE stored in the HSS. The request contains the UE's identity which shall be an IMSI, and the new IMEI of the UE.\nFigure 5 illustrates the process of IMEI update in a 4G network. The figure shows the steps involved in updating the IMEI of a device, including the steps to update the IMEI of the device, the steps to update the IMEI of the network, and the steps to update the IMEI of the network's base station. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network's IMEI update process, with arrows indicating the flow of data and the steps involved.\nFigure 5.4.2.3-1: IMEI Update\n1.\tThe NF service consumer sends a POST request (custom method: imei-update) to the HSS; the request body contains the UE identity (IMSI) and the new IMEI of the UE.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds either with \"204 No Content\", which indicates that the HSS does not have any stored IMEI(SV) value for the UE, or with a \"200 OK\", which indicates that the HSS had an IMEI value stored for the UE. In the latter case, the HSS shall update the locally stored IMEI value for the UE, and return in the response body the previous IMEI, so the NF Service Consumer (UDM) can determine whether the HSS contained a different IMEI value than the current one sent to the HSS in this IMEI Update notification.\n2b.\tIf there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" should be returned including additional error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the POST response body.\nIn the case of redirection, the HSS shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint of another HSS (service) instance.\nFigure 5.4.2.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (UDM) requests HSS to update the Roaming Status of the UE stored in the HSS. The request contains the UE's identity which shall be an IMSI, and the new PLMN-ID where the UE is located.\nThe figure depicts a 4G roaming status update, showing the current status of roaming users and the network's response to their requests. The update includes information on the number of roaming users, the network's response time, and the status of the roaming network. This figure is crucial for network operators to ensure seamless roaming experiences for their customers.\nFigure 5.4.2.4-1: Roaming Status Update\n1.\tThe NF service consumer sends a POST request (custom method: roaming-status-update) to the HSS; the request body contains the UE identity (IMSI) and the new PLMN-ID of the UE.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds with \"204 No Content\".\n2b.\tIf there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" should be returned including additional error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the POST response body.\nIn the case of redirection, the HSS shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint of another HSS (service) instance.\n",
