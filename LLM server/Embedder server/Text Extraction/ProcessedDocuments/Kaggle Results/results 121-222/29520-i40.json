If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are accepted, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute indicating the event(s) for which the subscription failed and the associated reason(s). The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If the immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the \"evtReq\" attribute sets to true in the event subscription, the NWDAF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response.\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer).Editor's Note: It is FFS to determine whether any further provisions or limitations with regard to the usage of the \"notifFlag\" attribute are needed.\nIf the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP POST request includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".\nWhen the \"PredictionError\" feature is supported, if the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP POST request includes the prediction time period in the future and the event is \"SM_CONGESTION\", \"PFD_DETERMINATION\" and/or \"PDU_SESSION_TRAFFIC\", the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"PREDICTION_NOT_ALLOWED\".\nIf the statistics in the past are requested but the necessary data to perform the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".\nIf the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is required for the requested analytics collection depending on local policy and regulations, then the NWDAF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [23]. If the NWDAF receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted user(s), then the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".\nNOTE 14:\tWhen the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the NWDAF to update the subscription for event notifications (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a NF service consumer's subscription to notifications, with various updates and notifications being displayed. The figure includes a list of notifications, their respective statuses, and the corresponding updates. The NF service consumer is shown as a user, and the updates are displayed in a user-friendly format, making it easy for the consumer to understand and manage their subscriptions.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe service operation to update subscription to event notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2. In addition, each element of the \"eventSubscriptions\" may contain the following:\n-\tAnalytics feedback information within the \"feedback\" attribute, if the \"AnalyticsAccuracy\" feature is supported and the susbcription is for a prediction.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI and NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tupdate the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and\n-\tstore the subscription.\nNOTE:\tThe \"notificationURI\" attribute within the NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to a new NF service consumer.\nIf the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\" resource, and shall respond with:\na)\tHTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 2a. If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are modified successfully, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute indicating the event(s) for which the modification failed and the associated reason(s); or\nb)\tHTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 2b.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP PUT request includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".\nWhen the \"PredictionError\" feature is supported, if the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP PUT request includes the prediction time period in the future and the event is \"SM_CONGESTION\", \"PFD_DETERMINATION\" and/or \"PDU_SESSION_TRAFFIC\", the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"PREDICTION_NOT_ALLOWED\".\nIf the statistics in the past are requested but the necessary data to perform the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".\nIf the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NWDAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included in the request with the value \"DEACTIVATE\", the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer); if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the NWDAF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store available events; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the NWDAF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.\nEditor's Note: It is FFS to determine whether any further provisions or limitations with regard to the usage of the \"notifFlag\" attribute are needed.\nThe Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from event notifications.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from event notifications (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications, illustrating the process of unsubscription from a service. The NF service consumer is represented by a rectangle, and the unsubscription is represented by a dashed line connecting the consumer to the service provider. The figure also includes a label indicating the service provider's name and a label indicating the unsubscription status. The figure is set against a background that represents the NF service provider's network infrastructure, with a label indicating the service provider's name and a label indicating the service provider's network infrastructure.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, if the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation is used by an NWDAF to notify NF consumers about subscribed events or by the target NWDAF to notify the consumer of the successful analytics subscription transfer.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NWDAF sends a request to the NF service consumer to notify for event notifications or notify for the successful analytics subscription transfer (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a network-wide data aggregation and notification system, known as NWDAF (Network Wide Data Aggregation and Notification). It shows a network-wide data aggregation system that notifies subscribers of events, such as network failures, system status changes, and other important information. The system is designed to ensure that subscribers are informed of any issues that may affect their data or services, allowing them to take appropriate action to resolve the issue.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1: NWDAF notifies the subscribed event\nThe NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation to notify the subscribed event or the successful analytics subscription transfer. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{notificationURI}\" received in the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe service operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, step 1.\nIf both the repetition period (\"repPeriod\" or \"repetitionPeriod\") attribute and the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute are present in the subscription request for periodical notification, the NWDAF shall produce a notification in every repetition period seconds, including the statistics in the past offset period if the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute value is negative, or including the prediction for the future offset period if the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute value is positive.\nThe NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tIf the notification is for notifying about subscribed events, a description of the notified event as \"eventNotifications\" attribute that for each event shall include:\na)\tan event identifier as \"event\" attribute;\nb)\tnetwork slice load level information in the \"sliceLoadLevelInfo\" attribute when subscribed event is \"SLICE_LOAD_LEVEL\";\nc)\tservice experience information as \"svcExps\" attribute when subscribed event is \"SERVICE_EXPERIENCE\";\nd)\tUE mobility information in the \"ueMobs\" attribute when subscribed event is \"UE_MOBILITY\";\ne)\tUE communication information in the \"ueComms\" attribute when subscribed event is \"UE_COMM\";\nf)\tabnormal behaviour information in the \"abnorBehavrs\" attribute when subscribed event is \"ABNORMAL_BEHAVIOUR\";\ng)\tuser data congestion information in the \"userDataCongInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"USER_DATA_CONGESTION\";\nh)\tQoS sustainability information in the \"qosSustainInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"QOS_SUSTAINABILITY\";\ni)\tNF load information in \"nfLoadLevelInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"NF_LOAD\";\nj)\tnetwork performance information in the \"nwPerfs\" attribute when subscribed event is \"NETWORK_PERFORMANCE\";\nk)\tLoad level information for the network slice(s) and the optionally associated network slice instance(s) in \"nsiLoadLevelInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"NSI_LOAD_LEVEL\";\nl)\tDispersion information in the \"disperInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"DISPERSION\";\nm)\tRedundant transmission experience information in the \"redTransInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"RED_TRANS_EXP\";\nn)\tWLAN performance information in the \"wlanInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"WLAN_PERFORMANCE\";\no)\tDN performance information in the \"dnPerfInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"DN_PERFORMANCE\";\np)\tSMCCE performance information in the \"smccExps\" attribute when subscribed event is \"SM_CONGESTION\";\nq)\tPFD Determination information for known application identifier(s) in the \"pfdDetermInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"PFD_DETERMINATION\";\nr) \tPDU Session traffic information in the \"pduSesTrafInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"PDU_SESSION_TRAFFIC\";\ns)\tE2E data volume transfer time in the \"dataVlTrnsTmInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"E2E_DATA_VOL_TRANS_TIME\";\nt) \tMovement Behaviour information in the \"movBehavInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"MOVEMENT_BEHAVIOUR\";\nu)\tLocation Accuracy information in the \"locAccInfos\" attribute when the subscribed event is \"LOC_ACCURACY\";

In this case, the NWDAF may send an HTTP POST request as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, which shall only provide (within the EventNotification data type in the NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data type) an indication of the failure event via the \"event\" attribute and the corresponding failure reason via a \"failNotifyCode\" attribute, and may also provide a minimum time interval recommended by the NWDAF for the event via a \"rvWaitTime\" attribute which will be used by the NF service consumer to determine the time when analytics information is needed in similar future analytics subscriptions.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{notificationURI}\" as Resource URI and NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data structure as request body, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall:\n-\tstore the notification; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer service operation is used by an NWDAF instance to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s) to another NWDAF instance. If the source NWDAF discovers that the analytics consumer may change concurrently to this procedure, the source NWDAF should not perform the procedure. In such a case, the source NWDAF may send a message to indicate to the analytics consumer that it will not serve this subscription anymore.\nNOTE 1:\tTo discover the possible change of analytics consumer, if the Analytics ID is UE related, the source NWDAF takes actions responding to external trigger (such as UE mobility), for example, checking if the Target of Analytics Reporting is still within the serving area of the analytics consumer, if the serving area information of the consumer is available.\nNOTE 2:\tHandling of overload situation or preparation for a graceful shutdown are preferably executed inside an NWDAF Set, when available, therefore, not requiring an analytics subscription transfer as described in this clause.\nFigure 4.2.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF Service Consumer (e.g. NWDAF) sends a request to the NWDAF to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s) from the NF Service Consumer to the NF Service Producer (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer requesting an analytics subscription transfer, illustrating the process of transferring data between the service provider and the consumer. The figure includes various elements such as the service consumer, the analytics subscription, and the transfer request, all of which are essential components of the NF service. The figure also includes a visual representation of the transfer process, with arrows indicating the flow of data between the service provider and the consumer. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise representation of the NF service consumer's request for an analytics subscription transfer.\nFigure 4.2.2.5.2-1: NF service consumer requests an analytics subscription transfer\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer service operation to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s).

The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions\" as Resource URI representing the \"NWDAF Data Management Subscriptions\", as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create a subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\" according to the information in message body.\nThe NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tan URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notificURI\" attribute;\n-\tnotification correlation identfier within the \"notifCorrId\" attribute; and\n-\tone of the following:\n-\tanalytics subscription information to be used to determine which data shall be collected and reported within the \"anaSub\" attribute;\n-\tdata subscription information within the \"dataSub\" attribute;\nThe NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body may include:\n-\tthe notification endpoints within the \"notifEndpoints\" attribute if the \"DataAnaCollect\" feature is supported;\n-\tformatting instructions within the \"formatInstruct\" attribute;\n-\tprocessing instructions within the \"procInstruct\" attribute or the \"multiProcInstructs\" attribute if the \"MultiProcessingInstruction\" feature is supported;\n-\tone of the following identifiers related to the ADRF:\n-\tADRF instance identifier within the \"adrfId\" attribute;\n-\tADRF set identifier within the \"adrfSetId\" attribute;\n-\tone of the following target identifiers:\n-\tNF instance identifier within the \"targetNfId\" attribute;\n-\tNF set identifier within the \"targetNfSetId\" attribute;\n-\ttime window of the occurrence of the requested data collection within the \"timePeriod\" attribute;\n-\tthe purpose of data collection within the \"dataCollectPurposes\" attribute.\n-\tthe indication that the NF service consumer has already checked the user consent within the \"checkedConsentInd\" attribute.\n-\tstorage handling information within the \"storeHandl\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall use the contents of the request to determine whether the subscription can already be served or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required. If the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, in the case where the \"dataSub\" or \"anaSub\" attributes are provided, when the request is syntactically valid and there is no NWDAF internal error, but the NWDAF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct one based on the received subscription contents.\nIf the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is required for the requested data collection depending on local policy and regulations, then the NWDAF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [23]. If the NWDAF receives the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted user(s), then the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.\nIf the NWDAF determines that the subscription can already be served (without requiring further interactions with ADRF and/or data sources) or a successful response from the ADRF and/or data sources is received for the creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tcreate a new subscription;\n-\tassign a subscriptionId;\n-\tstore the subscription.\nIf the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\" resource, the NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If an immediate reporting indication is provided in the subscription, the NWDAF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response within the \"dataSub\" attribute, or, if the DataAnaCollect feature is supported, potentially within the \"immReport\" attribute.\nIf the NWDAF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to \"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same analytics, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 3:\tThe default operator policy for how long analytics is to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nWhen the notification flag of the \"dataSub\" attribute (e.g. the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the notification flag to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the NWDAF may consider the contents of the muting instructions of the \"dataSub\" attribute (if provided; e.g. the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) and/or local configuration to determine its actions.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings in the response (e.g. within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the case of AF events). If the NWDAF does not accept the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.\nFigure 4.4.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the NWDAF to update the subscription for data notifications.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a NF service consumer's subscription to data notifications. It shows the consumer's subscription status, including whether it is active or inactive, and the number of data notifications received. The figure is used to communicate the consumer's subscription status to the service provider, allowing for efficient management of NF service updates and notifications.\nFigure 4.4.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to data notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation to update subscription to data notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI representing the \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\", as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.4.2.2.2.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI and NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall use the contents of the request to determine whether the updated subscription can already be served or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required. If the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, in the case when the \"dataSub\" or \"anaSub\" attributes are provided, when the request is syntactically valid and there is no NWDAF internal error, but the NWDAF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct one based on the received subscription contents.\nIf the NWDAF determines that the updated subscription can already be served (without requiring further interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources) or a successful response from the ADRF and/or data sources is received for the creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tupdate the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and\n-\tstore the subscription.\nIf the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\" resource, and shall respond with:\na)\tHTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step 2a; If an immediate reporting indication is provided in the request, the NWDAF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP PUT response within the \"dataSub\" attribute, or, if the DataAnaCollect feature is supported, potentially within the \"immReport\" attribute; or\nb)\tHTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step 2b.\nIf the NWDAF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to \"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same analytics, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 2:\tThe default operator policy for how long analytics is to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nWhen the notification flag of the \"dataSub\" attribute (e.g. the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) is included in the request with the value \"DEACTIVATE\", the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the notification flag attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the NWDAF may consider the contents of the muting instructions of the \"dataSub\" attribute (if provided; e.g. the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) and/or local configuration to determine its actions; if the notification flag is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the NWDAF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store available events; if the notification flag is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the NWDAF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings in the response (e.g. within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the case of AF events). If the NWDAF does not accept the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.\nIf the NWDAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF service consumer to remove a subscription for data notifications from the NWDAF.\nFigure 4.4.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from data notifications.\n\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer unsubscribing from data notifications, illustrating the process of data removal from the network.\nFigure 4.4.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from data notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe from data notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the identifier of the existing subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request, if the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription;\n-\trespond to the NF service consumer:\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is not supported or no stored unsent events to be included in the response; or\n-\trespond with HTTP \"200 OK\" status code if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported and including the stored unsent events in the NnwdafDataManagementNotif data type in the response.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.\nIf the NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service operation is used by the NWDAF to notify NF service consumers about subscribed events related to data.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NWDAF sends a request to the NF service consumer to notify for event notifications (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a network-wide data aggregation and notification system, known as NWDAF (Network Wide Data Aggregation and Notification). It is designed to provide real-time data aggregation and notification to subscribers, ensuring that they are aware of any changes or events in their network. The system uses a distributed architecture, with nodes responsible for data aggregation and notification, and a centralized system for managing the system and providing alerts. The figure shows the different components of the system, including the subscriber, the event, and the notification system.\nFigure 4.4.2.4.2-1: NWDAF notifies the subscribed event\nThe NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service operation to notify the subscribed event. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{notificURI}\" received in the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.4.2.4.2-1, step 1.\nThe NnwdafDataManagementNotif data structure provided in the request body that shall include:\n-\tthe notification correlation identifier within the \"notifCorrId\" attribute;\n-\tthe timestamp of the notification within the \"notifTimestamp\" attribute;\n-\tone of the following:\n-\tdata collected from data sources (e.g. SMF, NEF) in the \"dataNotification\" attribute;\n-\tsummarized data derived from events that occurred based on processing and formatting instructions in the \"dataReports\" attribute;\n-\tinformation for fetching the contents of the notification in the \"fetchInstruct\" attribute.\n-\ta deletion alert in the \"delAlert\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nThe NnwdafDataManagementNotif data structure provided in the request body may include:\n-\tan indication that the NWDAF has requested a termination of the subscription within the \"terminationReq\" attribute; and/or\n-\ta pending notification cause for the stored unsent data in the \"pendNotifCause\" attribute if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer shall store the notification and respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, or with HTTP \"200 OK\" status code and the NotifResponse data structure in the response body if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nAfter the successful processing of the HTTP POST request:\n-\tif the NWDAF requests the NF service consumer with the \"fetchInstruct\" attribute to retrieve the data, the NF service consumer may invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch service operation to retrieve the notified data as defined in clause 4.4.2.5.\n-\tif the NWDAF provided a deletion alert to the NF service consumer, the NF service consumer may invoke the Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalRequest service operation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.575 [27] clause 4.2.2.5, using the storage transaction identifier received within the \"alertStorTransId\" attribute of the \"delAlert\" attribute, in order to retrieve the data that are about to be deleted.\nNOTE:\tThe \"alertStorTransId\" attribute, which is used for retrieving data prior to deletion, does not have to be the same with or related to the storage transaction identifier that is assigned and returned during the storage of the data in the ADRF.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.\nIf the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch service operation is used by an NF service consumer to retrieve data notifications indicated by fetch instructions from the NWDAF.\nFigure 4.4.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the NWDAF to retrieve notified data.\n\nThe figure depicts a request to retrieve notified data, illustrating the communication process in a 5G network.\nFigure 4.4.2.5.2-1: Requesting to retrieve notified data\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch service operation to retrieve notified data. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{fetchUri}\" URI previously provided by the NWDAF in \"fetchInstruct\" attribute within NnwdafDataManagementNotif data type, as shown in figure 4.4.2.5.2-1, step 1, to fetch NWDAF data. The request body shall include fetch correlation identifiers, which was previously provided by the NWDAF in the \"fetchCorrIds\" attribute within fetchInstruction in the NWDAF notification.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tfind the data according to the requested parameters.\nIf the requested data is found, the NWDAF shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing the NnwdafDataManagementNotif data structure. The NnwdafDataManagementNotif data structure in the response body shall include the data collected from data sources (e.g. SMF, NEF) in the \"dataNotification\" attribute.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.\nIf the NWDAF determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\n",

The NF service consumer is represented by a rectangle with a circle at the top, indicating the subscriber's status. The circle is divided into two parts, with one part representing the subscriber's status and the other representing the service provider's status. The service provider's status is represented by a rectangle with a circle at the top, indicating the service provider's status. The service provider's status is divided into two parts, with one part representing the service provider's status and the other representing the subscriber's status. The subscriber's status is represented by a rectangle with a circle at the top, indicating the subscriber's status. The subscriber's status is divided into two parts, with one part representing the subscriber's status and the other representing the service provider's status.

The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-mlmodelprovision/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request, if the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.4.7.\nThe Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation is used by an NWDAF to notify NF consumers about subscribed events.\nFigure 4.5.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NWDAF sends a request to the NF Service Consumer to notify for event notifications (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a network-wide data aggregation and notification system, known as NWDAF (Network Wide Data Aggregation and Notification). It is designed to provide real-time data aggregation and notification to subscribers, ensuring that they are aware of any changes or events in the network. The system uses a distributed architecture, with nodes responsible for aggregating data and notifying subscribers. This ensures that the system is scalable and can handle large amounts of data.\nFigure 4.5.2.4.2-1: NWDAF notifies the subscribed event\nThe NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation to notify the subscribed event. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{notifUri}\" received in the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, step 1. The NwdafMLModelProvNotif data structure provided in the request body that shall include:\n-\tan event subscriptionId as \"subscriptionId\" attribute; and\n-\tdescription of the notified event as \"eventNotifs\" attribute, that for each event, the MLEventNotif data type shall include an event identifier as the \"event\" attribute, an address (e.g. a URL or an FQDN) of the ML model file as the \"mLFileAddr\" attribute or (if the \"ModelProvisionExt\"feature is supported) ADRF ID as the \"adrfId\" attribute or ADRF Set ID as the \"adrfSetId\" attribute, and may include a notification correlation identifier as \"notifCorreId\" attribute and a time period when the provided ML model applies as the \"validityPeriod\" attribute and an area where the provided ML model applies as the \"spatialValidity\" attribute and (if the \"ModelProvisionExt\"feature is supported) Storage Transaction ID when the ADRF (Set) ID (i.e. \"adrfId\" or \"adrfSetId\" attribute) is provided as the \"storTransId\" attribute. If the feature \"ModelProvisionExt\" is supported, may also include additional ML model information as \"addModelInfo\" attribute.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer shall store the notification and respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the NF service consumer receives the ADRF ID as the \"adrfId\" attribute or the ADRF Set ID as the \"adrfSetId\" attribute in the NwdafMLModelProvNotif data structure of the HTTP POST request, it may invoke Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalRequest service operation to retrieve ML Model from the ADRF (Set) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.575 [27].\nIf the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.4.7.\n",

The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PATCH request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-mlmodeltraining/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing subscription to be modified, to update an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Training Subscription\" according to the information in the message body.\nUpon receipt of an HTTP PATCH request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-mlmodeltraining/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI and NwdafMLModelTrainSubscPatch data type as request body, if the request is successfully processed and accepted, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tpartial modify the concerned subscription; and\n-\tstore the subscription.\nIf the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PATCH request, the NWDAF shall partial update an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Training Subscription\" resource, and shall respond with:\n-\tHTTP \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.6.2.2.4-1, step 2a); or\n-\tHTTP \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.6.2.2.4-1, step 2b) with a response body containing a representation of the updated subscription in the NwdafMLModelTrainSubsc data type.\nIf not all the requested events in the subscription are modified successfully, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute indicating the event(s) for which the subscription failed and the associated reason(s).\nIf the immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the \"eventReq\" attribute sets to \"true\" during the event subscription update, the NWDAF shall include the reports of the subscribed events, if available, as the \"immReports\" attribute in the HTTP PUT response.\nNOTE:\tImmediate and one-time reporting can be used in order to implement the Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingInfo service, which is defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [17].\nIf there is no associated ML model training available for all provided \"mLEvent\" attributes, the NWDAF shall send a \"500 Internal Server Error\" status code to the NF service consumer, including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UNAVAILABLE_ML_MODEL_TRAINING_FOR_ALLEVENTS\".\nIf other errors occur when processing the HTTP PATCH request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.5.7.\nIf the NWDAF determines that the received HTTP PATCH request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from event notifications.\nFigure 4.6.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from event notifications (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer unsubscribing from notifications, illustrating the process of service unsubscription in a NF network.\nFigure 4.6.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-mlmodeltraining/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request, if the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.5.7.\nThe Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation is used by an NWDAF to notify NF consumers about subscribed events.\nThe figure depicts a network-wide data aggregation and notification system, known as NWDAF (Network Wide Data Aggregation and Notification). It is designed to provide real-time data aggregation and notification to subscribers, ensuring that they are aware of any changes or events in their network. The system uses a hierarchical structure, with NWDAF notifications being sent to subscribers at the top level, followed by the next level, and finally to the lowest level, which is the subscriber. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient data distribution and ensures that all subscribers receive the same level of notification.\nFigure 4.6.2.4.2-1: NWDAF notifies the subscribed event\nThe NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation to notify the subscribed event. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{notifUri}\" received in the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Subscribe service operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.6.2.4.2-1, step 1. The NwdafMLModelTrainNotif data structure provided in the request body that shall include:\n-\ta notification correlation identifier as \"notifCorreId\" attribute;\n-\tat least one of the notification detailed information:\n-\tdescription of the notified event as \"mLModelInfos\" attribute;\n-\ta delay event notification for training the ML model as \"delayEventNotif\" attribute when the service is for Federated Learning;\n-\tan indication that the subscription is requested to be terminated, i.e. no further notifications related to this subscription will be provided, as \"termTrainReq\";\nand may include:\n-\tan identification of the Machine Learning procedure for training the ML model as \"mlCorreId\" attribute when the service is for Federated Learning;\n-\tan identification of the round number of the training in a multi-round training process as \"roundInd\" attribute;\n-\tthe status report for the ML model training as \"statusReport\" attribute when the service is for Federated Learning; and/or\n-\tan indication of the use case context of the ML model as \"uCaseCont\".\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer shall store the notification and respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.5.7.\n",

The NF service consumer is represented as a user, and the unsubscription is depicted as a service unsubscription event. The figure shows the NF service consumer's subscription status, the unsubscription event, and the notification being sent to the NF service consumer. The figure also includes a visual representation of the NF service consumer's subscription status, which is represented by a green check mark, indicating that the service is active and being subscribed to.\nFigure 4.8.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_RoamingData_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-roamingdata/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscription ID of the existing subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-roamingdata/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, if the RE-NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the RE-NWDAF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the RE-NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the RE-NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.6.7.\nThe Nnwdaf_RoamingData_Notify service operation is used by an RE-NWDAF to notify NF service consumer about the subscribed data of roaming UEs exposed by an RE-NWDAF.\nFigure 4.8.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to notify for event notifications.\nThe figure depicts a network event notification system, specifically the RE-NWDAF, which is responsible for notifying subscribers of network events. The system uses a hierarchical structure with multiple levels, including the RE-NWDAF, RE-NWDAF-1, RE-NWDAF-2, and RE-NWDAF-3, each with its own set of subscribers. The RE-NWDAF-1 and RE-NWDAF-2 are the primary subscribers, while RE-NWDAF-3 is a backup subscriber. The system uses a combination of traditional and modern technologies, such as SMS, email, and web-based interfaces, to deliver network events to subscribers. The figure also includes a diagram of the network topology, showing the connections between the different subscribers and the RE-NWDAF.\nFigure 4.8.2.4.2-1: RE-NWDAF notifies the subscribed event\nThe RE-NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_RoamingData_Notify service operation to notify the subscribed event. The RE-NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{notificationUri}\" received in the Nnwdaf_RoamingData_Notify service operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.8.2.4.2-1, step 1. The HTTP POST message shall include NnwdafDataManagementNotif data structure as described in clause 5.3.6.2.2.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer shall store the notification and respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the RE-NWDAF determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the RE-NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the RE-NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.6.7.\n4.9\tNnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics Service\n4.9.1\tService Description\n4.9.1.1\tOverview\nThe Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics service is provided by the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) with roaming exchange capability, which is called Roaming Exchange NWDAF (RE-NWDAF).\nThis service:\n-\tallows NF service consumers to subscribe to and unsubscribe from different analytics events related to roaming UE(s); and\n-\tnotifies NF service consumers with a corresponding subscription about observed events related to roaming UE(s).\nThe 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Network Data Analytics Exposure architecture, including the case of roaming, is defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]. The Network Data Analytics signalling flows are defined in 3GPP TS 29.552 [25], the Policy and Charging related 5G architecture is also described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [4] and 3GPP TS 29.513 [5].\nThe Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics service is part of the Nnwdaf service-based interface exhibited by the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF), but it can be provided only by an NWDAF with the roaming exchange capability, which is called Roaming Exchange NWDAF (RE-NWDAF).\nThe only known consumer of the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics service is the Roaming Exchange NWDAF (RE-NWDAF).\nBoth the RE-NWDAF that provides the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics service and the RE-NWDAF that consumes the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics service may be in the HPLMN (in which case it is denoted as H-RE-NWDAF) or in the VPLMN (in which case it is denoted as H-RE-NWDAF). If the NF service producer is the H-RE-NWDAF then the NF service consumer is the V-RE-NWDAF and vice versa.\nThe figure depicts a reference architecture for the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics Service, showcasing the service's components and their interconnections. The architecture includes a Service Broker (SB), a Service Interface (SI), a Service Gateway (SG), and a Service Processor (SP). The SB is responsible for managing the service life cycle, while the SI and SP are responsible for providing the service to the end-users. The SB is connected to the SI and SP through the SG, which in turn is connected to the SP. The SB, SI, and SP are interconnected through the SB, ensuring that the service is delivered to the end-users.\nFigure 4.9.1.2-1: Reference Architecture for the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics Service; SBI representation\nThe figure depicts a reference architecture for the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics Service, illustrating the reference point representation. It includes a reference point, which is a point in the network where the service is implemented, and a set of reference points, which are the locations where the service is deployed. The figure also includes a set of reference points for the service's deployment, which are the locations where the service is implemented. The figure is a visual representation of the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics Service's reference architecture, providing a clear and concise overview of the service's implementation and deployment points.\nFigure 4.9.1.2-2: Reference Architecture for the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics Service: reference point representation\nThe Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) with roaming exchange capability, i.e. the RE-NWDAF, provides analytics information for different analytics events related to roaming UE(s) to NF service consumers.\nThe Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) allows NF service consumers to subscribe to and unsubscribe from one-time, periodic notification or notification when an event is detected.\nThe Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) with roaming exchange capability, i.e. the RE-NWDAF, supports (un)subscription to the notification of analytics information for all types of network analytics related to roaming UE(s) from the NWDAF.\n",

The NF service consumer is shown as a user, and the unsubscription is depicted as a notification being sent to the consumer. The figure shows the consumer's status as \"off\" and the notification being sent to the consumer's device. The figure also includes a visual representation of the notification being sent to the consumer's device, showing the status as \"on\".\nFigure 4.9.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications related to roaming UE(s) by sending an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-roaminganalytics/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-roaminganalytics/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, if the RE-NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the RE-NWDAF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the RE-NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.7.\nIf the RE-NWDAF determines that the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\nThe Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics_Notify service operation is used by an RE-NWDAF to notify NF consumers about subscribed events related to roaming UE(s).\nFigure 4.9.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the RE-NWDAF sends a request to the NF service consumer to notify for event notifications related to roaming UE(s).\nThe figure depicts a network diagram with various components, including a router, switch, and a network device. The router is responsible for routing traffic between different network devices, while the switch is used to manage the flow of data between the router and the network device. The network device is the device that is being notified of the subscribed event. This figure is used to illustrate the communication and routing processes in a network, and it is important for understanding the overall network architecture.\nFigure 4.9.2.4.2-1: RE-NWDAF notifies the subscribed event\nThe NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics_Notify service operation to notify the subscribed event related to roaming UE(s) by sending an HTTP POST request with the \"{notifUri}\" that was received in the Nnwdaf_RoamingAnalytics_Subscribe service operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.9.2.4.2-1, step 1.\nIf both the repetition period (\"repPeriod\" or \"repetitionPeriod\") attribute and the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute were present in the subscription request for periodical notification, the NWDAF shall produce a notification in every repetition period seconds, including the statistics in the past offset period if the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute value is negative, or including the prediction for the future offset period if the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute value is positive.\nThe RoamingAnalyticsNotification data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tthe notification correlation identifier as \"notifCorrId\" attribute;\n-\ta description of the notified event(s) as \"roamEventNotifs\" attribute with the same contents as specified for the \"eventNotifications\" attribute in clause 4.2.2.4.2 but excluding the attributes that are indicated as non applicable in Table 5.7.6.2.3-1.\nNOTE:\tThe features mentioned in clause 4.2.2.4.2 are not relevant here.\nand may include:\n-\ta cause for termination in the \"termCause\" attribute if the NWDAF wants to request the termination of this subscription, i.e. to indicate that it will send no further notifications for it.\nIf the time when analytics information is needed has been provided (via the \"timeAnaNeeded\" attribute within the \"extraReportReq\" attribute) during the subscription for an event (via the \"event\" attribute within the EventSubscription data type), if the time when analytics information is needed is reached but the subscribed analytics information is not ready, the consumer does not need to wait for the analytics information any longer. In this case, the RE-NWDAF may send an HTTP POST request as shown in step 1 of figure 4.9.2.4.2-1, which shall only provide (within the EventNotification data type in the RoamingAnalyticsNotification data type) an indication of the failure event via the \"event\" attribute and the corresponding failure reason via a \"failNotifyCode\" attribute, and may also provide a minimum time interval recommended by the NWDAF for the event via a \"rvWaitTime\" attribute which will be used by the NF service consumer to determine the time when analytics information is needed in similar future analytics subscriptions.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{notifUri}\" as Resource URI and RoamingAnalyticsNotification data structure as request body, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall:\n-\tstore the notification; and\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.7.\nIf the NF service consumer determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].\n",
