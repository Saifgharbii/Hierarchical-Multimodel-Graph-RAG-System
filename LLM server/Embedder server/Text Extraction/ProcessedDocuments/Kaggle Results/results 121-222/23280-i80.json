            "description": "A common functional architecture to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], MCData defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]) including common application plane and signalling plane entities is specified in this document. It also deals with the functional architecture of the MC gateway UE to enable access to the MC system from MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices. A subset of these devices can host an MC client specified by 3GPP.\nEach MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users (e.g. group call, private call). There are several common functions and entities (e.g. group, configuration, identity) which are used by the MC services.\nThe common functional architecture to support MC services utilises aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], the Proximity-based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], the Group Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].\nThe MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using either MC service UEs in E-UTRAN or using MC service UEs via non-3GPP access networks. External applications usage of MC services can be enabled via E-UTRAN or non-3GPP access networks.\nNOTE:\tDispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are considered MC service UEs in the common functional architecture to support MC services.\n",

MC service group de-affiliation can occur due to either an MC service client's explicit request, or implicitly i.e. changed by the MC service server as the result of another action e.g. the MC service user logging off.

The SIP database may update the registrar with filter criteria to trigger the MC service server(s).\nThis functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.\nThis functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the MC service UE allowing the HTTP client to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with multiple HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.\nThe HTTP proxy terminates the HTTP-3 reference point that lies between different HTTP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP entities outside the trust domain of the MC system.\nThe HTTP proxy is not used as part of CSC-1 interface. CSC-1 is a direct HTTP interface between the IdM client in the UE and the IdM server as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].\nAccording to 3GPP TS 33.180 [25], either an HTTP proxy or a direct HTTP interface is used between the key management server and the key management client in the UE for CSC-8.\nThe HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP servers that are located within a MC service provider's network. There can be multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.\nNOTE:\tThe number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.\nThis functional entity acts as the HTTP server for all hypertext transactions.\n",

The MC service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service user.

Typically, this information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify a user's organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user's service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example, if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that identifies a user's role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.\nThe MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where the MC service ID is defined.\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the signalling control plane.\nA default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile may be used.\nFor the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been granted special privileges within the context of the client function being performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, key management client).

Alternatively, for example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create new groups or add/delete members to groups.

It highlights the role of base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, as well as the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.

                            "text_content": "This subclause describes five different deployment scenarios in which different administration of MC service, SIP core and EPS are described, together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms of signalling in those scenarios.\nIn each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be different from the organisation that administers these devices. For example, the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the EPS even when the EPS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be owned by an organisation that is independent from PLMN and MC service providers.\nIn this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and EPS) are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.2-1 below.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the common administration of all services by one operator, illustrating the various services and their associated interfaces.\nFigure 9.2.2.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator\nAlthough the identities in each plane are separate according to clause 8, there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other information at the application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core and the EPS.\nAll authorisation and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the application services layer, SIP core and EPS, shall be separate, but there may be no need for any restrictions in how these are stored and managed; for example the same entity could provide services to each of the application services layer, SIP core and EPS.\nIn this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.3-1, the MC service provider is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MC service is administered independently of the EPS and SIP core. The PLMN operator administers the EPS and the SIP core.\nThe figure depicts a network setup where MC service providers manage their own MC services separately from SIP core and EPS. MC service providers can manage their own MC services, while SIP core and EPS are responsible for managing the core and end-point services, respectively. This setup allows for efficient management and control of MC services within the network.\nFigure 9.2.2.1.3-1: MC service provider administers MC service separately from SIP core and EPS\nThe MC service provider may require that all application services layer identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core and the EPS.\nWhen required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer are hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.\nIn this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.4-1, the MC service provider administers the SIP core, and the MC services and SIP core are independent of the PLMN operator.\nThe figure depicts a service provider's provision of a SIP core, separate from the EPS, which is crucial for managing and routing voice and multimedia traffic. The separate domain ensures that the SIP core can handle voice and multimedia traffic independently, while the EPS handles the routing and signaling of the data traffic. This separation helps to optimize the network's performance and ensure a smooth user experience.\nFigure 9.2.2.1.4-1: MC service provider provision of SIP core, separate domain from EPS\nThe MC service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive information at the application services layer are hidden from the EPS. The MC service provider need not hide the identities and signalling at the application services layer from the SIP core. However the MC service provider may require that identities and other sensitive information between SIP core and SIP client in the MC service UE are also hidden from the EPS.\nAll authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.\nIn this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.5-1, the SIP core is partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core registrar is administered by the MC service provider, but the SIP core registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.\nThe figure depicts a partial provision of a SIP core by a service provider, with separate domains for the core and the EPS. This configuration allows for efficient use of resources and ensures that the core can be provisioned and decommissioned independently.\nFigure 9.2.2.1.5-1: MC service provider partial provision of SIP core, separate domain from EPS\nThe MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the application services layer are hidden from the EPS, and may require identities and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator administered part of the SIP core.\nAll authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.\nIn this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MC service UEs served by the MC service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MC service provider.\nThe figure depicts a service provider's identity management system (IDMS) providing identities to a public local network (PLMN) operator's SIP core. The system is designed to ensure secure and efficient identity management for both the service provider and the PLMN operator.\nFigure 9.2.2.1.6-1: MC service provider provides identities to PLMN operator SIP core\nThe MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and EPS.\nWhen required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.\nThe security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the MC service provider's SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g. authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling control plane authentication to take place.\nFigures 9.2.2.2-1 to 9.2.2.2-4 show the possible deployment scenarios of the MC service user database and SIP database, including collocation with the HSS.\nThe MC service user database may be combined with an HSS in some deployment scenarios (e.g. when the MC service provider and the PLMN operator are part of the same trust domain).\nThe MC service user database may be a user data repository (UDR) in deployment scenarios when the UDC architecture is applied (see 3GPP TS 23.335 [15]), in that case the MC service server and the configuration management server are assumed to be application front-ends and the Ud interface is used to access data from the repository.\nNOTE 1:\tAs an implementation option, the SIP database can be located within the SIP core, in which case the AAA-1 interface is not exposed.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MC service user database and the MC service server are always deployed in the same network i.e. both in the PLMN operator's network or both in the MC service provider's network.\nThe figure depicts a collocation of a MC service user database and SIP database with HSS, illustrating the integration of these databases within a unified network architecture.\nFigure 9.2.2.2-1: Collocation of MC service user database and SIP database with HSS\nThe HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-1 can be deployed either in the PLMN operator's network or the MC service provider's network.\nThe figure depicts a shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based deployment of MC service, with a SIP database collocated with HSS and separate MC service user database.\nFigure 9.2.2.2-2: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based deployment of MC service - SIP database collocated with HSS with separate MC service user database\nThe MC service user database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in the PLMN operator's network or the MC service provider's network, and the HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in the same or different network to the MC service user database i.e. PLMN operator's network or the MC service provider's network.\nThe figure depicts a shared PLMN operator and MC service provider-based deployment of MC service, with a user database and SIP database deployed together, and separate HSS.\nFigure 9.2.2.2-3: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based deployment of MC service - MC service user database and SIP database deployed together, with separate HSS\nThe MC service user database and SIP database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can be deployed in the PLMN operator's network or the MC service provider's network, and the HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can be deployed in the same or different network to the MC service user database i.e. PLMN operator's network or the MC service provider's network.\nThe figure depicts a shared PLMN operator and MC service provider-based deployment of MC service, with separate HSS, MC service user database, and SIP database.\nFigure 9.2.2.2-4: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based deployment of MC service - separate HSS, MC service user database and SIP database\nEach of the MC service user database, SIP database and HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-4 can be deployed in the same or different networks i.e. PLMN operator's network or the MC service provider's network.\nThis subclause describes two different scenarios in which bearers are controlled by access to Rx by either the SIP core or the MC service server.\nThese may provide suitable models for each of the scenarios listed in subclause 9.2.2.1. However, there is no direct correlation of any of the scenarios described in this subclause to each of the scenarios described in subclause 9.2.2.1.\nIn this scenario, bearer control is performed by the SIP core alone, as shown in figure 9.2.2.3.2-1 below.\nThe figure depicts a bearer control by SIP core, illustrating the process of managing the flow of data between the sender and receiver. The diagram shows the SIP core as the central element, with the bearer control function represented by the dotted lines. The figure also includes the sender and receiver, as well as the network interface, which is represented by the dashed lines. The diagram highlights the importance of the bearer control function in ensuring the smooth flow of data, and the use of SIP core for this purpose.\nFigure 9.2.2.3.2-1: Bearer control by SIP core\nIn this scenario, bearer control is performed by the MC service server alone, as shown in figure 9.2.2.3.3-1 below.\nThe figure depicts a bearer control by MC service server, which is a crucial component in the network architecture. It illustrates the process of controlling the bearer traffic, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure includes various elements such as the MC service server, the bearer, and the network infrastructure, all of which play a vital role in the overall network performance.\nFigure 9.2.2.3.3-1: Bearer control by MC service server\n",

                            "text_content": "Depicted in figure 10.1.1.1-1 is a MC service configuration time sequence of the data related to specific MC service, representing the general lifecycle of MC service UE using an MC service.\nThe figure depicts a time sequence of the MC service UE configuration, including the associated configuration data, which is crucial for understanding the network's operational state and ensuring efficient communication.\nFigure 10.1.1.1-1 MC service UE configuration time sequence and associated configuration data\nThe MC service UE is provided with initial UE configuration via a bootstrap procedure that provides the MC service UE's clients (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, identity management client, key management client, functional alias management client) with critical information needed to connect to the MC system. This includes PDN connection information corresponding to the configured MC services on the MC service UE (see \"EPS bearer considerations\" in the 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) and on-network server identity information for all application plane servers with which the MC service UE needs to interact. See annex A.6 for more information.\nThe MC service UE is provided with UE configuration, MC service user profile configuration and group configuration via online configuration. While the MC service UE is using the MC service it may receive online configuration updates. If the MC service user profile configuration contains multiple MC service user profiles for an authenticated MC service user, then the MC service client and MC service server set the active MC service user profile to the configured pre-selected MC service user profile after MC service authorization (which can be updated by the MC service user using the procedure specified in subclause 10.1.4.6). The active MC service user profile can be changed by the MC service user to a different MC service user profile during MC service service (see MC service TSs).\nThe MC service is configured with the service configuration (not shown in the figure 10.1.1.1-1) which the MC service enforces during the entire phase of MC service UE using the MC service.\nEditor's note:\tThe extent of MC services available to an MC service UE with an unauthenticated MC user or unauthorized MC service user is described as 'limited services' in 3GPP TS 33.180 and is FFS.\nEditor's note:\tThe decision by the MC service UE to continue use of initial configuration data after MC service authorisation or discontinue its use in favour of configuration data obtained after MC service authorisation is FFS.\nFigure 10.1.1.2-1 depicts a general MC service configuration time sequence of the data related to MC service, representing the general lifecycle of MC service UE which obtains MC service when migrated to a partner MC system. The MC service user can only receive MC service from one MC system at a time.\nThe figure depicts a sequence of steps for migrating a MC service UE from one network to another. It includes the necessary configuration parameters for the UE, such as the network type, service type, and network ID. The sequence is designed to ensure a smooth transition, with each step providing a clear path for the UE to follow.\nFigure 10.1.1.2-1 MC service UE configuration sequence for migration\nThe MC service user and MC service UE first follow the MC service UE configuration and MC service user authorization steps described in subclause 10.1.1.1 to obtain one or more MC service user profiles from the primary MC system. Each user profile received from the primary MC system contains a list of partner MC systems to which migration is permitted using that user profile, together with the access information needed to communicate with the application plane servers of the partner MC system. See Annex A.3 for more information. The MC service user also obtains the necessary security parameters needed to authenticate and become service authorized on the partner MC system; the process for this is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].  At this point, the MC UE is configured sufficiently for the partner system so that the MC service user is capable of utilizing \"limited services\" as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].\nNOTE 1:\tThe above steps which enable migration to take place may be carried out some time in advance of migration. The MC service user could repeatedly obtain migrated MC service, e.g. on successive days while located in the area of the partner MC system, without needing to obtain the initial configuration afresh in advance of each period of migrated MC service. The user profile from the primary MC system must be retained to provide the access information to permit this.\nTo initiate migration, the desired partner system from those listed in the chosen user profile is selected, and the access information provided in the user profile is used to initiate communication with the partner MC system.\nNOTE 2:\tSelection of the relevant partner MC system could be performed as a result of a manual action by the user or automatically by an application in the MC service UE, e.g. according to the current location of the MC service UE or according to the serving PLMN of the MC service UE.\nThe MC service user performs user authentication to the partner MC system as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25]. The MC service UE performs signalling plane migration.\nNOTE 3:\tThe security aspects of the signalling plane migration are outside the scope of the present document.\nThe user profile or profiles for that MC service user which are to be used for service when migrated to the partner MC system are then downloaded to the configuration management client in the MC service UE by the partner MC system, and these downloaded profile or profiles are used by the MC service user during the ensuing period of MC service on the partner MC system.\nNOTE 4:\tThe user profile obtained from the primary MC system is simply used to provide access information for the partner MC system and is not otherwise used by the MC service client during migrated MC service.\nGroup configuration for the MC service groups listed in the user profile are then obtained by the group management client in the MC service UE. After these configuration steps, the MC service user obtains service authorization on the partner MC system.\nOnce service authorized, further configuration changes may be provided by the partner MC system during the period of operational MC service, in accordance with subclause 10.1.1.1. The partner MC system enforces the use of the user profiles and group configuration that have been provided by the configuration process described in this subclause.\n",

                            "text_content": "An MC service user is identified by an MC service ID. An MC service ID is associated with at least one MC service user profile and can be associated with multiple MC service user profiles (identified by an index and optionally a profile name). This is depicted in figure 10.1.4.1-1.\n\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 10.1.4.1-1: The relationship of MC service user, MC service ID, MC service user profile, and MC services,\" provides a detailed overview of the relationship between a user, their MC service ID, user profile, and the various MC services they are associated with. The figure illustrates the various components and their interconnections, highlighting the importance of user profiles in understanding the user's interaction with the MC services.\nFigure 10.1.4.1-1: The relationship of MC service user, MC service IDs, MC service user profile and MC services\nFor an MC service user there can be multiple MC service IDs with the constraint that only one MC service ID exists for a given MC service for that MC service user (e.g. MC service ID X may correspond to MCPTT service and MC service ID Y may correspond to MCVideo service). When the MC service provider requires to support a single MC service ID for all MC services, the value of the multiple MC service IDs is the same (e.g. value of MC service ID X is same as MC service ID Y).\nIn the case where a single MC service ID is configured for a MC service user for authorized access to multiple MC services, the MC service UE and MC service server shall include the indication of the specific MC service during the communication.\nFor the same MC service user there can be different MC service user profiles active on different MC service UEs or different MC service user profiles active on the same MC service UE at different times. The MC service user may have one or more specific MC service user profiles defined for use in migration cases, whereby there may be more than one MC service user profiles defined for migration for that MC service user e.g. so that different MC service user profiles can be applied in different partner MC systems. The appropriate MC service user profile for migration for the relevant partner MC system will be provided to the partner MC system by the procedure. For both the cases of MC service on the primary MC system of the MC service user, and MC service when migrating to a partner MC system, only one MC service user profile per MC service client is active at a time.\nAll MC service user profiles associated with an MC service user are stored in the MC service user database. Different parts of the MC service user profile are provisioned by the Mission Critical Organization, by the MC service provider and by the MC service user, respectively.\nMC service user profile information is downloaded to the MC service UE. The MC service user profile configuration may include more than one information exchange e.g. the configuration management server may provide the MC service UE with a list of some or all enabled MC service user profiles to allow the MC service user to select one (where the list may contain a subset of the MC service user profile information sufficient for the MC service user to distinguish which MC service user profile to select).\nWhen an MC service user is receiving MC service in its primary MC system, the MC service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated by the configuration management client (e.g. upon MC service user authentication or on reconnect to the MC service), or initiated by the configuration management server (e.g. due to role change or organization change). For a migrating MC service user, the MC service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated when the MC service user attempts to migrate to a partner MC system, and requests the MC service user profile from a nominated configuration management server in the partner MC system, prior to requesting service authorization from a partner MC service server.\nThe partner MC system may require that the MC service user profiles for migrating MC service users have parameters imposed by that partner MC system according to its operating and security policies.  For example, there may be limitations in the locations at which migrating MC users can receive service, specific priority levels for migrating MC service users or certain groups to which the migrating MC service users require access. The partner MC system applies any necessary modifications to the MC service user profile received from the primary MC system of the MC service user in accordance with its local requirements. This local profile will be stored, and will be provided to the configuration management server in the partner MC system in order to distribute it to the configuration management client of the migrating MC service user. This modified profile may be sent to the primary MC system of the migrating MC service user so that the primary MC system can validate the modified profile before it is provided to the migrating MC service UE. The modified MC service user profile will subsequently be provided to the MC service server in the partner MC system when the migrating MC user attempts service authorization.\nEditor's note: A reference should be added to configuration tables in Annex A to indicate where the local configuration policy can be configured.\nTable 10.1.4.2.1-1 describes the information flow get MC service user profile request from the configuration management client to the configuration management server.\nTable 10.1.4.2.1-1: Get MC service user profile request\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.2-1 describes the information flow get MC service user profile response from the configuration management server to the configuration management client.\nTable 10.1.4.2.2-1: Get MC service user profile response\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.3-1 describes the information flow notification for MC service user profile data update from the configuration management server to the configuration management client.\nTable 10.1.4.2.3-1: Notification for MC service user profile data update\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.4-1 describes the information flow get updated MC service user profile data request from the configuration management client to the configuration management server.\nTable 10.1.4.2.4-1: Get updated MC service user profile data request\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.5-1 describes the information flow get updated MC service user profile data response from the configuration management server to the configuration management client.\nTable 10.1.4.2.5-1: Get updated MC service user profile data response\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.6-1 describes the information flow update MC service user profile data request from the configuration management client to the configuration management server.\nTable 10.1.4.2.6-1: Update MC service user profile data request\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.7-1 describes the information flow update MC service user profile data response from the configuration management server to the configuration management client.\nTable 10.1.4.2.7-1: Update MC service user profile data response\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.8-1 describes the information flow update pre-selected MC service user profile request from the configuration management client to the configuration management server.\nTable 10.1.4.2.8-1: Update pre-selected MC service user profile request\n\nTable 10.1.4.2.9-1 describes the information flow update pre-selected MC service user profile response from the configuration management server to the configuration management client.

The system includes a user interface, a database, and a retrieval algorithm, all working together to provide a seamless user experience.\nFigure 10.1.4.3.2-1:\tRetrieval of user profile in partner MC system\n1.\tThe configuration management client in the MC service UE of the migrating MC service user requests the MC service user profile for migration from the configuration management server in the partner MC system.\n2.\tThe configuration management server in the partner MC system requests the MC service user profile from the configuration management server in the primary MC system of the MC service user.\n3.\tThe configuration management server in the primary MC system of the MC service user retrieves the MC service user profile from the MC service user database in that primary MC system. The identification of the partner MC system to which the MC service user is attempting to migrate is used to determine which MC service user profile is retrieved for that MC service user for migration to that partner MC system.\n4.\tThe configuration management server in the primary MC system provides the MC service user profile to the configuration management server in the partner MC system of the MC service user, optionally requesting validation of the modified MC service user profile.\n5.\tThe partner MC system of the MC service user modifies the MC service user profile according to local configuration information and stores the modified MC service user profile in the MC service user database in the partner MC system.\n6.\tIf the primary MC system requested validation of the MC service user profile in step 4, the configuration management server in the partner MC system of the migrating MC service user may send the modified MC service user profile to the configuration management server of the primary MC system of the MC service user to allow the primary MC system of the MC service user to validate the modified MC service user profile.\n7.\tThe primary MC system of the migrated MC service user validates the modified MC service profile of the migrated MC service user.\n8.\tThe primary MC system of the migrated MC service user responds to the partner MC system with the results of the validation process.\n9.\tThe configuration management server in the partner MC system provides the MC service user profile to the configuration management client of the migrating MC service user,\nNOTE:\tStep 9 is not followed if the validation process fails.\nThe procedure for MC service user obtaining updated MC service user profile data (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) that is initiated by the network is illustrated in figure 10.1.4.4-1.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service user has performed user authentication in identity management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user profiles.\n-\tThe configuration management server has access to the MC service user profile(s) associated with the MC service ID of the MC service user.\nThe figure depicts a user profile update process in a mobile communication service (MC) network. The user receives updated MC service user profile data from the network, illustrating the flow of data and the network's response to the update.\nFigure 10.1.4.4-1: MC service user receives updated MC service user profile data from the network\n1.\tThe configuration management server obtains updated MC service user profile data.\n2.\tThe configuration management server sends a notification for MC service user profile data update to the configuration management client.\n3.\tThe configuration management client sends get updated MC service user profile data request to the configuration management server, which includes the MC service ID.\n4.\tThe configuration management server sends get updated MC service user profile data response to the configuration management client which includes the updated MC service user profile data requested in step 3.\nNOTE:\tThe updated MC service user profile data could be for a specific MC service user profile, a specific parameter in an MC service user profile, a set of MC service user profiles, or all the MC service user profiles for the MC service ID.  MC service user profile data is defined per MC service. E.g. the MC service user profile data related to MCPTT is defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16].\nThe procedure for MC service user updating the MC service user profile data (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) is illustrated in figure 10.1.4.5-1.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service user has performed user authentication in identity management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user profiles.\nThe figure depicts a user profile data update process for MC service, with user-updating information and user profile data being sent to the network.\nFigure 10.1.4.5-1: MC service user updates MC service user profile data to the network\n1.\tThe configuration management client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction operation) to update the MC service user profile data on the configuration management server.\n2.\tThe configuration management client sends update MC service user profile data request to the configuration management server, which includes the MC service user profile data to be updated.\n3.\tThe configuration management server stores the received MC service user profile data.\n4.\tThe configuration management server sends update MC service user profile data response to the configuration management client to confirm the MC service user profile data update is complete.\nNOTE:\tThe updated MC service user profile data could be for a specific MC service user profile, a specific parameter in an MC service user profile, a set of MC service user profiles, or all the MC service user profiles for the MC service ID. MC service user profile data is defined per MC service. E.g. the MC service user profile data related to MCPTT is defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16].\nThe procedure for updating the pre-selected MC service user profile in the configuration for an MC service UE by the MC service user is illustrated in figure 10.1.4.6-1.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service user has performed user authentication in identity management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user profiles.\n-\tThe configuration management client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction, by some automated means) to change the pre-selected MC service user profile.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for managing a mobile communication service, with various options for selecting a pre-selected MC service profile. The interface includes a list of available services, a profile selector, and a profile management section. The figure illustrates the user's ability to customize their communication service preferences, ensuring a seamless and personalized mobile experience.\nFigure 10.1.4.6-1: MC service user updates the pre-selected MC service user profile\n1.\tThe configuration management client sends update pre-selected MC service user profile request to the configuration management server, which includes the MC service user's MC service ID and an MC service user profile index that indicates which MC service user profile is to be pre-selected by the MC service server at next MC service authorization.\n2.\tThe configuration management server checks the authorization of the update pre-selected MC service user profile request.\n3.\tThe configuration management server stores the received pre-selected MC service user profile selection.\n4.\tThe configuration management server sends update pre-selected MC service user profile response to the configuration management client to confirm the pre-selected MC service user profile has been set.\nNOTE:\tSteps 3 to 4 can occur in any order or in parallel.\nFor each update pre-selected MC service user profile request to the MC service user profile, the configuration management server determines whether the requested update is allowed prior to storing the configuration parameters and updating the MC service user database (via the CSC-13 reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 29.283 [19]).\nAfter each update to the MC service user profile in the MC service user database, the MC service server receives the changes from the MC service user profile database via the corresponding MC service reference point defined between MC service server and the MC service user database, and all of the MC service UEs associated with the MC service user receive the updated MC service user profile as specified in subclause 10.1.4.4.\nA change to the pre-selected MC service user profile while the MC service user is receiving MC service does not have any effect on the active MC service user profile, however, the change will be applied at the next MC service authorization.\nEditor's note: Specifying pre-selected MC service user profile specific to each UE associated with an MC service user is FFS.\nThe procedure for updating the selected MC service user profile within a single MC service for an MC service UE by the MC service user whilst the MC service user is receiving that MC service service is illustrated in figure 10.1.4.7-1. This procedure is used by the following MC services:\n-\tMCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]);\n-\tMCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]); and\n-\tMCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tFor the MC service (see list above) for which the selected MC service user profile is to be updated:\n-\tThe MC service user has performed user authentication in the identity management server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has secure access to the MC service server.\n-\tThe MC service UE has already obtained multiple MC service user profiles.\n-\tThe MC service UE has performed MC service authorization.\n-\tThe MC service client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction, by some automated means) to select a particular MC service user profile as active.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for managing a mobile communication service, specifically a MC service, with a user profile. The user interface includes a list of available MC services, a profile management section, and a button to update the selected service. The figure illustrates the user's ability to customize their communication preferences and manage their service selections.\nFigure 10.1.4.7-1: MC service user updates the selected MC service user profile\n1.\tMC service client sends update selected MC service user profile request to the MC service server, which includes the MC service user's MC service ID and an MC service user profile index that indicates which MC service user profile is selected to be currently active for MC service client.\n2.\tIf the MPCTT server does not have stored the MC service user profile data for the MC service user, then the MC service server obtains the MC service user profile data.\n3.\tThe MC service server stores the selected MC service user profile index for the MC service client.\nNOTE 1:\tDifferent MC service user profiles can be active for different MC service clients of the same MC service user.\n4.\tIf the MC service server does not have stored the group configuration data for the selected MC service user profile then the MC service server obtains group configuration data according to the selected MC service user profile (see subclause 10.1.5.2) and subscribes to updates of the group configuration data (see subclause 10.1.5.3).\n5.\tThe MC service server sends update selected MC service user profile response to the MC service client to confirm the active MC service user profile has been set.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 4 to 5 can occur in any order or in parallel.\n6.\tIf the MC service client does not have stored the group configuration data for the selected MC service user profile then the MC service client obtains group configuration data according to the successfully selected MC service user profile (see subclauase 10.1.5.2) and subscribes to updates of the group configuration data (see subclause 10.1.5.3).\nAfter each of the MC service server and the MC service UE have successfully negotiated a selected MC service user profile, then both the MC service server and the MC service UE, based upon the selected MC service user profile, clear any currently active service state from any previously selected or pre-selected MC service user profile data (including deaffiliating from relevant groups, disconnecting any MC service calls) and process the successfully negotiated selected MC service user profile data e.g. perform any needed affiliations.\n",

This helps in ensuring that the network functions are functioning correctly and can be easily managed and monitored.\nFigure 10.1.7.2-1: Subscription for functional alias configurations\n1.\tThe functional alias management client or MC service server subscribes to the functional alias configuration information stored at the functional alias management server using the subscribe functional alias configuration request.\n2.\tThe functional alias management server provides a subscribe functional alias configuration response to the functional alias management client or MC service server indicating success or failure of the request.\nThe procedure for notification of functional alias configuration data as described in figure 10.1.7.2-1 is used by the functional alias management server to inform the functional alias management client or MC service server that new functional alias configuration data is available.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe functional alias management client has subscribed to the functional alias configuration information\n-\tThe functional alias management server has received and stored new functional alias configuration information.\nThe figure depicts a notification of functional alias configurations, which is a crucial aspect of network management and ensures the proper functioning of the network.\nFigure 10.1.7.2-2: Notification of functional alias configurations\n1.\tThe functional alias management server provides the notification to the functional alias management client or MC service server, who previously subscribed for the functional alias configuration information.\n2.\tThe functional alias management client or MC service server provides a notify functional alias configuration response to the functional alias management server.\nIf the functional alias management server has notified the functional alias management client about new functional alias configuration information through this procedure, the functional alias management client may then follow the procedure described in subclause 10.1.7.1 in order to retrieve that functional alias configuration information.\nThere may be dynamic data associated with a functional alias. The following dynamic data is known to the MC service server and provided when requested:\nTable 10.1.7.3-1: Dynamic data associated with a functional alias\n\n",

For simplicity, only the case of two MC service groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is the same if more than two groups are combined.\nThe temporary group formation is applicable only for groups configured with at least one common MC service. The temporary group formation shall be rejected if any of the requested MC services are not common to all MC service groups in the list.\nThe temporary group created can be a broadcast group or a non-broadcast group.  The broadcast regroup is used for one-way communication where only an authorized MCX user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup members are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members).  The non-broadcast regroup is used for two-way communication where all regroup members can transmit and receive (i.e, the regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group call).  The broadcast regroup satisfies the temporary group-broadcast group requirements defined in 3GPP TS 22.180 [2] and is an alternative to the \"Temporary group – broadcast group call\" procedure (10.6.2.5.3) defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16].\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe group management client, group management server, MC service server and the MC service group members belong to the same MC system.\n2.\tThe group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the groups to be regrouped.\nThe figure depicts a group regroup for the groups within the same MC system, illustrating the hierarchical organization of the network.\nFigure 10.2.4.1-1: Group regroup for the groups within the same MC system\n1.\tThe group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup operation to the group management server, which is the group management server of one of the groups to be regrouped.

If the authorized MC service user does not specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server shall set the lowest security level and the highest priority of the constituent groups. If MC service types of the groups being combined are not identical, group management server determines the overlapping part and stores the MC service list for the temporary group.\n4.\tThe group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1's MC service group ID and group2's MC service group ID.

This process involves the MC systems forming a temporary group, which is then regrouped into a final group. The figure illustrates the process with arrows indicating the movement of the MC systems.\nFigure 10.2.4.2-1: Temporary group formation - group regrouping involving multiple MC systems\n1.\tThe group management client of the MC service user (e.g. dispatcher) requests group regroup operation to the group management server 1 (which is the group management server of one of the groups to be regrouped).

The group management client may indicate the priority level required for the temporary group. The group management client indicates whether the temporary group is a broadcast regroup.\n2.\tThe group management server checks whether group regroup operation is performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group management server 1 checks whether group1 is a temporary group. If group1 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.\n3.\tThe group management server 1 forwards the group regroup request to the target group management server 2 with the information of the group management server 2 MC service groups.\n4.\tThe group management server 2 checks whether group2 is a temporary group. If group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.\n5.\tThe group management server 2 provides a group regroup response. Due to security aspects concerning sharing information among different MC systems, the group management server 2 does not share the users' information of the groups under its management to the group management server 1. Any regroup action that violates the rules specified in subclause 10.2.4.4 shall cause a negative response and the current procedure to proceed to step 15.\nNOTE:\tIf there is a trust relationship between the primary MC service provider and the partner MC service provider, the partner MC system can share their users' information to the primary MC system at this step. If there is a change in partner MC system's constituent group membership, the synchronization procedure with the primary MC system for temporary group is out of scope of this specification\n6.\tThe group management server 1 creates and stores the information of the temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, off-network information, and the MC service IDs of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group, the security level of the temporary group, and whether the temporary group is a broadcast regroup. If the authorized MC service user does not specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server shall set the lower security level and the higher priority of the constituent groups.\n7.\tThe group management server 1 notifies the group management server 2 about its group regroup operation.\n8.\tThe group management server 2 acknowledges the group management server 1 and the group management server 2 also stores the information about the temporary group including the temporary MC service group ID, the MC service group IDs of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group and the security level of the temporary group.\n9.\tThe group management server 2 notifies the partner MC service server regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1's MC service group ID and group2's MC service group ID.\n10.\tPartner MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group management server 2.\n11.\tThe group management server 2 notifies the affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 2, possibly with an indication of a lower security level.\n12.\tThe affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 2 send individual group regroup notification responses to the group management server 2.\n13.\tThe group management server 1 notifies the MC service server of the primary system regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1's MC service group ID and group2's MC service group ID. If there are active calls to be merged, then the group management server 1 includes an indication to merge active calls.\n14.\tPrimary MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group management server 1.\n15.\tThe group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 1 by sending group regroup notification messages.\n16. The affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of group management server 1 send individual group regroup notification responses to the group management server 1.\n17.\tThe group management server 1 provides a group regroup response to the group management client of the authorized MC service user (e.g. dispatcher).\n18.\tThe affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management servers individually request group configuration data from the group management servers for the temporary group, as described in clause 10.1.5.2. The group configuration data includes security, priority, and other parameters.\nFigure 10.2.4.2a-1 below illustrates the tearing down procedure of temporary group created through the group regroup operation. The procedure can be used when, e.g., the specific task for which the temporary group was created has been completed or a busier period occurs. For simplicity, only the teardown case for a temporary group with two MC service groups is represented. The procedure is applicable for more than two groups combined in this temporary group.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe temporary group to be torn down is comprised of multiple MC service groups, and is created through the group regrouping procedure as described in subclause 10.2.4.1.\nThe figure depicts a temporary group tear down within an MC system, showing the process of removing a temporary group from the system. The figure includes a schematic representation of the system components, such as the MC unit, the temporary group, and the system's control and monitoring system. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, allowing for easier understanding of the system's operation and maintenance.\nFigure 10.2.4.2a-1: Temporary group tear down within an MC system\n1.\tThe group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup teardown operation to the group management server (which is the group management server where the temporary group is created and stored). The identity of the temporary group (MC service group ID) being torn down shall be included in this message. This message may route through some other signalling nodes.\n2.\tThe group management server checks whether group regroup operation is performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy.

This step is essential for ensuring the safety of the group and its members. The figure shows the various components involved in the tear down process, such as the temporary group, the dismantling tools, and the safety measures in place.

The identity of the temporary group (MC service group ID) being torn down shall be included in this message. This message may route through some other signalling nodes.\n2.\tThe group management server checks whether group regroup operation is performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group management server 1 checks whether the MC service group ID is a temporary group. If MC service group ID is not a temporary group, then the group regroup teardown request will be rejected, otherwise the group regroup teardown can proceed.\n3.\tThe group management server 1 tears down the temporary group, i.e., remove the temporary group related information.\n4.\tThe group management server 1 notifies the primary MC service server regarding the temporary group teardown.\n5.\tAny active group call for the temporary group is preserved until it is completed.\n6.\tThe group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MC service group members regarding the temporary group teardown by sending the group regroup teardown notification (6a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification response (6b) messages.\n7.\tThe group management server 1 sends a group regroup teardown notification (7a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification response (7b) messages with the group management server 2 – group management server in another MC system regarding the temporary group teardown.\n8.\tThe group management server 2 notifies the partner MC service server.\n9.\tThe group management server 2 notifies the affiliated MC service group members regarding the temporary group teardown by sending the group regroup teardown notification (9a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification response (9b) messages. Any active group call for the temporary group is preserved until it is completed.\n10.\tThe group management server 1 provides a group regroup teardown confirmation response to the group management client of the authorized MC service user.\nTo prevent routing issues and complexity related to group regrouping, the following rules shall be applied:\n-\tGroup regroup in either single MC system or multiple MC systems can take place if:\n-\tNone of the groups to be regrouped are temporary groups; and\n-\tThe groups to be regrouped are not already regrouped into another temporary group; and\n-\tIf the policy of the MC system does not allow a temporary group to include groups that are currently in emergency state, then regrouping of groups can take place if none of the groups to be regrouped are in emergency state.\n-\tIf the policy of the MC system allows a temporary group to include groups from other MC systems, group regrouping containing groups with multiple MC systems can take place if:\n-\tthe MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is the MC service server (controlling role) for all MC service groups involved in the regrouping; or\n-\tthe MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is an MC service server (controlling role) for at least one of the MC service groups involved in the regrouping; or\n-\tthe MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is an MC service server homed by at least one of the MC service groups and the MC system of any involved MC service group allows floor control for the set of regrouped groups to be deferred to the MC service server (controlling role) of the temporary group.\n-\tIf the policy of the MC system does not allow a temporary group to include groups from other MC systems, regrouping of groups with members spanning multiple MC systems can take place if:\n-\tthe MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is the MC service server (controlling role) for all MC service groups involved in the regrouping; or\n-\tthe MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is an MC service server (controlling role) for at least one of the MC service groups involved in the regrouping, and the MC service servers with the controlling roles for all of the groups that are regrouped are within the same MC system.\n",

Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the pre-established session modification process in a telecommunication network.\nFigure 10.3.2.3-1: Pre-established session modification\n1.\tThe MC service client within the MC service UE gathers ICE candidates, if necessary (e.g. depending on the information that needs to be updated).\n2.\tThe MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC service server to modify a pre-established session.\n3.\tMC service server performs necessary service control, obtains any necessary media parameters (e.g. by means of interacting with a media distribution function of the MC service server) and gathers necessary ICE candidates.\n4.\tMC service server sends a modify pre-establish session response to the MC service client within the MC service UE.\n5.\tIf necessary, ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MC service client within the MC service UE and a media distribution function of the MC service server.\n6.\tIf necessary the MC service client within the MC service UE sends a modify pre-established session request to the MC service server to update the ICE candidate pair for the pre-established session.\n7.\tThe MC service server sends a modify pre-established session response accepting the ICE candidate pair update.\nNOTE 1:\tThe represented procedure corresponds to a session modification initiated by the MC service client. It can also be initiated by the MC service server.\nNOTE 2:\tThe procedure can also be used to switch a media session from the inactive to the active state and the reverse. The modification of the session triggers a corresponding modification of the characteristics (e.g. activity, bandwidth) of the corresponding GBR bearers.\nFigure 10.3.2.4-1 represents the MC service client within the MC service UE initiated pre-established session release flow and figure 10.3.2.4-2 represents the MC service server initiated pre-established session release flow.\nThe figure depicts a client within the MC service UE initiating a pre-established session release, illustrating the process of establishing a session with the MC service.\nFigure 10.3.2.4-1: MC service client within the MC service UE initiated pre-established session release\n1.\tThe MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC service server to release a pre-established session.\n2.\tThe MC service server sends a release pre-establish session response to the MC service client within the MC service UE.\n3.\tThe MC service server releases all resources for the pre-established session.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a MC service server initiating a pre-established session release. The figure illustrates the network architecture, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the layered design of the optical backbone, aligning with SDN principles.\nFigure 10.3.2.4-2: MC service server initiated pre-established session release\n1.\tThe MC service server sends a request to the MC service client within the MC service UE to release a pre-established session.\n2.\tThe MC service client within the MC service UE sends a release pre-establish session response to the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server releases all resources for the pre-established session.\n",

                            "text_content": "In this scenario, the MC service server pre-establishes MBMS bearer(s) in certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of the group communication session. When a user originates a request for a group communication session for one of these areas, the pre-established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL media transmission.\nThe following steps needs to be performed prior the start of the MC group communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:\n-\tMBMS bearer(s) is Pre-established\n-\tAnnounce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the MC service clients\nWhen these preparation steps have been done the MC group communication session using MBMS bearer can start.\nBoth the media packets as well as the application level control signalling (e.g. floor control messages) to the receiving MC service clients are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the application level control messages, due to different bearer characteristic requirements.\nThe procedure figure 10.7.3.1.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service clients using an MBMS bearer. There might also be MC service clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the communication on unicast bearers.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe participating users are already affiliated.\nThe figure depicts a network setup with multiple MBMS bearers, each equipped with a unique identifier (ID) and a unique bearer ID. The bearers are interconnected through a network of optical fibers, forming a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient data transmission. The figure illustrates the use of p re-established MBMS bearers, which are designed to maintain a stable connection even in the event of a network outage. This ensures that the network remains operational and can continue to serve its users.\nFigure 10.7.3.1.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers\n1a.\tThe MC service server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. This bearer will be used for the MC communication media.\n1b.\tOptionally, the MC service server may also activate an MBMS bearer dedicated for application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is implementation specific.\n2a.\tThe MC service server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service description associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the MC service client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service description.\n2b.\tThe MC service server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service description associated with the pre-established floor control MBMS bearer to the MC service client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service description.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 2a and Step 2b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement message.\n3.\tThe MC service client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The MC service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MC service UE.\n4.\tThe MC service client that enters or is in the service area of at least one announced TMGI indicates to the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive media over MBMS, whereby the MC service server may decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for MC communication sessions.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 4 is optional for the MC service UE on subsequent MBMS bearer announcements.\n5.\tAn MC service group communication session is established.\n6.\tAs the MC service server transmits the media over the MBMS bearer, the media packets are detected and delivered to the MC service client.\nIn this scenario depicted in figure 10.7.3.2-1, the MC service server uses a unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the DL at the start of the group communication session. When the MC service server decides to use an MBMS bearer for the DL media transmission, the MC service server establishes an MBMS bearer using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. The MC service server provides MBMS service description information associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL media and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL media transmission.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MC service server logic for determining when to establish the new MBMS delivery bearer is implementation specific. For example, the MC service server could decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of the UE's that are a part of the group communication session.\nThe figure depicts a dynamic MBMS bearer establishment, illustrating the process of establishing a bearer in a network. The figure shows the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment, which is a method of establishing a bearer in a network. The figure includes various components such as the MBMS bearer, the bearer establishment process, and the network infrastructure. The figure is used to illustrate the process of establishing a bearer in a network, and it is important for understanding the network architecture and the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment.\nFigure 10.7.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment\n1.\tAn MC service group communication session is established.\n2.\tThe downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.\n3.\tThe MC service server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from the BM-SC.\n4.\tThe MC service server provides service description information associated with the MBMS bearer to the UE. The MC service UE obtains the TMGI from the announcement message. This message may be sent on an application level control signalling bearer.\n5.\tThe MC service UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI, while in the service area associated with the TMGI.\n6.\tThe MC service UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated with the TMGI.\n7.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server the MBMS listening status associated to the monitored TMGI, (e.g. that it is successfully receiving the TMGI). The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of the TMGI. MC service server stops sending media data over unicast way to the MC service client.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MBMS reception quality level may be used by the MC service server to make an efficient decision to switch again to a unicast transmission or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services).\n8.\tAn MC service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is established.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 8 can occur before step 7.\n9.\tMC service server sends the downlink media for the group communication session over the MBMS.\nFigure 10.7.3.3-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is about to move out of MBMS coverage by switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that the MBMS bearer has been activated by MC service server for downlink delivery.\nThe figure depicts a switch transitioning from MBMS (Multi-Band Multicast) delivery to unicast delivery in a network. The switch is equipped with multiple ports, each capable of delivering data packets to different destinations. The switch's design is based on the principles of SDN (Software-Defined Networking), allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure 10.7.3.3-1: Switching from MBMS delivery to unicast delivery\n1.\tThe MC service UE detects that it suffers from bad MBMS bearer condition for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is implementation specific.\n2.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it suffers from bad MBMS bearer condition for the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS listening status report.\nNOTE 1:\tTo efficiently notify the MC service server, e.g., when the MC service client detects that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services, the MC service client proactively may send to the MC service server a MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception quality level.\n3.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink data by unicast delivery to the MC service client.\nNOTE 2:\tThe unicast bearer may be set up on demand after step 2 or before.\n4.\tDuring the switching, the MC service client simultaneously receives downlink data through both unicast bearer and MBMS bearer. If there is no downlink data to the MC service client, this step can be skipped.\n5.\tThe MC service client ceases to receive the downlink data through MBMS bearer but continues receiving data through unicast bearer.\nThe MC service server may use an MBMS bearer for application level control signalling, according to this subclause. An MBMS bearer for application level control signalling is typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for using MBMS for resource efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance (KPIs), handling of high load scenarios.\nThe MBMS bearer for application level control signalling may be used to transmit the following messages:\n-\tTransmission control (e.g. call setup and floor control)\n-\tMBMS bearer announcement for media bearers\n-\tGroup application paging\n-\tGroup dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)\n-\tGroup state (e.g. emergency alerts)\nAn MBMS bearer for application level control signalling is activated in a service area that is larger than the estimated service for media bearers. The service area for the media bearers mainly based on counting of group members in each defined service area. The MBMS bearer for application level control signalling is also activated with a QoS that is better than MBMS media bearers since the packet loss requirements are much stricter.\nThe MC service client shall not send responses to group-addressed application level control signalling unless instructed or configured to respond.\nThe procedure in figure 10.7.3.4.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service clients using an MBMS bearer.\nThe figure depicts a diagram illustrating the use of MBMS bearer for application-level control signalling in a 5G network. It shows the various components involved, such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 10.7.3.4.2-1: Use of MBMS bearer for application level control signalling\n1.\tThe MC service server determines to activate MBMS bearer for application level control signalling, The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n2.\tThe MC service server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service description associated MBMS bearer to the MC service client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service description.\n3.\tThe MC service client stores the information associated with the TMGI. The MC service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MC service UE.\n4.\tThe MC service client that enters or is in the service area of the announced TMGI indicates to the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive application level control messages over the MBMS bearer. The MC service client may also indicate at which MBMS reception quality level it has received the MC service media on the MBMS bearer. Hence, the MC service server may decide to use the MBMS bearer for MC application control messages.\n5.\tThe MC service server transmit MC application control messages\nThe MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer. Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive way of doing announcement. The MC service server will send the MBMS bearer announcement message to the MC service client regardless if there is an MBMS bearer active or the MC service client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it gives a secure way to inform the MC service client about the MBMS bearer and how to retrieve the data on the MBMS bearer.\nWhen there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for MC service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for additional MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application level control signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.\nThe MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting compared to an MBMS bearer used for media, since application signalling messages are more sensitive to packet loss.\nThe procedure defined below enables the MC service to announcement a new MBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tAn MBMS bearer used for MC service application control messages must have been pre-established and announced to the MC service client.\n-\tAdditional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the client.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for application control messages. The MBMS bearer is a signaling protocol used in 5G networks, and the figure illustrates the process of announcing application control messages over the MBMS bearer.\nFigure 10.7.3.5.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for application control messages\n1.\tThe MC service client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for MC service application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.\n2.\tThe MC service server activates a new MBMS bearer.\n3.\tThe MC service server announce the MBMS bearer to the MC service client. The bearer may have just been activated or may have already been running for some time. The step may be repeated as needed.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer used for MC application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement contains the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally include additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and optional MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In this case the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer details.\n5.\tThe MC service clients start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.\n6.\tIf requested by the MC service server, the MC service client sends an acknowledgement of the MBMS bearer to the MC service server.\n7.\tThe MC service server de-announce the MBMS bearer.\n8.\tThe MC service server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that contains the identity of the MBMS bearer.\n9.\tThe MC service client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.\nThe same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.\nThe MC service client and MC service server use this procedure to report and take action on the MBMS bearer quality. An MC service client monitors an MBMS bearer to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality), the MC service client needs to inform the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality, the MC service client may notify the MC service server at which MBMS reception quality level it has received the MC service media on the MBMS bearer.\nThe issue can be more complex since the MC service client needs to estimate the quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently transmitted on the MBMS bearer (e.g. between MCPTT group call). The reason for this is that an MC service client that has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even notice that an MC service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the MC server still assumes that the MC service client can receive the media being broadcasted.\nTo estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g. RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.\nThe MC service client shall indicate the ability of the MC service client to receive the MBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThere is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is announced to the MC service client\n-\tThe MC service client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area\n-\tThe MC service UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the modulation and coding scheme\n-\tThe MC service UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer quality detection system, which is a crucial component in ensuring the quality of communication between the sender and receiver. The system uses a combination of hardware and software to detect and analyze the quality of the MBMS bearer signal. This is important for ensuring reliable communication in various communication scenarios, such as in a 5G network.\nFigure 10.7.3.6.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection\n1.\tThe MC service client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be reported to the MC service server. The MC service client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the MBMS service server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The MC service client may also map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality level the MC service media has been received. Based on the MBMS reception quality level, the MC service server may efficiently decide to switch to another bearer or to take measures to prepare such a switch.\nEditor's note:\tThe set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the MC service client sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been acceptable or not to receive a specific MC service media. If the MBMS bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the MC service client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception quality level.\nNOTE 2:\tPrior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer of the communication to unicast.\nNOTE 3:\tThe threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on service type (i.e. MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.\n3.\tThe MC service server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g. information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS bearer announcement message.\nThis subclause specify service continuity scenario when MBMS bearers are used. There are different solutions for different scenarios.\nThe service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a larger area. In mission critical communication several media streams may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one media stream (e.g. MCPTT group call) may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. An MC service client that is interested in receiving a media stream that is broadcasted in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2.\nThe figure depicts two MBMS bearers using overlapping MBSFN areas, illustrating the use of multiple frequency bands and the potential for increased spectral efficiency.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas\nThe procedural steps will work as follows:\nThe figure depicts a service continuity diagram for mobile backhaul networks, illustrating the transition from one MBSFN (Mobile Backhaul Service Node) to another. The diagram shows the path of the signal, including the MBSFN, the MBSFN-to-MBSFN link, and the MBSFN-to-MBSFN-to-MBSFN link. The dashed lines represent the redundancy paths, ensuring that the signal can be rerouted in case of failure. The figure is a visual representation of the service continuity concept, which is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of mobile backhaul networks.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another\n\n1.\tThe UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional MBMS bearers that the MC service client is interested in are active in the current cell.\n2.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is successfully receiving the MC service media over TMGI 1. The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MBMS reception quality level may be used by the MC service server to make an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer, or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services).\n3.\tThe UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast the same service on both TMGIs.\n4.\tLocation information are provided from the MC service UE via the Location management client to the Location management server. For that, the MC service UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block (SIB) transmitted by the radio cells. The location management server provides the location information to the MC service server.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether the MC service server has subscribed for notifications, as described in clause 10.9.3.6.1 of the present document, Event-trigger location information notification procedure, or uses on-demand requests, as described in clause 10.9.3.6.2 of the present document, On-demand usage of location information procedure, is out of scope.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends to the MC service client a MBMS bearer announcement with information related to TMGI 2 (if the MC service server had not done it before). Hence, the MC service client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same MC service media.\n6.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is successfully receiving TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level per TMGI.\n7.\tThe MC service client may receive the MC service media over both MBMS bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The MC service client may also verify that it is the same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to perform error corrections.\n8.\tThe UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is active.\n9.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is successfully receiving the MC service media over TMGI 2. The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.\n10.\tThe MC service client receives the MC service media only over TMGI 2.\n\nThis service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may occur if the UE would request to transfer the media stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still required that the MC service client sends a location report (and MBMS listening report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the MBMS listening report by the MC service client to the MC service server a unicast bearer is needed. The location report from the MC service client is required, since the MC service server must know that the UE has entered a new area and can only listen to MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the MC service server might send a media stream that the MC service client is required to listen to on the MBMS bearer 1, since the MC service server still assumes that the UE is located in the MBSFN area 1.\nThe solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 10.7.3.7.2-3. In this case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS bearers are used only for media. An application level signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is used for floor control messages and other application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS bearer TMGI 9. A similar concept was already introduced in 3GPP TS 23.179 [7] subclause 10.10.2, where the procedure allowed a separate MBMS bearer for floor control signalling. The application level signalling bearer will be used for all control messages needed for both media MBMS bearer (TMGI 1 and TMGI2).\nBy using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9) the MC service clients can receive floor control messages for all calls going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A MC service client that is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a MCPTT group call transmission only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that specific call over a unicast instead. Without the information received over TMGI 9 the MC service client must immediately report that the MC service client has left the broadcast area that the MC service server assumes that the MC service client is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for the MC service client to inform the MC service server of a location change.\nThe figure depicts two MBMS bearers using overlapping MBSFN areas, with a separate MC application signalling bearer. The overlapping MBSFN areas allow for efficient use of the available spectrum, while the separate MC application bearer ensures that the two bearers can communicate with each other without interfering with the other. This design is crucial for ensuring reliable communication in a multi-user environment.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a separate MC application signalling bearer\nThe procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in this subclause. However, in this scenario the MC service client is not required to initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report). The UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area (i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all floor control messages for all calls ongoing in both areas. If the UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that does not transmit the media of interest the UE can report to the server that it is not able to listen to the media over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the server to use a unicast bearer instead.\nThis procedure handles a scenario when UE is moving from a location when the UE is experiencing good reception of the MBMS bearer to a location outside the MBMS service coverage. The MC service client apply a service continuity procedure to ensure that the service can be maintained and that the packet loss can be minimized during transition to a UE-to-Network relay connection. The solution also provides the benefit that it offloads the cell when UEs that normally would trigger a transfer from MBMS bearers to unicast bearers when moving outside the MBMS coverage area.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.3-1 below illustrates the concept of this procedure. In the figure UE A (with the MC service client) is first within the MBMS coverage (the far right most location). The MBMS coverage is represented by the dashed circle. The UE A is the moving outside the MBMS coverage and first enters a location in which the MBMS signal is not good enough, but in this location there is still coverage to use\tunicast bearers. Unicast bearers use link adaption and retransmission so the coverage area for unicast bearers is larger than the coverage of the MBMS bearers. The solid circle outer line represents the coverage of the unicast bearer.\nA UE that is leaving the area of MBMS coverage may in this scenario trigger a ProSe discovery procedure to initiate the establishment a relay communication path to UE-R. A UE that is receiving media over an MBMS bearer (and is in idle mode) and for the moment does not need a unicast bearer is costly (from a resource efficiency point of view) to transfer to a unicast bearer due to the need for retransmissions and robust coding in the outer part of cell.\nWhen the ProSe communication path is established the UE A may continue to receive the media over the relay UE-R.\nThe figure depicts a UE (User Equipment) moving from a position within a mobile base station (MBMS) coverage to an area outside the network coverage, highlighting the potential for unicast communication in this scenario.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.3-1: UE A is moving from a position in MBMS coverage to outside the network coverage passing an area where only unicast is possible\nThe procedure defined in this subclause allows for MBMS bearer service continuity when UE is moving from a MBMS coverage area to outside the MBMS coverage area. The procedure applies when the UE is not finding a target cell with good RSRP/RSRQ (receiving strong reference signals from other cells), which could trigger normal cell reselection procedure. In such scenario other aspects should be evaluated to trigger to a relay communication path.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service client UE is not using a unicast bearer when this procedure applies.\nThe figure depicts a service continuity scenario over MBMS bearer using UE-to-network relay. It illustrates the use of a relay to ensure uninterrupted communication in the event of network failure. The relay is positioned between the UE and the network, allowing the UE to continue its communication without interruption. This figure is crucial for ensuring the reliability of MBMS bearer services in a network environment.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.3-2: Service continuity over MBMS bearer using UE-to-network relay\n1.\tThe MC service client estimate the MBMS bearer quality. The MC service clients also measure the reference signals from other cells to estimate the possibilities to transfer to unicast and perform a cell reselection procedure.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality has reach a certain threshold the MC service client performs ProSe UE-to-network relay discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay (UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].\n3.\tNormal service continuity procedure for a UE-to-network relay. This may be done according to annex B.\n4.\tThe MC service client informs the UE-R about the reception of media over the MBMS bearer. This includes sending the TMGIs, MBMS SAIs and ProSe per packet priority to the UE-R. This procedure is specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].\n5.\tThe UE-R will relay the MBMS media using one-to-many ProSe Direct Communication. The UE-R may also relay requests to transfer the media flow from multicast to unicast and vice versa.\n\nIn this procedure the MC service client is requested by the MC service server to send a MBMS suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can be included in the MBMS bearer announcement and the MC service server may choose to only send this request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all MC service clients.\nThe information flow below defines a procedure in which the MC service client notifies the MC service server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.\nThe MC service server can decide on a subset of all UEs in the MBMS broadcast area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the MC service server make the decision of the UE subset, consideration shall be taken to the location of the UEs, since UEs location is dynamically changed. This means that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be updated regularly based on the UEs mobility.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer\nThe figure depicts a MBMS suspension notification from a MC service client, indicating that the MBMS service is currently suspended. The notification is sent to the MC service client, which is a device that communicates with the MBMS service to receive and send messages. The figure shows the MBMS service status, which is currently suspended, and the reason for the suspension, which is due to a technical issue. The figure also includes a visual representation of the MBMS service, showing the status of the MBMS service and the status of the MC service client.\nFigure 10.7.3.8.2-1:\tMBMS suspension notification from MC service client\n1.\tThe MC service server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to the MC service client.\nNOTE:\tThis message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.\n2.\tRAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].\n3.\tAn MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].\n4.\tThe MC service client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS suspension report.\nMC service client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report shall still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). An MC service client shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS listening reports).\nThe same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that may be detected by the MC service client.\n\nTo avoid allocating duplicate bearers for an MBMS service area, a single MC service server may manage all the MBMS media transmission for all groups and users within a particular MBMS service area. An MC service server controlling the MBMS bearer has the MBMS bearer control role. Different MC service servers may allocate bearers as needed and make them available for other MC service servers to use. The use of the procedure in this sub clause is optional. MC system that supports multi-server bearer coordination shall use this procedure.\nNOTE:\tWithin one group communication session, multiple MC service servers (participating role) might be involved. Multiple MBMS service areas might have sufficient MC service group members to warrant multiple MBMS bearers to be used and therefore multiple MC service servers (MBMS bearer control role) might be involved. For brevity, this clause only illustrates the simplest case.\nThe procedure in this sub clause may be used when two or more MC service servers are serving users in the same area and are configured to share MBMS bearers for that specific area. The MC service servers may be of the same kind or different kind. The MC service servers are not participating in the same group call, which means that each MC service server broadcast media independently of each other.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tAll MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those MC service servers that are configured to take the MBMS bearer control role.\nThe figure depicts a complex MBMS procedure with multiple servers, each responsible for a specific step in the process. The diagram illustrates the flow of data from the source to the destination, with each server playing a crucial role in the overall operation. The use of arrows and labels helps to clearly communicate the sequence of actions and the interdependencies between servers.\nFigure 10.7.3.9.2.1-1: Multiple server MBMS procedure\n1.\tThe MC service server 1 evaluates whether multicast is desired for each service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon the locations, affiliation status and other factors.\n2.\tThe MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has already established a bearer with coverage for the MBMS service area where multicast is desired. To do this, the MC service server 1 consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover bearer request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.\nNOTE:\tMC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized entity for MBMS bearer control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service servers of all types can be configured to discover bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBMS bearer controller for all MC services.\n3.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) responds with a discover bearer response indicating whether there is an MBMS bearer available in the specific MBMS service area with the requested bandwidth. The discover bearer response message includes the TMGI of the bearer that is shared between the MC service servers. If the bearer of interest has insufficient bandwidth, the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another bearer for the congested area. If a duplicate bearer is allocated for the same area, the bearer should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down as soon as the congestion on the original bearer clears up, in order to conserve resources.\nFor any MBMS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBMS service areas via multicast by setting up a bearer. The bearer set up by the MC service server 1 may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for other MC service groups.\n4.\tThe MC service server 1 performs the MBMS bearer announcement and the MBMS listening reporting according relevant procedures specified in this specification. If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBMS related location information from the users utilizing the services from MC service server 1, the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBMS bearer announcement and handling the listening reports on behalf of MC service server 1. Listening reports shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1 and MC service server 2.\n5.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role). The media distribution request is sent to reserve the specified capacity in the MBMS bearer.\n6.\tMC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) sends a media distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be supported and supplies details about the bearer.\n7.\tThe MC service server 1 establishes a group communication session via the bearer, informing MBMS connected MC service clients 1 and 2 that a group communication session is about to start on the MBMS bearer. This step is equivalent to MapGroupToBearer in MCPTT.\n8.\tMC service client 2 sends media on the uplink to the MC service server 1\n9.\tThe MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role).\n10.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) distributes the media to MBMS served MC service client 1 via multicast.\n11.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request, informing the MC service server 2 (MBMB bearer control role) to request the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) to release the capacity that was reserved in step 5.\n12.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) respond to the request by sending a media distribution release request.\nThe procedure in this sub clause may be used when two MC service servers are serving users in the same area and are configured to share MBMS bearers for that specific area. The MC service servers are of the same kind, and the MC service servers may participate in the same group call, and by that have a need to broadcast the same content.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tAll MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those MC service servers that are configured to take the MBMS bearer control role.\nThe figure depicts a multiple server MBMS procedure, illustrating the steps involved in managing multiple servers in a multi-server MBMS (Multi-server MBMS) system. The diagram shows the server setup, the MBMS procedure, and the communication between servers. The figure is crucial for understanding the system's architecture and the steps required to manage multiple servers in a multi-server MBMS system.\nFigure 10.7.3.9.2.2-1: Multiple server MBMS procedure\n1.\tThe MC service server 1 evaluates whether multicast is desired for each service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon the locations, affiliation status and other factors.\n2.\tThe MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has already established a bearer with coverage for the MBMS service area where multicast is desired. To do this, the MC service server 1 consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover bearer request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.\nNOTE 1:\tMC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized entity for MBMS bearer control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service servers of all types can be configured to discover bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBMS bearer controller for all MC services.\n3.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) responds with a discover bearer response indicating whether there is an MBMS bearer available in the specific MBMS service area with the requested bandwidth. The discover bearer response message includes the TMGI of the bearer that is shared between the MC service servers. If the bearer of interest has insufficient bandwidth, the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another bearer for the congested area. If a duplicate bearer is allocated for the same area, the bearer should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down as soon as the congestion on the original bearer clears up, in order to conserve resources.\nFor any MBMS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBMS service areas via multicast by setting up a bearer. The bearer set up by the MC service server 1 may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for other MC service groups.\n4.\tThe MC service server 1 performs the MBMS bearer announcement and the MBMS listening reporting according relevant procedures specified in this specification. If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBMS related location information from the users utilizing the services from MC service server 1, the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBMS bearer announcement and handling the listening reports on behalf of MC service server 1. Listening reports shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1 and MC service server 2.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 1-4 is also performed by MC service server 3, but is not shown in the procedure to make it easier to read.\n5.\tThe MC service client 2 initiate a group call that is subject for multicast transmission. In this scenario there are more than one MC service server (i.e. MC service server 1 and MC service server 3) that serves MC service clients that are affiliated to the group, and by that should receive the media in the group call.\n6a.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role). The media distribution request includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution request is used for this specific group call.\n6b.\tThe MC service server 3 sends a media distribution request to the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role). The media distribution request includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution request is used for this specific group call.\n7a.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) sends a media distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be supported and supplies details about the bearer. This also includes details on which media stream that should be used for broadcasting the media on the MBMS bearer. This information is used in the MapGroupToBearer message sent by the MC service server when setting up the group call.\n7b.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) sends a media distribution response to the MC service server 3 indicating that the group call is already transmitted on the MBMS bearer by another MC service server. Based on the information, the MC service server 3 could decide to not broadcast media if media is already being broadcasted.\n8a.\tThe media is sent from the MC service client 2 to MC service server 1, which is the participating server for the MC service group of the group call.\n8b.\tThe media is forwarded to all MC service servers that are serving users that takes part in the group call.\nNOTE 3:\tThe figure above does not visualize the participating server for the MC service group and controlling server for the MC service group. The media is sent to all participating servers for the MC service group which are the servers that decide on unicast or multicast transmission.\n9.\tThe MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role).\n10.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) distributes the media to MBMS served MC service client 1 via multicast.\n11.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request, informing the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) to request the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) to release the capacity that was reserved in step 5. The media distribution release request shall only be sent when the group call is terminated. 12.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) respond to the request by sending a media distribution release request.\nThe MC service server is an instantiation of a GCS AS. For the MC service server to know the status of the MBMS bearer, and thus know the networks ability to deliver the service, it is required that the network provides MBMS bearer event notifications to the MC service server. The different events notified to the MC service server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios.\nEditor's note:\tThe procedure defined in this sub clause requires an enhancement to GCSE and RAN and is therefore subject to implementation in EPC and RAN.\nThe procedure in figure 10.7.3.10.2-1 shows notification information flows from MC service server to BM-SC.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer event notification, which is a crucial component in the MBMS (Multi-Band Massive MIMO) system. The figure shows the MBMS bearer event notification process, including the MBMS bearer, the event notification, and the response from the MBMS system. This figure is crucial for understanding the MBMS system's functionality and how it interacts with the MBMS bearer.\nFigure 10.7.3.10.2-1: MBMS bearer event notification\n1.\tThe MC service server activates an MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n2.\tThe BMSC will respond to the activation with an Activate MBMS bearer response message, according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n3.\tThe EPC and RAN will initiate the MBMS session start procedure according to 3GPP TS 23.246 [11]. This procedure is outside the scope of this specification.\n4.\tAt the first indication of a successful MBMS session start procedure, the BM-SC sends a MBMS bearer event notification, indicating that the MBMS bearer is ready to use.\n5.\tThe MC service server starts to use the MBMS bearer according to the MBMS procedures in this specification.\n6.\tAn event from RAN related to the MBMS session is received by the BM-SC.\n7.\tThe BM-SC notifies the MC service server of certain MBMS related events including references to affected MBMS services areas or list of cells. Example of such events may be radio resources not available, overload, MBMS suspension.\n8.\tThe MC service server may decide, based on the received events, to switch to unicast transmission for relevant MC service clients.\nNOTE:\tSteps 6-8 should be seen as example events from the network that may occur and possible actions taken by the MC service server. These steps may be done at any time and repeatedly during the life time of an MBMS bearer.\nApplication layer FEC can be used to recover the packet losses when delivering a MC service over MBMS, to reach its required level of QoS.\nSupport of FEC is optional for the MC service servers and MC service clients\nAdding FEC introduces an extra latency in the end to end media transport. This extra latency is bounded to fulfil the low latency requirements for mission critical services.\nFEC can be applied by the BM-SC if required by the MC service server (subclause 10.7.3.11.2), or directly by the MC service server (subclause 10.7.3.11.3). FEC is decoded by the MC service client. Either method is independent of the other.\nThe MC service server may consider the listening status reports from previous MBMS bearer quality detection procedures (subclause 10.7.3.6) to adjust the FEC parameters when delivering over a new MBMS bearer.\nIn this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.11.2-1, the MC service server asks the BM-SC to apply FEC to a set of medias, transported by a MBMS bearer, using the Setup FEC request.\nThis procedure can be applied when using pre-established MBMS bearers (10.7.3.1) or dynamic MBMS bearers (10.7.3.2).\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe MC service server has already activated a MBMS Bearer, with the MBMS Bearer request specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n\nThe figure depicts the application of FEC (Frame Error Correction) by the BM-SC (Base Station-Side Channel) in a 5G network. It illustrates the process of error detection and correction, highlighting the importance of FEC in ensuring reliable communication. The figure shows the transmission of frames over a fiber-optic backbone, with redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 10.7.3.11.2-1: Application of FEC by the BM-SC\n1.\tThe MC service server decides to set up FEC for a set of MC service media flows. The request is done on the MB2-C reference point. It includes the following elements: the TMGI of the bearer transporting those media, the media descriptions (codecs, transport protocols, bitrates, destination ip addresses and ports), the identification of the FEC repair packet flow (IP destination and port), an upper bound to the additional latency resulting to FEC application.  The MC Service server may perform this request several times to protect separately different sets of media transported within the same MBMS bearer.\n2.\tIf the BM-SC can satisfy the request, the Setup FEC response includes a modified list of media information and FEC information. The response also includes an identifier to the FEC process instance, which can be used to release the application of FEC for these media flows.\nNOTE 1:\tSource media packets may be modified by the application of FEC (e.g. addition of a footer of header), leading to a modification of the delivery protocol to be announced within the media information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Release FEC request is not shown on the figure.\n3.\tThe MC service server announces the MBMS bearer to the MC service client with the MBMS bearer announcement procedure, including the modified list of medias information and FEC information within the SDP information.\n4.\tWhen the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [12].\n5.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media to the BM-SC on the MB2-U reference points and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n6. The BM-SC performs FEC encoding of the downlink media in accordance to the announced FEC algorithm and parameters and delivers it over MBMS.\n7. The MC service client performs FEC decoding of the encoded media flows in accordance to the announced FEC information and delivers the decoded flows to the media player.\nEditor's note: the need for a MC service server ability to turn off/on the production of repair packets on the BM-SC during the media transmission must be discussed, and may impact the procedure.\nIn this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.11.3-1, FEC encoding is performed by the MC service server. The MC service server includes the FEC information within the MBMS bearer announcement. The FEC decoding is performed by the MC service client.\nThe figure depicts the application of FEC (Frame Error Correction) by the MC service server, illustrating the process of error correction in a network.\nFigure 10.7.3.11.3-1: Application of FEC by the MC service server\n1.\tThe MC service server sends MBMS bearer announcement message with FEC information to the MC service clients.\n2.\tAs media packets arrive from the originating MC service UE (not shown in diagram), the media is processed by the media distribution function on the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server performs FEC encoding and processing in accordance with the selected FEC algorithm.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the media with FEC to the MC service client (both payload source packets and the FEC repair packets are sent on the MB2-U to the BM-SC, which transparently forwards them unmodified to the MC service client).\n5.\tMC service client performs FEC decoding and processing in accordance with the selected FEC algorithm\nSupport of ROHC over MBMS is optional for the MC service servers and MC service clients. If header compression and FEC are both applied to a communication over MBMS, the header compression shall be performed after the FEC encoding.\nThese procedures can be applied when using pre-established MBMS bearers (see clause 10.7.3.1) or dynamic MBMS bearers (see clause 10.7.3.2).\nIn this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.12.2-1, header compression is performed by the MC service server. The MC service server includes the ROHC information within the MBMS bearer announcement. The header decompression is performed by the MC service client.\nThe figure depicts a header compression process by the MC service server, which is a crucial component in the network's data transmission. The MC service server compresses the header of the data packet, reducing its size and improving the efficiency of the network. This process is essential for reducing the network's bandwidth usage and improving the overall performance of the network.\nFigure 10.7.3.12.2-1: Header compression by the MC service server\n1.\tThe MC service server sends MBMS bearer announcement message with ROHC information to the MC service clients. The ROHC information contains the list of ROHC profiles and the ROHC context identifier range).\n2.\tWhen the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12].\n3.\tAs media packets arrive from the originating MC service UE (not shown in diagram), the media is processed by the media distribution function on the MC service server.\n4.\tThe MC service server performs header compression in accordance with the ROHC information.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends the header compressed media to the MC service client\n6.\tThe MC service client performs header decompression in accordance to the ROHC information\nIn this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.12.3-1, the MC service server asks the BM-SC to compress headers for a set of medias, transported by a MBMS bearer, using the Setup ROHC request.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe MC service server has already activated a MBMS Bearer, with the MBMS Bearer request specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n\nThe figure depicts a header compression technique used by the BM-SC (Baseband-to-Signal Converter) in a 5G network. The compression is achieved by using a combination of bit-level and word-level compression techniques, which are crucial for reducing the size of the header while maintaining the integrity of the data. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the header size is limited, such as in mobile devices or IoT devices. The figure also highlights the importance of error correction and error detection in 5G networks, as these are critical for ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 10.7.3.12.3-1: Header compression by the BM-SC\n1.\tThe MC service server decides to set up ROHC within a MBMS bearer. The request is done on the MB2-C reference point. It includes the following elements: the ROHC configuration, the list of RTP and UDP flows to be header compressed, characterized by their destination IPs and port numbers. For each of these flows, the request may indicate a target periodicity for the full header packets.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MC service server can later modify the ROHC configuration by performing again the Setup ROHC request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Release ROHC request is also not shown on the figure.\n2.\tIf the BM-SC can satisfy the request, the Setup ROHC response confirm the application of header compression.\n3.\tThe MC service server announces the MBMS bearer to the MC service client with the MBMS bearer announcement procedure, including the ROHC information.\n4.\tWhen the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12].\n5.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media to the BM-SC on the MB2-U reference points and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n6.\tThe BM-SC compresses headers of the downlink media in accordance to the announced ROHC parameters and delivers it over MBMS.\n7.\tThe MC service client performs header decompression in accordance to the ROHC information.\nThe MC service server, e.g., MCPTT server, may use the MBMS bearer to inform the status of a group communication (indicating the group call is on-going or not) when the group call is set up on unicast bearers. The affiliated clients that will perform late entry chat group calls or rejoin calls may use this group status information to decide whether to join the calls. The information flows for group status notification are specified in subclause 10.7.2.12.\nNOTE:\tThe procedure described in clause 10.7.3.4 can be used for the transmission of the group status notification.\n",

The decision to report location information can be triggered at the location management client by different conditions. The conditions could include, for example, the reception of the location reporting configuration, initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI change, MBMS session change, leaving a specific MBMS bearer service area, tracking area change, PLMN change, call initiation, or other types of events such as emergency alert, emergency call or imminent peril calls. The location report can include information described as time of measurement, accuracy, longitude, latitude, speed, bearing, altitude, ECGI, MBMS SAIs.\nThe figure depicts a detailed event-triggered location reporting procedure in a location management system. It illustrates the steps involved in reporting location changes, including the triggering mechanism, the reporting process, and the response to the location change. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the system's functionality, making it easy for users to understand the system's operation.\nFigure 10.9.3.1-1: Event-triggered location reporting procedure\n1.\tThe location management server sends location reporting configuration message to the location management client(s) containing the initial configuration (or a subsequent update) for reporting the location of the MC service UE. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to a specific location management client or as a group message over an MBMS bearer to update the location reporting configuration for multiple location management clients at the same time.\nNOTE 2:\tThe location reporting configuration information can be made part of the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.\nNOTE 3:\tDifferent location management clients may be given different location reporting criteria.\n2.\tA location reporting event occurs, triggering step 3.\n3.\tThe location management client sends a location information report to the location management server, containing location information identified by the location management server and available to the location management client.\n4.\tUpon receiving the report, the location management server updates location of the reporting location management client. If the location management server does not have location information of the reporting location management client before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location management client. If the location information report contains an optional MC service UE label, the location management server stores it together with the location information for the reporting location management client.\n\nNOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nThe location management server can request MC service UE location information at any time by sending a location information request to the location management client, which may trigger location management client to immediately send the location report.\nThe figure depicts a detailed on-demand location reporting procedure for a wireless network, illustrating the steps involved in reporting location information to a central server. The figure includes a flowchart, a list of steps, and a table that outlines the process. The steps include selecting the location, obtaining the location information, and reporting the location information to the central server. The table provides a structured format for the data to be reported, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\nFigure 10.9.3.2-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure\n1.\tBased on configurations such as periodical location information timer, or location information request from other entities (e.g., another location management client of an authorized user, MC service server), location management server initiates the immediate request of location information to be sent from the location management client.\n2.\tThe location management server sends a location information request to the location management client.\n3.\tThe location management client immediately responds to the location management server with a report containing location information identified by the location management server and available to the location management client.\n4.\tUpon receiving the report, the location management server updates location of the reporting location management client. If the location management server does not have location information of the reporting location management client, the location management server just stores the reporting location information for that location management client. If the location information report contains an optional MC service UE label, the location management server stores it together with the location information for the reporting location management client.\nNOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nFigure 10.9.3.3-1 illustrates the high level procedure of client-triggered location reporting.\nThe figure depicts a client-triggered location reporting procedure, which is a crucial component of location-based services (LBS) in mobile networks. It illustrates the steps involved in reporting a user's location, including the client initiating the reporting process, the server receiving the request, and the server processing the request and providing the location information. The figure is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of location-based services in mobile networks.\nFigure 10.9.3.3-1: Client-triggered location reporting procedure\n1.\tLocation management client 2 (authorized MC service user) sends a location reporting trigger to the location management server to activate a location reporting procedure for obtaining the location information of location management client 1.\n2.\tLocation management server checks whether location management client 2 is authorized to send a location reporting trigger for location management client 1's location information. Depending on the information specified by the location reporting trigger, location management server initiates an on-demand location reporting procedure or an event-triggered location reporting procedure for the location of location management client 1.\nNOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nThe location reporting cancel procedure reuses the information flow of location reporting configuration.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe location management client has been provided with location reporting configuration information.\n\nThe figure depicts a location reporting cancel procedure, which is a crucial step in the process of reporting a location change. It shows the steps taken by the user to cancel a location report, including the necessary information to be provided, the steps to be taken, and the final outcome of the cancellation. This figure is essential for ensuring accurate and timely location reporting in various applications.\nFigure 10.9.3.4-1: Location reporting cancel procedure\n1.\tThe location management server sends location reporting configuration without any information element to the location management client to stop location reporting from the MC service UE.\n2.\tThe location management client stops sending location information reports to the location management server.\nNOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nFigure 10.9.3.5-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information subscription request. The same procedure can be applied for location management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to MC service user location information.\nThe figure depicts a location information subscription request procedure, illustrating the steps involved in obtaining location information from a user's device. The figure includes a user interface (UI) with a form for entering the user's location, a map with the location, and a button for submitting the request. The figure also includes a legend to explain the different types of location information available.\nFigure 10.9.3.5-1: Location information subscription request procedure\n1.\tMC service server or location management client sends a location information subscription request to the location management server to subscribe location information of one or more MC service users.\n2.\tThe location management server checks if the location management client is authorized to initiate the location information subscription request.\nNOTE 2:\tAs the MC service server is implicitly trusted, the Location management server needs not to check the authorization for the MC service server.\n3.\tThe location management server replies with a location information subscription response indicating the subscription status.\nNOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nFigure 10.9.3.6.1-1 illustrates the high level procedure of event-trigger usage of location information.  The same procedure can be applied for location management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location information of MC service user.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe MC service server or location management client has subscribed to the location information of a target MC service user.\nThe figure depicts a detailed process for using location information in an event-triggered system. It illustrates the steps involved in triggering an event based on the location of a device, such as a sensor or a user. The figure shows the flow of data from the sensor to the system, and the steps to trigger an event when the sensor's location changes. This process is crucial for applications that require real-time location-based services, such as navigation, security, and location-based marketing.\nFigure 10.9.3.6.1-1: Event-trigger usage of location information procedure\n1.\tBased on configuration, e.g., subscription, periodical location information timer, the location management server is triggered to report the latest user location information of the target MC service user to the subscribed MC service server or subscribed location management client. The location management server has verified that the subscribed MC service server or subscribed location management client is authorized to receive the user location information of the target MC service user.\n2.\tThe location management server sends the location information notification including the latest location information of one MC service user to the MC service server or to the location management client. The latest location information is derived from the location report procedure as described in clause 10.9.3.1, or from PLMN operator (e.g. LCS network). If the optional MC service UE label is present, the location management server sends it, as part of the location information notification, to the MC service user.\nNOTE 2: The MC service server does not receive the MC service UE label.\nNOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nThe MC service server or the location management client can request location information at any time by sending a location information request to the location management server, which may trigger location management server to send the location information report immediately.\nFigure 10.9.3.6.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of on-demand usage of location information. The same procedure can be applied for other entities that would like to subscribe to location information at the location management server of an MC service user.\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for on-demand usage of location information, including the steps to access and utilize the location information.\nFigure 10.9.3.6.2-1: On-demand usage of location information procedure\n1.\tMC service server or location management client send a location information request to the location management server.\n2.\tThe location management server checks if the location management client is authorized to request the location information.\nNOTE 2:\tAs the MC service server is implicitly trusted, the Location management server needs not to check the authorization for the MC service server.\n3.\tThe location management server acquires the latest location of the MC service clients being requested, by triggering an on-demand location report procedure as described in clause 10.9.3.2, or from PLMN operator (e.g. LCS network).\n4.\tThen, location management server immediately sends the location information report including the latest location information acquired of one MC service user to the MC service server or to the location management client. If the optional MC service UE label is present, the location management server sends it, as part of the location information report, to the MC service user.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MC service server does not receive the MC service UE label.\n10.9.3.7\tLocation information cancel subscription procedure\nNOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.\nFigure 10.9.3.7-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information cancel subscription request. The MC service server or the location management client can request the cancellation of location information subscriptions at any time from the location management server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe authorized MC service user is in possession of the MC service ID of the MC service user as well as the location information subscriptions of this MC service ID.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for canceling a subscription request, with a step-by-step guide to follow. The user is presented with a list of options to choose from, and the system prompts the user to confirm their decision. The figure includes a cancel button, a confirmation message, and a list of available options.\nFigure 10.9.3.7-1: Location information cancel subscription request procedure\n1.\tMC service server or location management client sends a location information cancel subscription request to the location management server to cancel the subscription for location information of one or more MC service users.\n2.\tThe location management server checks the authorization of this request.\nNOTE:\tWhether the authorization check is a specific check of the requesting MC service user or is a general policy check is outside the scope of this procedure.\n3.\tThe location management server replies with a location information cancel subscription response indicating the cancel subscription status.\nFigure 10.9.3.8.1-1 illustrates the procedure when a location management client requests one-time location information from other location management clients for location information reporting using functional alias, which can be shared between several MC service users. Under this condition, the actual location of all MC service users sharing the same functional alias are reported.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMC service client 2 and MC service client 3 share the same functional alias.\n2.\tMC service client 2 and MC service client 3 activated the functional alias.\n3.\tMC service client 1 may have an activated functional alias.\n4.\tThe location management server has subscribed to the functional alias controlling MC service server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a one-time location information report for a shared functional alias, which is a crucial component in network management and troubleshooting. The report provides a detailed overview of the location information for the shared functional alias, including the time and location of the last update. This information is essential for network administrators to ensure that the shared functional alias is functioning correctly and to identify any potential issues that may arise.\nFigure 10.9.3.8.1-1: One-time location information report for shared functional alias\n1.\tLocation management client 1 sends a location reporting trigger, limited to one MC service at the time, to the location management server to activate a one-time location report procedure which shall retrieve the location information of the MC service users that may share the contained functional alias. Location management client 1 may include its own activated functional alias.\n2.\tLocation management server checks whether location management client 1 is authorized to send a location reporting trigger for location information of location management clients 2 and 3.\n3.\tThe location management server uses on-demand location reporting procedures. The location information request contains the functional alias provided by the location management client 1 to address location management client 2 and location management client 3.\n4.\tUpon receiving the report, the location management server updates location of the reporting location management clients. If the location management server does not have location information of a reporting location management client before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location management client.\n5.\tThe location management server sends location report responses to location management client 1 containing the provided location information for each location management client using the given functional alias. If the optional MC service UE label is present, the location management server sends it, as part of the location report response to location management client 1. If not all location management clients immediately respond to the location management server, i.e. other reports some time later, subsequent location reporting responses may be sent.\nFigure 10.9.3.8.2-1 illustrates the procedure when a location management client requests periodic location information from other location management clients for location information reporting using functional aliases which may be shared between several MC service users. Under this condition, the actual location of all MC service users sharing the same functional alias are reported.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMC service client 2 and MC service client 3 share the same functional alias.\n2.\tMC service client 2 and MC service client 3 activated the functional alias.\n3.\tMC service client 1 may have an activated functional alias.\n4.\tThe location management server has subscribed to the functional alias controlling MC service server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n\nFigure 10.9.3.8.2-1: Periodic location information report for shared functional alias\n1.\tLocation management client 1 sends a location reporting trigger, limited to one MC service at the time, to the location management server to activate a periodic location reporting procedure which shall retrieve the location information of the MC service users sharing the contained functional alias. Location management client 1 may include its own activated functional alias.\n2.\tLocation management server checks whether location management client 1 is authorized to send a location reporting trigger for location information for location management clients that have activated the functional alias.\n3.\tDepending on the information given by the location reporting trigger, the location management server uses event-triggered location information procedure and immediately send location information request to the location management clients that contains the functional alias requested by the location management client 1.\n4.\tUpon receiving the reports, the location management server updates location of the reporting location management clients.\n5.\tThe location management server checks whether location management client 1 is authorized to receive location information for all location management clients that have activated the functional alias.\n6.\tBased on the received location information reports, the location management server will periodically issue location report responses, one at a time for each location management client for which location management client 1 is authorized to receive location information, encompassing the MC service ID, the associated functional alias, the individual location information of the addressed MC service ID and the optional MC service UE label, if present.\nNOTE 1:\tIf a functional alias is deactivated for an MC service client, the corresponding location management client stops sending periodic location information reports.\nNOTE 2:\tIf a functional alias has been newly activated for an MC service client, the location management server activates location information reporting for this location management client.\nNOTE 3:\tIf a functional alias is simultaneously shared between several MC service IDs, all location management clients with the associated MC service IDs will send the location report until the functional alias status change, e.g. take-over, for the individual MC service ID.\nThe location management client may get into a state where it cannot report location information to the location management server at any time after the initial location reporting configuration was provided by the location management server. If any location information trigger criterion applies, while not reporting location information to the location management server, the location management client stores the corresponding location information.\nTrigger criteria while not reporting location information to the location management server may vary from trigger criteria while reporting location information to the location management server. Such trigger criteria may for example include not reported distance travelled, not reported elapsed time, not reported call initiation, not reported emergency alert, not reported emergency group call, not reported imminent peril group call and not reported emergency private call.\nThe location management server can request stored location information at any time from the location management client, following a return to report location information to the location management server.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for the on-demand based usage of location information history reporting from the location management client to the location management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe location management client is configured to store location information, while not reporting location information to the location management server.\n2.\tThe location management client has stored location information based on triggering criteria in not reporting location information cases.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for accessing and viewing location history reports, specifically for the On-Demand Usage of the Location History Procedure (LMC - LMS) in a mobile application. The interface includes a list of available reports, a search bar for filtering reports by location, and a button to view the report. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different types of reports available.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.2.1-1: On-demand based usage of report location history procedure (LMC – LMS)\n1.\tThe location management client returns to report location information while there is a communication link between the location management client and location management server.\n2.\tLocation management server requests the stored location information.\nNOTE 1:\tThe location management client may provide the status of the stored location information prior to the request from location management server.\n3.\tThe location management client responds to the location management server with one or several stored location information history reports.\nNOTE 2:\tThe transmission of requested stored location information does not interrupt the reporting of location information.\nNOTE 3:\tThe most recent stored location information that qualifies for transmission is transmitted first.\nNOTE 4:\tThe transmission may be stopped at any time with the cancel location history reporting procedure, according to the procedure described in clause 10.9.3.9.4 of the present document.\n4.\tThe location management server updates the available location information with one or several stored location information and the optional MC service UE label, if present, from the location management client.\nThe location management server can request stored location information at any time from the location management client, following a return to report location information to the location management server. The MC service server or the location management client may initiate the request of stored location information.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the on-demand based usage of location history reporting.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe location management client 1 is configured to store location information, while not reporting location information to the location management server.\n2.\tThe location management client 1 has stored location information based on triggering criteria in not reporting location information cases.\n3.\tThe location management server may have none, a subset or all available stored location information reports from location management client 1.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for accessing and viewing location history reports. The interface includes a search bar, a list of reports, and a button to view the report. The report is displayed in a table format with columns for the report name, location, and date. The user can select a report to view its details, including the location history, the date of the report, and the number of times the report was accessed. The figure is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to access and view location history reports on-demand.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.2.2-1: On-demand based usage of report location history procedure\n1.\tThe MC service server or the location management client 2 initiate the location information history request to the location management server.\nNOTE:\tThe MC service server or the location management client 2 may request the status on stored location information from location management client 1, prior to the location information history request.\n2.\tThe location management server checks the authorization of this request and compares the location information history request with the already retrieved stored location information from location management client 1.\n3.\tThe location management server requests stored location information from location management client 1 according to the procedure described in clause 10.9.3.9.2.1 of the present document, if the desired stored location information is not available on the location management server.\n4.\tThe location management server reports the requested stored location information to the MC service server or location management client 2. The location management server reports the optional MC service UE label, if present, to the location management client 2.\nThe location management client can report the status of stored location information at any time to the location management server, following a return to report location information to the location management server.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure for the usage of the status reporting from the location management client.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe location management client has returned to report location information and has stored location information reports.\nThe figure depicts a status location history reporting procedure (LMC – LMS) for a specific location, as indicated by the figure number and the corresponding status location history reporting procedure. The figure shows the steps involved in reporting the status of a location, including the location's name, the status of the location, and the reporting procedure. The figure is a visual representation of the process, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.3.1-1: Status location history reporting procedure (LMC – LMS)\n1.\tThe location management client returns to report location information while there is a communication link between the location management client and location management server.\n2.\tThe location management client reports without a status request the status of the stored location information to the location information server.\n\nThe location management server can request the status of stored location information at any time from the location management client, following a return to report location information to the location management server.\nFigure 10.9.3.9.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the on-demand based usage of requesting the status of the stored location information from the location management client.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe location management client has returned to report location information and has stored location information reports.\nThe figure depicts a detailed flowchart illustrating the on-demand usage of status location history reporting procedure (LMS – LMC) in a system.

The MC service emergency alert request message shall contain the following information: Location, MC service ID, and the MC service user's mission critical organization name. If in step 2, the MC service client 1 does not include the location information in the MC service emergency alert request to the MC service server, the MC service server acquires the location information of the MC service user at the MC service client 1 from the location management server. If the location information is included in step 2, then the MC service server uses the location information from MC service client 1.\n6.\tMC service user of MC service client 2 is notified of the MC service emergency alert. The functional alias of the initiating MC service user may be displayed.\nNOTE 2:\tMC service client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of receiving the MC service emergency alert.\n7.\tThe receiving MC service client 2 sends the MC service emergency alert response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency alert.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MC service client 1 need not initiate a private call to MC service client 2.\nThese procedures describe cases where an MC service client has initiated an MC service emergency alert and entered the emergency state, and wishes to cancel the alert.  For group-based alerts the cancellation informs the MC service server and other group members of this cancellation. By doing so, the MC service client may also request the cancellation of the in-progress emergency state of the group. For individual-based alerts the cancellation informs the MC service server and the MC service user designated as the target of MC service emergency communication.\nIn both cases the cancellation of the MC service emergency alert clears the emergency state of the MC service client.\nFor group-based emergency alerts, the emergency state of the MC service user can alternatively be cancelled using the MC service in-progress emergency group state cancellation procedures in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], TS 23.281[12], and TS 23.282 [13].\nFigure 10.10.1.2.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client cancelling an MC service emergency alert with an MC service group i.e., MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined on MC service group management server.\nNOTE 1:\tFor simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MC service emergency alert targeted to a group.\n2.\tThe MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.\n3.\tThe initiating MC service client 1 has affiliated with the MC service group designated as the MC service emergency group.\nThe figure depicts a communication service group with a specific emergency alert cancel message. The MC service group is highlighted, indicating that it is the primary service group for the emergency alert cancel message. The message is displayed in a clear and concise format, making it easy to understand the content of the message.\nFigure 10.10.1.2.2.2-1 MC service group emergency alert cancel\n1.\tThe MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service emergency alert cancel to inform the server that MC service client 1 is no longer in the emergency state.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MC service emergency alert cancel request can carry an indication to also request that the in-progress emergency of the group is to be cancelled. The MC service server can accept or deny the request to cancel the in-progress emergency state of the group as a whole, separately from accepting or denying the request to cancel the emergency alert at MC service client 1. An authorized user (e.g. dispatcher, supervisor) can cancel either or both the in-progress emergency state of the group and the MC service emergency alert of another user. A MC service user is always authorized to cancel the emergency state of their own client. Determination of authorized users is implementation dependent.\n2.\tMC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service emergency alert cancel to the MC service group to which MC service client 1 had previously sent the emergency alert.\n3.\tMC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group management server.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert cancel request. MC service client 1 clears its emergency state.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request towards the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members.\n6.\tMC service users are notified of the MC service emergency alert cancellation of MC service client 1.\n7.\tFor a unicast MC service emergency alert cancel, the receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency alert cancel. For a multicast MC service emergency alert cancel, these acknowledgements are not sent unless the MC service clients have been configured to do so.\nFigure 10.10.1.2.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client cancelling an individual MC service emergency alert (i.e. without an associated MC service group).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an individual MC service emergency alert targeted to MC service client 2.\n2.\tThe MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.\n\nThe figure depicts a communication system with multiple services, including MC service 1, individual emergency alert cancel, and individual emergency alert cancel 1. The system is designed to provide reliable communication in the event of an emergency.\nFigure 10.10.1.2.2.3-1 MC service individual emergency alert cancel\n1.\tThe MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service individual emergency alert cancel for an individual emergency alert.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the MC service emergency alert cancel request to the MC service server to inform the server that MC service client 1 is no longer in the emergency state. The emergency alert cancel request contains the MC service ID of MC service client 2.\n3.\tThe MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert cancel request. MC service client 1 clears its emergency state.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request towards MC service client 2.\n5.\tThe MC service user of MC service client 2 is notified of the MC service emergency alert cancellation of MC service client 1.\n6.\tMC service client 2 sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency alert cancel.\nEditor's Note:\tMC service emergency alert triggered by MC service client locally which stores the pre-defined area is another possible solution. How to define this procedure and how to combine the two solutions is FFS.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MC service emergency alert to be triggered when an MC service UE moves into a pre-defined area. This procedure will place the MC service client in the MC service emergency state if the MC service client is not already in that state.\nProcedures in figure 10.10.1.2.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MC service server triggering an MC service emergency alert with an MC service group i.e., MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined on MC service group management server. This procedure will place the MC service client in the MC service emergency state if the MC service client is not already in that state.\nNOTE:\tFor simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC service group is previously defined on the group management server with MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 affiliated to that MC service group.\n2.\tAll members of the MC service group belong to the same MC system.\n3.\tAn area in which the MC service client should send emergency alert is pre-defined in MC service server.\nThe figure depicts a map of a city with various zones, including an emergency alert area (EAA).

As part of this process, the MC service client may also request the cancellation of the in-progress emergency state in the group if authorized to do so.\nProcedures in figure 10.10.2.2.2-1 describe procedures for the MC service client cancelling an MC service emergency alert.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC service client 1 has successfully initiated an MC service emergency alert and is in the MC service emergency state.\n2.\tInformation for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MC service group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MC service client 1.\n3.\tThe initiating MC service client 1 and MC service clients 2 and 3 are still in off-network contact via the MC service group provisioned to MC service client 1 as for the MC service emergency group.\n\nThe figure depicts an emergency alert cancel system, showing the various components and their connections. The system includes a central station (CSC), a network control center (NCC), and a network management system (NMS). The CSC receives alerts from the NMS, which in turn sends them to the NCC. The NCC then sends the alerts to the CSC, which then sends them to the appropriate personnel.

If the ad hoc group emergency alert request is not authorized, the MC service server and the MC service client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n5.\tThe MC service server determines the list of participants to be invited for the ad hoc group emergency alert based on the information present in the information element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying the criteria or combination of both. The MC service server stores the ad hoc group ID together with the list of participants for the duration of the ad hoc group emergency alert.

The figure shows a group of individuals, represented by circles, who are alerted to a potential emergency. The alert is then canceled by a group of individuals represented by a line, indicating that the alert has been canceled. This figure illustrates the importance of effective communication systems in emergency situations, ensuring that individuals can quickly and efficiently respond to any incidents.\nFigure 10.10.3.3.2-1: Ad hoc group emergency alert cancel\n1.\tThe MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel to inform the MC service server that alert is to be cancelled.\nNOTE 1:\tThe ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request can carry an indication to also request that the in-progress emergency of the group is to be cancelled. The MC service server can accept or deny the request to cancel the in-progress emergency state of the group, separately from accepting or denying the request to cancel the emergency alert at MC service client 1.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request to the MC service server. If the cancel request is for another MC service user that initiated this emergency alert, that user’s MC service ID shall be included in the request.\n3.\tMC service server checks whether the MC service user of MC service client 1 is authorized for cancellation of ad hoc group emergency alerts and whether the request is supported.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request return to the MC service client 1 containing the result of whether the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel is authorized or not. If the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel is not authorized, the MC service server and the MC service client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n5.\tMC service server uses the ad hoc group ID to select the participants of that ad hoc group. If MC service client 1 has initiated the ad hoc group emergency alert and its MC service emergency state is set, then the MC service emergency state is cleared.NOTE 2:\tIf MC service client 1 has not initiated the ad hoc group emergency alert, the MC service emergency state on the MC service client which initiated the ad hoc group emergency alert is retained locally by the MC service client until explicitly manually cancelled by the MC service user.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MC service emergency state of an MC service client due to an ad hoc group emergency alert or an ad hoc group communication is considered as a different state as from an MC service emergency state set by an MC service emergency group call or an MC service group emergency alert.\n6.\tThe MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request towards the participants of the ad hoc group associated with the ad hoc group emergency alert.\n7.\tMC service users are notified of the ad hoc group emergency alert cancellation and the MC service emergency state is cleared.\n8.\tThe receiving MC service clients send the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel.\n9.\tThe MC service server sends the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel response to MC service client 1 to inform about successful alert cancellation.\nNOTE 4:\tIf there is no ongoing communication in the ad hoc group or once the ongoing communication in the ad hoc group is terminated, the MC service server removes the ad hoc group.\nDuring an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, the MC service server continuously checks if additional MC service users meet the conditions of the ad hoc group emergency alert.\nAs illustrated in Figure 10.10.3.3.3-1 MC service client is added to the ad hoc group as the MC service client meets the criteria for receiving an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn ad hoc group emergency alert has been initiated and the related ad hoc group exists.\n2.\tThe criteria for entering an ad hoc group emergency alert are known to the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service user on MC service client 2 is authorized to receive ad hoc group participants information.\nThe figure depicts an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, with the user entering the group and the system responding with an alert.\nFigure 10.10.3.3.3-1: Entering an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert\n1.\tMC service server acquires the latest information of the MC service user at the MC service client and checks whether the criteria for initiating an ad hoc group emergency alert to the MC service client are met. The MC service server considers the MC service client 1 to be implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group associated to the emergency alert.\n2.\tThe MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert request notification to MC service client 1 to notify that it has moved into potential danger. The MC service client 1 is added to the emergency ad hoc group.\n3.\tMC service client 1 notifies the MC service user about the ad hoc group emergency alert.\n4.\tThe receiving MC service client 1 sends the ad hoc group emergency alert response to the MC service server to acknowledge the ad hoc group emergency alert.\n5.\tThe authorized user on MC service client 2 is notified with the total list of MC service IDs of those MC service users who belong to the ad hoc group including the newly added MC service client 1, and a separate list of MC service IDs of MC service users who belong to the ad hoc group that have not acknowledged the ad hoc group emergency alert.\n6.\tIf there is an ongoing ad hoc group emergency communication ongoing, the MC service server adds the MC service client to the list of ad hoc group emergency communication participants according to 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] or 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].\nDuring an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, the MC service server continuously checks if MC service users still meet the conditions of the emergency alert.\nAs illustrated in Figure 10.10.3.3.4-1 MC service client is removed from the ad hoc group associated with an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert as the MC service client does not meet the criteria for the alert any longer and the emergency alert is removed from the MC service client.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn ad hoc group emergency alert has been initiated and the related ad hoc group exists.\n2.\tThe MC service server is aware of the criteria for leaving an ad hoc emergency alert.\n3.\tThe MC service user on MC service client 2 is authorized to receive ad hoc group participants information.\nThe figure depicts an ad-hoc group emergency alert system, with a clear hierarchy of messages and a clear structure for managing the alert. The system includes a group of users, a central server, and a notification system. The message structure is organized into a series of messages, each with a specific purpose, such as a warning, an action, or a notification. The system also includes a notification system that allows users to receive alerts in real-time, ensuring that they are aware of any potential threats or incidents.\nFigure 10.10.3.3.4-1: Leaving an ad hoc group emergency alert\n1.\tMC service server acquires the latest information of the MC service user at the MC service client 1 and checks whether the criteria for the ad hoc group emergency alert are still met. The MC service server deaffiliates the MC service client 1 from the ad hoc group associated to the emergency alert.\n2.\tThe MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request to MC service client 1. The MC service client 1 is removed from the ad hoc group.\n3.\tMC service client 1 notifies the MC service user that the emergency alert is cancelled.\n4.\tThe receiving MC service client 1 sends the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge that the ad hoc group emergency alert is cancelled for this MC service user.\n5.\tThe authorized user on MC service client 2 is notified with the MC service IDs of those MC service users who are currently in the ad hoc group after removing MC service client 1 from the list.\nNOTE:\tIf a communication is ongoing in the ad hoc group for the MC service user, the MC service server will wait to remove the MC service user from the ad hoc group until the communication is terminated.\nFigure 10.10.4.x.1-1 illustrates the procedure for initiating of ad hoc emergency alert within multiple MC systems.\nPreconditions:\n-\tThe MC service user 1 belonging to MC system A initiates an ad hoc group emergency alert that involves MC service users from MC system A and MC system B.\n-\tThe MC system A and MC system B are interconnected.\nThe figure depicts an ad hoc group emergency alert initiation between multiple MC systems, illustrating the communication process and the use of emergency alert systems in a network.\nFigure 10.10.3.4.1-1: Ad hoc group emergency alert initiation between multiple MC systems\n1.\tThe MC service user 1 at the MC service client 1 initiates an ad hoc group emergency alert to an ad hoc group with participants satisfying specific criteria. The MC service user may add additional information describing the reason for sending the alert.\n2.\tThe MC service client 1 sends an ad hoc group emergency alert request containing the details of the criteria to be applied by the MC service server A for determining the participants list. The MC service client 1 may set its MC service emergency state. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 may select a functional alias used for the MC service group emergency alert. If the MC service client 1 is in an MC service emergency state, the MC service emergency state is retained by the MC service client 1 until explicitly cancelled.\n3.\tThe MC service server A checks whether the MC service user of MC service client 1 is authorized for initiation of ad hoc group emergency alert and whether the request is supported. The MC service server checks whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.\n4.\tThe MC service server A determines that the partner MC system B is to be involved in the initiated ad hoc group emergency alert based on the information elements provided by the MC service client 1. The MC service server A determines the list of participants within MC system A to be invited for the ad hoc group emergency alert based on the information elements provided by the MC service client 1. This information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying the pre-defined criteria or combination of both. Furthermore, The MC service server A adds the ad hoc group ID (generated by the MC service server A in the case when the MC service ad hoc group ID created by the MC service client 1 is not acceptable or the case where the MC service ad hoc group ID was not provided by the MC service client 1) to be associated with the ad hoc group emergency alert. The MC service sever A stores the ad hoc group ID together with the list of participants for the duration of the ad hoc group emergency alert.\nNOTE:\tThe content of the Criteria for determining the participants information element, the details of the pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MC service server determines the list of participants are left to implementation.\n5.\tThe MC service server A sends an ad hoc group emergency alert get userlist request to MC service server B including the criteria to determine the list of participants from the MC system B.\n6.\tThe MC service server B sends an ad hoc group emergency alert get userlist response to MC service server A including the list of participants within MC system B. The MC service server B may apply local policies if any while determining the participants satisfying the criteria.\n7.\tThe MC service server A compiles the list of participants from both MC system A and the partner MC system B to be involved in the ad hoc group emergency alert. The MC service server A considers MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC service client 4 implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group associated to the emergency alert.\n8. \tThe MC service server A sends the MC service client 1 an ad hoc group emergency alert response to confirm that the request is granted.\n9.\tThe MC service server A sends an ad hoc group emergency alert request towards MC service client 2 within the partner MC system A and, MC service client 3, MC service client 4 within the partner MC system B.\n10.\tThe MC service user 2, MC service user 3 and MC service user 4 are notified of the ad hoc group emergency alert.\n11.\tThe MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC service client 4 send an ad hoc group emergency alert response back to MC service server A\n12.\t It is configured, whether any MC service client may setup a subsequent ad hoc group communication, using the ad hoc group ID from the ad hoc group emergency alert, according to 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] or 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].\nNOTE 1:\tMC service client 1 may start the subsequent ad hoc group call after step 8.\nNOTE 2:\tSending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency state.\nNOTE 3:\tSending the emergency alert does not put the other participants in the group into an MC service emergency state.\nThe MC service server continuously checks whether other MC service clients meet or if participating MC service clients no longer meet the criteria for the ad hoc group emergency alert.\nFigure 10.10.3.4.2-1 illustrates updating the participant list of an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert within multiple MC systems. This includes scenario of MC service users entering and leaving an ongoing ad hoc emergency alert.\nPreconditions:\n-\tAn ad hoc group emergency alert has been initiated by MC service user 1 within MC system A, and a related ad hoc group exists.\n-\tThe MC service server A and MC service server B are aware of the criteria sent by MC service client 1 related to the ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert.\n-\tMC system A and MC system B are interconnected.\n\nThe figure depicts an ad hoc group emergency alert system, showing the participant list being updated between multiple MC systems.\nFigure 10.10.3.4.2-1: Updating the participant list of an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert between multiple MC systems\n1.\tAn ad hoc group emergency alert has been established based on a set of criteria sent by MC service client 1 upon initiating the ad hoc emergency alert.  The MC service server A considers MC service client 3 implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group associate to the emergency alert.\n2.\tMC service server B detects that MC service client 3 meets the criteria of the ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert initiated at MC system A.\n3.\tMC service server B sends an ad hoc group emergency alert add user notification including the identity of MC service client 3 to be added to the ad hoc group associated to the ongoing emergency alert.\n4.\tThe MC service server A sends an ad hoc group emergency alert request to MC service client 3.\n5.\tThe MC service user 3 is notified of entering an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert.\n6.\tThe MC service client 3 sends the MC service server A an ad hoc group emergency alert response.\n7.\tThe MC service server A updates the participant list of the MC service group associated with the ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert. The MC service server A may send a notification to authorized users indicating the addition of MC service client 3 to the ad hoc group.\n8.\tThe MC service server B detects that MC service client 4 no longer meets the criteria of the ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert. The MC service server A deaffiliates the MC service client 4 from the ad hoc group associated to the emergency alert.\n9.\tThe MC service server B sends the MC service server A an ad hoc group emergency remove user notification.\n10.\tMC service server A sends the MC service client 4 an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request.\n11.\tThe MC service user 4 is notified of leaving an ad hoc group emergency alert.\n12.\tThe MC service client 4 sends the MC service server A an ad hoc emergency alert cancel response.\n13.\tThe ad hoc group associated with the ongoing ad hoc emergency alert is updated. The MC service server A may send a notification to authorized users indicating the removal of the MC service client 4.\nFigure 10.10.3.4.3-1 illustrates the procedure once an MC service client cancels an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert.\nPreconditions:\n-\tAn ad hoc group emergency alert is ongoing with participants within MC system A and MC system B.\n-\tMC system A and MC system B are interconnected.\n\nThe figure depicts an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel between multiple MC systems, illustrating the communication protocols and coordination mechanisms in real-time emergency situations.\nFigure 10.10.3.4.3-1: Ad hoc group emergency alert cancel between multiple MC systems\n1.\tThe MC service user 1 decides to cancel an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the MC service server A an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request. If the cancel request is sent for another MC service user that initiated this emergency alert, that user`s MC service ID shall be included in the cancel request.\n3.\tMC service server A checks whether the MC service client 1 is authorized to cancel an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert. The MC service server A checks whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.\n4.\tThe MC service server A sends an ad hoc emergency alert cancel notification to the MC service server B at the partner MC system B.\n5.\tThe MC service server A sends an ad hoc group emergency alert response to MC service client 1.\n6.\tThe MC service server A sends MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC service client 4 ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request.\n7.\tThe MC service user 2, MC service user 3 and MC service user 4 are notified of the ad hoc group emergency alert cancellation.\n8. \tThe MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC service client 4 sends ad hoc group emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server A.

This is an explicit activation caused either by the MC service user or determined by a trigger event such as the MC service UE coming within a permitted geographic operational area of a functional alias.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 10.13.4-1: Functional alias activation procedure within an MC system,\" depicts a detailed process of functional alias activation within a Multi-Cast (MC) system. The figure illustrates the steps involved in activating functional aliases, which are used to improve the performance of the system by allowing multiple users to share the same resources. The process is shown in a step-by-step manner, with each step represented by a separate figure.

The configuration includes the MC system, the group call request, and the associated parameters. The figure illustrates the process of handling group calls in a network, with the MC system acting as the primary source of the call and the group call request being received from the primary MC system. The configuration ensures that the group call request is handled correctly and efficiently.\nFigure 10.14.3.3-1:\tEnforcement of local configuration where group call request is received from primary MC system of MC service group\n1.\tA group call request is received from the group host MC service server in the primary MC system of the MC service group.\n2.\tThe serving MC service server of MC service client 1 authorizes the group call request using local group configuration information.\n3.\tIf the group call request authorization by the serving MC service server of MC service client 1 is successful, the serving MC service server sends the group call request to MC service client 1.\n4.\tMC service client 1 responds to the group call request with a group call response.\n5.\tThe group call response is sent to the group host MC service server of the MC service group.\n6.\tFloor control or transmission control and media paths are established for the MC service group call.\n",

The MC service regroup group configuration needs to be provided to the relevant MC service users who will be regrouped in advance of the regrouping operation.\nNOTE 1:\tA preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration for the preconfigured regroup process is identified by a parameter in group configuration described in this specification.\nNOTE 2:\tThe configuration may alternatively be taken from any MC service group that has been configured in the user profile of all the relevant MC service users who will be regrouped.\nNOTE 3:\tRegroup groups may be defined according to the organizational structure of a mission critical organization, or by some other means which allows the MC service client of an authorized user to be aware of an appropriate regroup group for sets of MC service groups or MC service users that will be regrouped together.\nThe preconfigured MC service group that provides the configuration is not used as the MC service regroup group itself, it only provides configuration for one or more MC service regroup groups. The MC service group ID of the regroup group is provided by the authorized user when the preconfigured regrouping is carried out.\nThe MC service regroup group can be specified to be a broadcast or non-broadcast type according to the configuration of the MC service group whose configuration is specified by the regroup request. The broadcast type of regroup is used for one-way communication where only an authorized MC service user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup members are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members). The non-broadcast type is used for two-way communication where all regroup members can transmit and receive (i.e, the regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group call).\nFor group regrouping, if the MC service server has been notified by the group management server that one of the MC service groups that has been requested for regrouping by means of these procedures has already been regrouped, the MC service server shall reject the request for regrouping described in the following procedures.\nThe following subclauses define group and user regroup procedures using preconfigured groups within a single MC system.\nFigure 10.15.3.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a group regroup using a preconfigured MC service group. The procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the MC service regroup group.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service client 2 is an affiliated member of MC service group 1 and MC service client 3 is an affiliated member of MC service group 2.\n-\tThe MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured MC service group have been preconfigured in MC service clients 2 and 3, and MC service clients 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in the MC service regroup group.\n-\tMC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure.\n-\tMC service client 1 is aware of a suitable MC service group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs of the group members who will be regrouped.\n-\tIn order to be aware whether a group is currently regrouped, the MC service server is subscribed to the group configuration in the GMS.\n-\tThe GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MC service server using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6.\n\nThe figure depicts a regroup procedure using preconfigured groups in a single MC system, illustrating the step-by-step process of grouping data in a multi-level data center (MC) network. The figure includes various components such as preconfigured groups, data center, and network elements, highlighting the importance of efficient data management and organization in MC systems.\nFigure 10.15.3.2.1-1: Regroup procedure using preconfigured group in a single MC system\n1.\tThe authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the group regroup procedure, specifying the list of MC service groups to be regrouped (MC service groups 1 and 2), the MC service group ID of the regroup group and the MC service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the MC service groups requested in step 1. The MC service server also checks which group members are affiliated to MC service groups 1 and 2. The MC service server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that configuration information is not already known to the MC service server. The MC service server also checks that none of the MC service groups that are requested for regrouping are already regrouped by any mechanism.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure does not require that that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is a group member of MC service groups 1 or 2, or that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is an affiliated group member of MC service groups 1 or 2.\nNOTE 2:\tThe list of groups included in the group regroup is held in dynamic data in the MC service server, and is not used to update group configuration information in the group management server.\n4.\tIf the MC service server determines that any of the groups requested for regrouping, including the regroup group, have been regrouped by other group regrouping procedures, the MC service server then sends a preconfigured regroup reject back to MC service client 1 with a reject reason indicating that one of the groups has already been regrouped, and this procedure terminates.\n5.\tIf the preconfigured regroup request is not rejected, the MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MC service clients 2 and 3 in steps 5a and 5b respectively.\nNOTE 3:\tOnly group members that are affiliated to the MC service groups that are to be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.\n6.\tMC service clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps 6a and 6b respectively.\n7.\tMC service clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the MC service server to acknowledge the regrouping action. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup request.\n8.\tThe MC service server affiliates the regrouped MC service clients to the regroup group.\n9.\tThe MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MC service client 1.\nAfter the group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.15.3.2.3.\nMC service client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the MC service client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups (group 1 or 2 in this procedure).\nMC service client affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE's MC service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by performing a log-off operation.\nEditor's note:\tData persistence in the MC service client following a user log-off or power down needs further study.\nFigure 10.15.3.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a user regroup procedure using a preconfigured MC service group. The procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the MC service regroup group.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients 2 and 3 are registered with the MC service server.\n-\tThe MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured MC service group have been preconfigured in MC service clients 2 and 3, and MC service clients 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in the MC service regroup group.\n-\tMC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured user regroup procedure.\n-\tMC service client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs of the MC service users who will be regrouped.\nThe figure depicts a user regroup procedure in a single MC system, with a preconfigured group. The procedure involves the use of a preconfigured group, which is a group of users that are pre-configured and ready to be used in the system. This group can be used to group users together for a specific purpose, such as a specific task or a specific group of users that need to be managed together. The figure shows the steps involved in using the preconfigured group, including the selection of the group, the creation of the group, and the assignment of users to the group. The figure also shows the use of a group manager to manage the group and ensure that the group is used effectively.\nFigure 10.15.3.2.2-1: User regroup procedure using preconfigured group in a single MC system\n1.\tThe authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the user regroup procedure, specifying the list of MC service users to be regrouped (MC service clients 2 and 3), the MC service group ID of the regroup group, and the MC service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken. Alternatively, the MC service client 1 can provide the criteria which allows the MC service server to determine the list of MC service users to be regrouped.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured user regroup procedure.\nNOTE 1:\tMC service clients can be involved in multiple user and group regroups simultaneously.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MC service clients 2 and 3 in steps 4a and 4b respectively.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen using multicast, the MC service server can periodically rebroadcast the preconfigured regroup request.\n5.\tMC service clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.\n6.\tMC service clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the MC service server to acknowledge the regrouping action.

The figure includes a diagram of the MC system, with the MC system, the regroup procedure, and the cancelation process clearly labeled. The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different symbols and their meanings.\nFigure 10.15.3.2.3-1: Cancel preconfigured regroup procedure in a single MC system\n1.\tThe authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the cancellation of the regrouping that uses a preconfigured MC service group.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the MC service server, specifying the MC service group ID of the regroup group.\n3.\tThe MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to cancel a regrouping that used a regroup procedure with preconfigured groups.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to MC service clients 2 and 3 (steps 4a and 4b respectively).\n5.\tMC service clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the cancellation of the regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.\n6.\tMC service clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the cancellation of the regrouping function.

The primary MC system where the preconfigured group regrouping is initiated does not need to be aware of the list of group members belonging to groups whose group home system is the partner MC system. If the group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service regroup group shares the necessary security related parameters together with the group configuration of the preconfigured MC service group with the group management server in the partner MC system and the group management server in the partner MC system distributes this configuration including those security parameters to its served MC service users according to the procedures in subclause 10.2.7, the primary MC system does not need to be aware of the list of group members of the MC service regroup group that are receiving service in the partner MC system.\nThe procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the MC service regroup group.\nIn this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MC systems are not shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup procedure, and is receiving MC service in the primary MC system of MC service client 1.\n-\tMC service client 2 is an affiliated member of MC service group 1 where MC service group 1 is defined in the partner MC system and MC service client 2 is receiving service in the partner MC system of MC service client 1.\n-\tThe MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured MC service group have been preconfigured in MC service client 2, and MC service client 2 has received the relevant security related information to allow communication in the MC service regroup group.\n-\tIn order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MC service server is subscribed to the group configuration in the GMS.\n-\tThe GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MC service server within the same MC system using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6\nThe figure depicts a group regroup procedure using preconfigured groups in multiple MC systems, illustrating the step-by-step process for configuring and managing group regrabs.\nFigure 10.15.3.3.1-1: Group regroup procedure using preconfigured group in multiple MC systems\n1.\tThe authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the group regroup procedure, specifying the list of MC service groups to be regrouped including MC service group 1, the MC service group ID of the regroup group and the MC service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the MC service groups requested in step 1. The MC service server also checks which group members are affiliated to the requested MC service groups that are homed in the primary MC system. The MC service server identifies any partner systems which are the group home systems for MC service groups identified in the list of groups to be regrouped. The MC service server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that configuration information is not already known to the MC service server. The MC service server also checks that none of the MC service groups that are homed in the primary MC system and that are requested for regrouping are already regrouped by any mechanism.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure does not require that that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is a group member of the MC service groups listed in the regroup request, or that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is an affiliated group member of any of the listed MC service groups.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to the MC service server in the partner MC system.\n5.\tThe partner MC service server checks the status of any MC service groups hosted by that partner MC service server, and identifies affiliated group members of any of the identified MC service groups (both MC service groups that are hosted in the primary MC system and MC service groups that are hosted in the partner MC system) that are receiving MC service service in the partner MC system, which include MC service client 2.\n6.\tThe partner MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup request to MC service client 2.\nNOTE 2:\tOnly group members that are affiliated to the MC service groups that are to be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.\n7.\tMC service client 2 notifies the user of the regrouping.\n8.\tMC service client 2 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the partner MC service server to acknowledge the regrouping action.

The rejection can occur, for example because one of the groups hosted by the partner MC service server is already regrouped by other group regrouping procedures.\nIn this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MC systems are not shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup procedure, and is receiving MC service in the primary MC system of MC service client 1.\n-\tIn order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MC service server within the same MC system is subscribed to the group configuration in the GMS.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a 15-3-4-1 system, which is a type of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The system uses preconfigured groups to reject retransmissions, improving the overall system performance.\nFigure 10.15.3.3.4-1: Regroup rejection using preconfigured group in multiple MC systems\n1.\tThe authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the group regroup procedure, specifying the list of MC service groups to be regrouped including MC service group 1, the MC service group ID of the regroup group and the MC service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken.\n2.\tMC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the MC service groups requested in step 1. The MC service server also checks which group members are affiliated to the requested MC service groups that are homed in the primary MC system. The MC service server identifies any partner systems which are the group home systems for MC service groups identified in the list of groups to be regrouped. The MC service server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that configuration information is not already known to the MC service server. The MC service server also checks that none of the MC service groups that are homed in the primary MC system and that are requested for regrouping are already regrouped by any mechanism.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure does not require that that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is a group member of the MC service groups listed in the regroup request, or that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is an affiliated group member of any of the listed MC service groups.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to the MC service server in the partner MC system.\n5.\tThe partner MC service server checks the status of any MC service groups hosted by that partner MC service server, and determines that one or more requested MC service groups has already been regrouped by another group regrouping procedure.\n6.\tThe partner MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup reject to the primary MC service server, indicating the reason for rejection.\n7.\tThe primary MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup reject to MC service client 1, indicating the reason for rejection.\nFigure 10.15.3.4.1-1 illustrates the procedure to add a newly affiliated user to an in-progress preconfigured MC service group regroup operation.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service client is a member of a MC service group that is part of an in-progress preconfigured group regroup operation.\n-\tThe MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured MC service group has been preconfigured in the MC service client, and the MC service client has received the relevant security related information to allow it to communicate in the MC service regroup group.\n\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure to add a newly affiliated user to a preconfigured group regroup.

The MC clients instruct the MC gateway UE about the corresponding MBMS bearer details to enable MC gateway listening on them. On demand, MC gateway UE forwards the traffic received over MBMS bearer to the MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices. With the procedure defined in this subclause MBMS bearer can be supported for the MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices. Changes required are confined to the reference point between MC gateway UE and the MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices. MC service server may consider the location of the corresponding MC clients as defined in subclause 11.5.2 while deciding to establish MBMS bearer.\nTable 11.5.3.2.1-1 describes the information flow from the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device to the MC gateway UE for sharing the details of MBMS bearer announcement received by the MC Client from the MC Service server.\nTable 11.5.3.2.1-1: MC GW MBMS bearer announcement\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.2-1 describes the information flow from the MC gateway UE to the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device for the MC GW MBMS listening status report.\nTable 11.5.3.2.2-1: MC GW MBMS listening status report\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.3-1 describes the information flow from the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device to the MC gateway UE for sharing the details of MapGroupToBearer message received from the MC service server.\nTable 11.5.3.2.3-1: MC GW MapGroupToBearer request\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.4-1 describes the information flow from the MC gateway UE to the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device for the MC GW MapGroupToBearer response.\nTable 11.5.3.2.4-1: MC GW MapGroupToBearer response\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.5-1 describes the information flow from the MC gateway UE to the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device for the MC GW MBMS bearer quality report.\nTable 11.5.3.2.5-1: MC GW MapGroupToBearer response\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.6-1 describes the information flow from the MC gateway UE to the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device for the MC GW MBMS bearer suspension indication.\nTable 11.5.3.2.6-1: MC GW MBMS bearer suspension indication\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.7-1 describes the information flow from the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device to the MC gateway UE for sharing the details of UnMapGroupToBearer message received from the MC service server.\nTable 11.5.3.2.7-1: MC GW UnMapGroupToBearer request\n\nTable 11.5.3.2.8-1 describes the information flow from the MC gateway UE to the MC client which resides on a non-3GPP device for the MC GW UnMapGroupToBearer response.\nTable 11.5.3.2.8-1: MC GW UnMapGroupToBearer response\n\nMC clients residing on non-3GPP devices receive MBMS bearer announcements from the MC system, MC clients share the details of the MBMS bearer received in MBMS bearer announcement to the MC gateway UE. This enables the MC gateway UE to start monitoring the corresponding MBMS bearer.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the MBMS bearer announcement by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters to enable the use of the MC gateway UE.\n2.\tThe MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway UE.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the MBMS bearer announcement handling process in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps involved in the announcement, including the MBMS bearer's identification, the announcement message, and the response from the network. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.1-1: Handling of MBMS bearer announcement\n1.\tThe MC service server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from the BM-SC.\n2.\tThe MC service server provides service description information associated with the MBMS bearer to the MC client residing on non-3GPP devices via MC gateway UE.\n3.\tThe MC client sends the MC GW MBMS bearer announcement to the MC Gateway UE containing the MBMS bearer related information received from the MC service server.\n4.\tThe MC gateway UE stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The MC gateway UE uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.\n5.\tThe MC gateway UE that enters or is in the service area of at least one announced TMGI notifies to the MC client that it can receive data over MBMS by sending the MC GW MBMS listening status report. The MC GW MBMS listening status report also contains the details of the non-3GPP transport resources related parameters. The MC gateway UE may choose to send the details of existing transport resources information as part of non-3GPP transport resources establishment parameters IE if existing communication channel can be reused.\n6.\tThe MC client establishes the transport resources with the MC gateway UE based on the parameters received in step 5 to receive the MC service data from the MC gateway UE, if these parameters are not referring to any of the already established transport resources. The MC Gateway UE forwards the MC service data it received over the MBMS bearer from the MC service server to the MC client over this transport resources.\n7.\tThe MC client sends the MBMS Listening Status Report to the MC service server indicating that it is able to receive the media over MBMS.\nWhenever the MC client detects that traffic received from MC service server is MapGroupToBearer message and if the MC client participates in the group session or communication identified by the MapGroupToBearer message then it should inform the details contained in the MapGroupToBearer message to MC gateway UE. When the association of group call, MBMS bearer and the MC GW service ID of the MC client is known to the MC gateway UE, it can forward the traffic received over MBMS bearer accordingly.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the MapGroupToBearer message by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters needed for connectivity with the MC gateway UE.\n2.\tThe MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway UE.\nThe figure depicts a message handling scenario in a 5G network, specifically focusing on the handling of MapGroupToBearer messages. The message is a key component in the network, responsible for routing and forwarding data packets. The figure illustrates the process of mapping a group of messages to a bearer, which is a type of message that can be forwarded to a specific destination. The figure shows the steps involved in this process, including the use of routing tables, message routing, and the handling of errors. The figure is crucial for ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of the network.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.2-1: Handling of MapGroupToBearer message\n1.\tThe MC service server sends a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MC service group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer broadcasting the call.\n2.\tIf the MC client is participating in the MC group communication identified by the MapGroupToBearer message, it sends the details contained in the MapGroupToBearer message to the MC gateway UE through MC GW MapGroupToBearer request message.\n3.\tThe MC gateway UE on receiving the MC GW MapGroupToBearer Request message from the MC client it maintains the association between the GW MC Service ID and the corresponding MBMS sub channel.\n4.\tThe MC gateway UE sends the MC GW MapGroupToBearer response message to the MC client which contains the details of the non-3GPP transport resources related parameters. The MC gateway UE may choose to send the details of existing communication channel information as part of non-3GPP transport resources establishment parameters IE if existing transport resources can be reused.\n5.\tThe MC client establishes the communication channel with the MC gateway UE based on the parameters received in step 4 to receive the MC service group communication data from the MC gateway UE, if these parameters are not referring to any of the already established transport resources. The MC Gateway UE forwards the MC service group communication data it received over the MBMS bearer from the MC service server to the MC client over this transport resources.\n6.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media for the group communication session over the MBMS bearer.\n7.\tThe MC gateway UE checks which MC clients should receive the media of the MC group communication based on Step 3.\n8.\tThe MC gateway UE forwards the downlink media to the intended MC clients over the transport resources established as in step 5.\nWhenever the MC client receives UnmapGroupFromBearer message and if the MC client participates in the group session or communication identified by the UnmapGroupFromBearer message then it should inform the details contained in the UnmapGroupFromBearer message to MC gateway UE. When the association of group call, MBMS bearer and the MC GW service ID of the MC client is known to the MC gateway UE, it can remove the association and stop forwarding of the traffic received over MBMS bearer accordingly.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.2A-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the UnmapGroupFromBearer message by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters needed for connectivity with the MC gateway UE.\n2.\tThe MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway UE.\nThe figure depicts a message handling scenario in a network, specifically focusing on the handling of a \"UnmapGroupFromBearer\" message. The message is sent from a sender to a receiver, and the receiver attempts to unmap the group from the sender's group. The figure illustrates the process of unmapping the group, including the sender's group, the receiver's group, and the unmapped group. The figure also shows the sender's group and the receiver's group, indicating the sender's group is unmapped and the receiver's group is unmapped. The figure also shows the unmapped group, indicating that the unmapped group is not mapped to any group. The figure is important for understanding the message handling process in a network.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.2A-1: Handling of UnmapGroupFromBearer message\n1.\tAn MCPTT group call is ongoing; the MC gateway UE forwards the downlink media to the intended MC client over the transport resources established.\n2.\tMCPTT server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer for the MC client.\n3.\tAn UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to MC client (if in MBMS coverage area) on MBMS bearer(s).\n4.\tIf the MC client is participating in the MC group communication identified by the UnmapGroupFromBearer message, it sends the details contained in the UnmapGroupFromBearer message to the MC gateway UE through MC GW UnMapGroupToBearer request message.\n5.\tThe MC gateway UE on receiving the MC GW UnMapGroupToBearer Request message from the MC client it removes the association maintained between the GW MC Service ID and the corresponding MBMS sub channel.\n6.\tThe MC gateway UE sends the MC GW MapGroupToBearer response message to the MC client.\nThe MC service server can choose to instruct some MC clients to send the MBMS bearer suspension report when notified by RAN. When the MC clients are residing on non 3GPP devices, MC gateway UE would be the one listening on the MBMS bearers. When RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer it indicates the MC gateway UE. MC gateway UE to notify the MC clients it is serving so that MC clients can report the same to the MC service server. This procedure is applicable only if the MC client is instructed to report the MBMS bearer suspension. Irrespective of whether the MC clients need to send the MBMS bearer suspension report to the MC service server, MC gateway can choose to notify the MC clients it is serving whenever RAN suspends the MBMS bearer. MC clients can then decide to send the MBMS bearer suspension report to the MC service server only if they are instructed by the MC service server.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices reporting the MC service server about the MBMS bearer suspension.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer suspension notification, which is a crucial step in the MBMS (Multi-Band Mobile Satellite) communication system. The MBMS system uses satellites to provide communication services to mobile users in remote areas. The figure shows the MBMS bearer suspension notification process, which involves the suspension of the MBMS bearer, a satellite communication link, and the subsequent notification to the user. This process ensures that the user is informed of the suspension and can take appropriate action to continue their communication.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.3-1: MBMS bearer suspension notification\n1.\tThe MC service server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to the MC client residing on non-3GPP device.\nNOTE:\tThis message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.\n2.\tRAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].\n3.\tAn MBMS suspension indication is sent to the MC gateway UE in the MSI (MCH Scheduling Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].\n4.\tThe MC gateway UE detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MC GW MBMS suspension indication to the MC Client residing on non-3GPP device.\n5.\tThe MC client MBMS suspension report to the MC Service server via MC gateway UE.\nThe MC gateway UE listening on the MBMS bearer has to report the MBMS bearer quality to the MC clients so that MC clients can report the same to the MC service server. MC Gateway UE monitors an MBMS bearer to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality) the MC gateway UE needs to inform the MC Clients which requested the MC gateway UE to listen on MBMS bearer, whether it is able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not the MC Clients can inform the MC service server accordingly.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.4-1 illustrates the procedure for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices reporting the MC service server about the MBMS bearer quality.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThere is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is announced to the MC gateway UE.\n2.\tThe MC gateway UE is located in the MBMS broadcasting area\n3.\tThe MC gateway UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the modulation and coding scheme.\n4.\tThe MC gateway UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer quality report, showing the quality of the MBMS bearer in a specific area. The report includes various parameters such as signal strength, signal quality, and interference levels. The figure is used to assess the performance of the MBMS system in a particular location.\nFigure 11.5.3.3.4-1: Reporting MBMS bearer quality\n1.\tThe MC gateway UE follows the Step 1 of the procedure as described in clause 10.7.3.6.2 for the MC service UE. The corresponding MBMS bearer quality information is forwarded to all the MC clients which have asked the MC gateway UE to listen on the particular MBMS bearer.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the MC gateway UE sends an MC GW MBMS bearer quality report to the MC client. The threshold is used to define the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been acceptable or not to receive a specific MC service media. If the MBMS bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the MC gateway UE may send an MBMS Bearer Quality report including the MBMS reception quality level to the MC Client.\nNOTE:\tThe threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on service type (i.e. MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.\n3.\tThe MC Client sends the MBMS listening status report to the MC Service server via MC gateway UE containing the information received in the MC GW MBMS bearer quality report.\n4.\tThe MC service server may send an additional proposal for measurements e.g. information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS bearer announcement message.\n",

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user and MC service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user and MC service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.280 [3] or 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] or 3GPP TS 22.282 [5] or 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] or the corresponding subclause from the present document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all the three tables of on-network and off-network, on-network only and off-network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top-most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\n",

For illustration, MCPTT AS is considered as the MC service.\nOnly the procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service is described in figure B.1-1. The procedure for service continuity in the opposite direction is identical.\nThe figure depicts a service continuity diagram for a 5G network, illustrating the path taken by signals from the base station (gNB) to the user equipment (UE) and the network relay (NR). The diagram highlights the use of optical fiber and optical line terminals (OLTs) to ensure reliable communication. The layered design of the network supports SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure B.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay\nAs illustrated in figure B.1-1:\n-\tInitially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network (on-network MCPTT service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tWhen UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MCPTT service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tThe SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].\nDepicted in figure B.1-2 is the call flow for service continuity when the UE switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network MCPTT relay service.\nThe figure depicts the service continuity of a UE when it switches from on-network to off-network relaying, illustrating the transition from a traditional circuit-switched network to a more efficient and reliable network architecture.\nFigure B.1-2 Service continuity when UE switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service\n0. UE-1 has a direct connection to the network and is engaged in a SIP session with the MCPTT AS (on-network MCPTT service). The SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) and a Session transfer Identifier (STI) is assigned for the anchored SIP session, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].\n1. UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network or has completely lost it.\n2. UE-1 (in the role of remote UE) performs ProSe UE-to-network relay discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay (UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]. In the process UE-1 is also assigned an IP address/prefix by the relay.\nNOTE 1:\tIf step 2 is started after losing connection, the service interruption can be noticeable to the user.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 2 will be entirely described under in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].\n3: UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the UE-to-network relay leg.\n4. In order to transfer the media streams of the SIP session UE-1 sends an INVITE message on the new access leg towards the SCC AS. The INVITE message includes the STI identifying the session to be transferred. The SCC AS identifies the session based on STI and updates the session over the remote access leg i.e. towards the MCPTT AS.\n5. The procedure is completed when all media streams have been transferred on the access leg relayed via UE-R. At this point UE-1 may deregister the on-network leg if it still has direct network connection (not shown in the figure).\nNOTE 3:\tThe procedure for service continuity is always completed with unicast delivery on the target side. If MCPTT content is being distributed on the target side in multicast mode, then switching from unicast to multicast delivery is performed after completion of the service continuity procedure.\n",

            "description": "Different communications between two or more MC service users need to be distinguished in their urgency in order to appropriately or less preferably allocate 3GPP system transport resources. Also simultaneous incoming communications to a MC service user requires an indication of the urgency in order to preferentially join the communication in accordance with the urgency.\nTo make this distinction of urgencies, the MC system necessarily supports different types of priorities and corresponding levels within each priority category representing the relative importance of a request at the application level. The use of application priority allows the MC system to decide whether a communication establishment or modification request can be accepted or needs to be rejected (e.g. in case of transport resource limitations), or it allows the MC service client to rank simultaneous incoming communication for presentation to an MC service user. Hence the application priority can also be used to decide which existing transport resources (e.g. bearers) to pre-empt during resource limitations. Such pre-emption capability information defines whether a communication can obtain transport resources that were already assigned to another communication with a lower priority level. The pre-emption vulnerability information defines whether a communication can lose the resources assigned to it in order to admit a communication with higher priority level.\nThe following types of application priorities are provided by the MC system:\nThe figure depicts various application priorities in the MC system, illustrating how different applications may have different requirements for network performance. The priorities are represented by different colors and shapes, with each color and shape indicating a different priority level. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different priorities and their corresponding colors.\nFigure C.1.-1: Types of application priorities in the MC system\nCommunication priority involves a combination of the type of call/communication, the role of the requesting MC service user, and the predefined/requested priority of the initiating MC service user and/or group.\nPresentation priority involves the determination of which communications, from within multiple simultaneous possible, are the highest priority to present to the MC service user either audibly or visibly. An example would be a private call received at the same time as an emergency call on a monitored group. This category can be configured uniquely for each MC service user.\nFloor priority involves the determination of who can transmit within a communication at a particular time. This is essentially the priority of the MC service user according to its profile, and possibly modified by its role and/or mode of service (e.g. using emergency or imminent peril call). This category is used, for example, to determine the ordering of the floor control queue within an established communication.\n",
