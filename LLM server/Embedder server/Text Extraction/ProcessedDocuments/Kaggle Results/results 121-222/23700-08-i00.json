The services may be localized (i.e. provided at specific/limited area) and may be bounded in time. The user may become aware of the available access to local services, and the process to gain and terminate access to the hosting network and local services. This process should be efficient, and convenient from a user experience standpoint.\nProviding access to local services creates new opportunities for users and service providers. For example, access can be provided in areas where there is no coverage provided by other networks (for example, on a cargo ship out at sea), or the access and local services can be established as needed (on a short-term basis), without the need for long term business relationships, permanently installed equipment, etc.\nThe type of local services and access for localized services via a hosting network can be promoted and arranged through different channels. Principally the Localized service provider (e.g. brick and mortar businesses, construction contractors, first responder agencies, etc.) will provide information and proper incentive or instructions to potential users so that they will seek to access the local services via hosting networks.\nThe 5G network as hosting network offering access to such localized services can be either a PNI-NPN or an SNPN.\nIt is assumed that hosting network and the localized services can be operated by different entities. Localized services may provide more than just data connectivity to end users, e.g. additional information/incentive/instructions in order to seek access to the localized services in.\nThis key issue aims at addressing how to enable a NPN (i.e. a SNPN or a PNI-NPN) as a hosting network for providing access to localized services with the following aspects:\n-\tDefine hosting NPN and identify the difference(s) between hosting NPN and NPN defined in both Rel-16 and Rel-17.\n-\tDefine localized services and identify the difference(s) between localized services and regular services.\n-\tDefine where and when localized services are available based on localized service agreements (i.e. a service agreement for a localized service).\nNOTE 1:\tSA WG2 works under the assumption that the relationships and the localized service agreements are already available by means outside SA WG2 scope i.e. SA WG2 is to agree where the information is made available.\n-\tWhat is required to enable communication between a network operator deploying a hosting network and a localized services provider:\n-\tInvestigate which type of interaction (e.g. configuration of the hosting network, information reporting) is needed, in such relation to enable the localized services provider for making the best use of the hosting network; and\nNOTE 2:\tCollaboration with SA WG5 and SA WG3 may be needed.\n",

This list contains the SNPNs advertised by all discovered non-3GPP access networks. A non-3GPP access network may advertise (e.g. with ANQP), not only the PLMNs with which 5G connectivity is supported (as specified in clause 6.3.12.2 of TS 23.501 [3]), but also the SNPNs with which 5G connectivity is supported.\n-\tThe UE selects an SNPN that is included in the list of available SNPNs.\n-\tWhen the UE wants to perform UE onboarding via an SNPN, the UE may select an SNPN that is included in the pre-configured ON-SNPN selection information.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the same SNPN identifier is included in the lists advertised by multiple non-3GPP access networks and the UE has determined to connect to this SNPN, the UE selects the underlying non-3GPP access network through which to establish the connection based on UE implementation.\n-\tThe UE selects a non-3GPP access network that supports 5G connectivity to the selected SNPN and initiates the registration procedure via trusted non-3GPP access specified in clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502 [4] in order to register with the selected SNPN via the selected non-3GPP access network. During the EAP authentication procedure the NAI provided by the UE indicates that 5G connectivity to a specific SNPN is required, e.g. NAI = \"<username>@nai.5gc.nid<NID>.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org\".\nNOTE 2:\tIn the case of SNPN ID with self-assigned NID, if the UE, when trying to register with an SNPN ID via TNAN X, is rejected by the AMF with a cause code that temporarily prevents the UE from registering with this SNPN ID, the UE does temporarily not attempt to register with the same SNPN ID, even if the same SNPN ID is advertised via another TNAN.\n-\tIf there are multiple non-3GPP access networks that support 5G connectivity to the selected SNPN as described in clause 6.3.3, then the UE places these non-3GPP access networks in a prioritized list and selects the highest priority non-3GPP access network from this list.

It illustrates the various steps involved in establishing and maintaining connections between different service providers and end-users. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the sequence of actions and decision points, and a list of key steps, such as network configuration, network testing, and network monitoring. The figure is essential for understanding the complex network architecture and ensuring the smooth operation of local services.\nFigure 6.7.3-1: High level procedures for providing access to local service\nH1.\tFor a hosting network to provide access to localized service, the service provider of the localized service needs to establish localized service agreement with the operator of a hosting network.\nThe service provider, according to clause 6.41.2.2 of TS 22.261 [2], can be network operators or 3rd party application providers. The services offered from service providers can be localized, and accessed via the hosting network based on the agreement between the different entities.\nA service agreement with UE's home network operator is needed to enable, e.g.:\n-\tUE to receive and use configuration provided by a 3rd party service provider to discover and access a hosting network and localized services.\n-\tCharging for the use of localized service.\n-\tThe interworking scenarios described in Annex G, clause G.1 of TS 22.261 [2].\n-\tService/session continuity between home network and hosting network.\nNOTE 1:\tThe service level agreements established between different entities are work assumptions for SA WG2.\nH2.\tThe hosting network is configured based on the service agreements with localized service provider for the localized service, e.g. QoS, number of end users, time, location, network slicing, etc.\nThe configuration of home network can include, e.g. whether a subscriber of the home network is authorized to use localized service, whether home network services can be accessed via hosting network, etc.\nNOTE 2:\tThe configuration of hosting network based on agreement with localized service provider for localized service is out of SA WG2 study scope. Whether there is a gap that needs to be addressed in 3GPP is up to SA WG5.\nH3.\tEnd user/UE is prompted with localized service (e.g. via ticket of an event, commercial etc) , and starts to look for methods how to access the localized service. This could trigger activities on the application layer (e.g. login a web page, scan a QR code etc) and further triggers demand/request from the UE to obtain information related localized services.\nNOTE 3:\tThe application layer activities are outside of 3GPP scope.\nH4.\tThe service provider / hosting network / home network can co-ordinately deliver to the UE information related to localized service(s). This step can also involve the serving network of the UE if UE is not currently served by home network. The information related to localized service(s) provided to UE in this step can also be unsolicited. In this case, step H3 can happen after, or during this step.\nH5.\tBased on the received information related to localized service(s), the end user/UE decides to accept and starts the process to discover/select the hosting network when the conditions of the localized service are about to be met (e.g. event time is approaching, end user enters the physical location etc).\nH6.\tUE connects to the hosting network, possibly with the authorization from home network, and prepares to access the localized service (e.g. User Plane setup, QoS negotiation, etc ).\nH7.\tUE temporarily stays in the hosting network to obtain the desired localized service and optionally home network services that are available via the hosting network.\nH8.\tWhen the temporary access to hosting network for localized service is about to be terminated due to for example event is over, end user has left the area, agreed quota is exhausted, etc, the UE returns from the hosting network.\nH9.\tHosting network and/or the service provider collect and provide charging information to UEs' home network operator, depends on the localized service agreement.\nNOTE 4:\tCharging aspects is to be coordinated with SA WG5.\nH10.\tWhen the localized service agreement is terminated, each entity shown in the figure may need to roll back the previous setup, in order to for example maintain the privacy of an end user against hosting network, prevent a UE to re-access hosting network, release network resources etc. The operation of roll back depends how the localized service is agreed between entities, e.g. if it is a time limited or a geographic limited service, whether it is an one-time service for a single event, etc.\n",

It does not adapt quickly to changes of signalling load. The purpose of the mechanism is to distribute the load in relation to the relative capacity of the involved Network Functions. The load distribution is based on Weight Factors in AMFs.\nAMF Control of Overload involves activation of NAS level congestion control, which is based on providing UEs with back-off time values. The UEs use the back-off time values to decide when to initiate NAS signalling. By providing different back-off time values to different UEs, the UE-initiated NAS-signalling is expected to be distributed over time, thereby reducing the peak signalling load.

We will call this UE an \"SNPN-localized services-enabled UE\".\nAn \"SNPN-localized services-enabled UE\" can be configured with a specific prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services. The UE can be pre-configured or dynamically configured by the subscribed SNPN or Home PLMN (e.g. using the SoR procedure as defined in Annex C of TS 23.122 [6]). The dynamically configured mechanism by the subscribed SNPN or Home PLMN (e.g. using the SoR procedure as defined in Annex C of TS 23.122 [6]) is not used to steer the UE from one hosting network to another hosting network. If the UE which is registered to a hosting network received the updated prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services, then the UE only uses the updated prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services to perform SNPN hosting network selection for localized services after the UE leaves the current hosting network for localized services.\nNOTE:\tIt assumes that how does the subscribed SNPN or Home PLMN construct the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services is addressed by other solutions.\nThe reason to have a separate list for localised services instead of a common one like the one is defined in clause 5.30.2.4 of TS 23.501 [3] is that there may be a case where the home SNPN or HPLMN or the UE is present in the same areas where localised services are provided and based on the existing selection procedures the UE will always prefer the home SNPN or HPLMN in this case.\nThe prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services is stored in the context of a given subscription in the UE. If the UE has multiple subscriptions, then the UE may have one prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services for each subscription.\nEach entry in the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services contains:\n1.\tAn identification of the SNPN and the localized service to access. This identification can be done in a few different ways:\n-\tIdentification Mode 1: SNPN ID (PLMN ID + NID) or a Group ID for Network Selection (GIN)\n-\tThis mode if identification assumes that the localized service is enabled in the whole SNPN with the SNPN ID or in every cell where GIN is broadcasted.\n-\tNote that an SNPN operator could potentially use multiple SNPN IDs in different areas.\n-\tIdentification Mode 2: SNPN ID or GIN, plus an additional Subnetwork ID.\n-\tThe subnetwork ID is used to assign a specific area where the localized service is provided, and it is broadcasted in SIB together with SNPN ID or GIN.\n-\tThe subnetwork ID may be a new ID or may be CAG (effectively extending CAG use to SNPN).\nNOTE:\tWhether to reuse CAG for subnetwork in SNPN or define a new ID is to be evaluated during evaluation/conclusions.\n-\tOne or more localized services may be assigned the same subnetwork ID if they are offered in the same area.\n2.\tValidity information:\n-\tValidity time period.\n-\tAdditional location information (TAI list or geographical information).\nThe UE uses this prioritized list and the validity information to perform discovery and selection and to leave the SNPN as described in the Procedures clause 6.10.3.\nFor PNI-NPN case, Rel-17 automatic selection defined in TS 23.501 [3] applies with one additional enhancement:\n-\tEntries in the Allowed CAG list of the UE can additionally contain the following validity information:\n-\tValidity time period (from/to date and time).\n-\tLocation (e.g. list of tracking areas where the CAG list is valid).\nNOTE:\tLocation information for Allowed CAG list only needed if PNI-NPN as hosting network can be a subset of a CAG.\nIn the case of PNI-NPN (CAG) selection for access to localized services, the UE only considers an entry in the Allowed CAG list valid if and while all conditions for that entry are met.\nFor the case of time period, a UE will only attempt registration on a CAG cell if e.g. the current time lies within the time period of the related condition.\nThe principles of this solution for enabling access to the SNPN Hosting Network for localized services are as follows:\n-\tThe hosting network maps a localized service to a subnetwork ID. Multiple localized services may be mapped to the same subnetwork ID if they are offered in the same service area.\n-\tThe Credentials Holder is aware of the subnetwork ID for the localized service in the SNPN hosting network.\nNOTE:\tThe interaction between Hosting Network and Credentials Holder is not covered in this solution, but the inclusion of subnetwork ID may be included in other solutions in the TR.\n-\tThe UE is configured by the credentials holder as described in clause 6.10.2.1.\n-\tThe RAN, via OAM, is configured to broadcast one or more subnetwork IDs.\n-\tThe UE performs Network selection as in clause 6.10.2.1 using the subnetwork ID if configured. The UE initiates UE registration procedure.\n-\tThe AMF receives from the UDM (at the Credentials Holder) the subscription information for UE access to a localized service in the Hosting Network. The AMF may receive also the subnetwork ID included in the NR access restriction information.\n-\tIf the AMF does not receive any subnetwork ID, i.e. the access for the localized service is enabled in the whole SNPN, regular registration procedure is executed.\n-\tIf the AMF receives a subnetwork ID, the AMF checks whether the UE is located in the subnetwork ID. This may be done:\na.\tVia configuration in AMF.\nb.\tVia receiving from NG-RAN the subnetwork ID(s) in the cell the UE is camping on.\n-\tThe AMF accepts the registration request if the UE is in the subnetwork ID received from the UDM.\n-\tThe AMF rejects the registration request if the UE is outside the subnetwork ID received from the UDM.\n-\tThe AMF provides to the NG-RAN the access restriction to the subscribed subnetwork ID. The NG-RAN uses this information for handover decision. The NG-RAN does not initiate handover towards a cell that would be outside the subnetwork ID.\n-\tIf the UE moves outside the subnetwork ID the UE does not attempt to initiate any procedure towards the hosting network. The UE may initiate network selection as in clause 6.10.2.1.\n",

This configuration allows the UE to start operating in \"SNPN Localized services mode\" when the right validity conditions are met. The UE may continue at this point be in either SNPN access mode or PLMN access mode until the conditions of validity information.\nStep 2.\tWhen some validity information is met (e.g. time validity) in step 1, the UE scans for SNPNs in the background.\nNOTE:\tDetails of how often to scan, etc. are out of scope of SA WG2.\nStep 3.\tIf the UE finds at least one available and allowable SNPN which meets the validity conditions, then the UE switches to a new network selection mode \"SNPN Localized services mode\" and selects an available SNPN from the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services.\nStep 4.\tThe UE performs Initial registration in the SNPN and presents the SUPI of the currently active subscription (subscription that contains the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services which the UE used to select the SNPN).\nThe UE performs the following steps:\nStep 1.\tIf the validity information in the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services for the currently registered SNPN are no longer met, then the UE disables \"SNPN Localized services mode\" and returns to the mode in which the UE was before activating SNPN Localized services mode (i.e. return to SNPN access mode or PLMN access mode). If the validity conditions that are no longer met is the Validity time period, this could occur to many devices at the same time and a large number of UEs may return to their HPLMN at the same time if measures are not taken. Therefore, two possible solutions to address this issue (key issue #6) can be taken:\n-\tOption 1: The CH or HPLMN (depending on case) configures UEs with slightly different end time to the validity time period.\n-\tOption 2: The UE applies a random delay before initiating step 2.\nStep 2.\tThe UE performs SNPN selection or PLMN selection as defined in TS 23.122 [6] (depending on the mode).\nThe UE performs the following steps:\nStep 1.\tUE is configured with Allowed CAG list, and some of the entries in the Allowed CAG list are associated with validity information for localized services.\nStep 2.\tWhen the validity information is met in the Allowed CAG list, the UE starts to additionally consider the CAG cell during cell reselection and also consider the associated PLMN of the Allowed CAG list is valid if it was excluded during the previous network selection procedure due to CAG validation.\nStep 3.\tThe UE selects the CAG cell and potentially a new PLMN.\nStep 4.\tThe UE accesses the network via the CAG cell, and potentially a new registration if there is a PLMN change.\nIf the validity information of the Allowed CAG list is no longer met, UE re-evaluates the CAG related configuration and triggers cell reselection and/or network selection procedure.\nThe UE displays to the user a list of available SNPNs, marking first which SNPNs, if any, are in the \"prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services\" and at least one entry in the validity information is met. The user can select an SNPN for access to localized services.\nFigure 6.10.3.6-1 shows the call flow for the UE registration into an SNPN hosting network for localized service(s) access.\nThe figure depicts the registration procedure for accessing localized services in the SNPN Hosting Network. It illustrates the steps taken by users to register their devices and access specific services. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the process from the user's perspective, and a list of required information, such as the user's device type, network type, and service type. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different types of services and their corresponding registration requirements. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the registration process for accessing localized services in the SNPN Hosting Network.\nFigure 6.10.3.6-1: Registration procedure for access to localized service(s) in SNPN Hosting Network\n0.a.\tIt is assumed the Credentials Holder is aware of which subnetwork ID in an SNPN hosting network applies to a specific (set of) localized service(s). It is assumed the UE has been configured for selection of SNPN for localized services as in 6.10.3.1, and that NG-RAN is configured to broadcast subnetwork ID in cells that belong to a subnetwork.\n0.b.\tThe UE performs selection of SNPN for localized services as in 6.10.3.1.\nThe UE and SNPN perform registration procedure as in TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.2.2.2.2 with the following additions:\n-\tIn step 3, the NG-RAN may include the (list of) subnetwork ID(s) that are available in the cell the UE is camping on,\n-\tIn step 14, the UDM provides the AMF with subscription information for access to localized service(s) the UE is authorized at the SNPN Hosting network. The UDM may also provide a subnetwork ID in the NR access restriction information, to indicate that the UE only is allowed access in the subnetwork ID.\n-\tBefore step 15, if the AMF received a subnetwork ID from UDM, the AMF checks if the UE is camping in the subnetwork ID. If not, the AMF sends Registration Reject to UE with appropriate cause code, and terminates the procedure. If yes, the AMF proceeds with completing Registration Procedure.\n-\tIn step 21, the AMF includes the access restriction information including subnetwork ID. The NG-RAN uses this information to avoid handover to a cell not belonging to the subnetwork ID.\n",

When a UE registers to the selected hosting network and receives localized services provided by the hosting network, architecture in figure 6.11.2.1-1 is used. If the UE also need to get services from the home network, the UE may establish home routed PDU session as shown in figure 6.11.2.1-2. Whether the UE receives a specific service from the hosting network or home network is determined based on subscription of the UE by establishing a local breakout session, or a home routed session.

The Localized Service Information contains following information:\n-\tLocalized Service Name.\n-\tValidity condition:\n-\tTime and Spatial validity.\n-\tHosting network information:\n-\tPrecedence.\n-\tHosting network ID (PLMN ID) and RAT type (e.g. NR, E-UTRA).\n-\tLADN DNN.\n-\tAllowed CAG information.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the Localized service is provided in the home network (i.e. PNI-NPN is in the home network), hosting network information can be omitted.\nWhen a UE is registered in home network, the UE may request Localized Service Information to the AMF by sending NAS message (e.g. Registration). If subscription of the UE allows to use the Localized service, the AMF provides localized service information to the UE. The UE stores the received Localized Service Information until time validity condition is fulfilled. The spatial validity condition in the Localized Service Information can be represented by geographical area. The exact service area information of hosting network is provided to the UE as a part of LADN information during the registration to the hosting network.\nNOTE 2:\tIn the case of roaming scenario, the AMF in the serving PLMN provides Localized Service Information to the UE.\nNOTE 3:\tThe AMF can provide Localized Service Information to the UE without UE request if subscription of the UE allows to use the Localized service. For example, the AMF may provide Localized Service Information when a UE enters an area where the Localized service is available.\nInstead of providing Allowed CAG information to the UE in the Localized Service Information, the hosting network may provide Allowed CAG list to the UE by using existing procedure. However, in the case of roaming scenario, the serving PLMN cannot provision Allowed CAG list of hosting network to the inbound roamers as current specification only allows to update CAG information of the serving PLMN in the case of roaming. If the UE receives Allowed CAG information via Localized Service Information, the UE shall use the Allowed CAG information only when the UE access the hosting network for the Localized service.\nBased on received Localized Service Information, the UE selects hosting network and registers to the network. When a UE registers to the hosting network and has the subscription to a specific LADN DNN for local service or a wild card DNN, the AMF provides LADN information (i.e. LADN DNN and LADN service area) to the UE according to the existing LADN mechanism. The UE uses the LADN information to access localized services provided by the hosting network.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen hosting network operator configures LADN information in the AMF, the operator can provide associated validity time of LADN DNN so that the AMF provides LADN information when the validity time is satisfied.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the Localized service is provided in the home network (i.e. PNI-NPN is in the home network), the UE skips hosting network selection. If validity condition in Localized Service Information is fulfilled, the UE can requests LADN information to the AMF according to the existing LADN mechanism.\n",

For subscribers of other PLMNs this means there needs to be proper roaming/service agreements in place.\nIn PNI-NPN a Closed Access Groups is used to apply access control for a group of subscribers i.e. to prevent UE(s) that are not allowed to access the NPN via the associated CAG cell(s). The CAG cell(s) are inherently associated with location or spatial validity condition(s) and hence additional spatial validity condition is not required to be provided with Allowed CAG list.\nHosting network specific aspects can be addressed as additional considerations, if needed, for NPN as a network slice of a PLMN described in TS 23.501 [3] Annex D.2. Network Slice Selection Policy (NSSP) could be associated with hosting network specific time validation criteria.\nPNI-NPN slice may be only available in the TA(s) that span over the event location, i.e. S-NSSAI is only provided to the UE as allowed S-NSSAI in this TA by the AMF. UE may consider TAI list, Allowed NSSAI, Allowed CAG list as communicated by AMF in Registration Accept or UE Configuration Update to discover a specific hosting network configuration.\nUE can be pre-configured with S-NSSAI(s) that are used for localized services, i.e. PLMN can reserve few values for this purpose and pre-provision the UEs with these S-NSSAI(s).

There can be UE implementation specific means how to map service specific information retrieved via OTT to hosting network information, such as S-NSSAI/DNN. The UE may then perform registration update to network with new slice information.\nThis solution addresses KI#4 and the following principles are used:\n-\tUE is assumed to have only single radio capability.\n-\tThe home network UDM is assumed to have UE's subscribe localized services and corresponding hosting network information.\n-\tThe home network UDM invokes Namf_EventExposure_Notify to receive UE location information event notification in order to be aware of the availability of hosting network. When the hosting network is available, the UDM can trigger SoR procedure to update information on available hosting network(s).\n-\tThe home network UDM may send location information to the AMF, enabling the AMF to assign the Registration Area according to the received location information.\n-\tWhen the UE is camping in the home network, the home network AMF determines the location of the UE, for instance, based on AMF determining change of Tracking Area (TA), e.g. Tracking Area Code (TAC) or cell id, in Registration Request (Mobility Registration Update) received from UE as specified in clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [4].\n-\tThe AMF is aware of availability of hosting network(s) that corresponds to (allowed) areas (such as tracking area) which represent the current UE location as indicated in the Mobility Registration Update sent by the UE. The AMF may assign Registration Area to the UE in such a way that the UE performs Mobility Registration Update when UE moves to into the Tracking Area (TA) where the hosting network is present. The AMF may be aware of the availability and other information of the hosting network(s) in the registration area by local configuration or based on the location information received from UDM, or by service agreement with hosting network.\n-\tBased on availability of the hosting network(s) in the location of the UE and considering other information such as subscription information, UE capability, roaming and local configuration/policies or other operator specific criteria, AMF may decide to assist UE in discovering hosting network(s).\n-\tIf the serving network decides to assist UE in discovering hosting network(s), the AMF may:\n-\tthe AMF may include information on available hosting network(s) as part of Registration Accept message sent to UE.\n-\tthe UDM may as part of registration procedure initiate Steering of Roaming (SoR), as specified in Annex C of TS 23.122 [6], to update information of available hosting network(s) to UE.\n-\tthe AMF may initiate UE Configuration Update procedure, as specified in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [4], to update information on available hosting network(s).\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether the existing information element in the SoR is sufficient to carry hosting network related information or what enhancements are needed.\n-\tThe AMF may invoke the Namf_EventExposure_Notify to provide mobility related event to (authorized) SMF(s) that have subscribed for the events by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe as specified in clause 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [3] and clause 4.15.4.2 of TS 23.502 [4]. Mobility event notification may include information of available hosting network(s) or could be mapped (e.g. PRA) to such information in SMF. SMF may use the information of available hosting network(s) received from AMF to initiate PDU Session Modification to inform UE, e.g. using PCO, about specific details of hosting network configuration such as URL that UE may use to access localized services captive portal for UE onboarding and remote provisioning purposes. SMF may be locally configured with configuration information for hosting network(s).\n-\tUE could use the localized services captive portal, e.g. for UE onboarding to hosting network (to obtain credentials) while still connected in home network (or current serving network) and using existing PDU session.\n-\tInformation of available hosting network(s) may include:\n-\tindication of availability of one or more hosting network(s);\n-\tlist of (PLMN ID, SNPN ID), GINs (as defined in clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [3]) or localized services specific identifier of available hosting network(s);\n-\tN3IWF address and necessary credentials to access hosting network(s);\n-\tSpecific details of hosting network such as URL or other data for UE to be able to connect to the localized services captive portal page.\n-\tThe serving network may also broadcast GIN that is localized services specific or localized services specific broadcast indicator to indicate localized services availability with which the hosting network has an agreement with. If GIN is used, the serving network also broadcasts GIN when requested by the UE. In the case of localized services, a new indicator is needed in the broadcast that a GIN can be used to select a hosting network. GIN, the localized services identifier and other information such as HRNN (Human readable network name) may also be displayed on the UE allowing for manual selection by the user. The GIN that is hosting network specific or the hosting network specific indicator broadcasted by the serving network could be cell specific.\nNOTE 1:\tIn Rel-17 maximum number of GINs is 24 (see TS 38.331 [14]).\nNOTE 2:\tBroadcast details will be determined by RAN WG2.\n-\tBased on information of available hosting network(s) UE receives from current serving network (e.g. initiated by AMF or triggered by GIN broadcasted by the serving network), UE may:\n-\taccess hosting network using credentials owned by a Credentials Holder separate from the hosting network. Credentials Holder can be the home network (e.g. the PLMN or the SNPN). Hosting network identifier information may include indication that access using credentials from a Credentials Holder is supported or indication that hosting network allows registration attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured in list of preferred SNPNs/GINs to select the hosting network. This follows the principles defined in Rel-17 for automatic network selection (TS 23.501 [3] clause 5.30.2.4.2) and manual network selection (clause 5.30.2.4.3 of TS 23.501 [3]). UE authorization for hosting network services is checked by the serving network.\n-\taccess hosting network by using UE onboarding and remote provisioning as specified in clause 5.30.2.10 of TS 23.501 [3] with onboarding SUCI/SUPI and other configuration information provisioned using UE Configuration Update (or SoR) procedure while connected to home network.\n-\taccess from the serving network to hosting network via NWu interface and N3IWF located in the hosting network using onboarding SUCI/SUPI in registration procedure. Onboarding SUCI/SUPI, N3IWF address, default credentials to establish connectivity via NWu to access hosting network and other data can be configured using UE Configuration Update procedure to the UE. The access credentials can be UE specific or usable by all UEs of a certain serving network. In this case hosting network acts as the overlay network, serving network acts as the underlay network. UE may use PDU session in (overlay) hosting network that is restricted to access only to the localized services portal page where the UE can be provisioned with service and network related data.\n-\taccess hosting network that offers free services for users in the area, e.g. using sponsored connectivity.\n-\taccess hosting network services for subscribers of the serving network (e.g. the PLMN or the SNPN) with which they have agreement. In this case, authorization to offer hosting network services is checked by the serving network.\n",

This includes how to configure UE with information enabling the UE to be aware of services that can be accessed via a specific network (e.g. home network or hosting NPN).\n-\tHow home network determines the need to steer or instruct the UE, and how the home network steers or instructs the UE to select a hosting network for obtaining home network services or localized services or select a network for a specific service which is available from both hosting and home network.\n-\tHow to mitigate user plane and control plane overload when a high number of UEs return to home network from a temporary hosting network , especially ensure the service continuity for the UEs with single radio capability which are camping in the hosting network, and using hosting network as an underlay network to access the services provided by the home network.\nThe main principles of this solution are that:\n-\tThe localized service provider can act as the AF to manage the localized service agreements among Hosting Network operator, localized service provider, and Home Network or Credentials Holder via exposure interface.\n-\tThe localized service provider can act as the AF to manage the subscribed localized service information in subscription data within the Home Network or Credentials Holder or Hosting network via network exposure.

                            "text_content": "Providing access to localized services refers to the capability to provide access to a hosting network (PNI-NPN or SNPN) and a set of services offered by the hosting network provider, other mobile network operators (PLMN or SNPN) and 3rd party application providers. The services may be localized (i.e. provided at specific/limited area) and may be bounded in time.\nThe UE's with or without prior subscription to the hosting network can access to the localized services via hosting network using access credentials from Home Network or Credentials Holder once the UE has subscribed successfully to the localized services of the hosting network. Then this solution is described as below:\n-\tThe localized service provider acting as the application function manages the service agreements among Hosting Network operator, localized service provider, and Home Network or Credentials Holder via network exposure. The service agreements include:\n-\tAvailability of each of the localized service (service identification, service parameters [DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS], service authorization methods [NSSAA or PDU Session SAA], service access methods [LBO or HR], time and location); and\n-\tList of Supported Home Networks or Credentials Holders for each localized service; and\n-\tList of Supported Hosting Networks for each localized service.\n-\tThe localized service provider may request the hosting network operator to configure or update its network rule (e.g. at the specific time and location) to provide the localized services. Based on the request from the localized service provider and the agreement between hosting network operator and localized service provider, the hosting network may configure or update its network rules in NFs to provide the localized services. The hosting network operator may respond the localized service provider with the result for providing the localized services.\n-\tThe hosting network may advertise the localized services to the UE according to the network rules.\n-\tUE/User can subscribe to the localized service for a specific Hosting Network via out-of-3GPP means, e.g. online store, portal:\n-\tThe UE should be a subscriber of the supported Home Network or should have credentials from the supported Credentials Holder in the service agreement; and\n-\tThe target Hosting Network should be one in the list of supported Hosting Networks; and\n-\tThe localized service provider should know localized service information selected by the UE/User, e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location, this information selected by the UE/User should be covered by the Availability of the localized service in the service agreement. The localized service provider should also know the information of the UE's subscribed Hosting Network and Home Network or Credentials Holder; and\n-\tThe UE/User can obtain the service credentials assigned by the localized service, the service credentials can be used to authenticate and authorize the UE access to the localized service.\n-\tThe localized service provider acting as the application function, updates subscription data in the subscribed Home Network or Credentials Holder or Hosting network via network exposure, so the subscription data can contain the localized service information subscribed by a single UE or a group of UEs:\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how network exposure is used by localized service provider to update the subscription data and what the subscription data for localized service contains.\n-\tIf the UE will access the Hosting Network using credential from Credentials Holder with AAA Server, then the localized service provider updates the subscription data in the subscribed Hosting Network, so the subscription data contains the indication that primary AA by AAA-S is required as well as the subscribed localized service information e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location.\n-\tIf the UE will access the Hosting Network using credential from Credentials Holder with AUSF and UDM, then the localized service provider updates the subscription data in the subscribed Home Network, so the subscription data contains the subscribed Hosting Network information as well as the subscribed localized service information e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location.\n-\tIf the UE will access the Hosting Network using credentials from Home Network, then the localized service provider updates the subscription data in the subscribed Home Network, so the subscription data contains the subscribed Hosting Network information as well as the subscribed localized service information e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location.\n-\tThe Home Network updates UE with the network selection information for the subscribed Hosting Network (e.g. service identification, Hosting Network ID, temporal validity condition, spatial validity condition) when subscribed time starts and/or when UE enters specific area indicated by the subscribed location contained in the subscription data:\n-\tThe temporal validity condition is derived from the subscribed time for the localized service, this indicates the time period when the network selection information is valid.\n-\tThe spatial validity condition is derived from the subscribed location for the localized service, this indicates the area where the network selection information is valid.\n-\tThe Home Network can also provide UE with its N3IWF address to enable UE to access both home network services and localized services via the hosting network:\n-\tThe N3IWF address of home network is used for UE to determine its way to access to hosting network based on its radio-capability.(e.g. access hosting network directly, or access home network via hosting network as an underlay network).\n-\tThe UE moves in the subscribed location for the localized service and the temporal validity condition is still valid, and starts discovery and selection of the Hosting Network.\n-\tThe UE registers in the Hosting Network with the access credentials and accesses to the localized services using the service credentials.\n-\tThe UE is authenticated and authorized by the Home Network or the Credentials Holder.\n-\tThe UE can be provisioned with information related with the subscribed localized service (Allowed NSSAI, service authorization method, URSP rules).\n-\tThe UE setups the connectivity to the localized service by establishing a PDU Session with the DNN, S-NSSAI associated with the localized service, the Hosting Network can allocate resources for the PDU Session according to the subscribed QoS or service access method.\n-\tWith the subscribed service authorization method, the Hosting Network performs the service authorization using the indicated authorization method.\n-\tWith the subscribed time and location, the Hosting Network performs access control to the localized service.\n-\tWhen the UE moves out the subscribed location for the localized service or the temporal validity condition becomes out-dated:\n-\tThe UE de-registers from the Hosting Network, the UE may delete the network selection information for the subscribed Hosting Network and information related with the subscribed localized service.\n-\tThe Hosting Network de-registers the UE and releases network resources reserved for the UE.\n-\tThe localized service provider may delete the localized service information from subscription data in the Home Network or Credentials Holder or Hosting network.\nFigure 6.13.2-1 depicts the scenarios for support of providing access to localized services.\nThe figure depicts a support for providing access to localized services via exposure enhancements, illustrating the various methods and technologies used to enhance the visibility of services in a specific area.\nFigure 6.13.2-1: Support of providing access to localized services via exposure enhancements\n-\tWhen UE returns to Home Network from the Hosting Network, the AMF of Hosting Network may group the UEs based on the Nwu status and the availability of the Home Network of the UE. Hosting Network indicates the UE with a random back-off timer from different range of values corresponding to different groups to register to Home Network.\n-\tAMF of hosting network indicates UE the localized service(s) end. One or more localized services ID may be included in this indication.\n-\tUpon receiving the end indication of the localized service(s) from the AMF, UE may:\n-\tdetermine whether all the target localized services provided by the hosting network end.\n-\tdetermine its current Nwu interface status for the specific home network.\n-\tdetect whether there is a coverage of the specific home network in a good signal condition(e.g. meet the requirement of the signal strength to access to)\n-\tIf UE determines all the target localized services provided by the hosting network end, UE reports the Nwu interface status and related home network identity(e.g. PLMN ID) that the Nwu interface connects to. UE reports the availability of the coverage of the home network.\n-\tBased on the reports of the UEs, AMF groups the UE and indicate the UE with a random back-off timer from different range of values corresponding to different groups to register to home network in different groups.\nFor every single home network, AMF may group the UEs into four groups:\n-\tGroup1: Nwu interface for home network exists and coverage of the home network exists. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register and establish the PDU session in the home network immediately.\n-\tGroup2: Nwu interface for home network does not exist and coverage of the home network exists. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register to the home network immediately. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group2 should be longer than which of in Group1.\n-\tGroup3: Nwu interface for home network exists and coverage of the home network does not exist. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register and establish the PDU session in the home network when UE detects the availability of the home network. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group3 should be longer than which of in Group2.\n-\tGroup4: Nwu interface for home network does not exist and coverage of the home network does not exist. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register to home network when UE detects the availability of the home network.

                            "text_content": "The figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for the interaction between a hosting network and a localized service provider to enable a user to access localized services via the hosting network. The figure includes a host network, a local service provider, and a user, with the host network acting as the central point of communication. The local service provider is responsible for providing the localized services, while the user is the one who accesses these services. The figure illustrates the steps involved in this interaction, including the establishment of a connection, the exchange of data, and the termination of the connection.\nFigure 6.13.3.1-1: Procedure for the interaction between hosting network and localized service provider to enable UE to access the localized services via hosting network\nThe precondition for this procedure is the existence of a SLA between the Hosting network and the provider of localized service to enable the interaction between the AF and the Hosting Network as required. And there should be another precondition for this procedure that UE with target localized service has registered to the hosting AMF and setup a PDU session with the hosting SMF, and the related AM/SM policy association have been established between the hosting AMF/SMF with the hosting PCF.\n-\tStep 1: AF(localized service provider) may initiate or update the request to the NEF of the hosting network for providing access to localized services with the characteristics of the localized service, which including:\n-\tlist of the identification of the localized services;\n-\tvalidity restriction for each localized service, e.g. the validity of time or location;\n-\tQoS requirements for each localized service.\n-\tStep 2: NEF/PCF of the hosting network determines its network rules for the localized services based on the request in Step1 and the agreement with the localized service provider. The network rules are used to reserve the network resources and meet the QoS requirement with the specific validity restriction for providing access to the localized services.\n-\tStep 3: NEF/PCF of the hosting network responses the result for providing access to localized services to the AF (localized services provider), the result corresponds to the request in the Step1, which including:\n-\tlist of the identification of the localized services, which can be provided by the hosting network;\n-\tvalidity restriction for each localized service provided by the hosting network, e.g. the validity of time or location;\n-\tQoS requirements for each localized service provided by the hosting network.\n-\tStep 4: PCF of hosting network updates the parameters of the AMF and SMF in order to enforce its network rules which are determined in step 3 to provide access to localized services.\n-\tPCF will invoke Npcf_AMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request to AMF as defined in clause 4.16.2.2 of TS 23.502 [4], which includes the list of the identification of the localized services, the modified service area restrictions (e.g. the validity of location), and the modified QoS (such as UE-AMBR, UE-Slice-MBR) parameters to notify AMF the access and mobility related policy for localized services has been updated.\n-\tPCF will invoke Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request to SMF as defined in clause 4.16.5.2 of TS 23.502 [4], which includes the modified QoS (e.g. Authorized MBR, Authorized session-AMBR), the Revalidation time limit, the Time Condition, etc. parameters to notify SMF the PDU session related policy information for localized services has been updated.\n-\tStep 5: hosting network advertise the localized services to the UE according to the network rules (e.g. at the specific time and location).\n-\tWhen AMF received the modified access and mobility related policy from PCF in step 4, AMF will deploy and store this updated policy information, then provisioning the Service Area Restrictions (e.g. the validity of location), the list of the identification of the localized services (such as DNN and/or S-NSSAIs) to the UE, and provisioning the UE-AMBR, Service Area Restrictions to the NG-RAN.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for a home network to update its UE (User Equipment) with network selection information for hosting a network. The process involves selecting a network, updating the UE, and ensuring proper communication between the network and the UE.\nFigure 6.13.3.2-1: Procedure for home network to update UE with network selection information for hosting network\n-\tStep 1: UE indicates its target localized services (via a list of identification of the localized services) in the NAS message: Registration Request when UE registers to the AMF of the home network.\n-\tStep 2: Home network may perform the authorization and authentication for the target localized services based on the local network policy and UE subscription.\nEditor's note: It is FFS how the authorization and authentication for the target localized service are performed in the home network,\n-\tStep 3: Based on the UE subscription of the target localized services provided by the hosting networks and the availability of the hosting network(s) in the location of the UE, the AMF of the home network may returns the information of the hosting network providing the target services to the UE in the NAS message: Registration Accept or UE configuration update, which includes:\n-\tList of SNPN IDs of the hosting network associated with the localized services.\n-\tSpecial restriction for the localized services, including time and location restrictions.\n-\tN3IWF address of the home network, which may be used for hosting network as an underlay network to access the home network.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether ANDSP can be reused to provide N3IWF information to UE.\n-\tCredentials to access hosting network(s).\nNOTE:\tWhether and how credential can be sent to UE via NAS message is up to SA WG3.\nUE may store the information of the hosting network; it is up to UE to determine its way to access to hosting network when it is available, such as:\n-\tFor a dual- radio capability UE, UE may access the hosting network directly on one radio link and retain the connection with the home network with the other radio link.\n-\tFor a single-radio capability UE, UE access the home network via the hosting network as an underlay network, for both services from hosting network and the home network.\nThe figure depicts a procedure for a network to instruct an UE (User Equipment) to return to the home network. The network is shown as a series of nodes connected by a backbone, with a central node (eNodeB) acting as the home network. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the process, including the use of a procedure to guide the UE to return to the home network.\nFigure 6.13.3-1: Procedure for hosting network to instruct UE to return to the home network\n-\tStep 1: AMF sends the localized service end indication to the registered UE, which may include the list of the identity of the localized service that is about to end.\n-\tStep 2: Upon receiving the end indication of the localized service from the AMF, If UE determines all the target localized services provided by the hosting network end, UE reports the Nwu interface status and related home network identity(e.g. PLMN ID) that the Nwu interface connects to. UE reports the availability of the coverage of the home network (e.g. the signal strength of the home network detected by the UE meets the requirement to access to).\n-\tStep 3: For every single home network, AMF may group the UEs into four groups:\n-\tGroup1: Nwu interface for home network exists and coverage of the home network exists. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register and establish the PDU session in the home network immediately.\n-\tGroup2: Nwu interface for home network does not exist and coverage of the home network exists. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register to the home network immediately. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group2 should be longer than which of in Group1.\n-\tGroup3: Nwu interface for home network exists and coverage of the home network does not exist. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register and establish the PDU session in the home network when UE detects the availability of the home network. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group3 should be longer than which of in Group2.\n-\tGroup4: Nwu interface for home network does not exist and coverage of the home network does not exist. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register to home network when UE detects the availability of the home network. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group4 should be longer than which of in Group3.\nNOTE:\tFor each of the home network operator and the hosting network operator, there may be a SLA to configure the pre-defined range value corresponding to different groups. On the other hand, the hosting network may configure the pre-defined range value corresponding to different groups locally.\n-\tStep 4: AMF sends the mobility command to each of UE, which includes the assigned random back-off timer value from the predefined range corresponding to different groups.\n-\tStep 5: Upon receiving the value of back-off timer from the AMF of the hosting network, UE should waits until the expiry of the back-off timer to initiate the registration attempt and PDU session establishment request attempt if needed to the home network.\n",

It is also assumed that the PLMN offers services e.g. IMS voice/SMS that the UE cannot access directly from the non-3GPP access and therefore it needs to connect to the 3GPP CN. This is achieved for example through connection to N3WIF in the case of untrusted non-3GPP access architecture or for Trusted Non-3GPP access using the network elements of TNAP and TNGF.\nThese assumptions may though not hold true in \"enterprise\" environment that will possibly deploy 3GPP based \"private cellular network\"/SNPN while it already has a deployed WLAN infrastructure in place. For example in such enterprise environment the identities and credentials used for WLAN authentication could be already provisioned to the \"enterprise\" UEs before the SNPN is deployed. In such network environment also access to specific services can be restricted through using a VPN that runs on top of internet connection provided from WLAN or using application layer authentication and therefore there is possibly no need to have N3IWF in the \"untrusted non-3GPP access\" architecture and there is no need to upgrade the existing WLAN infrastructure to support what is required from TNAP and TGNF in the \"trusted non-3GPP access\" architecture.\nThe other two aspects that need consideration is the access network selection and mobility. For access network selection mechanisms standardised by 3GPP e.g. using ANDSP need to be enhanced for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload or rely on local UE configuration. Seamless mobility is not in scope of this solution since many applications can also work with nomadic mobility.\nThe solution describes how UE can access an SNPN with NG-RAN on one hand and a WLAN Access Network on the other hand using the same credentials. If the credentials use AKA and USIM authentication and are stored in UDM, the existing mechanisms for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload defined in TS 33.501 [10] and TS 23.501 [3] apply.\nIf the credentials are stored in a AAA Server possibly new authentication procedures and Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) architecture need to be defined. After being authenticated the UE does not have access to 5GC via WLAN and it performs only Non-seamless WLAN offload traffic.\nIn summary this solution proposes the following enhancements:\n(1)\tin the case of SNPN with non-3GPP credentials there has to be an association between the WiFi and cellular (non-3GPP) credentials that are stored in the cellular modem; and\n(2)\tWLANSPs support for SNPN ID, GIN to identify WLAN AN associated with the SNPN.\nThe details are described in the following clauses.\n",

The diagram illustrates the steps involved in the authentication process, including the authentication request, authentication response, and authentication failure.

WLAN network selection can be based on enhanced WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP) rules from ANSDP used for Non-Seamless WiFi Offload i.e. as defined in clause 4.8.2.1.6 of TS 23.402 [9].\nThe SNPN can configure the UE to use a specific identity (SUCI) and credentials for specific WLAN networks, e.g. by associating the conditions from WLANSP rules that in Rel-17 are only supported for PLMNs with a specific identity (SUCI) and credentials to be used for the specific WLAN network e.g. based on the PreferredSSIDList or the HomeNetwork attribute containing the SNPN-id.\nSteps 1-8 are out of scope of SA2 and are shown for information:\n1.\tA connection is established between the UE and the WLAN AP, using a specific procedure based on IEEE 802.11.\n2.\tThe WLAN AP sends an EAP Identity Request to the UE.\n3.\tThe UE always sends the SUCI in NAI format.\n4.\tThe WLAN AP sends a SWa protocol message (could be over RADIUS or Diameter interface) with EAP identity response, NAI containing the SUCI to AAA Proxy.\n5.\tIf AAA Proxy is used it forwards the SWa message to AAA Server based on the NAI of the SUCI.\n6.\tEAP authentication is performed.

The UE data flows are identified using URSP configuration for Non-Seamless Offload, or UE Local Configurations as defined in TS 23.503 [5].

Consequently in order to enable different access control for the following scenarios:\n-\tTo allow or forbidden the access to the SNPN via direct N3GPP access, e.g. a WLAN deployed in the SNPN.\n-\tTo allow or forbidden the access to the SNPN via indirect N3GPP access, e.g. via PLMN as defined in clause 5.30.2.8 and Annex D, clause D.3 of TS 23.501 [3] specify how the UE can access SNPN services via a PLMN.\nIt is required to distinguish the scenarios otherwise the restriction \"Non-3GPP access to 5GCN not allowed\" or lack of restriction applies to both scenarios since from the point of view of SNPN they are both a N3GPP accesses.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in selecting a new network path for a specific service, ensuring that the service remains available in the event of network failure. The figure shows the network topology, including the network paths, the service, and the selected path. The TNR procedure is crucial for maintaining service quality and user experience in a network environment.\nFigure 6.25.3.1-1: Temporary Network Reselection (TNR) procedure to enable localized services\nThe following steps describe how to use Temporary Network Reselection (TNR) procedure to enable localized services as shown in Figure 6.25.3.1-1:\n1.\tThe UE is already registered in a network, which was selected based on existing network selection procedures defined in TS 23.122 [6].\n2.\tThe UE selects a localized service (e.g. the user selects a Localized service, the application requests a Localized service) and is aware of which hosting network to use for this localized service.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the UE gets aware of which hosting network to use for the localized service is assumed to be described in other solutions.\n3.\tThe UE and the home network (i.e. HPLMN or subscribed SNPN) decides to enable TNR procedure.\nThe home network can authorize its subscriber to use the TNR, e.g.:\ni.\tvia pre-authorization for the UE based on UE configuration; or\nii.\tvia UE request as described in clause 6.25.3.2.\n4.\tThe UE stores the current registered network, and activates TNR when the criteria associated with the TNR are met.\nThe TNR can be achieved, in one way, by reprioritizing (or reordering) the list of networks that are made available to the UE, with the hosting network as the top priority.\nAnother way is to avoid the automatic network selection to the higher priority networks, e.g. by avoiding triggering of periodic checks for higher prioritized networks when the UE is in a VPLMN (e.g. hosting network is a PNI-NPN which is different than the serving PLMN and has a lower priority than the serving PLMN).\nThe TNR can also trigger the UE to switch the SNPN access mode if it is needed (e.g. hosting network is an SNPN while the UE is currently registered in a PLMN).\nThe criteria associated with the authorized TNR can include, e.g. start/stop time, location, availability of home network services, etc.\n5.\tThe UE starts and stops using the localized service.\n6.\tThe UE deactivates the TNR when the criteria are no longer met, and selects a new network based on the existing network selection procedures defined in TS 23.122 [6].\nNOTE 2:\tIt is up to CT1 to determine whether and how the previous registered network stored in step 4 is used in the network selection after UE deactivates the TNR.\nThe figure depicts a home network authorizing Temporary Network Reselection (TNR), which is a method used to reroute network traffic to a different network when a network is experiencing congestion or failure. This process allows for faster and more efficient network performance.\nFigure 6.25.3.2-1: Home network authorizes Temporary Network Reselection (TNR)\nThe temporary network reselection (TNR) can be requested by the UE and be authorized by the home network, reusing Steering of Roaming (SOR) procedure defined in TS 23.122 [6] with additions listed below.\nFigure 6.25.3.2-1 shows PLMN as an example of the home network. The same principle applies if home network is SNPN.\n0.\tThe UE is already registered via an AMF in a VPLMN or in the HPLMN. This implies that the AMF has already registered in UDM, has obtained subscription data for the UE and subscribed to subscription data updates including possible updates of SOR information.\n1.\tThe UE requests an authorization of TNR procedure by including a TNR information within a NAS message, e.g. a Registration Request. The TNR information can be sent as a separate IE or in a new transparent container for the HPLMN UDM (i.e. all AMFs would simply forward the transparent container).\nNOTE:\tWhether and how the TNR information is protected by UE before sending to AMF is up to SA WG3.\nThe TNR information in the UE request includes, e.g.:\ni.\tRequested start and stop time for permission to use TNR procedure.\nii.\tThe selected localized service identity.\niii.\tThe selected hosting network identity.\n2.\tBased on the TNR information received from the UE, the AMF decides to update its registration in UDM to provide the UE requested TNR information to UDM.\n3.\tBased on the TNR information received from the AMF, the UDM decides to request the SOR-AF for authorizing the TNR requested by the UE (step 3a and 3b). The UDM does this even if the UE is registered in the HPLMN.\nThe SOR-AF updates the SOR information for the UE if needed according to SOR-AF decision (step 3c) and protects the SOR info via AUSF (step 3d). The SOR information provided by the SOR-AF includes the TNR authorization in the SOR-AF. This can be in the form of, e.g.\ni.\tAn indication that the UE is authorized for TNR. Based on this indication, UE can temporarily suspend the automatic network selection mechanism which is according to the available SOR list stored in the UE, or temporarily switch SNPN access mode.\nii.\tAn updated or new list of prioritized PLMNs or SNPNs including the hosting network selected by the UE with the highest priority.\niii.\tConditions for UE to activate TNR, e.g. authorized start/stop time, location, indication of whether possible to access home network using N3IWF via the hosting network, indication of home routed architecture exists between home network and the hosting network, etc.\nUE determines whether automatic network selection is possible, based on the indications described above and the UE's own capabilities (e.g. dual radio capability, access home network using N3IWF via hosting network).\nIn order to avoid overload of the home network when UE leaves the hosting network(Key Issue #6), the UDM/SOR-AF can apply an offset to the authorized star/stop time in the authorized TNR sent to UE.\n4.\tThe UDM provides the authorization decision to the UE via the AMF after protection via AUSF.\n6-10.\tAs defined in clause C.2 of TS 23.122 [6].\n11.\tThe UE applies the TNR as authorized by the SOR-AF when conditions are met. If the SOR-AF is used and the SOR-AF keeps track of the conditions associated with the authorized TNR, then SOR-AF can issue an update of the SOR information to the UE as described by Figure C.3.1 and Figure C.6.1 of TS 23.122 [6].\n",

One aspect of KI #4 is to identify the mechanism to provisioning UE with appropriate localized service information. Considering we need to support the cases which the UE may or may not have prior subscription or information about the hosting network and the localized service, this solution is to propose an information query/response mechanism by enhancing the registration procedure to allow UE to query the localized service information from the hosting network which UE may or may have subscription with.\nThe localized service information may include local service ID or name, service availably (e.g. time, duration and location), local service captive portal address, information about available local hosting networks associated with the local service as described in solution #12, so on.

                            "text_content": "This solution proposes to allow UE to use registration procedure to query the localized service information from the AMF of the hosting network. The local hosting network may configure a designated AMF to handle the UE access for localized service and store the localized service information. The localized service information stored in the designated AMF can be configured locally or provisioned by the localized service provider's AF via NEF. A new localized service intention indicator or new Registration Type is carried in the registration request message sent by UE to the AMF, to indicates UE's intention of using the registration for the query of localized service information. The gNB of the hosting network can use this indicator to select the designated AMF and forward the registration to this AMF, if there is a designated AMF for localized services. Upon receiving this indication, the designated AMF can provide UE with the localized service information during or after the registration procedure by using the Registration Accept message or Configuration Update Command. The UE may not have the right subscription which allows UE to access the hosting network before UE queries the localized service information, e.g. the user may not buy a ticket which has the credentials information, therefore, UE may only use the registration procedure to query the localized service information instead of registering to the network. For the latter case, network will send registration reject to the UE but with cause value of localized information query response along with the localized service information shown to the user. And UE may use the queried localized service information to subscribe the localized services (e.g. User uses the service portal address to subscribe the services) and manually select the hosting network later.\nThere can be some different registration intention indicators or registration type which can be carried in the registration request:\n-\tLocal service information Query only: This indicates the UE only uses this registration request to query localized service information without actual camping and registering to the network. After the hosting network gNB receives the registration request message with this indicator, the gNB forwards the request message to the AMF which can provide the information, such as the designated AMF. The AMF skips the normal registration procedure and just responses UE with registration reject but with cause value of localized information query response along with the localized service information. In this case, if UE is still connected and registered with the home network, UE can be either manually initiated by user to deregister from the home network and conduct query with the hosting network, or UE conducts the localized service information query while UE enters the RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state based on a stored localized service discovery policy which contains conditions under which service discovery with other hosting network(s) can be conducted. UE and the home network can use paging restriction as defined in clause 5.38.5 of TS 23.501 [3] while UE is conducting localized service query with the hosting network RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state.\n-\tRegistration with local service information query: This indicates that the UE would like to collect local service information during service registration phase. After the hosting network gNB receives the registration request message with this indicator, the network forwards the request message to the AMF which can provide information, such as the designated AMF. The AMF can provide the localized service information by either adding the localized service information in the registration accept message or sending separate NAS message, such as UCU.\n-\tRegistration only: This indicates that the UE only wants to conduct normal service registration without collecting the localized service information. When the local service intention indicator is absent in the registration request message, it's default to consider the intention indicator is registration only, in order to support backword compatibility or the network which doesn't support localized services.\nIn addition, the AMF will indicate how the localized services can be accessed by either providing a specific slice and/or a PDU session The AMF may also provide the UE a list of Tracking Areas, e.g. called \"Localized Services availability area\", where the localized services are available. The UE will then use this information instead of periodical searches to discover localized services.\nIf a certain localized service was not available when the UE asked for it during the registration and now has become available, the network can page the UE (if it happens to be in IDLE Mode), bring it to Connected Mode and then provide the needed information by means of UCU procedure.\nIn order to enable UE to use registration message to query localized service information, the hosting network needs to broadcast its capability of supporting the localized service access (e.g. using SIB message). UE only send register request with localized service query to the hosting network which supports localized service access.\nIf UE is connected to the home network and supported by the home network, UE can conduct localized service information query with the hosting network including receiving the SIB messages from the hosting network while UE is in the RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state. UE and the home network can use paging restriction as defined in clause 5.38.5 of TS 23.501 [3] while UE is conducting localized service query with the hosting network.\nUE can initiate localized service query procedure either manually by the user or being trigged by a stored localized service discovery policy which contains conditions under which service discovery with other hosting network(s) can be conducted, such as time, Localized Services availability area, as well as allowed discovery window duration (this can be used to configure the paging restriction information) while UE is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state. This policy can be provisioned by the home network, or localized service providers or User. The home network can also trigger UE to conduct the localized service discovery procedure while UE enters RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state and certain conditions are met, such as time, Localized Services availability area, so on. In order to trigger UE to conduct localized service discovery, the home network includes a localized service discovery indication and a discovery window which the page restriction is applied in the AN release message sending to UE.\n",

When a UE registers to the selected hosting network and receives localized services provided by the hosting network, architecture in figure 6.27.2-1 is used. If the UE also need to get services from the home network, the UE may establish PDU session as shown in figure 6.27.2-2. Whether the UE receives a specific service from the hosting network or home network is determined based on URSP rule of the UE. The UE just follows the existing PDU Session Establishment procedure based on URSP rule provided by the home network.\nThe figure depicts a simplified architecture of a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It shows the role of the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers in the network.

It illustrates the multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network, showing how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 6.27.2-2: Architecture when a UE uses services provided by the home network\nIt is assumed that there is service level agreement between the home network and hosting network and based on the agreement the AMF in the home network is configured with Localized Service Information. The Localized Service Information contains following information:\n-\tLocalized Service Name.\n-\tValidity condition:\n-\tTime and Spatial validity.\n-\tHosting network information:\n-\tPrecedence.\n-\tHosting network ID (SNPN or PLMN ID) and RAT type (e.g. NR, E-UTRA).\n-\tLADN DNN.\n-\tAllowed CAG information.\nWhen a UE is registered in home network, the UE may request Localized Service Information to the AMF by sending NAS message (e.g. Registration). If subscription of the UE allows to use the Localized service, the AMF provides localized service information to the UE. The UE stores the received Localized Service Information until time validity condition is fulfilled. The spatial validity condition in the Localized Service Information can be represented by geographical area. The exact service area information of hosting network is provided to the UE as a part of LADN information during the registration to the hosting network.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the case of roaming scenario, the AMF in the serving PLMN provides Localized Service Information to the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AMF can provide Localized Service Information to the UE without UE request if subscription of the UE allows to use the Localized service. For example, the AMF may provide Localized Service Information when a UE enters an area where the Localized service is available.\nIf the hosting network uses CAG for Localized service (i.e. in the case of hosting network is PNI-NPN), the Allowed CAG information can be provided to the UE. If the UE receives Allowed CAG information via Localized Service Information, the UE shall use the Allowed CAG information only when the UE access the hosting network for the Localized service.\nBased on received Localized Service Information, the UE selects the hosting network and registers to the network. When a UE registers to the hosting network and has the subscription to a specific LADN DNN for local service or a wild card DNN, the AMF provides LADN information (i.e. LADN DNN and LADN service area) to the UE according to the existing LADN mechanism. The UE uses the LADN information to access localized services provided by the hosting network.\nNOTE:\tWhen hosting network operator configures LADN information in the AMF, the operator can provide associated validity time of LADN DNN so that the AMF provides LADN information when the validity time is satisfied.\n",

The LSP also establishes a service agreement with UE's Home Network operator to enable the UE to receive information needed to discover/access Hosting Network and the localized service.\nH2.\tThe hosting network is configured based on the service agreement e.g. DNN/S-NSSAI configuration for access to localized service, QoS, number of end users, time, location, whether home network services can be accessed via hosting network, etc. The configuration of the Hosting Network is performed by means that are outside of 3GPP scope.\nH3.\tUE's user is prompted by localized service advertisement.\nH4.\tUE's user connects to a web portal of the Home Network operator to request information for access to a localized service. The Home Network obtains time-restricted credentials from the LSP providing this service. The time-restricted credentials are described in clause 6.28.2. The Home Network pushes the time-restricted credentials into the UE (e.g. using SMS or via the web portal).\nNOTE:\tThe solution assumes that the LSP has service agreement with the Home Network (as in Solution #7). If the UE has a direct service relationship with the LSP, the Home Network can be circumvented.\nH5.\tWhen the UE arrives at the venue where the localized service is provided (e.g. stadium), the user performs manual selection of the Hosting Network.\nH6.\tUE connects to the Hosting Network and is authenticated by the LSP in the role of Credential Holder (e.g. using a AAA server).\nH7.\tUE requests a PDU Session and accesses the localized service of the LSP via the Hosting Network.

Therefore, the UE can decide (e.g. UE implementation) whether it stays in current serving network or it selects a Hosting Network.\nTo access Localized Services, when the Validity Information is met, the UE may initiate Hosting Network selection according to the configuration.\nThis solution proposes a complementary approach where the Home Network may configure the UE only initiate Hosting Network selection when explicitly steered by the Home Network. The solution focuses on Home Network (PLMN or SNPN) steering to SNPN Hosting Networks.\nEditor's note:\tSteering to PNI-NPN is FFS.\nBased on the above, in this solution, the following general principles are proposed:\n-\tThe UE is (pre)-configured or provisioned (signalled) by Home Network with a List of SNPN Hosting Networks with Validity Information (i.e. time and/or location) and an Indication that the UE is only allowed to select a Hosting Network upon Steering by the Home Network, except if Home Network is not available in which case the UE is allowed to select an SNPN Hosting Network without Home Network steering, when Validity Information is met.\n-\tWhen the Validity Information is about to be met, the UE starts searching for available and allowable SNPN Hosting Networks based on the List of SNPN Hosting Networks with Validity Information while the UE is served by a Serving Network.\n-\tIf the UE finds available and allowable SNPN Hosting Networks, the UE reports those SNPN Hosting Networks to the Home Network. The Home Network then determines the Prioritized list of SNPN Hosting Networks to which the UE can register for the Localized Services using Home Network's subscription/credentials. This list may contain a single SNPN Hosting Network.\n-\tIf the UE needs to register to Home Network using NWu interface, the N3IWF addresses of the Home Network are also configured in the UE.\nNOTE:\tIf the UE's Serving Network is PLMN, and the UE's Home Network is PLMN.

Because it's for local services, the coverage of the hosting network and the localized services normally are limited to certain area(s) (e.g. stadium, school campus, etc) within possible limited operation time. Therefore, it's important for home network to steer or instruct a UE to the specific hosting network while the UE is a location with good coverage of the hosting network and services.\nThere can be two options to make sure UE being steered to a local network with satisfying those considerations:\nOption 1:\tUE-based: Home network provides hosting network selection policy to UE with the location and coverage validity conditions, so UE can use those policy to select the valid hosting network which match those conditions. This option fully relies on UE to make decision on whether the conditions are met and when to move to the local network after receiving the instruction from the home network, while the home network may lack knowledge of the UE's location and the coverage from the target hosting network in UE's location when the home makes steering decision.\nOption 2:\tNetwork-and-UE-coordination based: Home network coordinates with UE to obtain UE location and the reception performance of the target hosting network in UE's location, before the home network makes steering decision to instruct UE to steer to the target hosting network.\n",

Knowing the potential target network coverage for the UE(s) to be steered to may not be the reason for steering, instead it's used by the home network to check if the target network(s) are suitable for the UE with good coverage.\nThere are 2 methods for option 2:\n-\tMethod 1: The home network can use that UE location information to query the network performance information (e.g. performance analytics or Observed service experiences related network data analytics) from the target hosting SNPN in that UE location via target hosting SNPN's NEF. Based on the information from target network hosting SNPN, the home network decides if the hosting network is suitable for UE to be steered to or not. This method is from the network point of view with data being collected from the target network to determinate and predict if UE is in the good service coverage of target network or not. This method may not reflect the real UE experience in that location.\n-\tMethod 2: The home network can instruct UE to measure and report the signal reception status of the potential target hosting network(s). This can be realized via enhancing the UCU or UPU procedures. The signal reception status information from UE can be simple indication if those candidate network's signal strength is below or pass a defined signal strength threshold defined in UE's policy or the report instruction from home network, without requiring to UE to report detail information of the target network.\n",

As a local hosting network that provides localized services can be a temporary network, provide specific service(s) for a limited time (minutes to hours) and serve a variety of number of subscribers from different home networks (very low to very high number of users accessing the localized service), there can be a local hosting specific back-off timer range which can be used to spread out re-registration request from home network subscribers in a more effective way by means of waiting time. For example, if the number of users accessing to a hosting network is relatively small, a shorter range of backoff timer may be considered for these users.\nThis solution proposes a local hosting network-specific flexible back-off timer range and back-off timer assignment to spread out the registration attempts over time and limit the number of users attempting to register back to their home network simultaneously in order to avoid signalling overload and unnecessary waiting times for the returning users.\n",

If home network credential can be used to access the desired hosting network, step 3 to 5 are skipped.\nNOTE:\tWhether and how the Credential Holder controlled priority lists are extended for hosting network selection is discussed by other solutions.\n3.\tThe UE initiates the PDU Session Establishment procedure for remote provisioning of credential related information (e.g. PVS address, etc). Along with a PDU Session Establishment procedure, UE can request for credential related information (e.g. PVS address, etc) of the hosting networks for accessing localized service if it is not already provisioned.\nThe UE's request of credential related information includes one or more identifier(s) of the selected hosting network(s), and/or one or more identifier(s) of the selected localized service(s).\nThe UE's request can be either as part of the UL NAS Transport message or inside the PDU Session Establishment Request message which is the payload container of the UL NAS Transport message.\n4.\tPDU Session Establishment is accepted by SMF.\nAMF or SMF has a locally configured mapping table between [Credential Information] and [Hosting network identifier] for a specific localized service.

It illustrates the steps involved in determining the optimal deregistration time for a given system, taking into account factors such as the system's current state, the desired level of performance, and the system's resources. The figure shows a graphical representation of the deregistration process, with different stages and parameters represented by different shapes and colors. This helps to visualize the complexity of the deregistration process and to understand how it can be optimized to achieve the desired performance.\nFigure 6.47.3-1: Adaptive deregistration procedure\n1.\tThere is a service level agreement between the hosting network and the home network. Based on the agreement, the hosting networks identities, locations, and the localized services information are shared with the home network.\n2a.\tUE initiates registration with the hosting network for accessing the localized service.\nNOTE 1:\tTo identify the home network AMF of UEs, UEs share their home network given 5G-GUTI value while registering to the hosting network. In the case of roaming, UEs share 5G-GUTI of serving network that served last. Editor's note:\tIt is FFS that how UE deregistered from hosting network would select the same serving network that served last in roaming scenarios.\n2b.\tThe hosting network AMF accepts the registration of UE.\n3a.\tThe hosting network subscribes for configuration service for deregistering UEs to the home network in an adaptive manner. The subscription request includes the hosting network ID, the localized service information, and the number of UEs registered for the localized service.\nNOTE 2:\tThe interface between hosting network AMF and home network AMF can be direct or indirect. It is assumed that there is a bidirectional communication between hosting network AMF and home network AMF.\n3b.\tUpon receiving the subscription request from the hosting network, the home network AMF determines the hosting network and the localized service specific maximum allowed number of returning UEs to the home network per unit time, which is used for simultaneous deregistration at the hosting network.\nBased on the given number of UEs registered for the localized service in the hosting network, the localized service end time, and the number of UEs that can attempt to register from the home network and other hosting networks, the home network AMF determines the hosting network and the localized service specific the allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time to the home network. The home network AMF ensures that the total number of UEs attempting to register at a time from the home network and hosting networks do not exceed the maximum number of UEs that can be handled based on its processing capability in order to avoid congestion and overloading.\n3c.\tThe home network AMF notifies to the hosting network the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network AMF per unit time. The notification includes the hosting network ID, the allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time, valid time to follow this instruction, and the localized service information that UEs are accessing.\nIf there is a change in the allowed maximum number of returning UEs from the hosting network to the home network AMF per unit time due to increase or decrease in the number of UEs that can attempt to register from the home network and other hosting networks, then the home network AMF notifies the new value (the updated allowed maximum number of returning UEs) to the hosting network in a new notification. In this case, the hosting network follows the instruction in the new notification and discards the old notification, i.e. the new notification always has higher precedence than the old notification.\n4.\tThe temporary localized service time is over at the hosting network.\n5a.\tUDM coordinates with AMFs for selection of the allowed maximum number of returning UEs from hosting network based on the notification from the home network AMF. The selection is for simultaneous deregistration of UEs in an adaptive manner based on the notification from the home network AMF and ensures that the number of returning UEs from the hosting network do not exceed the maximum number of UEs the home network AMF can handle.\nThere is a possibility that multiple AMFs in home network handle registration requests of UEs returning from hosting network and each home network AMF notified the allowed maximum number of returning UEs can be considered based on step 3 in that case.\nNOTE 3:\tThe notified value of the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network is valid until the valid time is expired.\n5b.\tThe hosting network AMF initiates the simultaneous deregistration by sending Deregistration Request messages to the selected number of UEs in step 5a.\nNOTE 4:\tUEs may initiate deregistration procedure before the localized service is terminated. The hosting network AMF can handle UE-initiated deregistration requests as well. In order to allow the hosting network AMF to select the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network, the service termination time of UEs can be set to slightly higher than the actual localized service termination time.\n5c.\tUEs deregister from the hosting network and the AMF accepts the deregistration.\nIf UEs initiate Deregistration Request and the number UEs initiate the Deregistration Request procedure is higher than the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network per unit time, then the hosting network AMF indicates the event with 'the allowed maximum number of returning UEs exceeded' parameter in a Deregistration Response message to that home network UEs. After deregistering from the hosting network, UEs which exceeded the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to that home network wait for a random amount of time before registering back to the home network or another hosting network. Otherwise, UEs initiate the registration procedure to their home network or another hosting network immediately after leaving the hosting network.\nNOTE 5:\tAfter deregistration, UEs place the hosting network NPN in a temporary forbidden list (a list of PLMN ID or SNPN ID which prohibits the UE to select the PLMN ID or SNPN IDs in this list for a certain period of time) and initiates automatic PLMN/SNPN network selection mode.\n6.\tDeregistered UEs leave the hosting network and initiate registration procedure to their home network or another hosting network.\n7.\tOnce all UEs registered for the localized service are deregistered, the hosting network unsubscribes the configuration service from the home network. The request to unsubscribe configuration service for a temporary localized service includes the hosting network ID and the localized service information.\n",

But on the other hand, home network subscription/credential is utilized for the UE to establish PDU connection with the application server and the UE needs to handle co-existence of multiple subscriptions/credentials on device.\n-\tWhen the information includes a list of hosting networks and an indication that home network credential is to be used, there will be impact on network selection. Application server obtaining such information via network exposure is not necessary, since it is covered as part of the SLA between localized service provider and hosting network operator.\nUE fetches the information from home network (Sol #10, #13, #14, #15, #18, #23, #24, #29, #30, #31, #33, #36, #43).\n-\tThis principle assumes that home network is capable of managing the localized service information data.\n-\tThe impact is about how home network is provisioned with the localized service information data, and how UE is provisioned by the home network.\n-\tMost of the solutions following this principle propose that the home network provides the localized service information to UE via SoR procedure in combination with the principle that the localized service information is constructed based on a priority list for (hosting) network selection as described in clause 7.4.2.\n-\tSome solutions assumed that the SoR-AF within the home network should be involved as the data source and the mechanism regarding how SoR-AF obtains such data should be out of 3GPP scope. Some solutions (Sol #14, #43) assumed the data source for SoR procedure is obtained from other NFs than SoR-AF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the current specifications, SoR-AF is the only entity that creates the SoR message if there is a need to dynamically change the content of the SoR information.\n-\tSince SoR procedure is mainly used for network discovery and selection, it is not suitable to be extended to provision UE with data more than required for the UE's actual network discovery and selection.\nNOTE 2:\tThe current specifications provide the means for the serving network to provision the UE with information relevant for the serving network once the UE has registered to the hosting network e.g. network slicing information.\n-\tSol #24 proposes another variant for UE to fetch the information from home network, that is via home network UDR and new UE policy. UE policy has the potential to include necessary data of the localized service, and possibility to be extended in the future. The new UE policy can be delivered to UE by PCF in home network, or PCF in serving network using N24.\nUE fetches the information from serving network (Sol #11, #12, #24, #27, #32, #42, #44).\n-\tThis principle assumes serving network (either home network or another network which UE is accessing using home network credential) is capable of storing the localized service information data. This principle enables multiple information sources for UE to obtain localized service information.\n-\tIf the current serving network is not the home network, this principle also provides mechanisms for home network to authorize or determine the final data that UE will receive, where the serving network either checks a subscription flag (Sol #12, #24, #32) or passes the localized service data to home network for authorization and delivery to UE (Sol #12, #42).\n-\tThe impact is about how serving network is provisioned with the localized service information data, and how UE is provisioned by the serving network.\n-\tSome solutions following this principle proposes to use AMF/SMF in serving network to store the localized service information data. In this case, the provisioning to serving network is based on configuration which has less impact, but it requires the UE is served by the correct AMF/SMF configured with such information (e.g. UE is located in the overlapping area where the hosting network is available) or requires all the AMF/SMF in the serving network are configured with such information. The data is provisioned to UE via MM NAS or SM NAS message (it is TBD which procedures/messages are impacted).\n-\tOther solutions following this principle, proposes to use UDR in the serving network to store the localized service information data as application data for any UE registered to the serving network. This enables the flexibility that if the serving network is not the home network, UE can obtain localized service information data from either the serving network, or from the home network, or from both. The impact is to extend service specific parameter provisioning for the serving network to receive the data (see clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [4]) and new UE policy to provide the data to the UE.\nUE fetches the information from hosting network (Sol #22, #26, #34, #41).\n-\tThis principle assumes a hosting network is selected prior to a localized service is selected, since the localized services information arrives later from the hosting network. It can happen that the fetched information is not interesting for the end user.\n-\tThe impact is to extend broadcast with capability for localized service, service discover policy that allows UE to query information from hosting network while in RRC-IDLE/INACTIVE with serving network, new on-demand SIB, or code for URL. Another impact is to deliver localized service information via registration reject/accept message.\nNOTE:\tPrivacy aspect needs to be evaluated by SA WG3.\n-\tThis principle implies that in some scenarios the UE needs to suspend the connection with or suppress the paging from the serving network when getting information from hosting network, which can cause service interruption.\nThere are different triggers to provision the information to UE:\n-\tUE request as trigger (Sol #11, #13, #15, #24, #27, #32, #34, #42).\n-\tUE location as trigger (Sol #11, #12, #18, #27, #32).\n-\tUE subscription data change via external parameter provisioning as trigger (Sol #14, #23, #43).\n-\tUE Steering of Roaming information update (SoR based solutions).\nUE request as trigger assumes UE/end user is aware of the desired localized services. UE location as trigger requires the serving network is aware of which hosting network is available in which serving network tracking areas, and the information sent to UE is unsolicited. UE subscription data change and SoR based solutions restrict the information source to home network only.\nThere are different architectures/business relationships between home network and hosting network or Localized service provider.\n-\tBusiness relationship / roaming interface exists between home network and hosting network or Localized service provider.\n-\tIn this scenario, the home network knows about the hosting network or the Localized services. Therefore, it is reasonable for the home network to provision obtain hosting network information/localized service information to the UE.\n-\tMoreover, UE can use its home network credentials to access hosting network.\n-\tTo allow flexible deployment and use of Localized service, it would be benefit to allow update the above information to the UE timely, after the UE requesting for the Localized service. The UE can request via OTT, then LSP can notify the home network of the UE to send the above information to the UE.\n-\tNo business relationship / roaming interface between home network and hosting network.\nIn this scenario, the home network does not know about the hosting network or the Localized services directly. There are two sub-scenarios regarding the business relationship between visiting network and hosting network or Localized service provider:\n-\tBusiness relationship / roaming interface exists between visiting network and hosting network or Localized service provider\n-\tIn this scenario, the visiting network knows about the hosting network or the Localized services. Therefore, UE can obtain hosting network information/localized service information from the visiting network. In order to enable control from home network, home network authorization is required before sending the information to the UE.\n-\tIn this scenario, UE cannot use credentials from home network to access hosting network. Therefore, other credentials e.g. default credentials can be used to access hosting network.\n-\tNo business relationship between visiting network and hosting network/ Localized service provider\nIn this scenario, neither home network or visiting network know about the hosting network or the Localized service. The UE can only obtain hosting network information/ localized service information from hosting network or the Localized service provider.\n-\tUE obtains localized service information from hosting network\n-\tin this scenario, manual network selection is used for hosting network discovery and selection;\n-\tdefault credentials are used for the first time accessing to hosting network;\n-\tcredentials of hosting network can be provision to the UE.\n-\tUE obtains hosting network information/ localized service information from Localized service provider\n-\tIn this scenario, the UE may also obtain the following information from the Localized service provider:\n-\tdefault credentials to access hosting network;\n-\tcredentials to access localized service from the Localized service provider;\n-\tconfigurations to access localized service from the hosting network;\n-\tThe above procedure is considered as OTT solution and would have no standard specifications.\nAlthough the first scenario (i.e. Business relationship / roaming interface exists between home network and hosting network or Localized service provider) is considered as the main scenario, it would be benefit to consider the other scenarios to support flexible deployments of hosting networks.\n",

Whether home network can act as CH can be implicitly determined by whether there are priority lists for SNPN selection configured/provisioned on UE.

Under the condition, it may cause many UEs returning back to e.g. their Home Network and this may result in signalling overload in their Home Network.\nNOTE:\tHome Network is used, but the network selected by the UE depends on the UE's network selection and what networks are available e.g. UE can return to VPLMN different from the PLMN the UE was registered to before selecting the Hosting Network.\nWhen considering solution proposals for KI#6, there are two categories for handling signalling overload resulting from the UEs returning to their Home Network:\n1.\tThe avoidance-based method: it mitigates or avoids overload at home network and it can be further classified into three subcategories based on the principles in the proposed solutions,\na)\tthe UEs is (pre)-configured with a timer/waiting time based on the Validity Information of the Localized Services and/or the NWu status and the availability of the home network of the UE e.g. by the Home Network or by the Hosting Network,\nb) the home network negotiates/communicates once with the hosting network as part of a service level agreement to configure the number of UEs can be deregistered from the hosting network to the home network per unit time, and\nc) the home network negotiates/communicates with the hosting network continuously by utilizing “subscribe-notify” communication service to configure the number of UEs which can be deregistered from the hosting network to the home network per unit time adaptively without causing an overload at the home network, and the hosting network instructs UEs which exceed the home network given maximum limit to wait for random amount of time before initiating re-registration to their home network if UEs initiate deregistration requests.\n2.\tThe runtime-based method: it handles overload at home network using the existing mechanisms and it can be further classified into three subcategories based on the principles in the proposed solutions,\na)\tthe UEs directly return to their Home network when the Localized Services terminate and the Home Network will use the existing mechanisms to handle the signalling overload if the congestion happens,\nb)\tthe home network and/or local hosting network may group the UEs to create an Internal-Group Identifier specific to local hosting network(s) and/or local service(s), and then the home network AMF or SMF applies the existing UE group-specific NAS level congestion control mechanism to manage UEs returning from a local hosting network to their home network, and\nc) the UEs directly return to their home network when the Localized Services terminate and the home network uses localized hosting network specific back-off timer to adaptively reduce the overall waiting for UEs before re-register to their home network.\nFor avoidance-based method (i.e. Solutions #9, 10, 13, 25, 38, 47), hosting network either determines the timer or maximum number of UEs on its own (e.g. Solution #9, #10,) or uses the home network input to determine it (e.g. Sol#47).\nFor runtime-based method (i.e. Solutions #8, 17, 39), the Home Network applies the existing congestion control and overload control to the UEs for returning from the Hosting Network but cause congestion overload. The UEs registers to the Home Network by indicating they are back from the Hosting Network. If the Home Network is in a congestion condition, the Home Network can reject the UE with a cause and a back-off timer.\nTo compare the avoidance-based and runtime-based methods, the differences are below:\n-\tThe avoidance-based method can allow the UE to return to their Home Network in a distributed or stagged manner to prevent the congestion or overload conditions happen in their Home Network.\n-\tThe runtime-based method directly applies the existing mechanism optionally with some enhancement (e.g. hosting-network specific backoff timer).\nCategory 1-a of the avoidance-based method potentially delays the UEs return to the Home Network also for the cases when the Home Network is not overloaded/congested. It is also expected that the user itself can decide to stop using the Localized Service i.e. in these cases the UE would return back to the Home Network disregarding the spreading applied for the UE's return.\nThe runtime handling has allowed the UEs to initiate the Registration procedure as soon as wanted and then if the Home Network is congested rejected the UE with a back-off timer in which the Home Network has been through the signalling congestion from those returning UEs from the Hosting Networks (unless Home Network is so congested that e.g. UAC is used).\nTable 7.6-1: Summary of solutions for KI#6\n\nIn the avoidance-based solutions (Category 1), there are three subcategories based on the principles used to address the requirements mentioned in the KI #6, which are summarized as follows:\n-\tCategory 1-a based solutions are based on the principle of pre-configuring UEs service end time either by the home network or hosting network to spread out the registration attempts over time and limit the number of simultaneous attempts in a very short period of time in order to mitigate an overload/congestion at the home network. Though the category 1-a based solutions potentially mitigate the overload at home network, they would increase the overall waiting time for UEs before registering to their home network as all UEs are pre-configured to make re-registration attempt to their home network at different point in time without knowing the actual capacity of the home network AMF.\n-\tCategory 1-b based solutions are based on the principle of one-time negotiation/communication between the home network and the hosting network to deregister the number of UEs simultaneously per unit time from the hosting network to the home network without causing overload/congestion at the home network. Since it’s a one-time negotiation/communication between the home network and the hosting network as part of a service level agreement and the actual load in the home network may vary over time, the constant/fixed number of deregistration of UEs from the hosting network to the home network may lead to congestion/overload. Also, if the home network is in a position to handle more of UEs that it was communicated/negotiated earlier, then UEs in the hosting network may have to wait unnecessarily.\n-\tCategory 1-c based solutions are based on the principle of negotiating/communicating the home network AMF capacity with the hosting network continuously to deregister the number of UEs simultaneously per unit time from the hosting network to the home network without causing overload/congestion at the home network. Since the home network and the hosting network are negotiating/communicating continuously using subscribe-notify communication service, the load variation in the home network due to less or high number of attempts from the home network and other hosting networks UEs is notified to the hosting network as a new maximum threshold value (i.e. the new allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time) in a new notification. Hence, the hosting network can deregister the number of UEs adaptively based on the current capacity of the home network AMF without causing overload/congestion at the home network. Also, it minimizes the overall waiting time for UEs before re-registering to their network and utilizes the available resources in the home network AMF efficiently.\nIn the runtime-based solutions (Category 2), there are three subcategories based on the principles used to address the requirements mentioned in the KI #6, which are summarized as follows:\n-\tCategory 2-a based solutions reuse the existing mechanisms without any additional enhancements. However, the existing mechanisms do not avoid an overload/congestion at the home network when a high number of UEs attempt to return from the hosting network to their home network in a short period of time. Moreover, the existing mechanisms would increase the overall waiting time of UEs as the existing mechanisms use the same pre-defined range for assigning random back-off timer value to all UEs irrespective of their size and service type they used.\n-\tCategory 2-b based solutions are based on the principle of grouping UEs to create an Internal-Group Identifier specific to local hosting network(s) and/or local service(s) and then reusing the existing UE group-specific NAS level congestion control mechanism to manage UEs returning from a local hosting network to their home network. However, the existing mechanisms do not avoid overload and would increase the overall waiting time of users since the same pre-defined range is used for assigning random back-off timer value to all UEs irrespective of their size and service type they used.\n-\tCategory 2-c based solutions are based on the principle of assigning a local hosting network specific back-off timer value in order to reduce the overall waiting for UEs before re-register to their home network.\nA UE returning from a Hosting Network after using a Localized Service would normally not have higher priority than any other UEs, i.e. the prioritization among UEs would better follow existing mechanisms and therefore adding a separate indication that the UE is returning from the Hosting Network as an indication to the Home Network can be questioned. However, as the avoidance-based method potentially delays the UEs return to the Home Network also for the cases when the Home Network is not overloaded/congested, unless a frequent load check is introduced, it is better to allow the UE return as soon as the Localized Service ends or whenever the UE (e.g. user) decides to stop using the Localized Service and therefore leaves the Hosting Network before the end of the Localized Service. The end time of the Localized Service can be adapted on application layer by existing means i.e. without 3GPP impacts.\n",

Specifically:\n-\tWhen UE registers to SNPN with credentials owned by the SNPN, UE uses the same N3IWF selection procedure as specified for access to stand-alone non-public network services via PLMN in clause 6.3.6.2a of TS 23.501 [3].\n-\tUE initiates N3IWF selection for emergency services when the UE detects a user request for emergency session and determines that Untrusted non-3GPP access is to be used for the emergency access. The UE with SNPN subscription performs the following:\n-\tIf the UE determines that it is located in the same country as the subscribed SNPN, the UE uses the configured N3IWF FQDN for N3IWF selection.\n-\tOtherwise, the UE follows the N3IWF selection procedure for Emergency services for UE not equipped with UICC, as defined in clause 6.3.6.4.2 of TS 23.501 [3].\n-\tWhen the UE is registering to SNPN over Untrusted N3GPP access for UE Onboarding, UE may select a N3IWF in the SNPN which supports UE Onboarding by using the pre-configured N3IWF FQDN used for onboarding.\nNOTE 1:\tThe GIN is not used to construct a N3IWF FQDN if a UE is registering to SNPN over Untrusted N3GPP access.\nNOTE 2:\tThe format of FQDN will be specified by CT WG4.\n-\tIf the PVS is reachable from the local Untrusted non-3GPP access network (e.g. via the Internet) using the local IP connectivity, UE may connect directly (i.e. without connected to a N3WIF) with a PVS to obtain the SNPN credentials.\n-\tAccess to SNPN services via Trusted non-3GPP access network is to be specified according to the principles described in Solution #3, including support for credential Holder, Emergency services and UE onboarding. Specifically:\n-\tANQP is to be extended to support advertising of:\n-\tSNPN IDs and GINs corresponding to SNPNs with which 5G connectivity is supported and related parameters as described in clause 6.3.3.1.\n-\tSupport for Emergency services.\n-\tOnboarding enabled indication.\nNOTE 3:\tThe work on additional parameters in ANQP is to be kept internal to 3GPP.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the UE tries to register with an SNPN via TNAN X in the case of SNPN ID with self-assigned NID, and the UE is rejected by the AMF with a cause code that temporarily prevents the UE from registering with this SNPN, the UE does temporarily not attempt to register with the same SNPN, even if the same SNPN ID is advertised via another TNAN Y.\n-\tWhen accessing SNPN services via Trusted or Untrusted non-3GPP access the UE needs to be able to construct a prioritized list of WLAN access networks by using enhanced WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP) rules from ANDSP (currently supported only for PLMN in TS 23.402 [9]) or based on local configuration.\n-\tN3IWF and TNGF needs to be able to include the \"selected NID\" in the [NGAP] INITIAL UE MESSAGE, which is up to RAN WG3 to define.\n-\tAccess to SNPN services via wireline access network and use of Credential Holder is to be supported by defining a new GCI including a \"NID\".\n-\tThe NSWO procedure is to be extended to support UE authentication using SNPN credentials (applies both to SIM-based and non-SIM based credentials). It is expected that the impact is limited to the use of a SUCI format whose \"realm\" part enables routing of SWa requests from the WLAN AN to the NSWO in the SNPN's 5GC, which is already supported.\n-\tTo support N5CW device access to SNPN services, the TWAP needs to be able to advertise a list of SNPNs with which \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\" is supported, equivalent to the PLMN list-4 defined in clause 6.3.12a.2 of TS 23.501 [3].\nNOTE 3:\tAdditional conclusions for wireline access related to UE behind 5G-RG depends on the progress on the FS_5WWC_Ph2 study.\nNOTE 4:\tFunctionality related to the use of the same credentials for access to SNPN with NG-RAN and to WLAN Access Network as proposed in Solution #16 can be considered during normative work based on any feedback from SA WG3.\n",

Each localized service is mapped to a specific hosting network ID. Multiple localized service areas can be mapped to the same hosting network ID if their allowed service areas are the same. Validity conditions are also used by hosting network to restrict access.\n",

The list is determined by the home network and may be associated with validity conditions, including time and location conditions.\n-\tWhen the hosting network is an SNPN which provides localized services and the home network is an HPLMN, the architecture specified in clause 5.30.2.7 of TS 23.501 [3] is reused for the UE to access both home network services (using the SNPN as underlay network) and localized services (via the SNPN).\n-\tIf the hosting network is a PNI-NPN, existing mechanisms (e.g. roaming architecture, network slicing, etc.) are reused for the UE to access home network services.\n-\tThe existing URSP rules or LADN feature can be re-used for a UE to access the Localized services after the UE has registered to a Hosting network. URSP rules are pre-configured in the UE, provisioned by the PCF of the home network or provisioned by the PCF of the hosting network according to existing principles.\n",
