Otherwise a new dictionary entry shall be created and \"201 Created\" shall be returned, the content of the POST response shall contain the newly assigned PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability ID included in DicEntryCreatedData and the \"Location\" header shall be present and shall contain the URI of the newly created resource.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.2-3 shall be returned.

A UCMF configured to operate in Mode of Operation A (3GPPP TS 23.501, Clause 5.4.4.1a) shall reject the operation if the request does not contain UE Radio Access Capability Information in both the formats and the UCMF is not able to find match of the received UE Radio Access Capability Information in its database.\nThe Subscribe service operation shall be used by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. an AMF, to create a subscription in the UCMF, to get notifications for one or more new dictionary entries creation or for the deletion of one or more PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.\nThe NF Service Consumer shall request to create a new subscription by using HTTP method POST with URI of the subscriptions collection, see clause 6.1.3.4. A ucmfNotificationUri shall be provided in the CreateSubscription to be used by the UCMF to send notifications later. See Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a subscription management system, with various components such as subscription IDs, subscription types, and subscription statuses. The system is designed to manage and track subscriptions, ensuring efficient and accurate management of subscriptions.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1 Create a subscription\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription resource in the UCMF. The content of the POST request shall contain a representation of the individual subscription resource to be created. The request may contain an expiry time, suggested by the NF Service Consumer as a hint, representing the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept active and the time after which the subscribed event(s) shall stop generating report.\n2a.\tOn success, the request is accepted, the UCMF shall include a HTTP Location header to provide the location of a newly created resource (subscription) together with the status code 201 indicating the requested resource is created in the response message. The UCMF may also include the highest dictionary entry ID which has been allocated.\nThe response, based on operator policy and taking into account the expiry time included in the request, may contain the expiry time, as determined by the UCMF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the UCMF. The UCMF shall not provide the same expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the subscription to be valid without an expiry time.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.\nThe Unsubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. AMF, towards the UCMF, to remove an existing subscription previously created by itself at the UCMF.\nThe NF Service Consumer shall unsubscribe to the subscription by using HTTP method DELETE with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause 6.1.3.5) to be deleted. See Figure 5.2.2.5.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a subscription management system, with various components such as subscription IDs, subscription status, and subscription history. It illustrates the process of unsubscribing a subscription, with steps like selecting the subscription, checking the status, and deleting the subscription. The figure is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand, making it suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.\nFigure 5.2.2.5.1-1 Unsubscribe a subscription\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing subscription resource in the UCMF.\n2a.\tOn success, the request is accepted, the UCMF shall reply with the status code 204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully deleted in the response message.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.5.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.5.3.2-3.\nThe Notify service operation is used by the UCMF, to send a notification, towards the notification URI, when certain event included in the subscription has taken place.\nThe UCMF shall use the HTTP method POST, using the notification URI received in the subscription creation as specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1. See Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a network topology with various nodes and links, including a base station (BTS), a user equipment (UE), and a network element (NE). The diagram illustrates the communication paths, such as the fiber-optic backbone, and the various nodes and links involved in the network. The figure also includes a layer of redundancy, represented by dashed lines, to ensure failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure 5.2.2.6.1-1 Notify\n1.\tThe AMF shall send a POST request to send a notification.\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service Consumer.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.5.2.3.1-3 shall be returned.
