It encompasses various components such as the network control plane (NCP), application layer (APL), and physical layer (PHY). The architecture is designed to ensure efficient communication between the various layers, enabling seamless data transmission and minimizing latency. The use of a layered design, with redundancy paths, ensures high reliability and failover capabilities. PINAPP is an essential tool for network administrators, enabling them to manage and optimize the performance of their network infrastructure.\nFigure 6.2.1-1: PINAPP architecture\nThe PIN elements contains PIN client and/or application clients. The PIN Element with gateway capability (PEGC) performs the role of an entity supporting gateway capability for PIN. The PIN Element with management capability (PEMC) performs the role of an entity supporting management capability for PIN. A PIN includes at least one PEGC and at least one PEMC. The roles of UEs acting as PEGC and PEMC in 5GS are specified in clause 5.44 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [4].\nThe PIN enabler architecture consists of PIN client deployed in PIN element and PIN server deployed in Data network.

This figure illustrates the architecture of a PIN, which is a part of the PINAPP (Point-to-Point Network Access Protocol) system. The PIN is a network element that provides access to services from a point-to-point network. The architecture includes a base station (BTS), a user equipment (UE), and a point-to-point network (P2P). The figure shows the connection between the BTS and the UE, as well as the P2P network. The architecture is designed to ensure reliability and failover capabilities, with redundant paths and failover mechanisms.\nFigure 6.2.2-1: PINAPP architecture of User accessing services provided by PIN Element from outside the PIN\nThe interactions between PEGC and PIN client of the authorized user are supported over interface PIN-11.

In this case the PEMC can trigger creation of PIN with these PIN elements in group.\nAfter the creation of PIN is accepted by network, the PIN server responds to PEMC containing the details of the PIN including the PIN ID, the PEGC information, access control information configured in PEGC etc.\nAt the network side, a PIN server should be deployed. The PIN server is responsible for the authorization of the Creation request of PIN, and arranges the PEGC information about access control to PIN.\n8.5.2.2.1\tPIN creation procedure\nFigure 8.5.2.2.1-1 illustrates PIN creation procedure based on request/response model.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe UE or PINE has been pre-configured or has discovered the address (e.g. IP address, FQDN, URI) of the PIN server;\n2.\tThe UE Identifier or PIN client Identifier is available;\n3.\tThe UE or PINE has already been registered in PIN server;\n4.\tThe UE or PINE has been authorized to communicate with the PIN server;\n5.\tPINE 1 is assigned the role of PEMC by PIN server and PINE-2 is the PEGC of the PIN;\nThe figure depicts the PIN creation procedure for a 5G network, illustrating the steps involved in generating unique identification numbers for network devices. The diagram shows the process of selecting a random number from a pool, generating a 16-bit number, and then concatenating the number with a 16-bit number to form the PIN. The figure is essential for ensuring secure communication in 5G networks, as it helps to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.\nFigure 8.5.2.2.1-1: PIN creation procedure\n1.\tThe PEMC sends a PIN creation request to the PIN server in order to create a PIN. The PIN creation request includes the security credentials of the UE or PINE-1 received during authorization procedure and may include the UE identifier such as GPSI, PIN client ID, UE location and PIN client profile(s) information.\nThe PEMC can request to create a PIN including the details of other PIN elements (list of PINEs) that has already established connection with it. The details of the PIN elements could be for example, UE identifier such as GPSI, PIN client ID, UE location and PIN client profile(s) information.\nIf there are no other PIN elements in the request, the PEMC requests to create a PIN including itself.\nIn order to save the procedure of several PEMCs to be involved into the certain PIN as individual PEMC, the PEMC can have the additional PEMC GPSIs/PIN client ID in the PIN create request, to indicate additional PEMCs that are allowed to manage the PIN. This procedure doesn’t have conflict with that other PEMC requests to join the certain PIN and becomes PEMC separately.\nThe PEMC creates the PIN profile and delivers the PIN profile to PIN server.\nNOTE 1:\tFor a certain PIN, only one PEMC at a time can be assigned with primary role and other PEMCs if any are assigned with secondary role.\nThe PIN creation request also includes service that PINE can provide.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PIN server performs an authorization check to verify whether the PEMC (PINE 1) has authorization to perform the PIN creation operation.\n3.\tThe PIN server sends a successful PIN creation response to PEMC, which includes a newly assigned PIN ID to indicate the PIN. It also includes the list of PIN elements and their identifier which are authorized and made as member of the newly created PIN if the PIN creation request contains the list of PIN elements to be included in the PIN.\nIf the PIN creation request fails, the PIN server should give the failure response indicating the cause of PIN creation request failure.\nThe member of newly created PIN may include PEMC and (optional) the list of PIN elements which are authorized to be added into the PIN by PIN server.\nIf there are no other PIN elements in the PIN creation request and the PIN creation is successful, the PIN server indicates the PEMC to be the PEGC. The PEMC who has already had the role of PEMC can also has the role of PEGC.\nThe PIN server may determine the list of candidates PEGCs for this PIN according to the gateway capability provided by PINE during PINE registration procedure. Only the PINE that has the capability of gateway can be selected as the PEGCs for this PIN.\nIf no PEGCs are available for this PIN, the PIN server initiates PIN create response with PIN creation failure to PEMC.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PEMC may validate if the PEGCs provided by the PIN server are available at the PINE by performing the PEGC discovery procedure as described in clause 8.9.2.1.5.\nIf the one or more PEGCs are indicated in the PIN creation response, the PIN server indicates the PIN client ID/GPSI of one PINE to be the PEGC. Also, the assigned IP address or port number is delivered in the PIN creation response to PEMC. And, the PIN Server also sends the PEGC information about access control in the response, including:\n-\tAccess control information includes: user name, account, SSID, BSSID. All the information is used by PIN elements in PIN to access 5G or access other application outside of PIN;\nThe PIN server or PEMC can decide the access control information in certain PEGC.\n-\tIf the access control information decided by PIN server, the PIN server sends the access control information to PEMC via PIN creation response. And the PEMC delivers the access control information to PEGC via PIN creation notification request.\n-\tIf the access control information decided by PEMC, the PEMC delivers the access control information to PEGC via PIN creation notification request.\nIt is possible for PIN server to indicate several devices as PEGCs in a PIN. And it is possible for PIN server to indicate the PEGC and PEMC is the same device in a PIN.\nThe PIN server may update the PIN profile and delivers the updated PIN profile to PEMC.\n4a-4c.\t[Optional] If the PIN creation response contains the list of PIN elements, the PEMC generates the PIN creation notification request to individual PINEs based on the list received in step 3. This notification request includes the PIN ID of the newly created PIN and also contains an indication that the PIN element is made the member of the newly created PIN.\nDuring this step, the PEMC may distribute the Access control information to PINE, to be used by PIN elements in PIN to access 5G or access other application outside of PIN.\nThe updated the PIN profile may be synchronized to PEGC or PINEs.\n5a-5c. [Optional] The individual PIN elements sends the PIN creation notification response to acknowledge the receipt of the notification. The PIN elements receiving the PIN creation notification request with joined indication shall not join the PIN by issuing the PIN join request since they are already made as the member of the PIN.\nAfter the procedure above, the PINE-1 (PEMC) creates a PIN with PEGC (PINE-2) and other accepted PIN elements in PIN.\n8.5.2.3.1\tGeneral\nThe following information flows are specified for PIN creation:\n-\tPIN creation request and response;\n-\tPIN creation notification request and response;\nEditor's note: A review and update of procedural text and IEs is necessary to ensure that multiple PEMC/PEGCs are supported.\n8.5.2.3.2\tPIN creation request\nTable 8.5.2.3.2-1 describes information elements in the PIN creation request from the PINE/PEGC to the PIN server.\nTable 8.5.2.3.2-1: PIN creation request\n\n8.5.2.3.3\tPIN creation response\nTable 8.5.2.3.3-1 describes information elements in the PIN creation response from the PIN server to the PEMC.\nTable 8.5.2.3.3-1: PIN creation response\n\n8.5.2.3.4\tPIN creation notification request\nTable 8.5.2.3.4-1 describes information elements in the PIN creation notification request from the PEMC to the PEGC and PIN elements.\nTable 8.5.2.3.4-1: PIN creation notification request\n\n8.5.2.3.5\tPIN creation notification response\nTable 8.5.2.3.5-1 describes information elements in the PIN creation notification response from the PEGC, PIN elements to the PEMC.\nTable 8.5.2.3.5-1: PIN creation notification response\n\n",

The PIN Client Profile information (supported PIN roles, supported PEGC KPIs, Supported PEGC schedule, UE location) shall be included in the requests. The PEMC shall use this information to determine whether multiple PEGCs are needed to meet the required KPIs of the PIN and which PIN elements (e.g., PEGC-A and PEGC-B) are able to serve as PEGCs. The PEMC shall configure multiple PEGCs (e.g., PEGC-A and PEGC-B) with a role of PEGC if needed.

                            "text_content": "This clause describes PIN modification functionality.\nFigure 8.5.10.2.2-1 describes the PIN modification procedure to perform a PEMC role change due to the failure of the PEMC. An authorised administrator is the owner of the PIN and accesses PIN configuration using an application on a UE, which is one of the PEMC for the PIN. The authorised administrator can manage the PIN locally or through the 5G network. This procedure describes a PEMC (e.g., an authorized administrator on a UE) managing the PIN remotely via the 5G network.\nThe procedure may be used e.g. when a PEMC is available on a UE for PIN management by an authorised administrator. When there is a local PEMC failure, the authorized administrator can be enabled to manage the PIN remotely, via the 5G network, using the following steps.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PIN server has authorized the creation of the PIN.\n2.\tThe authorized administrator is the owner of the PIN and has created the PIN.\n3.\tThe authorized administrator configures the active PEMC to provide PIN management for the PIN. UE/PEMC1 is the inactive PEMC.\n4.\tThe active PEMC, PEGC, PINE-1, PINE-2, and the UE/PEMC1 are members of the PIN. PINE-1 has PEMC capability.\n5.\tThe authorized administrator leaves the local area of the PIN (e.g., in a home) and is able to access the PIN remotely through the 5G network. As a result, the authorized administrator is able to manage the PIN through the 5G network.\n6.\tThe UE/PEMC1 is subscribed to the PEGC for PIN connectivity notifications\nThe figure depicts a PIN (Physical Encapsulation Module) modification after a local PEMC (Physical Encapsulation Module) failure, illustrating the process of reconfiguring the module to ensure proper communication.\nFigure 8.5.10.2.2-1: PIN Modification after local PEMC failure\n1.\tThe UE/PEMC1 may detect that PEMC2 is unavailable or failed. In step 1a, the UE/PEMC1 may receive a PIN connectivity notification from PEGC indicating that there is a communication failure with PEMC2. Otherwise, in step 1b, the UE/PEMC1 may detect that PEMC2 is unavailable by using the PIN heartbeat mechanism or if a communication timeout happens with PEMC2.\n2.\tIf UE/PEMC1 has detected that PEMC2 is unavailable or failed in step 1, an authorized administrator on UE/PEMC1 sends a PIN configuration request to the PIN server through the 5G network. The request includes the security credentials of the authorized administrator, the UE ID, the PIN ID, PIN member ID, authorization type indicating the role change (e.g., the request may indicate that PINE-1 be assigned the new PEMC).\n3.\tIf the PIN Server has received a PIN Configuration request in step 2, the PIN server processes the modification request and checks if the authorized administrator is allowed to modify the PIN. The PIN server verifies that PINE-1 has the capability to serve as a PEMC using information in the PIN profile.\n4. \tIf the authorized administrator is allowed to perform PIN modification or if the PIN Server has detected that PEMC2 is unavailable or failed and has determined that PINE-1 can be reassigned as the new PEMC, the PIN server sends a PIN management request to PINE-1 to assign PINE-1 as the new PEMC and provides PIN profile information to PINE-1.\n5.\tPINE-1 processes the PIN management request indicating the PEMC assignment and a PIN management response to the PIN server indicating if the assignment was successful.\n6.\tIf the PIN management response in step 5 was successful, the PIN server notifies the other members of the PIN that PINE-1 will be the new PEMC for the PIN and updates PIN profile information.\n7.\tIf the PIN Server has received a PIN Configuration request in step 2, the PIN server sends a PIN configuration response to the UE/PEMC1, the response includes the updated PIN profile information if the PEGC assignment was successful; otherwise, the response indicates that the assignment failed.\n8.\tIf the PEGC assignment was successful, the PIN communications resume with PINE-1 serving as the new PEMC.\nFigure 8.5.10.2.3-1 describes a PIN modification procedure to perform a PEGC role change due to the unavailability of the PEGC. This procedure describes a PEMC detecting the unavailability of a PEGC (e.g. PEGC leaves the local service area of the PIN) and performing a PIN modification with the PIN Server to assign a new PEGC. As part of PIN management, a PEMC receives periodic PIN heartbeat messages from PEGCs to ensure PIN routing is available for members of the PIN at all times. If a PEMC does not receive the periodic PIN heartbeat messages from the PEGC, then the PEMC needs to assign a new PEGC or request the PIN server to assign the new PEGC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PIN server has authorized the PEMC to create PINs.\n2.\tThe PEMC creates a local PIN with members: PEMC, UE serving as PEGC, PINE1, and PINE2.\n3.\tThe PEMC maintains a PIN profile with information on the capabilities of each PIN member.\n4.\tPINE2 is a PIN member that also has gateway capability.\nThe figure depicts a PIN modification process for a 10-pin connector due to a PEGC (Power Equipment Ground Circuit) unavailability. The process involves using a pin-to-pin jumper to replace the PEGC, ensuring the connector remains functional and secure.\nFigure 8.5.10.2.3-1: PIN Modification due to PEGC unavailability\n1.\tPEMC receives periodic PIN heartbeats from PEGC to monitor the availability of the PEGC.\n2.\tPEGC leaves the local coverage area of the PIN, e.g., leaves the home, and is not available to route PIN communications.\n3.\tPEMC does not receive a periodic PIN heartbeat from PEGC at the configured interval and determines that PEGC is no longer providing PIN routing capability.\nIf secondary PEGC is available in PEMC, that the PEMC decides to configure this PEGC as the gateway of PIN, and skip the procedure from step 4 to step 7. And PEMC only notifies PIN server of newly selected PEGC in step 8.\nIf secondary PEGC is unavailable in PEMC, that the PEMC decides to trigger the PIN server to discover the PEGC as the gateway of PIN from step 4 to step 7. And PEMC only notifies PINE in this PIN of newly selected PEGC in step 8.\n4.\tPEMC sends a PIN configuration request to the PIN server to select a new PEGC. The request includes the PIN ID, the PEMC ID, the PEGC ID, authorization type indicating the role change, the ID of a PIN member that can serve as the new PEGC (e.g., PINE2), and a timestamp.\n5.\tThe PIN server considers which member of the PIN can serve as the new PEGC, including the PIN member the PEMC provided, and selects a PIN member to serve as the new PEGC. The PIN server sends a PIN management request to PINE-2 with PIN profile and dynamic profile information. The dynamic profile information includes PIN traffic routing rules that PINE2 would need to make routing decisions.\n6.\tPINE-2 sends a PIN management response accepting to serve as the new PEGC.\n7.\tThe PIN server sends a PIN configuration response with PIN profile and dynamic profile information to the PEMC with the status of the request, the ID of the new PEGC, and PIN traffic routing rules. The PIN server response triggers the PEMC to notify other PIN members of the PEGC role change.\n8.\tPEMC notifies the PIN server or other members of the PIN that PINE2 will serve as the new PEGC. The PEMC includes PIN profile and dynamic profile information that includes traffic routing rules applicable to each member.\nA PIN element could have been authorized to act as PEMC for a certain duration after which it is either removed from the PIN or de-authorized to act as PEMC. Another PIN element in the PIN takes over the role of PEMC.\nWhen the duration of its role as PEMC is expiring or for some other reasons (implementation specific) the current PEMC requests another PINE to take the role of PEMC. Once the role assignment succeeds, the PIN server and other PIN elements including PEGC are notified of this role change.\nFigure 8.5.2.10.2-4-1 illustrates PEMC replacement procedure triggered internally within the PIN by current PEMC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tPEMC-2 PIN element has already indicated that it can act as PEMC during the registration process.\n2.\tDynamic profile information about the PIN is available at the current PEMC and PIN server\n\nThe figure depicts a PEMC (Power Electronics Module Control) replacement triggered internally within the PIN (Power Integrity Module) of a power supply unit. This internal trigger is a crucial component in ensuring the proper functioning of the power supply unit, preventing potential damage or malfunctions. The figure provides a visual representation of the internal trigger mechanism, allowing for a better understanding of its operation and its impact on the overall power supply system.\nFigure 8.5.2.10.2.4-1: PEMC replacement triggered internally within the PIN\n1.\tPEMC-1, PEMC-2, PEGC, PINE-1 and PINE-2 are part of same PIN. PEMC-1 is currently the PEMC of the PIN.\n2.\tPEMC-1 decides to relinquish its PEMC role and handover to another PIN element. It may decide if it detects that its UE power is draining or its role as PEMC is nearing expiry.\n3.\tThe PEMC-1 looks into the PIN dynamic profile information to identify the new PINE which can take up the role of PEMC (here PEMC-2 PIN element) and requests PEMC-2 to take the role of PEMC by sending PIN PEMC role takeover request which includes the PIN identifier, PIN element identifier of PEMC-2.\n4.\tIf the PEMC-2 PINE decides to take up the role of PEMC it sends the PIN PEMC role takeover success response to the PEMC-1.\n5.\tThe PEMC-1 updates the PIN dynamic profile information with this role change details and delivers the PIN dynamic profile information to the PEMC-2 by consuming PIN status notify message.\n6.\tThe PEMC-1 signals all the PINEs in the PIN including the PEGC and PIN server about the change in the PIN element acting as PEMC and its reachability information by sending PIN status notify message. On receiving this notification PIN server and PEGC updates the PIN dynamic profile information with the details of PEMC-2.\nIn some scenarios, like hardware failure, crash or power drain, the current PEGC may not be in a position to indicate to the PIN server or request the PIN server to assign the role of PEGC to another PIN element. In these cases, the PEMC on detecting the unavailability of the PIN element acting as PEGC, need to assign the PEGC role to another PINE and deliver the PIN dynamic information to the new PEGC.\nFigure 8.5.2.10.2-5-1 illustrates PEGC replacement procedure triggered by PEMC on detecting current PEGC is unavailable or PEGC role change is required.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tPEGC-2 PIN element has already indicated that it can act as PEGC during the registration process.\n2.\tDynamic information about the PIN is available at the PEMC.\n3.\tPIN has only one PIN element configured with the role of PEGC.\nThe figure depicts a PEGC replacement triggered by PEMC, which is a crucial component in the network's signaling and control system. The figure shows the PEGC (Physical Ethernet Gateway Control) and PEMC (Physical Ethernet Media Converter) in a 5G network, highlighting their role in managing signaling and control traffic. The figure also shows the physical Ethernet media converter (PEMC) in action, which is responsible for converting physical Ethernet signals into control signals for the network. The figure provides a visual representation of the complex network architecture and the importance of these components in ensuring the smooth operation of the 5G network.\nFigure 8.5.2.10.2.5-1: PEGC replacement triggered by PEMC\n1.\tPEMC, PEGC-1, PEGC-2, PINE-1 and PINE-2 are part of same PIN. PEGC-1 is currently the PEGC of the PIN.\n2.\tThe PEMC identifies that it is no longer receiving periodic PIN heartbeats from PEGC-1 or its duration to act as PEGC is ending.\n3.\tThe PEMC looks into the PIN profile and PIN dynamic information to identify the new PINE which can take up the role of PEGC (here PEGC-2 PIN element) and requests PEGC-2 to take the role of PEGC by sending PIN PEGC role takeover request and this request includes the PIN Element ID of PEGC-2, PIN identifier and time duration to act as PEGC etc.\n4.\tIf the PEGC-2 PINE decides to take up the role of PEGC it sends the success PIN PEGC role takeover response to the PEMC.\n5.\tThe PEMC notifies the PIN server that PEGC-2 is the new PEGC of the PIN and it is releasing PEGC-1 from its role as PEGC by sending PIN status notification request containing the required details.\n6.\tThe PEMC and PIN server updates the PIN dynamic information with the relevant details of PEGC-2.\n7.\tThe PEMC delivers the PIN dynamic information to the PEGC-2 by consuming PIN status notify message.\n8.\tThe PEMC sends PIN status notify message to notify the relevant PINEs in the PIN about the change in the PIN element acting as PEGC and its reachability information.\n8.5.10.3\tInformation flows.\n8.5.10.3.1\tGeneral\nTable 8.5.10.3.2-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN configuration request sent by a PIN Element to the PIN server to obtain authorization for the modification of a PIN.\nTable 8.5.10.3.2-1: PIN configuration request\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.3-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN configuration response provided by the PIN server to authorize the modification of a PIN.\nTable 8.5.10.3.3-1: PIN configuration response\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.4-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN management request sent to PIN elements to make changes to the configuration of the PIN.\nTable 8.5.10.3.4-1: PIN management request\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.5-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN management response received from the PIN element to the PIN modification request.\nTable 8.5.10.3.5-1: PIN management response\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.6-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN PEMC role takeover request sent from current PEMC of the PIN to another PIN element with PEMC capability.\nTable 8.5.10.3.6-1: PIN PEMC role takeover request\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.7-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN PEMC role takeover response sent from requested PIN element to the current PEMC.\nTable 8.5.10.3.7-1: PIN PEMC role takeover response\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.8-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN PEGC role takeover request sent from current PEMC of the PIN to another PIN element with PEGC capability.\nTable 8.5.10.3.8-1: PIN PEGC role takeover request\n\nTable 8.5.10.3.9-1 shows the informational elements of the PIN PEGC role takeover response sent from requested PIN element to the current PEMC.\nTable 8.5.10.3.9-1: PIN PEGC role takeover response\n\n",

The PSS is responsible for managing the security of the network by controlling the access to the network. The figure shows the various steps involved in the PSS procedure, including the setup of the switch, the configuration of the security policies, and the management of the network access. The figure also includes a diagram of the network topology, which helps to visualize the network's structure and the flow of data. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the PSS procedure, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.2-1: PIN Service Switch procedure\n1.\tThe PIN Client sends a PIN Service Switch request to the PIN Server. The PIN Service Switch request includes the requestor identifier [PIN Client ID], security credential, a PIN identifier [PIN ID], an Application Client identifier [ACID], an Application Server identifier, an application session identifier, can include an IP 4 tuple that describes the traffic of the application session and can include a target PIN Client [PIN Client ID] if a target is known.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the PIN Client, the PIN Server checks if the PIN Client is authorized to request service switching for the given Application Server and validates the request. If the request is authorized and valid, the PIN server can determine a target PIN Client if the target PIN Client was not included in the request. The PIN Server sends a PIN Configure Service Switch request to the PIN Management Client and the Application Server as in clause  8.7.2.1.2. The PIN Server can use the PIN ID to identify the PIN Management Client instance and the Application Server identifier, or IP 4 tuple, to identify the Application Server instance.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the PIN Server sends a PIN Service Switch response to the PIN Client that indicates the Service Swich request was successfully processed and can include the target PIN Client information if it was decided by the PIN Server. Otherwise, the PIN Server sends a PIN Service Switch response to the PIN Client indicating that the request processing failed and can include appropriate reasons.\nUpon reciving the PIN Service Switch response, the PIN Client validates if the request was succesful and can indicate the result to the Application Client; the PIN Client can transfer the application context to the target PIN Client. If the PIN Service Switch response indicated a failure, the PIN Client can attempt perform service switch again for the same or a different target PIN Client considering the failure reason.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PIN Client successfully requested a service switch with the PIN Server\n2.\tThe AS is successfully subscribed for PIN service switch notifications with the PIN server.\n\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for configuring a PIN service switch in a 7.2.1.3 network.

The PIN Management Client can use the PIN ID to identify the PIN Gateway Client instance and the target PIN Client identifier to identify the target PIN Client.\n3.\tThe PIN Management Client sends the PIN Management Service Switch Configure request to the PIN Gateway Client or the target PIN Client including the information defined in step 1.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PIN Management Client first performs PIN Configure Service Switch procedure with the PIN Gateway Client, then if successful, with the target PIN Client.\n4.\tUpon receiving the request from the PIN Management Client, the PIN Gateway Client or the target PIN Client checks if the PIN Managment Client is authorized to request service switch configuration and validates the request. If the PIN Management Client is authorized and the request is valid, the PIN Gateway Client or the target PIN Client use the information provided in the request to switch the application session to the target PIN Client.\nNOTE 3:\tThe target Application Client needs to receive the application context prior to re-establishing a switched application session with the Application Server.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the target Application Client recovers the switched application session is out of scope of this specification.\n5.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the PIN Gateway Client or the target PIN Client send a PIN management Service Switch Configure response to the PIN Management Client indicating the processing was successful. Otherwise, the PIN Gateway Client or target PIN Client send a PIN Management Service Switch Configure response to the PIN Management Client indicating that processing the request failed and can include appropriate reasons.\n6.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the PIN Management Client or Application Server send a PIN Configuration Service Switch Configure response to the PIN Server that indicates the request was successfully processed. Otherwise, the PIN Management Client or Application Server send a PIN Configuration Service Switch Configure response to the PIN Server indicating the processing the request failed and can include appropriate reasons.\n7.\tThe PIN Server sends the PIN service switch notification to the Application Server if the procedure with the PIN Management Client was successful in step 6. The PIN service switch notification includes the PIN server identifier, PIN identifier, Application Client identifier, target PIN Client, application session identifier and can include IP 4 tuple that descibes the traffic of the application session.\n8.\tUpon receiving the PIN service switch notification, the Application Server uses the information provided in the notification to switch the application session to the target PIN client.\nThe PIN service switch subscription is used by the Application Server to be notified of PIN service switch events by the PIN Server.\nThe PIN service switch notification events includes PIN service switch configuration information.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.1-1 illustrates the PIN service switch subscribe procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has already received the address of the PIN server;\n2.\tThe application server is authorized to communicate with PIN server;\nThe figure depicts a PIN service switch, which is a component of a network switch. It is used to route and manage network traffic, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The switch is equipped with multiple ports, each capable of handling different types of network traffic, such as Ethernet, IP, and MPLS. The figure also includes a label indicating the switch's model and version, as well as a description of its features and capabilities.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.1-1: PIN service switch subscribe\n1.\tThe application server sends the PIN service switch subscribe request to the PIN server. The PIN service switch subscribe request includes the application server identifier along with the security credentials, PIN ID, subscribed event, notification target address, and may include proposed expiration time.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the application server, the PIN server checks if the application server is authorized to subscribe. The authorization check may apply to an individual PIN. If the request is authorized, the PIN server creates and stores the subscription for application server.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request is successful, the PIN server sends a PIN service switch subscribe response to the application server, which includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the application server shall send a PIN service switch update request prior to the expiration time. If a new PIN service switch update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the PIN server shall treat the application server as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.2-1 illustrates the PIN service switch notify procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has subscribed with the PIN server as specified in clause 8.7.2.1.4.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a PIN service switch notification procedure, which is a crucial component of a network's signaling system. It illustrates the steps taken by the switch to notify the network of a change in service status, ensuring that all devices are aware of the new status. The figure includes various components such as the switch itself, the signaling protocol, and the network interface cards (NICs) that are used to communicate with the switch. The diagram is a visual representation of the complex network architecture, highlighting the interconnection of different devices and the importance of proper signaling protocols in maintaining network reliability and efficiency.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.2-1: PIN service switch notify procedure\n1.\tWhen a service switch event occurs at the PIN server that satisfies triggering conditions, the PIN server sends a server switch notification to the subscribed application servers.\n2.\tThe PIN server sends an PIN service switch notification to the subscribed application server(s) related to the service switch event and includes the PIN service switch configuration information.\nThe PIN service switch configuration information includes the PIN subscription identifier, subscribed event, PIN server identifier, PIN identifier, Application Client identifier, application session identifier, target PIN Client, application session identifier and can include IP 4 tuple that describes the traffic of the application session.\n3.\tUpon receiving the notification, the application server uses the information provided in the notification to switch the application session to the target PIN client.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.3-1 illustrates the PIN service switch update procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has subscribed with the PIN server as specified in clause 8.7.2.1.4.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a PIN service switch update, which is a crucial component in a network's infrastructure. It illustrates the process of updating the switch's configuration to ensure the proper functioning of the network. The update process involves updating the switch's configuration, including the configuration of the network interface cards (NICs), the configuration of the switch's routing tables, and the configuration of the switch's security settings. This update ensures that the switch is functioning correctly and is able to route traffic efficiently and securely.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.3-1: PIN service switch update\n1.\tThe application server sends a PIN service switch update request to the PIN server. The PIN service switch update request includes the security credentials and the subscription identifier. It may also include notification target address and proposed expiration time.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the application server, the PIN server checks if the application server is authorized to update the subscription information. If the request is authorized, the PIN server updates the stored subscription.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request is successful, the PIN server sends a PIN service switch update response to the application server, which may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the application server shall send a PIN service switch subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a PIN service switch update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the PIN server shall treat the application server as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.4-1 illustrates the PIN service switch unsubscribe procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has subscribed with the PIN server as specified in clause 8.7.2.1.4.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a PIN service switch, which is a key component in a network's infrastructure. It is used to manage and control the flow of data packets within a network. The switch is designed to handle multiple services, such as voice, video, and data, and to ensure efficient routing of packets. The figure shows the various ports and connections that the switch can handle, as well as the ability to unblock and unsubscribe from specific services.\nFigure 8.7.2.1.4.2.4-1: PIN service switch unsubscribe\n1.\tThe application server sends a PIN service switch unsubscribe request to the PIN server. The PIN service switch unsubscribe request includes the security credentials and the subscription identifier.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the application server, the PIN server checks if the application server is authorized to unsubscribe. If the request is authorized, the PIN server cancels the subscription indicated by the subscription identifier.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request is successful, the PIN server sends a PIN service switch unsubscribe response to the application server.\nThe figure depicts a PIN service setup, showing the internal PINs (pin numbers) used for authentication and access control. The setup includes a central server, a router, and a set of external devices, such as a printer and a scanner. The PINs are represented by a series of numbers, with each number corresponding to a specific pin number. The figure illustrates the importance of PINs in securing sensitive data and ensuring secure communication.\nFigure 8.7.2.2-1: PIN Service Switch internal PIN\nIn Figure 8.7.2.2-1, it describes the service switch scenario supported internal PIN.\nThe PINE A has the application communication with application server. And when the PINE A decides to select other alternative PINE B to apply the traffic flow, the PINE A firstly should discover a PIN and join in. And then, in the PIN, there should exist the PINE that can be hosted with the same service type as PINE A, for example, the video flow, music flow or game flow.\nThe PINE A can send the request to PEMC to determine the PINE B to host the application traffic. After the determination, the PEMC sends the endpoint information to PINE A and the PINE A can offload the traffic either directly to PINE B or via PEGC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe UE Identifier or PIN client Identifier of PINE A or PINE B is available;\n2.\tThe PIN client in PINE A or PINE B has been authorized to communicate with the PEMC;\n3.\tThe PIN client in PINE B can provide the same PIN service as PINE A’s traffic flow.\nThe figure depicts a service switch procedure internal PIN, which is a crucial component in the network's control and management system. It is used to manage and control the flow of data within the network, ensuring that it is routed efficiently and securely. The figure shows the various internal pins and their corresponding functions, such as the power supply, data input, and data output. This helps in maintaining the network's stability and performance.\nFigure 8.7.2.2-2: Service switch procedure internal PIN\n0.\tThe PINE A has application layer communication with application server. And the PINE A decides to do the service switch to other PINEs. And the PINE A has already been in a PIN.\n1.\tThe PINE A trigger the PIN service discovery request towards PEMC. This request carries the list of services the PINE A wants to consume.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PEMC performs an authorization check to verify whether the PINE A has authorization to perform the operation.\n3.\tThe PEMC provides the list of PINE endpoint(s), application client endpoint(s) information that are offering the requested services to PINE A in PIN service discovery response. The PIN service can be represented by service type that PINE provides or the application client on PINE. If the request fails, the PEMC should give the failure response to indicates the cause of request failure.\n4.\tThe PINE A selects PINE B from the list of PINEs provided in the PIN service discovery response.\nThe PINE A sends the PIN Management Service Switch Configure request to the selected PINE B including: PIN ID, requestor ID, service information (e.g. PIN service type, PIN service feature) before performing service switch.\n5.\tUpon receiving the request from PINE A, PINE B determines whether it can accept the service switch request and sends the PIN Management Service Switch Configure response to PINE A.\nIf the PIN Management Service Switch Configure response indicates failure, the PINE A may consider other PINEs in the list of PINEs provided in the PIN service discovery response received in step 3 and may perform step 4 again.\nIf the PIN Management Service Switch Configure response indicates success, the PINE A maintains the service towards AS and proceeds with switching the service traffic to PINE B.\n6.\tThe PINE A switches the traffic flow to PINE B via direct communication or via PEGC.\n",

This procedure enables the PEMC to provide AS connectivity information to the PINE when requested by the PINE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PINE has joined the PIN and is authorized to communicate with the PEMC;\nThe figure depicts the AS discovery procedure in a 5G network, illustrating the steps involved in identifying and locating the base stations (BSs) in the network. The figure shows the network topology, including the base stations, user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Key components include the network slicing, which is a concept used to divide the network into smaller segments for better management and control. The figure also highlights the use of network slicing to optimize network resources and improve performance.\nFigure 8.8.2.2-1: AS discovery procedure\n1.\tThe PINE sends an AS discovery request to the PEMC. The AS discovery request includes the requestor identifier, security credentials of the PINE and the AS service identifier of a service associated with an AS.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PEMC checks if the requestor is authorized to request AS discovery, and if the request is authorized, the PEMC verifies if it has information on an AS providing associated with the requested AS service identifier. If the PEMC identifies information about an AS providing the requested service, the PEMC proceeds to step 6.\n3.\tIf the PEMC has not identified an AS in step 2, the PEMC sends an AS discovery request to the PIN Server. The AS discovery request includes the requestor identifier, security credentials of the PEMC and the AS service identifier associated with an AS.\n4.\tUpon receiving the request, the PJN Server checks if the requestor is authorized to request AS discovery, and if the request is authorized, the PIN Server verifies if it has information on an AS providing associated with the requested AS service identifier.\n5.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the PIN Server sends an AS discovery response to the requestor indicating successful processing and includes connectivity information to the AS. If the request processing failed, the PIN Server indicates failure and may provide a failure reason.\n6.\tIf the processing of the request was successful in step 2 or the PEMC has received a successful response from the PIN Server in step 5, the PEMC sends an AS discovery response to the requestor indicating successful processing and includes connectivity information to the discovered AS. If the request processing failed, the PEMC indicates failure and may provide a failure reason.\nUpon receiving the AS discovery response from the PEMC, if the response indicates success, the PINE (e.g., PIN Client) may provide the AS connectivity information to the AC so the AC can access the AS. If the response indicates failure, the PINE may retry AS discovery considering the failure reason.\nFigure 8.8.2.3-1 illustrates the AS registration procedure between the AS and the PEMC or PIN Server. This procedure enables the AS to provide AS connectivity information to the PEMC or the PIN Server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AS is authorized to communicate with the PEMC or the PIN Server;\nThe figure depicts the AS registration procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's operation. It illustrates the steps taken by the network to register an access point (AP) with the network. The figure shows the process of obtaining the necessary information, such as the AP's MAC address, from the network, and then using this information to register the AP with the network. This step is essential for ensuring that the AP is correctly assigned to a specific network segment and can communicate with other devices on the network.\nFigure 8.8.2.3-1: AS registration procedure\n1.\tThe AS sends an AS registration request to the PEMC or PIN Server. The AS registration request includes the requestor identifier, security credentials of the AS, the AS service identifier of the service associated with the AS, the connectivity information of the AS.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PEMC or PIN Server checks if the requestor is authorized to request AS registration, and if the request is authorized, the PEMC or PIN Server stores information associated with AS service.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the PEMC or PIN Server sends an AS registration response to the requestor indicating successful processing and include the AS registration identifier; the response may include an expiration time to indicate to the AS when the registration will automatically expire. To maintain the registration, the AS shall send a registration update request prior to the expiration time. If a registration update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the PEMC or PIN Server shall treat the AS as implicitly de-registered. If the request processing failed, the PEMC or PIN Server indicates failure and may provide a failure reason.\nUpon receiving the AS registration response from the PEMC, if the response indicates success, the AS stores the registration identifier and may reuse it to update or delete its registration to the PEMC or PIN Server. If the response indicates failure, the AS may retry AS registration considering the failure reason.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AS has registered with the PEMC or PIN Server;\n2.\tThe AS has determined that its existing registration needs to be updated;\nThe figure depicts the AS registration update procedure, which is a crucial step in the network management process. It illustrates the steps taken by the network administrator to update the address space of an AS (Access Server) in a 5G network. The figure shows the process of updating the registration database, which is updated every 15 minutes, and the steps involved in updating the registration database. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network topology, with the AS and other network elements clearly labeled.\nFigure 8.8.2.4-1: AS registration update procedure\n1.\tThe AS sends an AS registration update request to the PEMC or PIN Server where it registered. The request shall include the AS registration identifier and may include registration information such as the AS service identifier and AS connectivity information.\n2.\tThe PEMC or PIN Server performs an authorization check to verify whether the requestor is authorized to request AS registration update for the provided AS registration identifier; if the request is authorized and the AS registration identifier is valid, the PEMC or PIN Server update the registration information associated with the AS registration identifier.\n3.\tIf the request processing is successful, the PEMC or PIN Server replies to the AS with an AS registration update response and may include an updated expiration time to indicate to the AS when the updated registration will automatically expire.

It illustrates the steps involved in deactivating an AS, including the deactivation of the network, the deactivation of the associated service, and the deactivation of the associated network. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 8.8.2.5-1: AS de-registration procedure\n1.\tThe AS sends an AS de-registration request to the PEMC or PIN Server where it registered. The request shall include the AS registration identifier.\n2.\tThe PEMC or PIN Server performs an authorization check to verify whether the requestor is authorized to request AS de-registration for the provided AS registration identifier; if the request is authorized and the AS registration identifier is valid, the PEMC or PIN Server removes the registration information associated with the AS registration identifier.\n3.\tIf the request processing is successful, the PEMC or PIN Server replies to the AS with an AS de-registration response.

It illustrates the steps taken to maintain connectivity during a power outage, including the use of a power generator, battery backup, and communication protocols. The figure is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of the network during critical events.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.2-1: PIN PEGC Service Continuity procedure\n1.\tThe PIN Gateway Client or the PIN Client sends a PIN Management PEGC Service Continuity request to the PIN Management Client for a specific service. The PIN Management PEGC Service Continuity request includes security credentials, PIN Client identifier(s), PIN Gateway identifier, and Service identifier.\n2\tUpon receiving the request, the PIN Management Client validates the request and checks if the request is authorized for the given PIN Client(s), PIN Gateway Client and service. If the request is authorized and valid, the PIN Management Client determines if a target PIN Gateway Client meets the requirements for handling the application traffic for the provided service.\nIf the PIN Management Client identifes a target PIN Gateway Client that meets the requirements, the PIN Management Client sends PIN Management PEGC Configuration request to the target PIN Gateway Client to configure the target PIN Gateway for handling service traffic from the PIN Client(s) as in clause 8.9.2.1.3. If the service is provided by an Application Server, the PIN Management Client send a PIN Configuration Update request to the PIN Server if needed to inform of the service continuity changes in the PIN as in clause 8.9.2.1.4.\n3.\tIf the procesing of the request was successful, the PIN Management Client sends a PIN Management PEGC Service Continuity response to indicate that the request processing was successfull and includes target PIN Gateway Client information. Otherwise, the PIN Management Client sends a PIN PEGC Service Continuity response indicating that the request processing failed and can include appropriate reasons.\nUpon receiving the PIN Management PEGC Service Continuity response, if the response was received by the PIN Client, the PIN Client validates if the request was successful and can inform the application client of the target PIN Gateway Client provided in the response to establish connectivity. If the response was received by the PIN Gateway Client, the PIN Gateway Client notifies each PIN Client included in the PIN Management PEGC Service Continuity request about the target PIN Gateway Client change as in clause 8.9.2.1.5.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PIN Management Client has received a PIN Management PEGC Service Continuity request; and\n2.\tThe PIN Management client has identified a target PIN Gateway Client.\nThe figure depicts a PIN Management PEGC Configuration procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's security and performance. The diagram illustrates the steps involved in configuring the PEGC (Physical Ethernet Guard Channel) for a 5G network, including the selection of the guard channel, the configuration of the guard channel, and the establishment of the guard channel's security parameters. This configuration ensures that the network is protected against unauthorized access and that the network's performance is optimized.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.3-1: PIN Management PEGC Configuration procedure\n1.\tThe PIN Management Client sends a PIN Management PEGC Configuration request to the target PIN Gateway Client. The PIN Management PEGC Configuration request includes security credentials, PIN Client identifier(s), PIN Gateway identifier, and Service identifier.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PIN Gateway Client validates the request and checks if the PIN Management Client is authorized to request PEGC Configuration. If the request is authorized and the request is valid, the PIN Gateway Client creates a new configuration for the PIN Client(s) and service that are indicated in the request.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the target PIN Gateway Client sends a PIN Management PEGC Configuration response to the PIN Management Client to indicate that the request was successful and can include connectivity information to be used by the PIN Client(s). Otherwise, the target PIN Gateway sends a PIN Management PEGC Configuration response indicating that the request failed and can include appropriate reasons.\nUpon receiving the PIN Management PEGC Configuration response, the PIN Management Client uses the information provided in the response to inform the PIN Client(s) or the PIN Gateway Client from which the service continuity request originated as in clause 8.9.2.1.2.\nThe PIN Service Continuity Update procedure allows the PEMC to inform the PIN Server about a service continuity request received at the PEMC for a PINE, and it allows the PIN Server to inform the related AS of the same if such functionality is supported by the AS.\nThe PIN Server may provide, in the response, policy information to the PEMC about service continuity for the concerned PINE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tPINE has an application session that goes through a PEGC; and\n2.\tPEGC needs to be replaced (e.g., PEGC will become unavailable or PEGC is unreachable).\n3.\tThe AS is successfully subscribed for PIN service continuity notifications with the PIN Server.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for updating the PIN configuration in a 4-1 system. It includes a diagram of the system components, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output (I/O) devices. The figure also illustrates the steps involved in updating the PIN configuration, including the selection of the correct PIN, the execution of the update procedure, and the verification of the updated configuration.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.4-1: PIN Configuration Update procedure\n1.\tThe PEMC sends a PIN Configuration Service Continuity Update request to the PIN Server. The PIN Configuration Service Continuity Update request includes the requestor identifier, security credentials, PINE identifier(s), source and target PIN Gateway identifiers, and service identifier (e.g., application client identifier, application server identifier, application session identifier, application session identifier), and the PIN ID.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PIN Server validates the request and checks if the PEMC is authorized to request service continuity update. If the request is authorized and valid, if the PIN Server has not authorized the PINE for service continuity, the PIN Server validates if the PINE is authorized and determines policy information about service continuity for the PINE. If the PIN Server has already authorized the PINE for service continuity, the PIN Server updates the configuration for the PINE and service indicated in the request.\n3.\tIf the PIN Server needs to update the AS with service continuity information, the PIN Server sends a PIN Service Continuity notification to the AS. The PIN Service Continuity notification includes PIN identifier, PINE identifier(s), PEGC identifier, service identifier and may include an application session identifier and terminating endpoints on the PINE and PEGC.\n4. \tUpon receiving the notification, the AS validates the notification. If the notification is valid, the AS updates the service continuity configuration related to the PINE and service indicated in the notification.\n5.\tIf the processing of the PIN Configuration Service Continuity Update request was successful, the PIN Server sends a PIN Configuration Service Continuity Update response to indicate that the request processing was successful and may include policy information about service continuity for the PINE. Otherwise, the PIN Server sends a PIN Configuration Service Continuity Update response indicating that the request processing failed and can include appropriate reasons.\nUpon receiving the PIN Configuration Service Continuity Update response, the PEMC uses the information provided in the response to inform the PINE(s) or the PEGC from which the service continuity request originated as in clause 8.9.2.1.2.\nPEMC performs PIN Management PEGC discovery procedure to discover which PEGC are available at the PINE when the PEMC does not have that information; for example, the PEMC may ignore if a PEGC is available at the PINE or PEGC information may not have been provided to the PEMC in the service provisioning request.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PEMC has been triggered for service continuity;\n2.\tThe target PEGC is not known by the PEMC.\n\nThe figure depicts a PIN Management PEGC Discovery procedure in a 5G network, illustrating the steps involved in managing physical-in-the-loop (PIN) and physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateways. The diagram shows the various components, such as the physical-in-the-loop (PIN) gateway, physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, and the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, as well as the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, and the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway. The diagram also includes the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, and the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, as well as the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway, and the physical-in-the-element (PEGC) gateway.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.5-1: PIN Management PEGC Discovery procedure\n1.\tThe PEMC sends a PIN Management PEGC Discovery request to the PINE involved in the service continuity procedure. The PIN Management PEGC Discovery request includes security credentials, requestor identifier, PIN identifier, PINE identifier and list of PEGC information.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PINE validates the request and checks if the request is authorized. If the request is authorized and valid, the PINE uses the PEGC information provided in the request to identify PEGC(s) that are reachable and creates a list of PEGC identifier(s) that are available at the PINE.\n3.\tIf the procesing of the request was successful, the PINE sends a PIN Management PEGC Discovery response to indicate that the request processing is successfull and includes the list of PEGC identifier(s) available at the PINE. Otherwise, the PINE sends a PIN Management PEGC Discovery response indicating that the request processing failed and can include appropriate reasons.\nUpon receiving the response, the PEMC selects the target PEGC based on the list of available PEGC received and the PIN policy.\nThe PIN service continuity subscription is used by the Application Server to be notified of PIN service continuity events by the PIN Server.\nThe PIN service continuity notification includes PIN service continuity information.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.1-1 illustrates the PIN service continuity subscribe procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has already received the address of the PIN server;\n2.\tThe application server is authorized to communicate with PIN server;\nThe figure depicts a PIN service continuity diagram, showing the various sub-services and their corresponding sub-services. The diagram illustrates the service continuity of the PIN service, with each sub-service represented by a separate line. The sub-services are connected to the main service, and the diagram shows the path of the service continuity.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.1-1: PIN service continuity subscribe\n1.\tThe application server sends the PIN service continuity subscribe request to the PIN server. The PIN service continuity subscribe request includes the application server identifier along with the security credentials, PIN ID, subscribed event, notification target address and proposed expiration time.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the application server, the PIN server checks if the application server is authorized to subscribe. The authorization check may apply to an individual PIN. If the request is authorized, the PIN server creates and stores the subscription for application server.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request is successful, the PIN server sends a PIN service continuity subscribe response to the application server, which includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the application server shall send a PIN service continuity update request prior to the expiration time. If a new PIN service continuity update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the PIN server shall treat the application server as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.2-1 illustrates the PIN service continuity notify procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has subscribed with the PIN server as specified in clause 8.9.2.1.6.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a service continuity notification procedure for a PIN service, with a step-by-step guide for the notify process.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.2-1: PIN service continuity notify procedure\n1.\tWhen a service continuity event occurs at the PIN server that satisfies triggering conditions, the PIN server sends a service continuity notification to the subscribed application servers.\n2.\tThe PIN server sends an PIN service continuity notification to the subscribed application server(s) related to the service continuity event and includes the PIN service continuity information.\nThe PIN service continuity information includes the PIN subscription identifier, subscribed event, PIN server identifier, PIN identifier, PINE identifier(s), PEGC identifier, service identifier, application session identifier and may include terminating endpoints on the PINE and PEGC.\n3.\tUpon receiving the notification, the application server uses the information provided in the notification to update the service continuity configuration related to the PINE and service indicated in the notification.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.3-1 illustrates the PIN service continuity update procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has subscribed with the PIN server as specified in clause 8.9.2.1.6.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a service continuity update for PIN 6, with a focus on the update status and the corresponding PIN 1. The update is scheduled for 9:00 AM, and the status is \"on.\"\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.3-1: PIN service continuity update\n1.\tThe application server sends a PIN service continuity update request to the PIN server. The PIN service continuity update request includes the security credentials and the subscription identifier. It may also include notification target address, PIN ID, event ID and proposed expiration time.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the application server, the PIN server checks if the application server is authorized to update the subscription information. If the request is authorized, the PIN server updates the stored subscription.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request is successful, the PIN server sends a PIN service continuity update response to the application server, which may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the application server shall send a PIN service continuity update request prior to the expiration time. If a PIN service continuity update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the PIN server shall treat the application server as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.4-1 illustrates the PIN service continuity unsubscribe procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe application server has subscribed with the PIN server as specified in clause 8.9.2.1.6.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a service continuity unsubscribe PIN, which is a crucial component in the telecommunications industry. It is used to manage and maintain the continuity of service for subscribers. The figure shows the various PINs and their corresponding service continuity numbers, ensuring that subscribers can easily identify and manage their subscriptions.\nFigure 8.9.2.1.6.2.4-1: PIN service continuity unsubscribe\n1.\tThe application server sends a PIN service continuity unsubscribe request to the PIN server. The PIN service continuity unsubscribe request includes the security credentials and the subscription identifier.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the application server, the PIN server checks if the application server is authorized to unsubscribe. If the request is authorized, the PIN server cancels the subscription indicated by the subscription identifier.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request is successful, the PIN server sends a PIN service continuity unsubscribe response to the application server.\nThis procedure solves the situation, that PINE 1 has application layer communication with PINE 2 via PEGC 1. But when the communication via PEGC 1 is not viable, for example, the PINE 2 moves out of the coverage of PEGC 1, only PINE 2 triggers to establish the 5GS communication to connect to PINE 1 via PEGC 2is the potential way.\nFigure 8.9.2.2-1 illustrates the service continuity to change application layer communication via PEGC only to application layer communication via PEGC + 5GS or 5GS + PEGC based on request/response model.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe PEMC in a PIN has been pre-configured or has discovered the address (e.g. IP address, FQDN, URI) of the PIN server;\n2.\tThe PIN has already been created and a PIN ID is distributed by PIN server;\n3.\tThe PINE 1 has the subscription that can communicate with PINE 2 via 5GS;\n4.\tThe PINE 2 does not have the 3GPP capability and require support of a PEGC to access the 3GPP network.\nThe figure depicts a change in communication between the application layer and the 5G network, illustrating the transition from traditional 4G/LTE to 5G. The figure shows the 5G network architecture, including the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, which are crucial for ensuring network reliability and failover.\nFigure 8.9.2.2-1: Change application layer communication to communication via 5GS\n1.\tThe PINE 1 has application layer communication with PINE 2 via PEGC 1.\n2.\tThe PINE 2 moves out of PEGC 1 and moves into the coverage of PEGC 2. The PINE 2 connects to the network that provided by PEGC 2 via access control information.\n3.\tThe PEGC 2 receives the related parameter (PIN ID, MAC address/IP address, Traffic descriptors, Packet filters, requested QoS) as indicated in section 8.6.2.2 from PINE 2 or PEMC.\n4.\tAccording to the Packet filters, the PEGC 2 may initiate PDU Session Modification as indicated in section 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502[5] with the Packet filters and requested QoS towards 5G system in order to make 5GC configure the N4 rules for UPF(s), referred to section 8.6.2.2.\n5.\tThe PINE 2 communicates with PINE 1 via 5GS by PEGC 2. To enable this communication via PEGC + 5GS or 5GS + PEGC, each PINE includes the PINE ID of the destination PINE in its communication.\n",

The diagram includes a PIN server, a user interface, and a PIN input field, all connected to a PIN authorization system. The user is prompted to enter their PIN, and the system validates the input to ensure the user's identity. The diagram also shows the connection to a PIN database, where the user's PINs are stored and can be retrieved for future use.\nFigure 8.10.2.2-1: PIN authorization with PIN server\n1.\tThe PINE sends a PIN authorization request to the PIN server. The request includes the PIN identifier, and the requestor identifiers, name, description, and address.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the PIN server validates if the requestor is allowed to access the requested PIN using the information provided in the request and the PIN configuration information from the PIN profile.\nEditor's Note: Whether enhancements or new procedures are required for supporting PIN security aspects is FFS.\n3.\tThe PIN server sends a PIN authorization response to the requestor. If the PIN server successfully determines that the requestor is allowed to access the PIN, the PIN server includes security information for the requestor to use within the PIN. If the PIN server fails to authorize the requestor, the PIN server indicates failure in the response and includes a failure reason.\n",
