            "description": "NSCE layer provides value added services to VAL customers, based on consuming 5GS services related to slicing (from OAM, 5GC) and based on interacting with the VAL UE side. The variety of services and the deployment aspects depend on the different assumptions for the slice owner / provider, the slice customer and the SEAL service provider. With respect to NSCE, the NSCE server belongs to the SEAL provider (as stated in TS 23.434 [2] clause 5) who can be either the MNO itself, or the vertical customer (e.g. factory owner, automaker X) or the edge/cloud provider (e.g. hyperscaler) who provides such platform services related to slice capability exposure to the vertical customer on top of the MNO. Thus, NSCE can play different roles based on the business models. For example, NSCE server can be:\n-\tdeployed by NOP / MNO.\n-\tdeployed by an Edge / Cloud Provider. In this case, it is assumed that the NSCE server is acting as an authorized AF/AS.\n-\tdeployed by a vertical industry, which can be the end slice customer.\nFrom business perspective, the following business model applies. In Figure 5-1, the different interactions among all the involved entities are provided. More specifically, in this model the end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the vertical/ASP and can have app-level service agreement with vertical/ASP(s).\nThe end user/UE also has a PLMN subscription arrangement with the MNO. The UE used by the end user is allowed to be registered on the MNO's network. MNO (via OAM) can have a slice SLA with the vertical / ASP, which is optional when vertical customer is the NSC. In addition, due to the involvement of a NSCE service provider, additional agreements can be possible between the NSCE server and VAL/ASP layer and the NOP/MNO(s):\n-\tthe enablement service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service provider include the agreement on the value-added services, which in case on NSaaS these are services related to the consumed slice from NOP. So, the end customer (VAL) subscribes to NSCE server for receiving additional services for optimizing the slice utilization. In case that the NSCE server is a NSP towards VAL customer, then such agreement can relate to slice SLA (for the slice provided by the NSCE server). When the NSCE server is part of the vertical, the service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service provider is internal to a single organization.\n-\tthe service agreement between MNO and NSCE service provider is for consuming 5GS services (and being also authorized to provide additional services on top). Such agreement could be also a slice SLA for the scenarios when NSCE server is the NSC of the MNO (in NSaaS model).\nThe figure depicts a network diagram with various business relationships represented by different colored lines and symbols. The network is divided into different layers, each with its own set of business relationships. The figure illustrates the flow of data and the interactions between different entities within the network, highlighting the importance of clear communication and collaboration in the business world.\nFigure 5-1: Business relationships\nIn case of shared RAN between operators, one NSCE service provider (slice service provider) can use NSCE to offer slice services using resources of these operators to end customer (VAL) using the shared RAN via one or both operators.\nIn case of national roaming between operators, one NSCE service provider (slice service provider) can use NSCE to offer slice services using resources of these operators to end customer (VAL).\n",

                            "text_content": "In the Initial Configuration procedure, the VAL server initially provides an application requirement to enabler server including the service KPIs and the subscribed/preferred slices. Then, the slice enabler configures the mapping of the VAL application to a slice API which is a combination/bundling of northbound APIs (from both management and control plane). In particular, a slice API consists of telco-provided/platform dependent service APIs (e.g., NEF, OAM, SEAL, etc), and provides an abstraction/simplification on top of them. The VAL server-initiated Configuration Update procedure covers the scenario where a trigger event occurs (e.g., QoS degradation, slice load) and the mapping configuration or the slice API configuration needed to be changed. In this scenario, the slice enabler updates the configuration of the API and provides a notification to the VAL server.\nThese two procedures for the initial configuration and the configuration update are covered in 9.3.2.1 and 9.3.2.2 respectively.\nFigure 9.3.2.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure of the initial slice API configuration.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.\nThe figure depicts the initial configuration of the Slice API in a 3.2.1.2 network. It shows the necessary parameters for the API to function correctly, such as the number of slices, the number of slices per slice, and the number of slices per slice. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different parameters and their meanings.\nFigure 9.3.2.1.2-1: Initial Slice API configuration\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a VAL application requirement request to the NSCE server.\n2.\tThe NSCE server maps the VAL application requirement to a slice API which includes a list of APIs which is needed to be consumed as part of this service capability exposure.\nThe NSCE server may also store the mapping of the slice API to the service API list and per service API information (e.g. data encoding, transport technology, API protocol and versions)\n3.\tThe NSCE server registers to consume the corresponding APIs from the 5GS (NEF and OAM) and SEAL service producers. The NSCE server registers to the following:\n-\tto consume NEF monitoring events as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 clause 5 e.g.,  network monitoring, slice status, analytics exposure, etc\n-\tto consume PM services and KPI monitoring from OAM\n-\tto consume SEAL services based on 3GPP TS 23.434\n4.\tThe NSCE server sends a VAL application requirement response to notify on the result of the request and indicate whether the configuration of slice API is possible or not.\n5.\tThe NSCE server sends the slice API information notification to the VAL server.\nFigure 9.3.2.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure of the slice API configuration updated based on a trigger event.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tInitial configuration of the slice API has been completed successfully.\n2.\tA trigger event, which may result the need of a slice configuration change, is captured by the VAL server (application server relocation to different EDN/DN, UE mobility to different EDN, application change of behaviour).\nThe figure depicts a slice API configuration update, showing the steps to update the API configuration for a specific slice. The figure includes a diagram of the API configuration, with various components such as the API server, API client, and the slice. The steps to update the API configuration are outlined, with a focus on the API server and API client. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 9.3.2.1.3-1: Slice API configuration update\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a VAL server-initiated configuration update request to the NSCE server.\n2.\tThe NSCE server processes the trigger event and checks the feasibility of such change and updates the mapping of service APIs to the slice APIs. One criterion for the update of the mapping is, if possible, to avoid changing the slice API configuration, which can be achieved by the re-mapping of the underlying service APIs\n3.\tThe NSCE server updates the subscription/registration to the underlying 5GS and SEAL service producers, if an update on the service APIs (e.g., NEF APIs, SEAL APIs, OAM provided APIs) is needed.\n4.\tThe NSCE server sends a VAL server-initiated configuration update response, containing the new slice API information, if an update has been carried out by the NSCE server.\nThis procedure follows the 9.3.2.1 and aims to describe how the slice API invocation request is translated to service API invocations after the slice API configuration mapping. In this procedure, the NSCE server initially receives a slice API invocation request from the vertical application. Then, the NSCE server fetches the service APIs to be invoked based on the slice API configuration and performs invocation requests to the corresponding service API providers.\nFigure 9.3.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure of the slice API translation based on the initial configuration.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.\n2.\tThe slice API mapping to the VAL server has been performed based on 9.3.2.1.2 step 2 and the slice API information is provided to the VAL server based on 9.3.2.1.2 step 5.\nThe figure depicts a slice API translation, illustrating the process of converting a slice API into a format that can be understood and used by the system. The figure shows a series of steps, including slicing, API translation, and the resulting format. This process is crucial for ensuring that the API is correctly interpreted and used by the system.\nFigure 9.3.2.2-1: Slice API translation\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a slice API invocation request to the NSCE server\n2.\tThe NSCE server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the slice API invocation and maps the requested slice API to a service APIs. If CAPIF is used, the NSCE server acts as AEF, and the authorization is obtained by CCF.\n3.\tThe NSCE server generates a trigger for service API invocation requests to all the service APIs within the slice API.\n4.\tThe NSCE server performs the corresponding service API invocation procedures based on CAPIF or via performing requests to the corresponding service API providers, which are mapped to the slice API.\tIf CAPIF is used, the requests are sent to the corresponding AEFs of the API provider's domain, and the authorization is obtained by CCF.\n5.\tThe NSCE server sends a slice API invocation response to the VAL server, based on the result of the service API invocation response(s) of step 4.\n",

The lifecycle includes planning, design, deployment, operation, and maintenance. Key components include network slices, network slices management, and network slice lifecycle management.\nFigure 9.4.2.1-1: Application layer network slice lifecycle management\n1.\tThe VAL server sends the application layer network slice lifecycle management (AppLayer-NS-LCM) subscribe request to NSCE server, with network slice requirements from VAL server/consumer (e.g. delay, throughput, load, the maximum number of users supported, etc.). The request can indicate whether the notification is needed before performing the AppLayer-NS-LCM. The request can also indicate the trigger conditions, such as by providing the monitored parameters and the corresponding thresholds as described in clause 9.4.3.2.\n2.\tAfter receiving the request, the NSCE server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the corresponding AppLayer-NS-LCM operations, and filters the unauthorized requests, if any.\n3.\tAccording to network slice requirements and/or the trigger conditions, NSCE server triggers the provision of network slice status and QoE metrics. If the trigger conditions are not indicated in the subscription, the NSCE server can help to configure an appropriate trigger condition, such as report period or thresholds.\n3a.\tThe network slice status could be collected through subscribing or requesting to 5GS. List of network slice status parameters to be collected are:\n-\tNetwork Slice load statistics information, and/or Network Slice load predictions information from NWDAF/NEF as defined in TS 23.288 Table 6.3.3A.\n-\tPerformance metric in the performance data file from OAM as defined in clause 11.3 of TS 28.532 [7].\n3b.\tAlso, the NSCE server could get the information of QoE metrics from the application layer domain by QoE metric subscribe as described in clause 9.4.3.5.\n4.\tOnce authenticated and authorized, the NSCE server sends the AppLayer-NS-LCM response to the VAL server.\n5.\tThe NSCE server may process and combine the collected network slice status and QoE metrics, if needed. The NSCE server may process and combine the parameters in the trigger conditions, if multiple trigger conditions were provided. Once the trigger condition or the combination of trigger conditions are met which indicating the network slice requirements from VAL server is not satisfied, the NSCE server determines whether and what network slice LCM operations should be taken based on requirements from VAL server/consumer and network slice status and QoE metrics, and makes the decision(s)/recommendation(s), such as modifyNsi/AllocateNsi/DeallocateNsi request as specified in TS 28.531 [8].\n6.\tOptionally, if it is indicated in the request to notify the VAL server/consumer before performing the AppLayer-NS-LCM, the NSCE sends the network slice LCM recommendation(s) with network slice information to VAL server, to see whether takes the recommendation(s) or not.\n7.\tOptionally, the VAL server sends the response to NSCE server.\n8.\tBased on decision made by VAL server or NSCE server, the NSCE server sends the network slice LCM request to the OAM.\n9.\tAccording to the corresponding operation(s) result, the NSCE server sends the response to the VAL server.\n",

                            "text_content": "Figure 9.5.2.1.1 illustrates the procedure of VAL server policy provisioning from the VAL server to the NSCE server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice profile/slice services which VAL server is using.\nThe figure depicts a server policy provisioning process for a VAL (Value-Aware Load Balancer) in a 5G network. The process involves defining the server policy, setting up the load balancing algorithm, and configuring the load balancing parameters. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the process, including the creation of a new server policy, the selection of the load balancing algorithm, and the configuration of the load balancing parameters. The figure is a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.1: VAL server policy provisioning\n1.\tVAL server sends VAL server policy provisioning request to NSCE server. The request contains the policy, VAL server ID, Default policy indication, and S-NSSAI. Optionally, the request contains the indicator of policy harmonization.\nThe VAL server can request the NSCE server to mark the provisioned policy as the default policy using the Default policy indication. The default policy should serve as a VAL server policy for the slices provisioned without any policy. Either the policy or default policy indication can be provided by the VAL server.\nThe VAL server policy is in form of a policy profile which contains list of trigger events associated with the parameters and expected actions. It contains priority and scheduling information with pre-emption capability for the policies. The scheduling information schedules the policy by defining the schedule (start and end time) for the policy. The pre-emption capability provides another, already successfully provisioned policy to pre-empt the scheduled policy in the scheduled period.\nThe supported policies are:\n-\tBased on monitored performance metric from OAM, when the max number of PDU sessions or max number of UE is reached, trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on monitored Network Slice load from NSACF, when the number of PDU sessions or number of UE exceeds the threshold, trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on monitored Network Slice load predictions from NWDAF, when Network Slice load predictions (Predicted Number of PDU Session establishments at the Network Slice) exceeds the threshold with high confidence, trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on the monitored the time period, when getting to a certain time period (e.g. summer vacation, spring festival etc.), trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on the monitored time period, when getting to a certain time period, trigger the slice modification based on the expected QoS per UE. QoS is mapped/calculated by NSCE to specific parameters of the slice such as the dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet, delayTolerance, dLLatency, uLLatency.\n2.\tThe NSCE server checks whether the policy is conflict with the MNO policies or NSPP. One criterion is to translate the network slice parameters in the service profile to see whether it is conflict with that in the VAL provided policy. If policy harmonization is not requested and policies conflict then the request could be rejected. The NSCE server also checks the validity of the policy (policy is valid for the specified time period or until the specified threshold count of trigger events is achieved) to avoid a ping-pong effect of slice modification. If the policy is invalid, the request could be rejected.\n3.\tIf the policy harmonization is requested, the NSCE server can harmonize the policy as per clause 9.5.2.1.4 and this may result in the changes to the current VAL server policy under provisioning.\n4.\tNSCE server sends the VAL server policy provisioning response to the VAL server to indicate whether the request is successful or not. If it is successful, policy ID is provided to VAL server.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.2-1 illustrates the VAL server policy update procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice profile/slice services that the VAL server is using.\n2.\tThe VAL server has created policies in NSCE server using the procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.\n\nThe figure depicts a server policy update for a VAL (Value-Aware Load Balancer) system. The update is represented by a series of lines and arrows, indicating the flow of data and the changes made to the policy. The figure shows the server's response to a request, with the update being the most significant change, as indicated by the arrow pointing to the \"1\" in the policy update column. The figure also includes a legend to explain the different colors and symbols used in the update, which helps to understand the update's impact on the server's behavior.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.2-1: VAL server policy update\n1.\tVAL server sends VAL server policy update request to NSCE server. The request shall contain the policy ID and policy modification details for updating the policy in the NSCE server. The request can update the existing default policy or specify a new default policy for the mentioned slice in the request. The policy update procedure can update the scheduling and pre-emption information for the policy.\n2.\tThe NSCE server checks whether the policy is conflict with the MNO policies or NSPP.\n3.\tIf authorized, the NSCE server can harmonize the policy as per clause 9.5.2.1.4 and this may result in the changes to the current VAL server policy under update process.\n4.\tIf the VAL server is authorized to update the VAL server policy, the NSCE server checks the modification with existing policies to avoid conflict and provides the response to the VAL server.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.3-1 illustrates the VAL server policy delete procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice profile/slice services that the VAL server is using.\n2.\tThe VAL server has created one or more policies in NSCE server using the procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.\n\nThe figure depicts a server policy delete operation in a 5G network, with the VAL server being the primary focus. The operation involves deleting a specific policy from the server, which is crucial for managing network resources and ensuring efficient use of resources. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, highlighting the steps involved in the deletion, such as selecting the policy to be deleted, entering the policy ID, and confirming the deletion. The figure also includes a description of the server policy, including its name, type, and any other relevant information. Overall, the figure serves as a useful tool for understanding and implementing server policy deletion in a 5G network.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.3-1: VAL server policy delete\n1.\tVAL server sends VAL server policy delete request to NSCE server. The request contains the policy ID, and optionally default policy indication. The default policy indicates the update of the default policy in the case of a delete request for the default policy. The policy delete procedure can be used to delete one or more policies.\n2.\tIf the VAL server is authorized to delete the VAL server policy, the NSCE server deletes the policy. In the case of a default policy delete request, the NSCE server first updates the default policy with the policy mentioned in the delete request and then deletes the old default policy. The NSCE server reports the outcome of the deletion of the requested policy with policy ID and priority for the new default policy.\nPolicy harmonization is to make sure the VAL server Policy (from VAL Provider/ slice customer/ASP) is compatible with the MNO policies and NSCE service provider policy for the same service or slice. The policy harmonization could be requested through the policy provisioning/update service.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.4-1 illustrates the procedure for policy harmonization.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE service provider policy (NSPP) and MNO policy is available at the NSCE Server.\n2.\tThe VAL server is authorized to receive NSCE services.\nThe figure depicts a policy harmonization process, illustrating the steps involved in integrating multiple policies to achieve a unified policy. The process is visually represented by a series of interconnected lines, each representing a step in the harmonization process. The figure is labeled with the figure number and the corresponding policy number, providing a clear reference for the viewer.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.4-1: Policy harmonization\n1.\tWhen receiving the policy provisioning, or policy update request, and the result of policy check turn out the policy is conflict, the policy harmonization is triggered.\n2.\tThe NSCE server determines parameters harmonizing the policy, if previously authorized.\n3.\tNSCE server sends the VAL server a notification providing parameters values that allow the policies to be harmonized. Then the VAL server would decide whether to accept the provided optional parameters values. If they are accepted, the VAL server may invoke VAL server policy provisioning/ VAL server policy update procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1, 9.5.2.1.2 with harmonized parameters values.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.5-1 illustrates the VAL server policy usage reporting data procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice profile/slice services which VAL server is using.\n2.\tThe VAL server has created one or more policies using in the NSCE server the procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.\nThe figure depicts a server policy usage reporting data for a VAL server, showing the usage of different policies and their corresponding data usage.\nFigure 9.5.2.1.5-1: VAL server policy usage reporting data\n1.\tVAL server sends VAL server policy usage reporting data subscribe request to NSCE server. The request contains the policy ID, reporting interval, and the required duration of the data.\n2.\tThe NSCE server responds with a VAL server policy usage reporting data subscribe response message indicating the success or failure of the subscription.\n3.\tThe NSCE server reports the policy reporting data containing the number of times the policy has been used and the duration for which the policy was active in the requested duration and details of the preemption of policies. The reporting interval enables the periodic reporting of the requested report.\nFigure 9.5.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure of network slice optimization based on VAL server policy.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE server is authorized to get network slice management data notification from OAM, and/or NWDAF via NEF.\n2.\tThe VAL server is authorized to the NSCE server for network slice optimization.\n3.\tThere is enough network capacity when the expected action is to expand the network slice.\n4.\tThe VAL server policy has been pre-configured on the VAL server.\n5.\tThe VAL server policy has been provided to the NSCE server as specified in clause 9.5.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a network slice optimization based on the VAL server policy, which is a key component in network slicing. It illustrates the process of selecting the optimal network slice for a given network slice optimization policy, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.\nFigure 9.5.2.2-1: Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy\n1.\tVAL server sends network slice optimization subscription request to NSCE server. The request contains the policy ID indicating the different policies. Optionally the request contains the Secondary policy ID indicating the fallback policy to be used for the failed network slice optimization. The NSCE server retries the network slice optimization using a Secondary policy in the case of a failed optimization.\n2.\tThe NSCE server translates the trigger event to service API(s) with necessary parameters, and subscribe to the related service if needed.\n-\tTo get the monitored performance metric from OAM, the notifyThresholdCrossing as defined in TS 28.532[7] clause 11.3.1.3 which is filled in with corresponding S-NSSAI in objectInstance could be used.\n-\tTo obtain the Network Slice load predictions from NWDAF, the NSCE server subscribes to the NWDAF prediction by invoking Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe or Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch  as defined in TS 23.288[4] clauses 6.1.1.2, and 6.1.1.2.\n-\tTo monitor the Network Slice load (e.g. the number of UEs or the number of PDU Sessions) from NSACF, the NSCE server subscribes to the NSACF by using the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe Request or Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe_Request as defined in clause 4.15.3.2.10 of TS 23.502 [12], and the APIs defined in clause 6.2 of TS 29.536 [13] can be utilized.\n-\tTo monitor the time period, the NSCE server setup the timer.\n3.\tNSCE server sends the network slice optimization subscription response to the VAL server to confirm the subscription of network slice optimization.\n4.\tUpon receiving the notification which indicating the trigger event is met, i.e., the monitored information reaches the threshold or specific time period is arrived, the NSCE server performs the expected action by triggering the slice modification as specified in the VAL server policy. The network slice modification could be triggered by consuming the Network Slice Provisioning service with the modifyMOIAttributes operation as specified in TS 28.531 [8]. The OAM responds back to NSCE server that the requested slice modification was successful or not. The slice modification requests contain the parameters need to be updated to fit the requirement of network slice (e.g., scale in or scale out the network slice capability), including at least one of the following, uLThptPerSlice, dLThptPerSlice, dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet, delayTolerance, dLLatency, uLLatency, maximum number of UEs, maximum number of PDU session as specified in TS 28.541 [10].\nNOTE 1:\tThe slice modification could be done by application layer network slice lifecycle management as defined in clause 9.4.\n5.\tThe NSCE server provides a network slice optimization notification to the VAL server. The successful response optionally includes the Optimization time and the Enforced policy ID. The optimization time indicates the time the NSCE server has taken to optimize the slice. The Enforced policy ID indicates which secondary policy is used by the NSCE server for slice optimization in the case of a failed attempt for network slice optimization.\nNOTE 2:\tThere is no expectation to have constant and exact mapping between slice configuration parameters and actual traffic load of the same slice.\nFigure 9.5.2.3-1 illustrates the Network slice optimization report retrieval procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice profile/slice services that the VAL server is using.\n2.\tThe VAL server has the created policies using the procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.\n3.\tThe VAL server has subscribed for the network slice optimization using the procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.2.\nThe figure depicts a network slice optimization report retrieval process, showing the steps involved in retrieving a report from a network slice. The report is organized into different sections, each representing a different step in the process. The figure includes a flowchart that illustrates the steps, such as selecting the report, retrieving the report, and analyzing the results. The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different colors and symbols used in the flowchart. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the network slice optimization report retrieval process.\nFigure 9.5.2.3-1: Network slice optimization report retrieval\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a Network slice optimization report request to the NSCE server. The request shall contain the subscription ID, optimization result window, and optional elements like optimization result filters, sorting rules, and result size. The VAL server creates a filter using the optimization result filter for the NSCE server requesting filtered successful or failed responses. The VAL server can create additional sorting rules for the NSCE server to request sorted results based on optimization time or policy ID or slice optimization event time in ascending or descending order. The result size indicates the number of results or responses for the report.\n2.\tThe NSCE server provides the report to the VAL server as per the request of the VAL server containing optimization response, optimization time, policy ID, and Enforced Policy information.\n",

Therefore, a new feature could be a managed entity, a MnS or management API, any software, hardware, or other functionality – for example, new technology support, new coverage area, new network slice type or instance, new NFs or new network slice subnet type or instance. To be able to utilise capabilities/features of the management system the applications must be made aware of existence of such features and capabilities. All MD features/capabilities come with a pre-configured exposure, where this can be configured by the operator for a given slice. This exposure is used to decide which application can see which information regarding the capability/feature. Exposure refers to the permissions that the 3rd party entity has gained over its use of the management service, e.g., the ability to read, or execute or modify or delete can be considered as different sorts of exposure.\nThe first procedure (9.6.2.1) provides the NSCE server support for translating the VAL server request to a MnS requirement and the exposure of service/management data related to his request. The second procedure (9.6.2.2) supports the notification to the VAL server, based on a new/modified MnS / capability for a target slice.\n",

Then, the OAM/MnS registry derives the details to be exposed based on the NSCE server/VAL server permissions and provides the list of MnS for the given slice and the access details via the NSCE server to the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.\n2.\tThe NSCE server is trusted by the OAM, and a contract has been signed between the MNO and NSCE server provider to allow OAM interfaces and/or network slice information exposure.\n3.\tMnS registry at OAM is aware of the allowed MnS and the permissions for a given slice.\nFigure 9.6.2.1-1 illustrates a solution for the MnS discovery support.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a 6.2.1-1-1 network, highlighting the discovery support for MnS (Molecule-Sensitive Nucleoside-Sensitive Nucleotidyltransferase) molecules. The network is composed of various components, including the discovery support, which is crucial for the accurate identification and isolation of MnS molecules. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the network's structure and components, making it easier to understand the network's functionality and the role of the discovery support in MnS molecule identification.\nFigure 9.6.2.1-1: MnS discovery support\nThe steps of this procedure are as follows:\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a Management Service Discovery subscribe request message to NSCE server to indicate a requirement for receiving the expected exposure capability type and the related permissions for a target slice or for a given VAL application.\n2.\tThe NSCE server sends a response to the subscription request, indicating a success or failure of the subscription request.\nNOTE 1:\tIf CAPIF is used, the API interactions for the MnS discovery subscription shall be compliant with CAPIF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222.\n3.\tThe NSCE server translates the requirement based on the subscription, and in particular identifies the needed exposure capability type and translates it to a MnS exposure requirement. Such translation of the requirement includes the mapping to a list of MnSs (specified in TS 28.532) which are needed for the given slice and VAL server permissions.\n4.\tThe NSCE server coordinates with the 5GS and discovers the related network service(s), by triggering the MnS service discovery as specified in TS 28.537[9], clause 5.2.1.3. In particular, NSCE server acts as MnS discovery service consumer (for all MnS needed for a target slice based on VAL requirement) requests from MnS discovery service producer(s) at OAM the discovery of MnS information for the MnS related to the target slice or VAL application. The 5GS, MnS discovery service producer(s) sends the discovery result including related exposure information such as management service identifier, management service information and management service producer information to the NSCE server.\nNOTE 2:\tThe actual connectivity in step 4 (e.g., exposure of MnS via CAPIF or EGMF) follows the mechanism defined in SA5.\n5.\tThe NSCE server sends a management service discovery subscription notify message to provide the service/management data based on step 4, including the list of MnS and the corresponding exposure details to the VAL server.\nThis procedure includes the case when a new/modified MnS is deployed at the MD for the given slice, and the OAM/MnS registry provides this information directly to VAL server (assuming that VAL server has registered to the MD).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tVAL server is registered to NSCE server based on clause 9.2.\n2.\tNSCE server has subscribed to OAM / MnS discovery service registry.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of an OAM-triggered new/modified MnS discovery process in a network. It illustrates the steps involved in identifying new or modified MnS (Molecule-Specific-Protein) molecules in a network. The figure includes key components such as the OAM (Optical Activity Modulation) trigger, the new/modified MnS molecules, and the network topology. The figure is crucial for understanding the process of identifying new or modified MnS molecules in a network and its impact on network performance.\nFigure 9.6.2.2-1: OAM-triggered new/modified MnS discovery\n1.\tThe MnS registry may discover new or modified MnS in the 3GPP MD. Such changes may be due to new/modified management service producers, new managed entities (such as new radio, new technology or new NFs), new/modified technical support (such as support in a new geography or coverage area), availability of new management data, e.g., related to slice performance. An example procedure related to the addition of a new MnS producer is provided in TS 28.537 clause 5.2.1.1.\nThe MnS discovery service producer when capturing new or modified capability (e.g. new MnS producer) related to the target slice or VAL application identifies the NSCE server which needs to be informed (based on the subscription) on the new/modified capability and derives the details to be exposed to the VAL server (via the NSCE server). Then, the MnS registry sends to the NSCE server the new / modified MnS.\nNOTE:\tThe actual connectivity in step 4 (e.g., exposure of MnS via CAPIF or EGMF) follows the mechanism defined in SA5.\n2.\tThe NSCE server determines the VAL server(s) that needs to be notified on the new or modified MnS / MD capability based on their registrations. Then, NSCE server generates and sends a notification with the required information to be provided to the VAL server.\n3.\tThe information on the discovered new/modified MnS is sent as a management service discovery notification message from the NSCE server to VAL server.\n",

The required end-to-end network slice related data performance data are indicated by Perflist IE as described in table 9.7.3.2-1.\n2.\tThe NSCE server shall check if the VAL server is authorized to request the network slice performance and analytics data monitoring job creation.\n3.\tNSCE server determines the requested data needed to collect from network side and collects the performance measurements and analytics data of network slice from 5GS. For OAM system, the APIs defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[7] is utilized, e.g., packet delay, radio resource utilization. For CN functions, the APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288 [4] is utilized, e.g., slice load level related network data analytics, slice load level related network data analytics.\n4.\tOptionally, NSCE server retrieves the KQI data of services, the QoE data and the end user’s information from NSCE client.\nNOTE 1: The Data collection from NSCE client follows the mechanism defined in SA4 EVEX in TS 26.531 clause 5.6.\nNOTE 2: How the collected data is stored in the NSCE server is implementation based.\n5.\tNSCE server responds to VAL server to inform the VAL server if the monitoring request is succeed.\nFor network slice related performance and analytics result subscription and report, the VAL server triggers the procedure by sending the network slice related performance and analytics report subscription to NSCE server, the NSCE server reports the performance and analytics report after the subscription is succeed, as Figure 9.7.2.2-1 shows:\nThe figure depicts a network slice related performance and analytics report subscription and report, showcasing various metrics such as network slice performance, analytics, and subscription status.\nFigure 9.7.2.2-1: Network slice related performance and analytics report subscription and report\n1.\tThe VAL server subscribes to the required performance and analytics report.\n2.\tThe NSCE server response to the VAL server to indicate whether the report is successfully generated and ready.\n3.\tNSCE server correlates the performance data of network slice instance, the analytics data of group of UEs and the KQI/QoE data to generate the performance data and analytics data report as required by VAL server.\n4.\tNSCE server sends the performance report Notify to VAL server if the report is ready.\nBased on preferred performance report request from the vertical applications, the consolidated performance report for dedicated service from multiple slices (PNI-NPN slice and PLMN slice of one network) can be offered to trusted third-party AF.\nFigure 9.7.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure of multiple slices coordinated performance and analytics report service from VAL server to NSCE server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with PLMN 5GC or OAM system to handle slices of PLMN and its PNI-NPNs.\n2.\tPNI-NPNs are deployed as network slices of the PLMN.\n3.\tNSCE server has subscribed for MDE and NWDAF analytics for the managed slices of PLMN and PNI-NPN.\n\nThe figure depicts a consolidated report process for multiple slices performance and analytics, with a focus on performance metrics, data analysis, and insights.\nFigure 9.7.2.3 -1: Multiple slices performance and analytics consolidated report process\n1.\tThe VAL server initiates multiple slices related performance and analytics consolidated report request towards the NSCE server. The request includes VAL server ID, VAL service ID. The message also includes application key performance indicator (such as end-to-end delay, throughput, etc.) list and monitoring period.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the VAL server to manage the network slice QoS monitoring report, the NSCE server makes authentication and authorization of the VAL server and if VAL server is not authorized, the NSCE server replies with failure response.\n3.\tThe NSCE server makes mapping from application ID that received from VAL server to slice identities (S-NSSAIs allocated in each network) and retrieves the PNI-NPN slice related status information from MDE/NWDAF, i.e. analytics data specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [21] and TS 23.288 [4].\n4.\tThe NSCE server retrieves the PLMN slice related performance information from MDE/NWDAF. The services of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3 of TS 23.288 [4] and analytics data as specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [21] can be utilized.\n5.\tThe NSCE server verifies and analyses analytics data of network slice instances that is received from MDE/NWDAF about both PNI-NPN and PLMN slices, then NSCE server makes consolidated performance report among different kinds of network slices in specific period of time/location zone.\n6.\tThe NSCE server sends the multiple slices related performance and analytics consolidated report response towards VAL server including application key performance indicator (such as end-to-end delay, throughput, etc. ) list and monitoring period.\n",

Such query may be in form of a request/response and include:\na.\tS-NSCE server interacting with 5GC to query the UE specific information (location, UE connection capabilities) as well as network conditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [4]).\nb.\tS-NSCE server may also interact with OAM to query on the target slice availability and the up-to-date configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531 [8], 5.1.12) at the target service area and measurements for the slice at the target area.\n4.\tS-NSCE server evaluates whether new NSCE service area supports slice #1 and if slice #1 offers similar performance in target area.\n5.\tIf the current slice doesn't fulfil these requirements, S-NSCE sends to the T-NSCE server (covering the target area) a service continuity negotiation request (including the VAL application service continuity requirement and optionally a proposed action) to negotiate on the trigger action.\n6.\tT-NSCE server determines the need for a slice lifecycle change at the target area and translates this to a trigger action. This trigger action can be based on the proposed action in step 5 and can be a requested slice modification or the slice #1 creation/instantiation at the target area (this may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and use slice #1, so it may be beneficial to create slice #1 at the target area).\n7.\tT-NSCE server sends to the S-NSCE server a service continuity negotiation response including the determined trigger action.\n8.\tThe S- or T-NSCE server may send the trigger action as a slice modification trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM (e.g. slice modification for network slice) to extend slice availability to the target service area based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group mobility. As response to the trigger action, the provisioning MnS producer provides a slice modification trigger response to the corresponding NSCE server with a positive or negative result.\n9.\tAfter the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in step 5), the S-NSCE server sends a notification to the VAL server and optionally to the VAL client via S-NSCE client\n10.\tIf the NSCE client needs to be remapped to different NSCE server (due to the expected change of UE location), the NSCE client establishes a new connection with T-NSCE and terminates the one with S-NSCE (in case of subscription-based interaction), or in case of request-based interaction, it updates the mapping at the client side, and maintains the new NSCE server address / ID for the target NSCE area.\n",

This allows for the efficient allocation of network resources and the seamless operation of the VAL application.\nFigure 9.11.2.1-1: Network slice adaptation for VAL application\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a network slice adaptation request to the NSCE server for the VAL application (and the VAL UEs within the VAL application). This request may be in the form of exact requested network slice (and optionally DNN) for all the VAL UEs of the VAL application; or indication that the VAL application needs to be remapped to a different network slice (and optionally DNN).

In this feature, the NSCE server initially receives an expected/predicted UE location/mobility change request outside a PLMN1 slice service area for one or more UEs within the VAL application session (e.g. such session can be a V2X session). Then, the NSCE server checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC) whether the serving slice is available and can offer the same performance at the target PLMN. The NSCE server evaluates the need for a slice modification (e.g. a slice lifecycle related trigger change). Based on this decision/recommendation, it provides the action to the OAM of PLMN2 proactively, before UE mobility happens.\n",

The VAL server is subscribed to and received prediction of UE location change from PLMN1 to PLMN2 in advance before the actual event.\nThe preceding context and figure name suggest that the content of the telecommunication figure is related to network management and service continuity. The figure depicts a network setup with a VAL server sending an application service continuity requirement request to a NSCE server, indicating potential issues with network connectivity or service availability. The output should be concise and technical, focusing on the key elements of the figure and the implications of the request.Figure 9.13.2-1: Predictive Inter-PLMN slice service continuity\n1.\tThe VAL server sends to NSCE server an Inter-PLMN application service continuity requirement request due to predicted/expected UE or group UE mobility from source service area of slice1 in PLMN1 to a target service area covered by a different slice service area in slice#2/PLMN2.\nNOTE:\tSuch UE predicted mobility at the VAL server can be available before the event based on UE mobility analytics received by NWDAF or can be predicted by the VAL layer (VAL server or VAL UE).\n2.\tNSCE server sends an Inter-PLMN application service continuity requirement response to the VAL server as positive or negative acknowledgement depending on its capability to provide such service serving both areas/slices in both PLMNs and available resources.\n3.\tNSCE server determines to query the underlying 5G system on the slice availability and conditions at the target service area/slice2/PLMN2 (based on step 1 requirement). Such query may be in form of a request/response and include:\na.\tNSCE server interacting with 5GC/PLMN2 to query the UEs specific information (location, UEs connection capabilities) as well as network conditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [4]).\nb.\tNSCE server may also interact with OAM/PLMN2 to query on the target slice availability and the up-to-date configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531 [8], 5.1.12) at the target service area and measurements for the slice at the target area.\n4.\tNSCE server determines the need for a slice lifecycle change at the slice target area and translates this to a trigger action. This trigger action can be based on the outcome of step 3 and can be a requested slice modification (slice2/PLMN2) or creation/instantiation of new slice at the target area (this may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and the requested slice2 is missing in the target area).\n5.\tThe NSCE server may send the trigger action as a slice modification trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM/PLMN2 (e.g. slice modification for network slice) to extend slice availability to the target service area based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group mobility. As response to the trigger action, the provisioning MnS producer provides a slice modification trigger response with a positive or negative result.\n6.\tAfter the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in step 5), the NSCE server sends a notification to the VAL server and optionally to the VAL client containing the positive or negative result from step5.\n7. \tIf big number of UEs is migrating from PLMN1 to PLMN2, there might be a need to further modify/reduce the respective slice resources of PLMN1. NSCE sends trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM/PLMN1 (e.g. slice modification for network slice) to decrease slice availability to the source area after the UEs have migrated.\n",

And network diagnostics is of key importance that helps with scanning, diagnosing and identifying problems within a network. Diagnostics includes gathering data and continuously providing sufficient fault diagnosis results that characterize the quality of the network connections and services. Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters ensures a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying network connectivity, performance and other related problems. Also, the alarm data from different sources (e.g., OAM, VAL server, NSCE client) can be used to help the third-party to diagnose the fault problem of the services, locate the fault causes, and to be aware of the potential fault. In TS 28.545 [23], the fault supervision management services are standardized by which the alarm of the network slice instance from network resource aspects can be subscribed and reported. This alarm information together with the application function's fault report and communication service related knowledge can be utilized by the NSCE to diagnose the cause of the service performance deterioration, locate the fault of the communication services, and expose the fault report to the third-party.\nFor example, if the status of the required communication is not correct, the SEAL/NSCE derives this alarm information from application functions. In this case, it is the SEAL/NSCE's responsibility to detect whether this fault is caused by the 5GS network or not and exposed the fault report to the third-party. If it is, then the SEAL/NSCE may inform the management functions the location of the fault and ask for the maintenance of the managed functions to clear the fault.\nThis service provides a possible procedure to illustrate the network slice fault management capability exposed by NSCE server. The performance data and alarm data from multiple sources is helpful to characterize the quality of the network connection.\n",

It illustrates the process of modifying slices in a network slicing system, which is crucial for managing and optimizing network resources. The figure includes key components such as the network slicing system, the distributed NSCE server, and the predictive slice modification feature. This system allows for the efficient management of network resources and the optimization of network performance.\nFigure 9.15.2.1-1: Support for predictive slice modification in distributed NSCE server deployments\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a subscription to NSCE server to subscribe the fault diagnosis of the applications and networks. This request may be triggered by the errors of the applications detected by the VAL server itself, or the VAL server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report subscribing to the NSCE.\n2.\tNSCE server sends the response of the subscription to VAL server.\n3.\tOptionally, on receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server subscribes the performance data of network slice from 5GS. For OAM system, the APIs defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[7] is utilized. For CN functions, the APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288[4] can be utilized.\nThe analytics data defined in clause 6.3 to clause 6.14, TS 23.288[4], network slice instance related performance data defined in clause 5, TS 28.552[19] and network analytics data in clause 8.3 and clause 8.4 TS 28.104[21] exposed by OAM system may be acquired. Also, the analytics result of slice-specific performance and slice usage analytics defined in TS 23.436[26] can be utilized.\n4.\tNSCE server subscribes the alarms of network slice instances from OAM system via the procedures defined in clause 6.1, TS 28.545[23], and the alarms are defined in clause 4.1.1.1, TS 32.111-1 [24], e.g., the fault of communication, environmental, equipment, processing error, QoS for device/resource/file/functionality/smallest.\n5.\tNSCE server may subscribe the alarm information (e.g., the 5GS network is not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the service's problem) collected by NSCE client if possible. The information collected by the NSCE client depends on the third-parties' requirements and implementation.\n6.\tNSCE client report the requested fault information to NSCE server.\nNote: The collection of fault data from NSCE client follows the mechanism defined in EVEX in SA4.\n7.\tEvery time the notifications from the OAM, NSCE client or ADAEs are received, NSCE server correlates this data, diagnoses the causes of the fault of the applications or services by analysing the fault information from different sources and prepares report for the VAL to be notified about the respective fault event. For example, the RAN function of the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application, for a certain time duration, the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by Service Availability Failure Events, and in the RAN function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time duration, then the environment fault may be the root cause of the Service Availability Failure and should be prioritized to be solved. The fault may be identified with \"critical\", \"major\", \"minor\", \"ignore\" to show its prioritization.\n8.\tIf the NSCE server detects that the application/service error (reported from NSCE client) is caused by the 5GS, the VAL server may send the fault diagnosis report to OAM system to indicate the server fault which causes the application/service failure by utilizing the NSCE-OAM interface.\nNOTE:\tThe APIs utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to OAM will re-utilize the fault management services in TS 28.532[7] exposed by EGMF as defined in TS 28.533[25].\n9.\tNSCE server send a notification to VAL server with the fault diagnostics report prepared in step 7.\n",

However, they are not able to guarantee that all the potential factors will be considered to generate the optimal slice requirements parameters on the first try.\nIn some cases, there may be some unforeseen exceptions (e.g., unexpected traffic changes) and the current configured slice requirements parameters are not able to fulfil the verticals requirements (e.g., more resources are required to address the exceptions), the VAL client may also suffer unsatisfied experience. Or in some other cases, when the service is executed on the required slice, the slice may not fully match the service real-time running conditions, for example, maybe only 60% of the slice resource is used to support the service, and rest of the slice resource is always idle, or the slice resource is insufficient due to under-provisioning.\nHence, NSCE is able to provide the capability of comparing the QoS achievement status together with the OAM QoS data versus real customer QoS data (e.g., Mean Opinion Score) collected from VAL client to check whether the existing QoS/Slice related data is able to satisfy the VAL clients and send periodically alignment notifications to VAL server for the slice requirements.\n",

For this scenario, if the distributed deployed NSCE wants to access the NEF/NWDAF/NSACF services or to receive policies from OAM, it needs to interact to the global NSCE.\nA further use case could be that some NSCE services (e.g. MnS discovery) are locally provided to VAL servers (for example as a micro-service), whereas other capabilities are provided for the whole PLMN area. So, the distributed NSCE includes a subset of capabilities which are edge native. The local deployment of such capabilities can allow for more efficient services to the VAL servers (e.g. for QoS verification, the edge deployed NSCE can receive more timely KQI/QoE measurements and can process them locally before triggering an event).\n",
