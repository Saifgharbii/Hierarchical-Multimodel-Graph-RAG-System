                            "text_content": "The MC gateway UE offers access to the MC server for several MC clients (see Figure 7.1.2-1). The MC clients can be either located in the MC gateway UE or in non-3GPP devices connected to the MC gateway UE via non-3GPP access.\nFor non-3GPP devices which can host an MC client, the MC gateway UE enables connectivity to the MC server. For non-3GPP devices which cannot host the MC client, the MC gateway UE hosts the instantiation of the MC client for the non-3GPP device.\nThe figure depicts the functional architecture of a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. It shows the role of the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers in the network. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the importance of redundancy paths for failover reliability.\nFigure 7.1.2.1-1: Functional architecture\nThe MC gateway UE provides MC service capabilities and 3GPP access capabilities using 3GPP network credentials for authorized access with an MC server.\nFor non-3GPP devices which cannot host MC clients, the MC gateway UE shall control the access and manage the communication between the non-3GPP devices and the MC server. Upon reception of connection  authorisation request from a non-3GPP device, the MC gateway UE instantiates an MC client, acting on behalf of the non-3GPP device, to provide the requested services (e.g. emergency call, group calls, short data messages services, etc.). The communication interworking and the definition of associated procedures between the MC client (initiated at the MC gateway UE) and the non-3GPP devices is out of scope of this document.\nNOTE 1:\tMC clients residing on a non-3GPP device cannot use UICC credentials to perform authorisation with the 3GPP transport system.\nFor MC clients getting MC service access via the MC gateway UE, the MC gateway UE forwards (unmodified) signalling and media from the individual MC clients to the MC server and vice versa.\nIf the MC service user on the non-3GPP device utilizes multiple MC services simultaneously, the MC service access may also be provided by one or multiple MC gateway UEs (see figure 7.1.2.1-2) while restricting each MC service to one MC gateway UE (e.g. MCPTT via MC gateway UE1, MCData via MC gateway UE2).\nThe figure depicts a scenario where multiple MC gateway UE (Multi-Access Edge Computing) devices are simultaneously using a single non-3GPP device, illustrating the potential for edge computing to be used in various network scenarios.\nFigure 7.1.2.1-2: Simultaneous multiple MC gateway UE use by a single non-3GPP device\nNOTE 2:\tEven not shown in the above figure, the same principle of simultaneous use of multiple MC gateway UEs is applied for non-3GPP devices which cannot host an MC client.\nFor application level signaling between the MC client on the non-3GPP device and the MC gateway UE a new reference point called CSC-GW is introduced. The MC gateway UE uses existing reference points (CSC-n) toward the MC server.\nThe figure depicts reference points for the 5G network, illustrating the various locations where signals are transmitted and received. These points are crucial for understanding the network's architecture and ensuring efficient signal propagation.\nFigure 7.1.2.2-1: Reference points\nThe reference points CSC-n belonging to the application plane and the reference points SIP-1 and HTTP-1 belonging to the signaling control plane are used by the MC client on the non-3GPP device towards the MC gateway UE and the MC gateway UE relays the application and control plane signaling further to the MC server.\nCSC-n, SIP-1 and HTTP-1 reference points are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].\nThe corresponding MCX-n reference points are specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [8].\nThe CSC-GW reference point, which exists between the MC gateway client and the MC gateway UE client residing on the non-3GPP device and the MC gateway UE server residing on the MC gateway UE, is used for connection authorisation of non-3GPP devices with an MC gateway UE. For connection authorisation, the connection authorisation request will be forwarded by the MC gateway UE server via the corresponding MC service client residing on the MC gateway UE (see clause 7.3.4). CSC-GW is also used to request the forwarding of the media from the MC gateway UE by the MC client (see figure 7.1.2.3-1) using corresponding identifiers, e.g. TMGI, applicable for multicast/broadcast-based communication.\nFor signalling, the MC clients utilize the allocated resources (default bearer for EPS or QoS flow in 5GS) between MC gateway UE and MC server. The MC gateway UE maps the signaling traffic between MC clients and MC server.\nOn the media plane a communication between the MC client on the non-3GPP device and is distributed both via non-3GPP access and via 3GPP access. Traffic from multiple MC clients may be transferred on the 3GPP access branch, depending on how many MC clients are served by the MC gateway UE. For that, the MC gateway UE has a media distribution function to relay the traffic on the non-3GPP access and the 3GPP access branch for unicast and multicast communications and multiple MC clients properly.\nThe figure depicts a media plane in a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The media plane is crucial for signal transmission, with key components including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, ensuring high-quality communication.\nFigure 7.1.2.3-1: Media plane\n",

The figure shows the MC gateway UE, which is the central device responsible for authorizing connections, and the connection authorisation process, which involves the MC gateway UE communicating with the network control center (NCC) to verify the identity of the user and ensure the connection is authorized. The figure also shows the connection authorisation process in a simplified form, with the MC gateway UE communicating with the NCC using a connection request message, which includes the user's identity and the network's response.\nFigure 7.2.5-1: Connection authorisation with the MC gateway UE\n1.\tThe MC client requests connection authorization with the MC gateway UE. The MC client of the MC service user provides the GW MC service ID.\n2.\tThe MC gateway UE performs an authorization check by using the provided GW MC service ID to verify that the MC service user is permitted to use the MC gateway UE to access an MC server.\nIn addition, the MC gateway UE checks whether:\n-\tthe requested MC service, as indicated by the GW MC service ID, is supported by the MC gateway UE;\n-\ta network status information is available, the MC gateway UE should check if the resources and network coverage are sufficient for the requested service at the current location for the specific MC client sending the connection authorization request;\n-\ta roaming scenario has been identified (e.g. switch between EPC and 5GC), then depending on operator policy, roaming agreements, and on national/regional regulatory requirements further check on the received request should be performed (e.g. a decision on how to handle the IP connectivity, the QoS Flows, etc.);\n-\tthe number of UEs present in a geographical area indicates that the maximum capacity is reached or a congestion status is occurred (i.e. in such situation pre-defined access control, access identities & access category rules will be used to handle the communication priority);\n-\tthe requested QoS can be provided under the current network operating conditions;\n-\ta release mismatch is identified between the MC gateway UE and MC client or has been identified between the MC gateway UE and the MC server.\nNOTE 2:\tThe authorization check mechanism is outside the scope of the present document. Further checks, for example. could be based on a pre-configured list of users who are expected to request connection authorization with the MC gateway UE.\n3.\tThe MC gateway UE sends the connection authorization response to the MC client.\nAfter successful connection with the MC gateway UE, the MC client has now access to an MC server and may continue with user authentication and service authorization.\nIf the MC service user wishes to have access to another MC service, the above procedure is repeated.

The MC service clients can be either located in the MC gateway UE or in non-3GPP devices connected to the MC gateway UE via non-3GPP access. Simultaneous sharing of an MC gateway UE by various MC service clients requires a relationship between the MC service identities used by the MC service clients with media streams passing the MC gateway UE towards the MC system to share the network transport resources of the MC gateway UE.\nIt is assumed that the MC service user behind the MC gateway UE has no 3GPP transport access credentials (i.e. no UICC), whereas the MC system relies on IMS identities (i.e. IMPUs/IMPIs) needed for authorisation with the IMS. In addition, in MC systems there exist a one-to-one correspondence of MC service IDs with IMPUs for enabling routing of signalling traffic between the MC service server and the MC service client.\nTaking the above into account two options are considered.\nOption 1 (see figure 7.4.2-1) relies on MC service IDs provided by the MC gateway UE. The MC service clients behind the MC gateway UE share the credentials from the IMS subscription of the MC gateway UE. The number of MC service clients behind the MC gateway UE is determined by the number of subscribed MC service IDs that are associated with the IMS subscription of the MC gateway UE.\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the MC gate way in an IMS subscription sharing scenario. It illustrates the flow of data between the MC gate and the UE's IMS subscription, highlighting the importance of efficient data transmission and management in the context of 5G networks.\nFigure 7.4.2-1: Sharing the MC gateway UE's IMS subscription\nOption 2 (see figure 7.4.2-2) relies on the use of the IMS Credentials (IMC) application specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4]. The MC service clients behind the MC gateway UE use their own IMS subscription and do not rely on the IMS subscription from the MC gateway UE. The number of MC service clients behind the MC gateway UE is independent from the number of subscribed MC service IDs that are associated with the IMS subscription of the MC gateway UE.\nThe figure depicts a network setup with independent IMS subscriptions, illustrating the use of multiple independent subscriptions to enhance network performance and reliability.\nFigure 7.4.2-2: Using independent IMS subscriptions\nBoth options support an unambiguous identification of MC service clients behind the MC gateway UE. Option 2 also has the degree of freedom that the user profiles associated with the devices behind the MC gateway UE are independent of the MC gateway user profile.\n",

Option 2 offers the degree of freedom that the user profiles used on the non -3GPP devices behind the MC gateway UE are independent from those of the MC gateway user profile. Whereas the pre-configuration of IMPUs for option 1 is not very flexible and sharing of IMPUs between different MC clients might have additional implications (e.g. managing of available IMPUs between MC clients). Option 2 seems not to have any significant drawbacks, has less implications regarding pre-configuration and is more future proof (e.g. parallel use of multiple MC gateway UEs).\nOption 2 is selected as way forward, i.e. on MC clients capable to host MC service clients separate IMS subscriptions are used, while for non-3GPP devices which cannot host MC client(s) the use IMS subscription(s) provided by the serving MC gateway UE(s) is applied.\n",

The MC gateway UE stores the correlation between the GW MC service ID and the IP address used by the MC client once it receives the connection authorisation request. The assigned IP address of the MC gateway UE (used for 3GPP transport) is used to forward the connection authorization request from the MC client to the MC server, since the MC client IP address is unknown to the MC system. The connection authorization response is sent back accordingly from the MC server towards the MC gateway UE, which then forwards it to the corresponding MC client. Subsequent procedures initiated by the MC client, i.e. SIP registration, user authentication and service authorisation, would also use the MC gateway UE's IP address. The MC gateway UE's IP address would then also be used in the case of local connection authorization (see clause 7.2).\nThe drawback of the approach is when the IP address of the MC gateway UE changes, all active MC clients would be affected with their communication with the MC server.\nThe figure depicts a 7.2-1 configuration of a MC client using a MC gateway UE's IP address. MC clients are used to connect to the MC gateway, which is responsible for routing and forwarding traffic.

In addition, it requires a correlation between the MC client's IP address and the MC gateway UE's IP address as the next hop. The advantage would be the independence between an MC gateway UE IP address and the MC client IP address.\nThe figure depicts a 7.3-1 configuration of a MC client, which uses a local IP address to communicate with the network. This configuration is essential for ensuring secure and reliable communication within the network.\nFigure 7.7.3-1: MC client uses local IP address\nThe approach below is referred to as routing behind the UE on an APN/DNN basis enables the routing of packets to IP addresses that do not belong to the PDN session or PDU session, but exist behind it. The routing behind (framed routing) the UE functionality enables the routing of packets to IP addresses that do not belong to the PDN/PDU session of the UE. The IP address of the MC client associated with the non-3GPP device can be different than the MC GW UE address.\nThe approach of framed routing (3GPP TS 23.501 [10], clause 5.6.14) in which the prefix, i.e. IPv6 prefix, of the route to the corresponding host IP adress is marked behind the UE.

The MC gateway UE must provide additional functions for routing and address mapping. Another disadvantage is that when the MC gateway UE changes its IP address, all MC clients behind the MC gateway UE are always affected. The use of the MC gateway UE IP address also requires the detection of characteristics unique to a MC client, e.g. port mapping, in order to be able to differentiate between the MC clients.\nThe second approach, using framed routing, enables the MC clients to act independently of the MC gateway UE IP address. This also eliminates the necessary IP address mapping function in the MC gateway UE and any type of traffic, CP and UP, is uniquely associated with the MC client's IP address.

The MC Gateway UE uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.\n5.\tThe MC Gateway UE that enters or is in the service area of at least one announced TMGI notifies to the MC client that it can receive data over MBMS by sending the MC GW MBMS listening status report. The MC GW MBMS listening status report also contains the details of the non-3GPP transport communication related parameters. The MC Gateway UE may choose to send the details of existing communication channel information as part of Non 3GPP transport channel establishment parameters IE if existing communication channel can be reused.\n6.\tThe MC client establishes the communication channel with the MC gateway UE based on the parameters received in step 5 to receive the MC service data from the MC gateway UE, if these parameters are not referring to any of the already established communication channel. The MC Gateway UE forwards the MC service data it received over the MBMS bearer from the MC service server to the MC client over this communication channel.\n7.\tThe MC Client sends the MBMS Listening Status Report to the MC Server indicating that it is able to receive the media over MBMS.\nWhenever the MC client detects that the data received from MC service server is MapGroupToBearer message and if the MC client participates in the group session or communication identified by the MapGroupToBearer message then it should inform the details contained in the MapGroupToBearer message to MC gateway UE. When the association of group call, MBMS bearer and the MC GW service ID of the MC client is known to the MC gateway UE, it can forward the data received over MBMS bearer accordingly.\nFigure 7.8.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the MapGroupToBearer message by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters needed for connectivity with the MC gateway UE.\n2.\tThe MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway UE.\nThe figure depicts a message handling scenario in a network, specifically focusing on the handling of MapGroupToBearer messages. It illustrates the process of converting a MapGroupToBearer message into a Bearer message, which is then forwarded to the next hop in the network. The figure includes a flowchart and a diagram, providing a visual representation of the message handling process.\nFigure 7.8.3.2-1: Handling of MapGroupToBearer message\n1.\tThe MC service server sends a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MC service group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer broadcasting the call.\n2.\tIf the MC client is participating in the MC group communication identified by the MapGroupToBearer message, it sends the details contained in the MapGroupToBearer message to the MC gateway UE through MC GW MapGroupToBearer request message.\n3.\tThe MC gateway UE on receiving the MC GW MapGroupToBearer Request message from the MC client it maintains the association between the GW MC Service ID and the corresponding MBMS sub channel.\n4.\tThe MC gateway UE sends the MC GW MapGroupToBearer response message to the MC client which contains the details of the non-3GPP transport communication related parameters.\n5.\tThe MC client establishes the communication channel with the MC gateway UE based on the parameters received in step 4 to receive the MC service group communication data from the MC gateway UE.\n6.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media for the group communication session over the MBMS bearer.\n7.\tThe MC gateway UE checks which MC clients should receive the media of the MC group communication based on Step 3.\n8.\tThe MC gateway UE forwards the downlink media to the intended MC clients over the communication channel established as in step 5.\nThe MC service server can choose to instruct some MC clients to send the MBMS bearer suspension report when notified by RAN. When the MC clients are residing on non-3GPP devices, MC gateway UE would be the one listening on the MBMS bearers. When RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer it indicates the MC gateway UE. MC gateway UE to notify the MC clients it is serving so that MC clients can report the same to the MC service server. This procedure is applicable only if the MC client is instructed to report the MBMS bearer suspension. Irrespective of whether the MC clients need to send the MBMS bearer suspension report to the MC service server, MC gateway can choose to notify the MC clients it is serving whenever RAN suspends the MBMS bearer. MC clients can then decide to send the MBMS bearer suspension report to the MC service server only if they are instructed by the MC service server.\nFigure 7.8.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices reporting the MC service server about the MBMS bearer suspension.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer suspension notification system, showing the steps involved in suspending a bearer. The system includes a notification mechanism, a suspension request, and a response mechanism. The figure illustrates the steps in the suspension process, including the notification, suspension request, and response.\nFigure 7.8.3.3-1: MBMS bearer suspension notification\nThe MC Gateway UE listening on the MBMS bearer has to report the MBMS bearer quality to the MC clients so that MC clients can report the same to the MC service server. MC Gateway UE monitors an MBMS bearer to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality) the MC Gateway UE needs to inform the MC Clients which requested the MC Gateway UE to listen on MBMS bearer, whether it is able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not the MC Clients can inform the MC service server accordingly.\nFigure 7.8.3.4-1 illustrates the procedure for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices reporting the MC service server about the MBMS bearer quality.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThere is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is announced to the MC gateway UE.\n2.\tThe MC gateway UE is located in the MBMS broadcasting area\n3.\tThe MC gateway UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the modulation and coding scheme.\n4.\tThe MC gateway UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals.\nThe figure depicts a MBMS bearer quality report, showing the quality of the MBMS bearer in a specific area. The report includes various parameters such as signal strength, signal quality, and interference levels. The figure is used to assess the performance of the MBMS system in the given area and to identify any potential issues that need to be addressed.\nFigure 7.8.3.4-1: Reporting MBMS bearer quality\n1.\tThe MC gateway UE follows the Step 1 of the procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] clause 10.7.3.6.2 for the MC service UE. Instead of reporting the bearer quality to the MC service server it has to inform all the MC clients which has asked the MC gateway UE to listen on the particular MBMS bearer.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the MC gateway UE sends an MC GW MBMS Bearer Quality report to the MC Client. The threshold is used to define the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been acceptable or not to receive a specific MC service media. If the MBMS bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the MC gateway UE may send an MBMS Bearer Quality report including the MBMS reception quality level to the MC Client.\n3.\tThe MC Client sends the MBMS listening status report to the MC Service server via MC Gateway UE containing the information received in the MC GW MBMS Bearer Quality report.\n4.\tThe MC service server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g. information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS bearer announcement message.\n",

It identifies enhancements to be included in the technical specifications for MCPTT, MCVideo, MCData and in the common functional architecture to support mission critical communications.\nThe results from the study will be considered for follow-up normative work in Rel-18 as follows:\n1)\tThe functional architecture (clause 7.1) is used as starting point to develop a proper functional model to support the MC Gateway UE functionality.\n2)\tThe solution connection authorisation with an MC server via an MC gateway UE (clause 7.3) will be used to define the authorisation procedure for an MC client hosted by a non-3GPP device.\n3)\tThe solution connection authorisation for non-3GPP devices that do not host an MC client (clause 7.5) will be used to define the authorisation procedure for an MC client which cannot be hosted by a non-3GPP device.\n4)\tOption 2 of solution on using IMS identities behind the MC gateway UE (clause 7.4) will be used, where MC clients capable to host MC service clients use dedicated IMS subscriptions, and non-3GPP devices which cannot host an MC client make use of the IMS subscription provided by the serving MC gateway UE.\n5)\tThe solution 3GPP access network related location information management (clause 7.6) will be used to define the 3GPP access network related location management procedures for MC clients hosted by non-3GPP devices.\n6)\tThe solution MC client uses an own IP address which relies on framed routing (clause 7.7.3) will be used to describe the mechanism for routing of data and signalling by the MC gateway UE.\n7)\tThe solution MBMS Support for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices (clause 7.8) will be used to support MBMS bearers for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices without requiring any changes at the MC system side.\nNo dependencies to other 3GPP groups were identified in the overall evaluation (clause 8) which are required for fulfilling the solutions listed above.\n",

                    "text_content": "The conceptual model for shareable McPTT UEs is that of a pool of UEs, each UE being interchangeable with any other, and users randomly choosing one or more UEs from the pool, each user for his temporary exclusive use. A shareable MCPTT UE can be used by user who can gain access to the MCPTT client application stored on it and can become an authenticated MCPTT User. A shareable MCPTT UE can serve only one MCPTT User at a time. An MCPTT User who signs into a shareable MCPTT UE that is already in-use causes the sign-off of the previous MCPTT User.\nAn MCPTT User can simultaneously have several active McPTT UEs, which, from an MCPTT Service point of view, are addressable individually and/or collectively within the context of their association to the MCPTT User.\nThe conceptual model for a gateway UE is that of a UE capable of providing service to an MCPTT User employing a non-3GPP device. A gateway UE is usable simultaneously by multiple MCPTT Users. Unlike a shareable MCPTT UE, if a new person enters his valid credentials towards signing in the MCPTT Service, his successful signing in and becoming an MCPTT User does not affect the initial MCPTT Users already served by the gateway UE.\nA gateway UE is typically installed in a vehicle (e.g., a police car, fire truck) and has wired and/or wireless connections to various devices in use by the MCPTT Users.\nA gateway UE differs functionally from a ProSe relay node. In the ProSe paradigm, the relay node and the devices served by it are all (ProSe enabled) 3GPP UEs and are \"visible\" to the 3GPP system as UEs. In the gateway UE paradigm, only the gateway UE is an 3GPP device and only it is \"visible\" at the 3GPP network layer.\nFigure A.1-1 shows schematically some of the relationships between MCPTT Users and McPTT UEs.\nThe figure depicts the relationships between MCPTT users and M c PTT UEs, illustrating the various connections and interactions between these entities in a network.\nFigure A.1-1: Relationships between MCPTT Users and McPTT UEs\n",
