The ADMF that receives the warrant information from the Law Enforcement Agencies has the task of provisioning the LI functions present in various Network Functions (NFs) of the serving CSP network. Upon provisioning, the LI is activated in those NFs, and accordingly, the LI functions within those NFs monitor the target's communications and provide the LI as required by the warrant.\nThe scope of the NFs that provide the LI functions within the CSP network is determined based on various factors such as LI service type, CSP deployment choice, scope of LI as authorized in the warrant. The present document provides the logic used within the ADMF in provisioning the LI functions considering those points.\n",

In doing so, the ADMF performs the target provisioning at various Network Elements (NEs) using the X1 protocol as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [6].\nWithin the LI architecture model defined in TS 33.127 [3] and TS 33.128 [4], the ADMF has two sub-functions referred to as Lawful Interception Control Function (LICF) and Lawful Interception Provisioning Function (LIPF). The LICF receives the warrant information from the LEA over LI_HI1 interface. The LIPF performs the provisioning of all LI functions within various NFs of CSP network including the MDF2 and MDF3. See figure 4.1-1 below for an overview.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the LIPF (Layer-in-Plane Finer-Scale) provisioning of NEs (Nodes) in ADMF (Admission-Management-Fabric) networks. It illustrates the process of assigning Layer-in-Plane Finer-Scale resources to NEs, which is a key component of network slicing and resource allocation in modern cloud-native networks. The figure shows the LIPF provisioning process, including the placement of resources, the allocation of resources to NEs, and the management of resources within the network.\nFigure 4.1-1: LIPF in ADMF provisioning of NEs\nWith respect to the LI model of ETSI 103 221-1 [6], the LIPF plays the role of ADMF (as defined in ETSI 103 221-1 [6], and the LI functions (within the NFs) MDF2, and MDF3 play the role of NE (as defined in ETSI 103 221-1 [6]).\nThe present document focuses on LIPF provisioning logic of LI functions, MDF2, MDF3 over the LI_X1. Henceforth, the term LIPF logic is used in the present document. See clause 5 for details of LIPF logic.\n",

                    "text_content": "A separate box is used to represent each of the NF in which an LI function is provisioned by the LIPF. In the illustration shown below in figure 4.2-1, P-CSCF and MGCF are two NFs and are represented by two separate boxes.\nThe figure depicts a network function virtualization (NFV) architecture with separate boxes for each NF that has the Local Interconnect (LI) function. This design allows for efficient resource allocation and management, enabling the efficient utilization of network resources.\nFigure 4.2-1: Separate box for each NF that has the LI function\n\nThe LI function present within a NF and provisioned by the LIPF is represented within the parenthesis. In the illustration shown in figure 4.2-2, the IRI-POI in P-CSCF and IRI-POI in MGCF are provisioned by the LIPF.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the Link-In function, which is a key component in NF (Network Function Virtualization) architecture. It illustrates the function's role in enabling the efficient management and orchestration of network functions, such as routing, security, and load balancing. The figure shows the function's components, including the Link-In function itself, the Link-In function's input, and the Link-In function's output. The figure is a visual aid to understand the function's function and its role in NF architecture.\nFigure 4.2-2: LI function as applicable to the NF\n\nThe possible target identities that are applicable to the LI function present in a NF are represented within another parenthesis that begin with \"Target Id:\". In the illustration shown in figure 4.2-3, the possible target identities for an IRI-POI in P-CSCF and IRI-POI in MGCF are PEI (IMEI only), IMEI, IMPU and IMPI.\nThe figure depicts a layered architecture of a 5G network, illustrating the various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the presence of redundant paths ensures failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and control plane abstraction.\nFigure 4.2-3: Possible target identifiers are in parentheses\n\nSome of the flow-charts have a callout description shown next to the provisioned box. The text within the callout description provides a hint on the conditions that would enable the LI function to provide the interception. When such a condition for the interception is obvious, no such call-out description is provided. In the illustration shown in figure 4.2-4, no callout description is given for the IRI-POI of P-CSCF implying no further clarity is needed. The callout description for the IRI-POI in MGCF is to hint that the IRI-POI in an MGCF is used only when an IMS session is redirected to a CS domain (see TR 33.929 [5]).\nThe figure depicts a call out next to the NF, which indicates the conditionality of interception. The NF is a network function that allows for the transmission of data between two or more networks. The call out next to the NF signifies that the interception of this data is possible, and the conditionality of interception is highlighted.\nFigure 4.2-4: Call out next to the NF describe the conditionality of interception\nThe conditions given inside the call-out description are outside the scope of LIPF logic. However, the LIPF logic is aware of the condition in an overall scheme of things.\nMost of the flow-charts have follow up tables that identify the scope of NF domain in providing the LI functions.\nIn the illustration shown in table 4.2-1:\n-\tP-CSCF has CC-TF in a non-roaming case, has IRI-POI (for non-emergency services only) and CC-TF in VPLMN with LBO and CC-TF (for emergency services only) in VPLMN with HR (home-routed).\n-\tMGCF has CC-TF in a non-roaming case, CC-TF in HPLMN with roaming (both LBO and HR) when an incoming session is redirected over a CS domain.\n-\tIMS-AGW has CC-POI when P-CSCF has the CC-TF and IM-MGW has the CC-POI whenever the MGCF has the CC-TF.\nNote that for each clause the relevant table is to be used as an aid to understand the LIPF logic and it is outside the scope of LIPF logic. However, the LIPF logic is aware of the condition in an overall scheme of things.\nTable 4.2-1: Scope of NF domain that provide the LI functions\n\nNOTE 1:\tFor non-emergency sessions only.\nNOTE 2:\tFor emergency sessions only.\nNOTE 3:\tOnly when an incoming session to a target is redirected over a CS domain.\n",

In other words, the CSP is expected to perform the interception only for the services required by the warrant. The interception may be performed for more than one service when required by the warrant.\nNOTE:\tThe term \"interception\" used in the present document refers to the step that involves actual capturing and then delivery of the Intercept Product to the LEMF.\nThis clause considers the following possibilities in the analysis:\n-\tThe intended target may have subscribed to only a specific service and in this case, by default, the interception would apply only to such service when specified in the warrant. The CSP network would provide the interception as and when the service is accessed by the target.\n-\tThe intended target may have subscribed to multiple services and in this case, the interception would have to be done based on the service type(s) specified in the warrant as and when CSP network detects that such services are accessed by the target.\n-\tA NF may be involved in providing only a particular service and in this case, by default, the interception performed by the POI present in that NF would apply to such service when specified in the warrant.\n-\tA NF may be involved in providing multiple services and in this case, the interception performed by the POI present in that NF would have to be based on the service type applicable to the warrant.\n-\tThere may be multiple warrants with differing service types active on a target, in this case, all applicable services would have to be intercepted at the POIs, and the MDFs would have to then deliver Interception Product based on the service type (s) applicable to the warrant.\nIn supporting the above scenarios, as per clause 4.4 of TS 33.128 [4], the LIPF will have to provision the POIs, TFs and the MDF2/MDF3 according to the CSP service type(s) applicable to a warrant.\nTo cover all the scenarios mentioned above, the service type may have to be part of LI provisioning data sent to the MDFs. Whether a service type will have to be provisioned to the POIs and TFs as an indication will depend on the services provided by the NFs that have such POIs and TFs.\nIn addition to the CSP service type, a few other factors present in the warrant may influence the LIPF logic in provisioning the POIs, TFs and MDF2/MDF3. Few examples are:\n-\tDelivery type.\n-\tLALS triggering.\n-\tCSP deployment options.\n-\tThe target type (local Vs non-local ID).\nFor the target non-local ID, Voice, RCS and Messaging type of services are supported in the present document. In this case, the other party communicating with the target non-local ID happens to access the service provided by the CSP.\nThis clause illustrates the LIPF logic through a series of flow-charts in provisioning the POIs and the TFs. The provisioning aspect of MDF2/MDF3 are not shown unless such details provide additional clarity.

For, the service type of Messaging, the LI provisioning for the service type RCS is also done (see below) if supported and applicable to the target.\n-\tFor the service type of PTC, the PTC Server is involved and hence, provides the IRI and CC interception.\n-\tFor the service type of LALS, the LI-LCS Client provides the IRI interception, and the CC interception does not apply to LALS.\nFor the service type RCS, the RCS Server, the HTTP Content Server, the File Transfer Localization Function are involved and hence, provide the IRI and CC interception.\nWhen the service type \"Messaging\" is explicitly specified in a warrant, the provisioning for the service type RCS is also performed by the LIPF, if the latter is supported and applicable to the target. If the warrant explicitly includes both \"Messaging\" and \"RCS\" as the service types, the LI provisioning for the service type RCS is done only once.\nThe UDM and HSS are also the NFs that have the IRI-POI and the provisioning of IRI-POI in UDM and HSS is independent of the service type indicated in the warrant as long as the target is not indicated as a non-local ID. The provisioning of IRI-POI in the UDM and HSS for a target identifier is done only once.\nWhen multiple service types are applicable for a target identifier, the LIPF may provision the LI function in a NF only once including all the applicable service types. Alternatively, the LIPF may determine the services that need to be intercepted at the LI function present in a NF and then provision that LI function for all services together.\n",

The LIPF logic in supporting the two deployment options is illustrated in figure 5.4.4.1-2.\nThe figure depicts two deployment options for an Ethernet Passive Optical Cables (EPC) network, illustrating the different ways in which the network can be structured. The first option, labeled as \"Option 1,\" shows a more traditional, centralized configuration, with a single base station (BTS) and a single optical line terminal (OLT) at the core. The second option, labeled as \"Option 2,\" presents a more distributed configuration, with multiple BTS and OLTs spread across the network. Both options are shown with their respective advantages and disadvantages, highlighting the flexibility and potential for future advancements in network design.\nFigure 5.4.4.1-2: Two deployment options in EPC\nThe LIPF includes a parameter while provisioning the SGW/SGW-C and PGW/PGW-C.\nTo PGW/PGW-C, with the SGW based deployment option:\n-\tProvide LI functions only for the targets that are outbound roaming with HR.\nSGW/SGW-C, with the PGW based deployment option:\n-\tProvide LI functions only for the targets that are inbound roaming with HR.\nThe above parameter is needed to avoid both SGW/SGW-C and PGW/PGW-C end up performing the interceptions for the same packet data session.\nFigure 5.4.4.1-3 shows the LIPF logic in provisioning the LI functions for additional data services in EPC.\nThe figure depicts the LIPF logic for the additional data services in the EPC (Enhanced Packet Core) network.

It is expected that the CSP implements one of the two deployment options.\nIn LALS triggering option 1, the LTF present in the host NF that has the associated IRI-POI triggers the LI-LCS client. Accordingly, the LTFs in MME, SGW, PGW, SGW-C and PGW-C (when EPC is deployed with CUPS) are provisioned.\nIn LALS triggering option 2, the LTF present in the MDF2 triggers the LI-LCS Client.

For the delivery type of IRI, the IRI-POIs are provisioned. For the delivery type of CC, the CC-TFs are provisioned.\nFigure 5.5.4.1-2 shows the LIPF logic for the provisioning of IRI-POIs and figure 5.5.4.1-3 shows the LIPF logic for the provisioning of CC-TFs.\nThe figure depicts a LIPF logic for delivering voice services over IP-based networks, specifically for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. It illustrates the logic for determining the delivery type of an IRI (Intermediate Resource Identifier) when the target is not a non-local ID (Non-Local Identifier). The figure includes a flow diagram and a flow chart to illustrate the process.\nFigure 5.5.4.1-2: LIPF logic for delivery type of IRI for service type of Voice when target is not a non-local ID\nThe S-CSCF, E-CSCF, P-CSCF, IBCF, MGCF and AS (in figure 5.5.4.1-2) provide IRI-POI functions under certain conditions as noted within the illustration. To prevent those IRI-POIs from providing the LI functions when not supposed to, the LIPF may have to include a parameter during the provisioning. If STIR/SHAKEN is required to be intercepted in the network, then the provisioning of IRI-POIs in IBCF and AS include the parameter ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo if the target identity is IMPU. Additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning is illustrated in figure 5.5.4.1-5.\nThe figure depicts a LIPF logic for delivery type of CC for service type of Voice when the target is not a non-local ID.

To prevent those CC-TFs from triggering the CC-POIs when not supposed to, the LIPF may have to include a parameter during the provisioning.\nFigure 5.5.4.1-4 illustrates the LIPF logic for LALS triggering.\nThe figure depicts a LIPF logic diagram for LALS triggering for the service type of Voice, illustrating the flow of logic and the connections between different components.\nFigure 5.5.4.1-4: LIPF logic for LALS triggering for the service type of Voice\nIn LALS triggering option 1, the host NF that provides the LTF is same as the NF that provides the IRI-POI functions. And therefore, the host NFs that provide the LTF can be different based on the IMS deployment options.\nThe P-CSCF, IBCF and LMISF-IRI (in figure 5.5.4.1-4) provide LTF under certain conditions as noted within the illustration. Under special scenario, the S-CSCF may provide the IRI-POI for emergency services (instead of E-CSCF) as specified in TS 33.127 [3]. To prevent those LTFs from providing the LI functions when not supposed to, the LIPF may have to include a parameter during the provisioning.\nFigure 5.5.4.1-5 illustrates the LIPF logic for additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning.\n\nFigure 5.5.4.1-5: LIPF logic for additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning\nFor STIR/SHAKEN related reporting, IBCF, AS, P-CSCF (VPLMN with LBO), LMISF-IRI (VPLMN with HR) provide the IRI-POI functions. The LIPF logic shown in figure 5.5.4.1-5 is additional logic required to support the LI for STIR/SHAKEN.\nAs illustrated in figure 5.5.4.1-2, the IRI-POIs in P-CSCF, LMISF-IRI and AS are provisioned as part IMS-based voice LI. Likewise, the IRI-POI in IBCF is also provisioned for IMS-based voice LI when the alternate option is used.\nWhen the STIR/SHAKEN is required to be intercepted in the network, the IRI-POIs in IBCF and AS are to be provisioned with ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo value when the target identity is IMPU.\nThere are two deployment options for IMS for intercepting the service type of Voice (TS 33.127 [3]):\n-\tDefault.\n-\tAlternate option.\nIt is expected that the CSP implements one of the two deployment options.\nThe conditions under which IRI-POI or CC-TF functions have to provisioned are illustrated within the drawing and are further clarified in table 5.5.4.2.3-1 and 5.5.4.2.3-2.\nThere are two deployment options for LALS triggering. It is expected that the CSP implements one of the two deployment options.\nIn LALS triggering option 1, the LTF present in the host NF that has the associated IRI-POI triggers the LI-LCS Client. In LALS triggering option 2, the LTF presents in the MDF2 triggers the LI-LCS Client.\nTable 5.5.4.2.3-1 provides the scope of NF domain that provides the IRI-POI/CC-TF/CC-POI functions for the service type of Voice with the IMS deployment option Default.\nTable 5.5.4.2.3-1: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions with Default option\n\nTable 5.5.4.2.3-2 provides the scope of NF domain that provides the IRI-POI/CC-TF/CC-POI functions for the service type of Voice with the IMS deployment option Alternate option.\nTable 5.5.4.2.3-2: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions with Alternate option\n\nNOTE 1:\tFor non-emergency sessions only.\nNOTE 2:\tFor emergency sessions only.\nNOTE 3:\tOnly when an incoming session to a target is redirected over a CS domain.\nNOTE 4:\tOnly when target is outbound roaming or when an incoming session to a target is redirected over an IP domain, or to an outbound roaming party with LBO.\nNOTE 5:\tOnly when the target is outbound roaming without a redirection.\nNOTE 6:\tWhen the interception of conferencing services is required.\nNOTE 7:\tWhen the content interception of conferencing, or application of music/ is required.\nNOTE 8:\tFor IMS emergency sessions in fixed networks when the S-CSCF is on the signalling path, S-CSCF may optionally (instead of E-CSCF) provide the IRI-POI functions with the default option.\nNOTE 9:\tThe use of \"n/a\" in the above table implies that the LI function is not applicable to the NF for the indicated scenario.\nNOTE 10:\tThe LIPF is not aware of the above role played by the host NFs in providing the LI functions.\nNOTE 11:\tMDF2, MDF3 and LI-LCS Client which are also involved in providing the LI functions are not shown in the tables above.\nNOTE 12:\tWhen the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required.\nNOTE 13:\tOnly when target is outbound roaming or when an incoming session to a target is redirected over an IP domain, or to an outbound roaming party with LBO, or when the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required.\nNOTE 14:\tOnly when the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required.\nSince the IRI-POI in AS, in support of LI for special services such as conferencing, is always provisioned, the LIPF logic has to ensure that when the STIR/SHAKEN is required to be intercepted and the target Id is IMPU, the ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo is included as part of that provisioning.\nLikewise, the IRI-POI in IBCF is also provisioned except for the case when the default option for IMS LI is deployed. The diagram shown in figure 5.5.4.1-5 illustrates that when STIR/SHAKEN is required to be intercepted and the target Id is IMPU, the IRI-POI in IBCF is provisioned even with the default option of IMS LI with ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo is included.\nIn general, when the STIR/SHAKEN is required to be intercepted in the network, and the target Id is IMPU, the IRI-POIs in AS and the IBCF are provisioned with ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo parameter included.\nThe diagram shown in figure 5.5.4.2.4-1 below illustrates the LI provisioning just from STIR/SHAKEN perspective. However, from an overall provisioning perspective, it is embedded within the LIPF logic of IMS LI provisioning as illustrated in clause 5.5.4.1.\nThe figure depicts a localized LI provisioning view from the STIR/SHAKEN perspective, illustrating the various steps involved in the provisioning process. It highlights the importance of ensuring that the provisioning process is secure and reliable, as well as the need for efficient and efficient provisioning of Localized Identity Information (LI). The figure provides a visual representation of the different components involved in the provisioning process, such as the STIR/SHAKEN protocol, the use of encryption, and the importance of maintaining a secure and reliable provisioning process.\nFigure 5.5.4.2.4-1: Localized LI provisioning view from STIR/SHAKEN perspective\nThe inclusion of ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo for provisioning of IRI-POI in P-CSCF and LMISF-IRI is not required.\nTable 5.5.4.2.4-1 shows the NFs that will have to provide the STIR/SHAKEN LI (signing) for various scenarios and table 5.5.4.2.4-2 shows the NFs that will have to provide the STIR/SHAKEN LI (verification) for various scenarios.\nThe signing for STIR/SHAKEN happens in the HPLMN except for the emergency sessions it can also happen in the VPLMN. In these tables the indicated scenarios are from the perspective of target.\nTable 5.5.4.2.4-1: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions for STIR/SHAKEN (signing)\n\nTable 5.5.4.2.4-2: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions for STIR/SHAKEN (verification)\n\nNOTE 1: \tSame as in the row for inbound roaming (LBO) and inbound roaming (HR).\nNOTE 2: \tThis is the case where the redirection happens with the outgoing SIP INVITE containing the validation result and the REQUEST URI is a target identity (see TS 33.128 [4], clause 7.11.2.3). The AS may or may not interact with the Verification AS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe IRI-POI is in IBCF. The IRI-POI can be in AS for the special redirection case depicted in NOTE 2 (see TS 33.128 [4], clause 7.11.2.3).\nThe indicated CSP choice is applicable when the signing/verification of only inter-CSP session is required. The CSP choice for signing and verification need not be the same.\n",

The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different components and their functions.\nFigure 5.5.5.1-1: LIPF logic for service type of Voice when target is a non-local ID\nFor the delivery type of IRI + CC, the IRI-POIs and the CC-TFs are provisioned. For the delivery type of IRI, the IRI-POIs are provisioned. For the delivery type of CC, the CC-TFs are provisioned.\nFigure 5.5.5.1-2 shows the LIPF logic for the provisioning of IRI-POIs and figure 5.5.5.1-3 shows the LIPF logic for the provisioning of CC-TFs.\nThe figure depicts a LIPF logic for delivering voice services over a non-local ID network, with a focus on the delivery type of IRI (Inter-Region Inter-Region) and the service type of Voice. The figure illustrates the logic for selecting the appropriate IRI and service type based on the target's location, ensuring efficient and reliable voice communication.\nFigure 5.5.5.1-2: LIPF logic for delivery type of IRI for service type of Voice when target is a non-local ID\nThe P-CSCF, IBCF and MGCF (in figure 5.5.5.1-2) provide IRI-POI functions under certain conditions as noted within the illustration. To prevent those IRI-POIs from providing the LI functions when not supposed to, the LIPF may have to include a parameter during the provisioning.\nIf STIR/SHAKEN is required to be intercepted in the network, the provisioning of IRI-POI in IBCF include the parameter ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo. Additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning for target non-local ID is illustrated in figure 5.5.5.1-4.\nThe figure depicts a LIPF logic for delivery type of CC for service type of Voice when the target is a non-local ID. It illustrates the use of LIPF (Local IP Forwarding) to deliver voice services over a non-local ID network. The figure shows the different delivery types and their corresponding CC (Call Control) codes, which are used to route voice calls to the appropriate network.\nFigure 5.5.5.1-3: LIPF logic for delivery type of CC for service type of Voice when target is a non-local ID\nThe P-CSCF, IBCF and MGCF (in figure 5.5.5.1-3) provide CC-TF functions under certain conditions as noted within the illustration. To prevent those CC-TFs from triggering the CC-POI when not supposed to, the LIPF may have to include a parameter during the provisioning.\nFigure 5.5.5.1-4 illustrates the LIPF logic for additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning for target non-local ID.\nThe figure depicts a simplified LIPF logic for additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning for target non-local ID. It illustrates the steps involved in configuring the LIPF for non-local ID provisioning, including the use of STIR/SHAKEN for secure communication. The figure is a simplified representation, highlighting the key components and steps involved in the process.\nFigure 5.5.5.1-4: LIPF logic for additional STIR/SHAKEN related provisioning for target non-local ID\nFor STIR/SHAKEN related reporting IBCF, AS, P-CSCF (VPLMN with LBO), LMISF-IRI-POI (VPLMN with HR) provide the IRI-POI functions. The LIPF logic shown in figure 5.5.5.1-4 is additional logic required to support the STIR/SHAKEN when the target is non-local ID.\nAs illustrated in figure 5.5.5.1-2, the IRI-POIs in P-CSCF, LMISF-IRI are provisioned as part IMS-based voice LI. Likewise, the IRI-POI in IBCF is also provisioned for IMS-based voice LI when default option is used in HPLMN, or when alternate options are used in both HPLMN and VPLMN.\nWhen the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required in the network, the IRI-POIs in IBCF and AS are to be provisioned with ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo value.\nThere are two deployment options for IMS for intercepting the service type of Voice (TS 33.127 [3]):\n-\tDefault.\n-\tAlternate option.\nIt is expected that the CSP implements one of the two deployment options.\nThe conditions under which IRI-POI or CC-TF functions have to provided are illustrated within the drawing and are further clarified in tables 5.5.5.2.2-1 and 5.5.5.2.2-2. The LIPF may have to indicate to the IRI-POI and CC-TF the condition in which they have to provide the respective functions.\nTable 5.5.5.2.2-1 provides the scope of NF domain that provides the IRI-POI/CC-TF/CC-POI functions for the service type of Voice with the IMS deployment option Default in HPLMN.\nTable 5.5.5.2.2-1: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions with Default in HPLMN\n\nTable 5.5.5.2.2-2 provides the scope of NF domain that provides the IRI-POI/CC-TF/CC-POI functions for the service type of Voice with the IMS deployment option Alternate option in HPLMN.\nTable 5.5.5.2.2-2: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions with Alternate option in HPLMN\n\nNOTE 1:\tIn tables 5.5.5.2.2-1 and 5.5.5.2.2-2, the use of the phrase non-roaming/roaming applies to the party communicating with the target non-local ID.\nNOTE 2:\tThe use of \"n/a\" in the above table implies that the LI function is not applicable to the NF for the indicated scenario.\nNOTE 3:\tThe LIPF is not aware of the above role played by the host NFs in providing the LI functions.\nNOTE 4:\tMDF2, MDF3 and LI-LCS Client which are also involved in providing the LI functions are not shown in the tables above.\nNOTE 5:\tOnly when the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required.\nWhen the target is non-local ID, the IRI-POI in AS is not provisioned for IMS-LI. The IRI-POI in IBCF is provisioned except for the case where the alternate option is deployed in the HPLMN for IMS LI (target non-local ID) and default option is used for IMS-LI in the VPLMN (target non-local ID).\nThe diagram shown in figure 5.5.4.2.4-4 illustrates that when the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required in the network, and the target Id is IMPU, and the target is non-local ID, the IBCF is provisioned even when the alternate option for IMS LI is used in the HPLMN and default option is used for IMS LI in the VPLMN.\nThe diagram shown in figure 5.5.4.1-5 (clause 5.5.4.1) illustrates the LI provisioning just from STIR/SHAKEN perspective. However, from an overall provisioning perspective for target non-local ID, it is embedded within the LIPF logic of IMS LI provisioning as illustrated in clause 5.5.5.1.\nTable 5.5.5.2.3-1 shows the NFs that will have to provide the STIR/SHAKEN LI (signing) for various scenarios and table 5.5.5.2.3-2 shows the NFs that will have to provide the STIR/SHAKEN LI (verification) for various scenarios.\nThe signing for STIR/SHAKEN happens in the HPLMN. In these tables the indicated scenarios are from the perspective of the party communicating with the target non-local ID.\nTable 5.5.5.2.3-1: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions for STIR/SHAKEN (signing)\n\nTable 5.5.5.2.3-2: Scope of NF domain in IMS providing the LI functions for STIR/SHAKEN (verification)\n\nNOTE:\tSame as in the rows for inbound roaming (LBO) and inbound roaming (HR).\nThe indicated CSP choice is applicable when the signing/verification of only inter-CSP session is required. The CSP choice for signing and verification need not be the same.\n",
