            "description": "Coverage is a fundamental aspect of cellular network deployments. Mobile operators rely on different types of network nodes to offer blanket coverage in their deployments. Deployment of regular full-stack cells is one option but it may not always be possible (e.g., no availability of backhaul) or economically viable.\nAs a result, new types of network nodes have been considered to increase mobile operators' flexibility for their network deployments. For example, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) was introduced in Rel-16 and enhanced in Rel-17 as a new type of network node not requiring a wired backhaul. Another type of network node is the RF repeater which simply amplify-and-forward any signal that they receive. RF repeaters have seen a wide range of deployments in 2G, 3G and 4G to supplement the coverage provided by regular full-stack cells. In Rel-17, RAN4 specified RF and EMC requirements for such RF repeaters for NR targeting both FR1 and FR2.\nWhile an RF repeater presents a cost effective means of extending network coverage, it has its limitations. An RF repeater simply performs an amplify-and-forward operation without being able to take into account various factors that could improve performance. Such factors may include information on semi-static and/or dynamic downlink/uplink configuration, adaptive transmitter/receiver spatial beamforming, ON-OFF status, and so on.\nA network-controlled repeater is an enhancement over conventional RF repeaters with the capability to receive and process side control information from the network. Side control information could allow a network-controlled repeater to perform the amplify-and-forward operation in a more efficient manner. Potential benefits could include mitigation of unnecessary noise amplification, transmissions and receptions with better spatial directivity, and simplified network integration.\n",

            "description": "The Network-controlled repeater is modelled as Figure 5-1, which includes the NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd.\nThe NCR-MT is defined as a function entity to communicate with a gNB via a Control link (C-link) to enable exchange of control information (e.g. side control information at least for the control of NCR-Fwd). The C-link is based on NR Uu interface.\nThe NCR-Fwd is defined as a function entity to perform the amplify-and-forwarding of UL/DL RF signal between gNB and UE via backhaul link and access link. The behavior of the NCR-Fwd will be controlled according to the received side control information from gNB.\nThe figure depicts a conceptual model of a network-controlled repeater, illustrating its role in enhancing network performance by providing additional capacity and improving network reliability.\nFigure 5-1: Conceptual model of network-controlled repeater\nAdditionally, at least one of the NCR-MT's carrier(s) should operate in the frequency band forwarded by the NCR-Fwd. And the NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd operating in the same frequency band is prioritized for the study.\nAs baseline, same large-scale properties of the channel, i.e., channel properties in Type-A and Type-D (if applicable), are expected to be experienced by C-link and backhaul link (at least when the NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are operating in same frequency band).\nFor the transmission/reception of C-link and backhaul link by NCR,\n-\tThe DL of C-link and DL of backhaul link can be performed simultaneously or in TDM way\n-\tThe UL of C-link and UL of backhaul link can be performed in TDM way.\nThe multiplexing is under the control of gNB with consideration for NCR capability and simultaneous transmission of the UL of C-link and UL of backhaul link is also subject to NCR capability\n",

                    "text_content": "For the backhaul link and C-link, both fixed beam and adaptive beam can be considered at NCR, where the fixed beam refers to the case that beam at NCR for both C-link and backhaul-link cannot be changed. Beam correspondence is assumed to apply for DL/UL of the backhaul link at NCR-Fwd, as well as the DL/UL of the C-link at NCR-MT.\nAs a baseline, the same TCI states as C-link are assumed for beams at NCR-Fwd for backhaul link if the NCR-MT's carrier(s) is operating within the frequency band forwarded by the NCR-Fwd. In case that the adaptive beams are adopted for C-link and backhaul link, the indication and determination of beams of backhaul link can be achieved by:\n-\tOption 1: The beam of backhaul link is indicated by a new signaling. The new signaling is dynamic signaling and/or semi-static signaling (e.g., RRC signaling/ MAC CE) indicating a beam(s) from the set of beams of the C-link. This does not imply that the beam of backhaul link is always indicated by the new signaling\n-\tOption 2: The beam of backhaul link is determined by a pre-defined rule, e.g., in slots/symbols with simultaneous DL receptions / UL transmissions in both C-link and backhaul link, the beam of backhaul link is the same as the beam of C-link. Otherwise, the beam of backhaul link follows one of the beams of the C link.\nOther predefined rules are not precluded.\nAt least for the access link, and at least for FR2, beam information is beneficial and recommended as the side control information for a network-controlled repeater to control the behaviour of the NCR for the access link.\nRegarding the access link beam indication, the beam of access link for NCR-Fwd is indicated by a beam index where both dynamic indication and semi-static indication, including semi-persistent indication, are considered\nThe time domain resource corresponding to an access link beam is explicitly determined based on the explicitly indicated time domain resources per beam indication. A single beam indication can indicate one or multiple beams. Different parameters may be indicated for semi-static or dynamic beam indication.\nBeam correspondence is assumed for the DL/UL of the access link at NCR-Fwd, i.e., a DL beam and a UL beam on the access side which correspond to each other have the same beam index. The forwarding direction of an indicated beam in access link can be determined based on its corresponding time domain resource and the UL/DL TDD configuration. The forwarding behaviour (or the forwarding direction) of an indicated beam in access link in flexible symbols is separately discussed in clause 6.3.\n",

            "description": "Though there is no commonly agreed set of simulation assumptions in the study, in order to study side control information for NCR, evaluations have been performed in the submitted contributions and the following are observed:\n-\tFor access link beam information:\n-\tFor FR2:\n-\t[R1-2203237] shows that the NCRs with beam information can improve the SINR performance for UEs especially at 5%-tile, 50%-tile SINR. Meanwhile, compared to the conventional RF repeater, the additional interference due to the introduction of repeater can be mitigated for the UEs with above 95%-tile SINR.\n-\t[R1-2203578] shows that the SINR performance of the UEs is improved compared with the case when there is no repeater when the NCR-Fwd beam is fixed to steer towards the cell edge. For cell edge UEs, the SINR gain is 2.3 dB for the 10%-tile SINR. When the NCR-Fwd beam is steering dynamically towards the UE, the SINR performance of the UEs is further improved compared to the case of the fixed NCR-Fwd beam. For cell edge UEs, the SINR gain is about 6.3 dB for the 10%-tile SINR.\n-\t[R1-2203921] shows that by introducing repeaters with beamforming, 2.34 dB, 6.15 dB, and 6.53 dB gain can be achieved at 5%-tile, 50%-tile, and 95%-tile SINR compared to the case of NR system without repeaters, respectively. In addition, 2.03 dB, 5.18 dB, and 6.53 dB gains at 5%-tile, 50%-tile, and 95%-tile SINR can be achieved compared to the case with conventional repeaters, respectively.\n-\t[R1-2204653] shows that performance gain on SINR can be achieved by introducing semi-static repeater gain/power configuration, and additional performance gain can be achieved by introducing dynamic repeater gain/power configuration. More than 5 dB gain can be further achieved by using large SCI payload for beam control for large NCR-Fwd antenna configuration.\n-\t[R1-2205047] shows that adaptive access-link beamforming will offer performance gain by providing a larger beamforming gain and reducing the interference due to use of narrower beams, e.g., the median SINR can improve by 11dB.\n-\t[R1-2206927] shows that the NCR with beamforming has SINR gains over gNB only and conventional RF repeater. Compared with gNB only, NCR has SINR improvements of about 1.42 dB, 1.44 dB, and 3.06 dB at 5%-tile, 50%-tile, and 95%-tile SINR. NCR could improve the coverage compared with gNB only and deployment with conventional RF repeaters.\n-\t[R1-2206055] shows that the SINR performance of the UEs is further improved compared with the case of the fixed NCR-Fwd access link beam when the NCR beam is set adaptively towards the serving UE. Especially for the cell edge UE, the UL SINR gain is about 6.3 dB at 10%-tile of CDF and DL SINR gain is 8 dB for 10%-tile of CDF.\n-\t[R1-2205875] shows that based on the evaluation methodology defined for NR coverage enhancements [3], the performance of NCR is evaluated for FR2 assuming a target data rates of 25 Mbps for DL and 5 Mbps for UL, target ISD of 200m, gNB EIRP of 65 dBm, UE EIRP of 29 dBm, NCR with DL EIRP of 40 dBm and gain of 90 dB. The achieved ISD by gNB only can be up to 140×√3=242m for DL, and 100×√3=173m for UL. With NCR, the DL coverage can be extended to an ISD of 175×√3=300m, and the UL coverage can be extended to an ISD of 135×√3=233m.\n-\tFor FR1:\n-\t[R1-2206018] shows that with indicated beam information, the SINR performance on FR1 in the O2I scenario are improved with around 5dB for 5%-tile SINR and 2dB for 50%-tile SINR after the deployment of NCR over gNB only, and NCR provides SINR gain compared to conventional RF repeater in all cases. According to the deterministic simulation based on Ray-tracing (RT) with realistic outdoor maps, NCRs with beam information can also improve the SINR performance on FR1 with 3dB gain for 5%-tile SINR and around 7 dB gain for the minimum value of SINR over gNB only.\n-\t[R1-2206957] shows that NCR can provide SINR gains for more than 80% of indoor UEs in case that side control information (SCI as defined in clause 6.1) with 4 bits are used for beam information compared to the conventional repeater while the UE SINR with gNB only case (from 0%-tile SINR to 40%-tile SINR) is around 1 dB better than the case with either NCR or conventional repeaters.\n-\t[R1-2205875] shows that based on the evaluation methodology defined for NR coverage enhancements [3], the performance of NCR is evaluated for FR1 assuming a target data rates of 10 Mbps for DL and 1 Mbps for UL, target ISD of 500m, gNB EIRP of 70 dBm, UE EIRP of 26 dBm, NCR with DL EIRP of 32 dBm and gain of 65 dB. The achieved ISD by gNB only can be up to  m for both UL and DL. The target coverage for FR1 can be achieved with BS only.\n-\tFor the ON-OFF information used to control the ON-OFF behaviour of NCR-Fwd:\n-\t[R1-2203237] shows that NCRs with ON-OFF information can mitigate the interference for high SINR UEs while maintain the performance of low SINR UEs, and also ON-OFF information can provide efficient interference management in FR1.\n-\t[R1-2203578] shows that about 9.8dB gain can be achieved for the 10%-tile UEs on the SINR performance after introducing ON-OFF indication.\n-\t[R1-2203921] shows that additional gain is observed for the repeater by both applying beamforming and on/off management compare to the NR system with the repeater only applying beamforming.\n-\t[R1-2205047] shows that about 2 dB gains on median SINR can be achieved by introducing dynamic on-off information.\n-\tFor the power control information used to control the behaviour of NCR-Fwd for the DL of access link and/or UL of backhaul link:\n-\t[R1-2203133] shows that for the uplink transmission via NCR, a fixed NCR amplifying gain may lead to interference to the gNB or NCR UL coverage loss. For the downlink transmission via NCR, a fixed NCR amplifying gain may lead to NCR-Fwd saturation or NCR DL coverage loss.\n-\t[R1-2203578] shows that the optimal system performance can be achieved when repeater's gain is set to a proper value.\n-\t[R1-2204653] shows that dynamic repeater gain/power control can provide additional SINR gain over semi-static repeater gain/power configuration.\n-\t[R1-2204642] shows that the gain control is needed for self-interference management due to repeater oscillation.\n10\tConclusion\nRAN1 has studied the side control information for NCR with corresponding signalling (including its configuration). The SI phase is completed in RAN1 and the following are recommended to be specified as part of Rel-18 NCR WI from RAN1's perspective:\n-\tBeam information as side control information\n-\tON-OFF information as side control information\n-\tUL-DL TDD configuration and NCR's behaviour over flexible symbols.\nBased on RAN3 analysis, the 4 candidate solutions may be further discussed pending confirmation from SA3 and SA5. With the captured content in TR38.867, RAN3 believe the SI phase is completed.\nBased on RAN2 analysis, early identification (via Msg1 or Msg3) for NCR is not needed. From security point of view, the feasibility of NCR validation procedure in solution 1 and the feasibility of solution 2 will be decided by SA3 in potential WI. With the captured content in TR38.867, RAN2 believe the SI phase is completed. Down selection of all captured solutions may take place in potential WI phase based on the feedback from other groups.\n\nTwo companies provided cost analysis results for network controlled repeaters in [] and []. Note that there was no RAN1 conclusion or observation with reference to cost analysis of network controlled repeaters.\n\n\n",
