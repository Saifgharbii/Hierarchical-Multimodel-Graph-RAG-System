NR base station equipment operating within network infrastructure is outside the scope of the present document. However, the present document does cover mobile and portable equipment that is intended to be operated in a fixed location while connected to the AC mains. NR base station equipment operating within network infrastructure is covered by the technical specification TS 38.113 [2].\nRequirements for the radiated emission from the enclosure port of integral antenna equipment and ancillaries are included in the present document. Technical specifications for conducted emissions from the antenna connector are found in the 3GPP specifications for the radio interface of NR UE, e.g. TS 38.101-1 [3], for the effective use of the radio spectrum.\nRequirements for the radiated emissions from the enclosure port and ancillaries cover the following case:\n-\tUE equipment supporting operations in a frequency range for which antenna connectors are available (i.e. for operations in FR1 as defined in e.g. TS 38.101-1 [3] for the radio interface).\nThe immunity requirements are selected to ensure an adequate level of compatibility for apparatus in residential, commercial, light industrial and vehicular environments. The levels however, do not cover extreme cases, which may occur in any location but with low probability of occurrence.\nCompliance of radio equipment to the requirements of the present document does not signify compliance to any requirement related to the use of the equipment (i.e. licensing requirements).\nCompliance to the requirements of the present document does not signify compliance to any safety requirement. However, any temporary or permanent unsafe condition caused by EMC is considered as non-compliance.\n",

The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.\nEnclosure port: Physical boundary of the apparatus through which electromagnetic fields may radiate or impinge. In the case of integral antenna equipment, this port is inseparable from the antenna port.\nIdle mode: state of User Equipment (UE) when switched ON but with no Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection.\nIntegral antenna: Antenna designed to be connected directly to the equipment with or without the use of an external connector and considered to be part of the equipment. An integral antenna may be fitted internally or externally to the equipment.\nNecessary bandwidth: For a given class of emission, the width of the frequency band which is just sufficient to ensure the transmission of information at the rate and with the quality required under specified conditions.\nOut of band emissions: Emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth, which results from, the modulation process, but excluding spurious emissions.\nSpurious emission: Emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information. Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude out-of-band emissions.\nTraffic mode: state of User Equipment (UE) when switched ON and with Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection established.\nTransient phenomena: Pertaining to or designating a phenomenon or a quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 [19])\nUser equipment: is a \"Mobile Station\" (MS) which is an entity capable of accessing a set of NR services via one or more radio interfaces. This entity may be stationary or in motion within the NR service area while accessing the NR services, and may simultaneously serve one or more users.\n",
