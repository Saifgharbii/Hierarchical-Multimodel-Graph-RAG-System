                            "text_content": "This clause contains information on test point analysis and test point selection for single carrier, NR CA and UL MIMO test cases in [2] clause 6 and 7 with information about transmitting test point selection for FR1 listed in table 4.1.1.1-1 and receiver test point selection in table 4.1.1.1-2.\nTable 4.1.1.1-1: NR UE transmitter test point selection for FR1\n\nTable 4.1.1.1-2: NR UE receiver test point selection for FR1\n\nThis section contains information on test point selection for SUL test cases in [2]. The basic principle is following the same rules for test point selection in single carrier test cases. In these SUL test cases, there are default test points to be used unless SUL configuration specific test points are over-ruling.\nBasic rules for Tx SUL test cases:\nFor Test environment: Adopt the same selection of test environment in corresponding single carrier test cases.\nFor Test frequency: Considering that Non-SUL carrier should have no impact on SUL carrier testing results, for any SUL configurations, Mid range is chosen as default for Non-SUL carrier. Select the same test frequency in corresponding single carrier test cases for SUL carrier.\nFor Test SCS: Considering lowest supported SCS can obtain minimum guardband and maximum spectrum utilization, and only 15 kHz SCS is supported for SUL band in SUL configurations, it’s reasonable to select 15 kHz SCS for SUL carrier and lowest supported SCS for Non-SUL carrier regardless of SUL configurations.\nFor Test channel bandwidths: Under the limit of 15 kHz SCS, only the lowest channel bandwidth is supported for current Non-SUL bands in SUL configurations, which are band n78 and n79. Select the lowest channel bandwidth that support 15kHz SCS for Non-SUL carrier. Select the same test channel bandwidths as in corresponding single carrier test cases for SUL carrier.\nFor waveform, modulation and RB allocations: Adopt the same selection of test configurations as in corresponding single carrier test cases for SUL carrier.\nBasic rules for Rx SUL test cases:\nIn Rx testing for SUL, test point selection in clause 7.3C and 7.6C need to be defined. Considering the focus of Rx test cases is testing DL bands, the configuration of SUL carrier shall be selected to ensure the test coverage without costing too much testing time. The configuration of Non-SUL carrier shall be selected based on the same principle as single carrier test cases. The basic test point selection rule for Rx SUL test cases is specified as below:\nFor Test environment: Adopt the same selection of test environment in corresponding single carrier test cases.\nFor Test frequency: The Non-SUL carrier should select the same test frequency as corresponding single carrier test cases. Select Mid range as default for SUL carrier.\nFor Test SCS: Since the REFSENS requirement for SUL is specified for 15 kHz SCS for SUL band and the test point selection of clause 7.6C is also based on that of clause 7.3C, 15 kHz SCS should be selected for SUL carrier. For the Non-SUL carrier the SCS should be selected following the same rule as single carrier testing.\nFor test channel bandwidths: Highest channel bandwidth when SCS =15 kHz for SUL shall be selected for SUL carrier. For the Non-SUL carrier the channel bandwidth should be selected following the same rule as single carrier testing.\nFor waveform, modulation and RB allocations: Adopt the same selection of test configurations as single carrier test cases for Non-SUL carrier. SUL carrier select DFT-s-OFDM QPSK. The RB allocation of SUL carrier shall fulfill the requirement in clause 7.3C.0 in TS 38.521-1.\nNumber of test points for SUL test cases in FR1 are listed in table 4.1.1.2-1 and table 4.1.1.2-2.\nTable 4.1.1.2-1: Number of test points for SUL test cases in FR1 (NR UE Transmitter test)\n\nTable 4.1.1.2-2: Number of test points for SUL test cases in FR1 (NR UE Receiver test)\n\nThis section contains information on test point selection for V2X test cases 6.2E, 6.3E, 6.4E, 6.5E, 7.3E, 7.4E, 7.5E, 7.6E, 7.7E and 7.8E in [2].\nNumber of test points for V2X test cases in FR1 are listed in table 4.1.1.3-1 and table 4.1.1.3-2.\nTable 4.1.1.3-1: Number of test points for V2X test cases in FR1 (NR UE Transmitter test)\n\nTable 4.1.1.3-2: Number of test points for V2X test cases in FR1 (NR UE Receiver test)\n\nThis section contains information on test point selection for RedCap test cases in [2]. The general rule in this section apply to all the RedCap test cases. Separate analysis is not provided for each single test case.\nFor the Tx requirements, basic PC3 requirements apply with the exception that the maximum channel bandwidth is 20MHz. Regarding test point selection, the same test points for PC3 non-RedCap UE apply for RedCap UE, except that the Low, Mid, Hight test channel bandwidth shall be selected among channel bandwidths up to 20MHz.\nFor the Rx REFSENS requirements, TDD/FDD 2Rx, TDD/FDD 1Rx, HD-FDD 2Rx and HD-FDD 1Rx requirements are specified separately. For test cases other than REFSENS, no exception requirements are specified, but considering those requirements have dependency on REFSENS, the UL/DL RB allocation would follow that of REFSENS.\n-\tFor TDD/FDD 2Rx capable RedCap UE, the basic 2Rx REFSENS requirements apply with the exception that the maximum channel bandwidth is 20MHz. For all the Rx test cases, the same test points for non-RedCap UE apply except that the Low, Mid, Hight test channel bandwidth shall be selected among channel bandwidths up to 20MHz.\n-\tFor TDD/FDD 1Rx capable RedCap UE, the exceptional REFSENS requirements are specified for channel bandwidth up to 20MHz. The UL/DL configuration required for 1Rx are the same for 2Rx requirements. For all the Rx test cases, the same test points for non-RedCap UE apply except that the Low, Mid, Hight test channel bandwidth shall be selected among channel bandwidths up to 20MHz.\n-\tFor HD-FDD 2Rx and 1Rx capable RedCap UE, the exceptional REFSENS requirements are specified for channel bandwidth up to 20MHz, with specific UL configuration specified along. For all the Rx test cases, the same test points for non-RedCap UE apply except that the Low, Mid, Hight test channel bandwidth shall be selected among channel bandwidths up to 20MHz, and the UL configuration shall follow Table 7.3I.2-5 in TS 38.101-1[2].\nThis section contains information on test point selection for TxD test cases [2]. Except for test cases listed in Table 4.1.1.5-1, the test point selection principle in single carrier test cases applies to all TxD test cases in term of Test environment, Test SCS, Test channel bandwidths, modulation and RB allocations.\nTable 4.1.1.5-1: NR UE transmitter test point selection for TxD test cases in FR1 (test)\n\nThis section contains information on test point selection for shared spectrum channel access test cases in TS 38.521-1[2]. The general rule in this section apply to all test cases for shared spectrum channel access test cases. Separate analysis for each FR1 shared spectrum channel access test case is not provided, unless deemed necessary.\nFrom the latest core requirement for NR band with shared spectrum channel access, the frequency range are 5150 MHz – 5925 MHz for n46, and 5925 MHz – 7125 MHz for n96. Both bands support power class 5 operations with various channel bandwidths.\nFor all Tx and Rx test requirements of NR unlicensed band, the selections of test point shall be the same as for regular NR band for Test Environment, Test frequency, Test channel bandwidths, Test Subcarrier Spacing, Test uplink/downlink modulations and Test RB configurations, unless shared spectrum channel access configuration specific test points are over-ruling.\nTable 4.1.1.6-1: UE transmitter test point selection for FR1 shared spectrum channel access\n\nTable 4.1.1.6-2: UE receiver test point selection for FR1 shared spectrum channel access\n\nThis section contains information on test point selection for FR1 CA with UL MIMO test cases in TS 38.521-1[2]. The general rule in this section apply to all test cases for FR1 CA with UL MIMO test cases. Separate analysis for each FR1 CA with UL MIMO test case is not provided, unless deemed necessary.\nFor Test Environment, Test frequency, Test channel bandwidths, Test Subcarrier Spacing, modulation and RB allocation: adopt the same selection as the corresponding FR1 NR CA test cases.\nAs for waveform, CP-OFDM is mandatory in case of UL MIMO with two layer transmission and DFT-s-OFDM is not valid. Therefore CP-OFDM waveform is selected.\nThe test point selection for FR1 CA with UL MIMO test cases in [2] clause 6 is listed in Table 4.1.1.7-1.\nTable 4.1.1.7-1: UE receiver test point selection for FR1 shared spectrum channel access\n\n",

The number of test points should be realistic.\nFor pi/2 BPSK with Rel-16 DMRS, the correspondent A-MPR requirements are the same as that for Rel-15 DMRS but the PAPR is lower. Given the UE can pass the requirements using Rel-15 DMRS, it can be expected that the UE can pass the requirements using Rel-16 DMRS. Therefore there is no need to additionally test A-MPR, A-SEM and A-SE for Rel-16 DMRS.\nTable 4.1.2.1-1 lists number of test points for A-MPR, A-SEM and A-SE single carrier test cases and for different NS values.\nTable 4.1.2.1-1: NS value specific test points for A-MPR, A-SEM and A-SE single carrier\n\nThis section contains information on test point selection for test case 6.2A.3.1 in [2], UE additional maximum output power reduction for CA.\nTS 38.101 [3] specifies band dependent NS-values, which in the inter-band UL CA test cases become a combination of two NS-values. Testing all possible combinations would lead to too excessive testing and the combinations that are realistic should therefore be prioritized. This selection is documented in table 4.1.1.1-1.\nTable 4.1.2.2-1: A-MPR test coverage per CA configuration for inter-band CA with 2 CC\n\nThe analyses are performed per NS-value and are stored as zip-files as defined in annex A.

This may cause that a fallback is skipped even if no technical analysis has been made leading to insufficient testing of demanding CA configurations. For NR fallback can only be skipped if there has been a technical analysis performed in TR 38.905.\n2.\tThe RAN4 decision to only specify the affected (aggressor and victim) bands for an exception enables a different approach than in E-UTRA that in most cases makes fallback analysis redundant. This is not entirely true for requirements under clause 7.3A.5 and 7.3A.6 of TS38.101-1 [5] but it is assumed that the same approach can be used also in those cases as it greatly simplifies test cases.\n3.\tTest cases can be split into default and additional test cases where default test cases only test where there is no exception (single carrier requirements apply), and additional only test the exceptions in TS 38.101-1 [5] clause 7.3A.\n4.\tDefault test cases need to be defined from 2 up to 5 CCs. Since they cover no exception, no fallback analysis is required, and the applicability rule should say that only highest CC number is required (similar to other Rx tests).\n5.\tAs the default test cases are not covering any CA exceptions, there is no need to configure UL CA in these test cases. Single UL configuration is sufficient to fulfil the test purpose.\n6.\tAdditional test cases only need to be defined for 2CC (and for intermodulation also 3CC) since this is sufficient for testing the exception. Adding more CCs is not considered to affect the test result and does not add any value.\n7.\tAdditional test cases only need to consider pure inter-band configurations since requirements are the same for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous, and the essential aspect to test is the interference between bands.\n8.\tIt is important for sufficient test coverage to ensure that all band combinations with the highest number of CCs supported in the UE can always be tested.\n9.\tThe highest supported CC number may be with a band including an exception that can be avoided by setting a different test frequency (e.g. harmonic interference). In such cases, there is a need to include test points in the default test case so that this CA configuration can be tested without an exception (see example 1 below).\n10.\tThe highest supported CC number may be with a band including an exception that cannot be avoided by setting a different test frequency (e.g. cross band isolation). In this case the test requirements of the default test that are normally general for any CA config need to include this specific exception requirement. In addition, one fallback configuration needs to be tested to ensure test coverage of the single carrier requirement for the victim band that applies in this case. In order to simplify test applicability this fallback configuration will be specified inside the higher order test case (see example 2 below).\n11.\tThe highest supported CC number may be with a band including a limitation that is not present in the lower order fallback (e.g. UL is not possible in one of the bands). In this case, one fallback configuration needs to be tested to ensure test coverage of the single carrier requirement with UL active in the band. In order to simplify test applicability this fallback configuration will be specified inside the higher order test case.\n12.\tTo ensure that it has been checked that the CA configuration has been fully analysed with regard to test configuration and fallback testing, the CA configuration is listed in TR 38.905.\n",

Considering the high number of EN-DC band combinations, the procedure has been developed to carefully reduce the number of test points. Since the objective of TS 38.521-3 [4] specification is providing conformance testing requirement for NR in the case of EN-DC scenarios, the number of E-UTRA test points can be reduced.\nTS 38.521-3 [4] include exception test cases and non-exception test cases for inter-band EN-DC with FR1. The exceptional test cases must be tested as per configurations defined in TS 38.521-3 [4]. The procedure covers selection of both non-exceptional case and exception cases.\nWhen no NR or E-UTRA exception or additional requirements exist, the E-UTRA anchor is configured such that it does not interfere with NR operation (based on TS 38.101-3 [7] clause 6.1 and 7.1). The EN-DC testing is performed in E-UTRA anchor-agnostic mode. NR is tested but in SA as per TS 38.521-1 [2].\nGeneral initial conditions to be used for NR RX sensitivity testing are:\nTable D.1-1: Initial test condition for standalone NR RX sensitivity\n\n",

This scenario did not happen in standalone NR mode due to that there is no UL CA defined for CA_n3(2A).\nIt can therefore be treated in the same way as inter-band intermodulation and added in the “additional” test case.\nThe intra-band contiguous exceptions are not expected to be very common. Currently only band 71 is affected, which can be added in the “additional” test case.\nInter-band\nFor both SA and NSA there are 4 different types of interference related to inter-band operation that results in refsens exception if the frequency relation of the exception is fulfilled.\nTable D.2.3-1: Exception types for inter-band (2 bands)\n\nThe exception requirements for dual uplink intermodulation apply only for a specified test frequency setting per UL configuration in TS 38.101-3 [7].\nMore details on how the exception requirements were derived can be found in TR 37.863 (Rel-15), TR 37.716 (Rel-16) and TR 37.817 (Rel-17). These TRs can be used to identify all the applicable requirements for a certain EN-DC configuration which are otherwise spread out over multiple sections in TS 38.101-3 [7]. Additionally, the TRs specify exactly which aggressors that contribute to the exception for IMD which is not defined in the TS. Some terminology from the mentioned TRs are re-used here to calculate test frequency for avoiding the exceptions, namely:\nBWINT: Effective bandwidth of the interference falling into the victim band which is |a|*BWLB+|c|*BWHB, where a and c are factors from Table D.2.3-1.\nFINT: Interference centre frequency within the victim band which is the offset from the frequency relation in Table D.2.3-1. If |FINT| ≥ (BWINT+BWvictim)/2 the interference is not overlapping the victim carrier and exception requirements do not apply.\nIt has been agreed that for SA tests all the interference types except intermodulation can be tested with 1UL. Doing the same for NSA would simplify the test cases and would also mean that the main interferer (the aggressor) can be tested with higher power.\nMost other Rx requirements than reference sensitivity in intra-band contiguous EN-DC configuration require a configuration with 2UL however, meaning the “default” test cases need to be tested with 2UL active in this scenario\nThere are combinations of intra-band contiguous/non-contiguous EN-DC + inter-band E-UTRA/NR CA which are listed in the inter-band EN-DC configuration tables of T S38.101-3 [7]. These configurations do not add any exception requirements and are therefore proposed not to be tested unless they contain maximum number of NR CCs supported by the UE.\n",

Therefore, the same test case structure as for SA where test cases are separated into “default” and “additional” test cases can be considered for EN-DC which can greatly reduce complexity in TS 38.521-3[4] as well as reducing the need to complicated fallback test analysis. However, the additional complexity of EN-DC requirements means that a clear separation between exception (“additional”) test cases and “default” test cases is not as straightforward.\nThe following principles are suggested for EN-DC Rx test cases:\n1.\tLet the 2CC test cases cover all reference sensitivity exceptions. Include test coverage of reference sensitivity when exception is avoided.\n2.\tThe 2CC test cases always need to be tested even for UE supporting more CCs since some of the exceptions are not covered in >2CC test cases.\n3.\tLet the 3CC-5CC test cases cover mainly non-exception testing (anchor agnostic), including EN-DC not affected by exceptions and EN-DC affected by exceptions. 2UL 3 band intermodulation exceptions are tested in the 3CC test. Exceptions that 2CC fallback cannot cover are tested in 3CC test.\n4.\tHighest number of NR CCs per band combination supported in the UE need to be tested. Anchor agnostic testing unless the EN-DC configuration has an exception requirement. Only 1 E-UTRA CC need to be tested for intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC and inter-band EN-DC. Maximum number of E-UTRA CCs need to be tested for intra-band contiguous EN-DC (1 band). This is further explained in clause 3.2.6.\n5.\tSince requirements for 3UL and 2UL for the Rel-16 EN-DC configurations are the same there is no technical reason to test receiver requirements with 3UL configured. This may change in Rel-17 but will not have an impact on structure if we can add 3UL as new test points in existing tests.\n6.\tThe test configuration shall be with 1UL or 2UL active depending on the exception type as indicated in Table D.2.5-1.\nTable D.2.5-1: UL configuration to test\n\n7.\tVoid\n8.\tOther than reference sensitivity test cases should use the MSD=0 test points defined in reference sensitivity test case, or minimum achievable MSD. This is currently ensured by using anchor agnostic configuration for inter-band EN-DC, but other solutions are not precluded.\n9.\tTest cases need to be defined from 2 up to 5 CCs for Rel-16. The number of CCs may increase in Rel-17. The reason for not needing more than 5CC is that it is sufficient to test max number of NR CCs as well as all defined exceptions.\n",

If requirements are the same in the lower order fallback, then the fallback can be skipped to save test time. The same principle can be applied for EN-DC, but there is a need to keep in mind that this is only for CA fallback and not EN-DC fallback. Additionally, lower order CA fallbacks can be split into E-UTRA CA fallbacks and NR CA fallbacks.\nEN-DC fallback\nEN-DC fallback does not need to be handled since this would mean falling back to pure E-UTRA operation, which is covered by TS 36.521-1 test cases.\nE-UTRA CA fallback\nSince it has been agreed to use anchor agnostic approach for EN-DC test cases (TS 38.521-3 [4], clause 4.6), it is enough to test with 1 E-UTRA CC unless more CCs are needed to test an exception requirement in TS 38.101-3 [7].\nThere are exception requirements in TS 38.101-3 [7]for intra-band-contiguous EN-DC (not reference sensitivity, but other Rx requirements as shown in clause D.2.3) meaning the maximum number of E-UTRA CCs need to be tested in this scenario.\nE-UTRA CA fallback in intra-band contiguous EN-DC can result in change of EN-DC config from contiguous to non-contiguous (e.g. DC_(n)41DA -> DC_41C_n41A). This change means requirements are different, but since the non-contiguous requirement is same as the standalone requirement it does not need to be tested.\nE-UTRA CA fallback in inter-band contiguous EN-DC can result in change of EN-DC config to intra-band contiguous (e.g. DC_1A-(n)41AA->DC_(n)41AA). This change means requirements are different, implying that both EN-DC config types may need to be tested. See clause D.2.6.2.\nNR CA fallback\nAs shown in clause D.2.1, the maximum number of NR CCs for Rel-16 is 4, which only occurs in inter-band EN-DC (2 NR bands). The fallback to 2-3 NR CCs (2 bands) don’t need to be tested since requirements are still the same. The fallback to single NR band with 1CC may need to be tested in the cases where the 2CC configuration had a reference sensitivity exception that is avoided in the higher order case.\nTable D.2.6.1-1: EN-DC configurations requiring testing and max number of CCs\n\n",

Detailed background can be found in [9].\nThe calculation of test frequency for avoiding exceptions is presented in clause 2.5. The UL configuration also need to be determined and may be with one or two simultaneous UL CCs depending on the scenario.\nFor HD and HM exceptions when the victim band is TDD there is no need from an interference point of view to have UL active on the victim band, meaning this can be verified with 1UL. The same can apply for EN-DC configurations where single switched Tx is allowed. In the case of FDD victim band when 2UL Is mandatory, both UL CCs should be active since this represents the worst case.\nFor CBI exceptions the requirements are defined in two different ways depending on the EN-DC configuration:\n1.\tException applies for any frequency separation as long as aggressor UL is active. In this case, the only way to avoid the exception is to not have UL active on the aggressor band. The test point then becomes very similar to the standalone test and then does not need to be tested for a SA and NSA capable UE. Therefore, CBI exception avoiding could not be tested for this kind of combinations.\n2.\tException applies only if separation is small. Just like for HD and HM exceptions, the exception can be avoided by configuring a larger separation with aggressor signal still active.\nFor 2-band IMD exceptions, the exception is avoided by changing the frequency of one of the CCs such that the intermodulation does not overlap with the victim CC anymore. In the case of multiple IMD affecting the same victim band, only the worst case IMD may be tested. However, in TS 38.101-3[7], there is no general criteria in which REFSENS can be fulfilled with MSD=0 for the EN-DC combinations which have MSD exceptions due to IMD interference (2 UL active). The 2-band IMD exception avoiding testing is still FFS in TS 38.521-3[4].\nFor 3-band IMD exceptions there are a separate set of IMD depending on the UL configuration (selecting 2UL among 3 bands gives two cases). Within a UL configuration, the same test point selection as for 2-band IMD can be used.\n",
