ITU-T Recommendation I.130 [4] describes a three-stage method for characterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU-T Recommendation Q.65 [3] defines stage 2 of the method.\nThis document does not cover the Access Network functionality except as they relate to provision of IM services, these aspects are covered in the normative Annexes.\nThis document identifies the mechanisms to enable support for IP multimedia applications. In order to align IP multimedia applications wherever possible with non-3GPP IP applications, the general approach is to adopt non-3GPP specific IP based solutions.\n",

                    "text_content": "Refer to TS 23.002 [1] for the definitions of some terms used in this document.\nFor the purposes of the present document the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [68] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [68].\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in TS 23.003 [24] apply:\n-\tDistinct Public Service Identity\n-\tPublic User Identity\n-\tWildcarded Public User Identity\n-\tWildcarded Service User Identity\nAlias Public User Identities: A set of Public User Identities that belong to the same alias group as specified in TS 29.228 [30].\nALG: Application Level Gateway (ALG) is an application specific functional entity that allows communication between disparate address realm or IP versions, e.g. an IPv6 node to communicate with an IPv4 node and vice versa, when certain applications carry network addresses in the payloads like SIP/SDP. NA(P)T-PT or NA(P)T is application unaware whereas ALGs are application specific translation entities that allow a host running an application to communicate transparently with another host running the same application but in a different IP version or IP address realm. See IETF RFC 2663 [34] for more details.\nFor IMS, an IMS ALG provides the necessary application function for SIP/SDP protocols in order to communicate between different address realms or IP versions, e.g. IPv6 and IPv4 SIP applications.\nApplication data channel: A data channel within an IMS session used to transfer data of data channel applications between UEs or between the UE and the network.\nAR Application Server: An application server used to control the service logic related to AR communication via IMS data channel.\nBootstrap data channel: A data channel established within an IMS session between the UE and the network, to transfer a graphical user interface that can include a list of data channel applications.\nBusiness trunking: as defined in TS 24.525 [81].\nData channel application: A HTML page including JavaScript(s) and optionally image(s) and style sheet(s). It is downloaded from the network to the UE through the bootstrap data channel.\nDC Application Server: An application server that interacts with the DCSF and the DC media function for data channel traffic handling.\nDistinct Public User Identity: used in relation to wildcarded Public User/Service Identities to denote an explicitly provisioned Public User/Service Identity. See more details in TS 23.003 [24].\nEntry point: In the case that border control concepts are to be applied in an IM CN subsystem, then these are to be provided by capabilities within the IBCF, and the IBCF acts as an entry point for this network (instead of the I-CSCF). In this case the IBCF and the I-CSCF can be co-located as a single physical node. If border control concepts are not applied, then the I-CSCF is considered as an entry point of a network. If the P-CSCF is in the home network, then the I-CSCF is considered as an entry point for this document.\nExit point: If operator preference requires the application of border control concepts then these are to be provided by capabilities within the IBCF, and requests sent towards another network are routed via a local network exit point (IBCF), which will then forward the request to the other network (discovering the entry point if necessary).\nGeographical Identifier: A Geographical Identifier identifies a geographical area within a country or territory. See more details in clause E.8.\nGeo-local service number: A local service number that is used to access a service in the roamed network (a local service where the subscriber is located).\nHome local service number: A local service number is used to access a service that is located in the home network of the user.\nHSS Group ID: This refers to one or more SBI capable HSS instances managing a specific set of IMPIs/IMPUs.\nIMC: IMS Credentials as defined in TR 21.905 [68].\nIMS application reference: An IMS application reference is the means by which an IMS communication service identifies an IMS application.\nIMS application: An IMS application is an application that uses an IMS communication service(s) in order to provide a specific service to the end-user. An IMS application utilises the IMS communication service(s) as they are specified without extending the definition of the IMS communication service(s).\nIMS communication service identifier: An IMS communication service identifier uniquely identifies the IMS communication service associated with the particular IMS request.\nIMS communication service: An IMS communication service is a type of communication defined by a service definition that specifies the rules and procedures and allowed medias for a specific type of communication and that utilises the IMS enablers.\nIMS enabler: An IMS enabler is a set of IMS procedures that fulfils specific function. An IMS enabler may be used in conjunction with other IMS enablers in order to provide an IMS communication service.\nInstance identifier: An identifier, that uniquely identifies a specific UE amongst all other UEs registered with the same Public User Identity.\nInter-IMS Network to Network Interface: The interface which is used to interconnect two IM CN subsystem networks. This interface is not constrained to a single protocol.\nIP Flow: Unidirectional flow of IP packets with the following properties:\n-\tsame destination IP address and port number;\n-\tsame source IP address and port number;\n-\tsame transport protocol (port numbers are only applicable if used by the transport protocol).\nIP-Connectivity Access Network: refers to the collection of network entities and interfaces that provides the underlying IP transport connectivity between the UE and the IMS entities. An example of an \"IP-Connectivity Access Network\" is GPRS.\nIP SM GW (IP short message gateway): An IP SM GW is an AS providing the support of Short Message Service of the IMS domain. See more details in TS 23.204 [56].\nLocal Service Number: A local service number is a telephone number in non-international format. A local service number is used to access a service that may be located in the home network of the user (home local service number) or the roamed network of the user (geo-local service number).\nMedia Flow: One or more IP flows carrying a single media instance, e.g. an audio stream or a video stream. In the context of this specification the term Media Flow is used instead of IP Flow regardless of whether the actual IP packet corresponds to media plane information (e.g. audio RTP flow) or control signalling (e.g. RTCP or SIP Signalling).\nMPS: Based on TS 22.153 [77]. Multimedia Priority Service allows authorized users to obtain and maintain radio and network resources with priority, also during national security or emergency situations when PLMN congestion may occur.\nMPS session: A session (e.g. voice, video, data session) for which priority treatment is applied for allocating and maintaining radio and network resources.\nMPS-subscribed UE: A UE having a USIM with MPS subscription.\nNAT-PT/NAPT-PT: NAT-PT uses a pool of globally unique IPv4 addresses for assignment to IPv6 nodes on a dynamic basis as sessions are initiated across the IP version boundaries. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6 network with addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent routing between the two IP domains without requiring any changes to end points, like the UE. NAT-PT needs to track the sessions it supports and mandates that inbound and outbound data for a specific session traverse the same NAT-PT router.\nNAPT-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (e.g. TCP and UDP port numbers, ICMP query identifiers). This allows the transport identifiers of a number of IPv6 hosts to be multiplexed into the transport identifiers of a single assigned IPv4 address. See IETF RFC 2766 [33] for more details.\nNetwork Address Translation (NA(P)T): method by which IP addresses are mapped from one group to another, transparently to end users. Network Address Port Translation, or NA(P)T is a method by which many network addresses and their TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol) ports are translated into a single network address and its TCP/UDP ports. See RFC 3022 [65] for further details.\nOutbound: Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (Outbound) defines behaviours for User Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent. See RFC 5626 [48] for further details.\nPreferred Circuit Carrier Access: An IMS service that allows a specific long distance circuit carrier to be selected for a long distance call.\nPreferred Circuit Carrier Selection: An IMS service that allows the subscriber to select a long distance circuit carrier per call when dialling a call origination.\nService User: According to TS 22.153 [77].\nStand-alone Non-Public Network: A non-public network not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN.\nSTUN: Simple Traversal of UDP Through NAT (STUN), provides a toolkit of functions. These functions allow entities behind a NAT to learn the address bindings allocated by the NAT, to keep those bindings open, and communicate with other STUN-aware devices to validate connectivity. See RFC 5389 [47] for further details.\nSTUN Keep-alive: Is a usage of STUN, to keep NAT bindings open.\nSTUN Relay: Is a usage of STUN, that allows a client to request an address on the STUN server itself, so that the STUN server acts as a relay. See IETF RFC 5766 [46] for further details.\nSubscriber: A Subscriber is an entity (comprising one or more users) that is engaged in a Subscription with a service provider. The subscriber is allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe services, to register a user or a list of user authorized to enjoy these services, and also to set the limits relative to the use that users make of these services.\nTransport address: A unique identifier of transport-layer address, i.e. a combination of a network address, protocol identifier and port number. For example an IP address and a UDP port.\n",

IP multimedia services are based on an IETF defined session control capability which, along with multimedia transport capabilities, utilises the IP-Connectivity Access Network (this may include an equivalent set of services to the relevant subset of CS Services).\nIn order to achieve access independence and to maintain a smooth interoperation with wireline terminals across the Internet, the IP multimedia subsystem attempts to be conformant to IETF \"Internet standards\". Therefore, the interfaces specified conform as far as possible to IETF \"Internet standards\" for the cases where an IETF protocol has been selected, e.g. SIP and RTP.\nThe IP multimedia core network (IM CN) subsystem enables operators to offer their subscribers multimedia services. The IM CN subsystem should enable the convergence of, and access to, voice, video, messaging, data and web-based technologies for the wireless and wireline user.\nThe complete solution for the support of IP multimedia applications consists of terminals, IP-Connectivity Access Networks (IP-CAN), and the specific functional elements of the IM CN subsystem described in this technical specification. Examples of IP-Connectivity Access Network are:\n-\tthe GPRS core network with GERAN and/or UTRAN radio access networks; and\n-\tEPC core network and E-UTRAN radio access network; and\n-\t5GS access network.\nFigure 4.0 below represents the IMS reference architecture including interfaces towards CS network and other IP based multimedia Networks. Details of the roles of these nodes are described in clauses 4.6, 4.7 and 4.7a.\nNOTE 1:\tSome entities defined as part of the IMS Subsystem can also be used by other subsystems.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Ici and Izi reference points are only applicable for IP Multimedia Networks that are IMS subsystems.\nNOTE 3:\tIn certain configuration, two entities can exchange SIP messages directly with each other without a reference point being defined between them (e.g. intermediate entity(ies) not record-routed).\nThe figure depicts the reference architecture of the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem, showcasing its components and their interconnections. It includes a reference network, a core switch, and distributed nodes, all interconnected through optical line terminals (OLTs). The layered design of the architecture aligns with SDN principles, providing redundancy and failover reliability.\nFigure 4.0: Reference Architecture of the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem\nA description of the functional entities can be found in TS 23.002 [1].\n",

It is up to the operator's policy when and which type of numbers in non-international format can be used. In the rest of this clause the term 'visited access network' is used to indicate the network in which the user is physically located. In the case of GPRS access this is the VPLMN. In the case of other access types this is most probably the IP-CAN provider.\nThe use of numbers in non-international format including local service numbers shall be provided in the following manner:\n1.\tIt shall be possible for the HPLMN to determine whether a user is using a number in non-international format according to an addressing plan used in the visited network or a geo-local service number. This shall be based upon an indication received from the UE. The same indication shall be used to access local services as well as to use a local addressing plan. This indication shall be included in the Request URI of the SIP request. If a user intends to use a number according to an addressing plan used at his/her current physical location or a local service number at his/her current physical location, then there shall be information about the visited access network independently from the location of the P-CSCF included in the Request-URI of the SIP request.\n2.\tThe P-CSCF shall route the session towards the S-CSCF as per the session origination procedures.\nProcessing the Request URI (e.g. address analysis and potential modification such as translation into globally routable format, e.g. a globally routable PSI) shall be performed by an Application Server in the subscriber's Home Network. The S-CSCF routes the SIP request towards this Home Network Application Server based upon filter criteria which are triggered by the information in the 'local indication' received from the UE. The AS may need to identify the visited access network, e.g. from information in SIP signalling or via the Sh interface.\nWhen clause 4.15a (Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local Breakout) is in use, and the Home Network decides to loop-back the call to the visited network, and when the indication is received that the number is in accordance with the visited network numbering plan the Home network can choose to not translate numbers in non-international format, and pass on the non-international number as received, to the VPLMN.\nWhen clause 4.15b (Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with home routed traffic) is in use, a translation to an international routable number may be needed, but this is beyond the scope of this specification e.g. an implementation specific NNI to the VPLMN (or other 3rd party in the visited country) is needed.\n3.\tThen the AS passes the session request back to the S-CSCF with Request URI that contains either a globally routable SIP URI or a Tel URI with number in international format, or a Tel URI with number in non-international format if clause 4.15a (Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local Breakout) is in use and the Home network does not translate the number in non-international format. The SIP request shall contain enough information to route to the network hosting the service or using the addressing plan and allow the terminating network to identify the intended end point (e.g. service).\n4.\tThe S-CSCF routes the SIP request, via normal IMS routing principles, towards its destination (e.g. a server in the visited access network identified by a PSI) using the Mw or Mm interfaces.\nNOTE:\tFor users who have roamed, services relevant to the locality of the user may also be provided by the home network.\n",

Two cases were identified:\n-\tServing-CSCF to an AS in Home Network.\n-\tServing-CSCF to an AS in External Network (e.g. Third Party or Visited)\nThe SIP Application Server may host and execute services. The SIP Application Server can influence and impact the SIP session on behalf of the services and it uses the ISC interface to communicate with the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF shall be able to supply the AS with information to allow it to execute multiple services in order within a single SIP transaction.\nThe ISC interface shall be able support subscription to event notifications between the Application Server and S-CSCF to allow the Application Server to be notified of the implicit registered Public User Identities, registration state and UE capabilities and characteristics in terms of SIP User Agent capabilities and characteristics.\nThe S-CSCF shall decide whether an Application Server is required to receive information related to an incoming initial SIP request to ensure appropriate service handling. The decision at the S-CSCF is based on (filter) information received from the HSS. This filter information is stored and conveyed on a per Application Server basis for each user. It shall be possible to include a service indication in the filter information, which is used to identify services and the order that they are executed on an Application Server within a single SIP transaction. The name(s)/address(es) information of the Application Server (s) are received from the HSS.\nFor an incoming SIP request, the S-CSCF shall perform any filtering for ISC interaction before performing other routing procedures towards the terminating user, e.g. forking, caller preferences etc.\nThe S-CSCF does not handle service interaction issues.\nOnce the IM SSF, OSA SCS or SIP Application Server has been informed of a SIP session request by the S-CSCF, the IM SSF, OSA SCS or SIP Application Server shall ensure that the S-CSCF is made aware of any resulting activity by sending messages to the S-CSCF.\nFrom the perspective of the S-CSCF, the \"SIP Application server\", \"OSA service capability server\" and \"IM-SSF\" shall exhibit the same interface behaviour.\nWhen the name/address of more than one Application Server is transferred from the HSS, the S-CSCF shall contact the Application Servers in the order supplied by the HSS. The response from the first Application Server shall be used as the input to the second Application Server. Note that these multiple Application Servers may be any combination of the SIP Application server, OSA service capability server, or IM-SSF types.\nThe S-CSCF does not provide authentication and security functionality for secure direct third party access to the IM subsystem. The OSA framework provides a standardized way for third party secure access to the IM subsystem.\nIf a S-CSCF receives a SIP request on the ISC interface that was originated by an Application Server destined to a user served by that S-CSCF, then the S-CSCF shall treat the request as a terminating request to that user and provide the terminating request functionality as described above. Both registered and unregistered terminating requests shall be supported.\nIt shall be possible for an Application Server to generate SIP requests and dialogs on behalf of users. Requests originating sessions on behalf of a user are forwarded to the S-CSCF serving the user, if the AS has knowledge of the S-CSCF assigned to that user and the S-CSCF shall perform regular originating procedures for these requests.\nOriginating requests on behalf of registered and unregistered users shall be supported.\nMore specifically the following requirements apply to the IMS Service control interface:\n1.\tThe ISC interface shall be able to convey charging information as per TS 32.240 [25] and TS 32.260 [26].\n2.\tThe protocol on the ISC interface shall allow the S-CSCF to differentiate between SIP requests on Mw, Mm and Mg interfaces and SIP Requests on the ISC interface.\n\nFigure 4.3: Void\nBesides the Cx interface the S-CSCF supports only one standardised protocol for service control, which delegates service execution to an Application Server. The protocol to be used on the ISC interface shall be SIP (as defined by IETF RFC 3261 [12], other relevant IETF RFC's, and additional enhancements introduced to support 3GPP´s needs on the Mw, Mm, Mg interfaces).\nThe notion of a \"SIP leg\" used throughout this specification is identical to the notion of a call leg which is the same as a SIP dialog defined by IETF RFC 3261 [12]. The same SIP leg that is received by the S-CSCF on the Mw, Mm and Mg interfaces is sent on the ISC interface. The same SIP leg that is received by the S-CSCF on the ISC interface is sent on the Mw, Mm and Mg interfaces.\nConcerning the relationship between the SIP legs of the ISC interface and the SIP legs of the Mw, Mm, and Mg interfaces the S-CSCF acts as a SIP proxy, as shown in Figures 4.3a – 4.3e below.\nFigures 4.3a-4.3e below depict the possible high-level interactions envisioned between the S-CSCF and the Application Server.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with an Application Server acting as a terminating UA, or redirect server, which is responsible for redirecting traffic to the appropriate destination. This is a crucial component in ensuring the efficient routing of data within a network.\nFigure 4.3a: Application Server acting as terminating UA, or redirect server\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an Application Server is acting as an originating User Equipment (UE) in a 5G network, with a focus on the application layer. The figure illustrates the communication between the Application Server and the network, highlighting the role of the Application Server in the network's architecture.\nFigure 4.3b: Application Server acting as originating UA\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an Application Server is acting as a SIP proxy, facilitating communication between two endpoints. The Application Server is equipped with features such as a SIP proxy, which allows it to forward calls to the appropriate SIP endpoint. This setup is crucial for ensuring a reliable and efficient communication network.\nFigure 4.3c: Application Server acting as a SIP proxy\nThe figure depicts a 3rd party call control application server in action, with a focus on its interaction with the application server. The server is responsible for managing the call control process, ensuring that calls are routed to the appropriate parties and that the call quality is maintained. The figure shows the server's interface with the application server, as well as the various components involved in the call control process, such as the application server, the call control application, and the call control system. The figure also highlights the importance of network security and the need for robust call control mechanisms to ensure the smooth operation of the network.\nFigure 4.3d: Application Server performing 3rd party call control\nThe figure depicts a SIP leg passing through the S-CSCF without Application Server involvement, highlighting the importance of network virtualization and the role of the Application Server in managing the network.\nFigure 4.3e: A SIP leg is passed through the S-CSCF without Application Server involvement\n",

Incoming or outgoing leg information e.g. state information, may be passed between the S-CSCF and AS implicitly or explicitly. Implicitly means that SIP information in transit carries information about the state of the session (e.g. an INVITE message received at the S-CSCF on an incoming leg may be sent to the AS with no changes or with some additional information). Explicitly means that SIP information is generated, e.g. to transfer state change information from an S-CSCF to an AS in circumstances where there is no ongoing SIP transaction that can be used. It is a matter for Stage 3 design to determine when to use implicit or explicit mechanisms and to determine what extensions to SIP are necessary.\nThe internal model of the S-CSCF (shown in Figure 4.3f) may sometimes exhibit proxy server like behaviour either by passing the requests to the Application Server or by passing the requests out of the system. A Proxy server may maintain session state or not. The S-CSCF may sometimes exhibit User Agent like behaviour. Some Applications require state to be maintained in the S-CSCF. Their exact behaviour depends on the SIP messages being handled, on their context, and on S-CSCF capabilities needed to support the services. It is a matter for Stage 3 design to determine the more detailed modelling in the S-CSCF.\nThe internal model of the AS (shown in Figure 4.3f) may exhibit User Agent like behaviour. The exact behaviour depends on the SIP messages being handled and on their context. Detailed Stage 3 modelling for the AS is not required.\nThe definitions used in the model are:\nCombined ILSM OLSM – Incoming/outgoing Leg State Model: Models the behaviour of an S-CSCF for handling SIP messages on incoming and outgoing session legs. The Combined I/OLSM shall be able to store session state information. It may act on each leg independently, acting as a SIP Proxy, Redirect Server or User Agent dependant on the information received in the SIP request, the filter conditions specified or the state of the session.\nIt shall be possible to split the application handling on each leg and treat each endpoint differently.\nILCM - Incoming Leg Control Model: Models the behaviour of an S-CSCF for handling SIP information sent to and received from an AS for an incoming session leg. The ILCM shall store transaction state information.\nOLCM - Outgoing Leg Control Model: Models the behaviour of an S-CSCF for handling SIP information received from and sent to an AS for an outgoing session leg. The OLCM shall store transaction state information.\nAS-ILCM - Application Server Incoming Leg Control Model: Models AS behaviour for handling SIP information for an incoming leg. The AS-ILCM shall store Transaction State, and may optionally store Session State depending on the specific service being executed.\nAS-OLCM - Application Server Outgoing Leg Control Model: Models AS behaviour for handling SIP information for an outgoing leg. The AS-OLCM shall store Transaction State, and may optionally store Session State depending on the specific service being executed.\n",

This allows for independent evolution of QoS control and the session control in the IM CN subsystem.\n2.\tNecessity for End-to-End QoS Signalling and Resource -Allocation\nEnd-to-end QoS indication, negotiation and resource allocation during the session set-up in the IM CN subsystem should be enforced for those services and applications that require QoS better than best-effort.\n3.\tVoid.\n4.\tRestricted Resource Access at the IP BS Level\nAccess to the resources and provisioning of QoS at IP BS Level should be authenticated and authorized by applying appropriate QoS policies via the IP Policy Control element\n5.\tRestricted Resource Access at the IP-Connectivity Access Network (i.e. layer-2) Level\nAccess to the resources and provisioning of QoS at the IP-Connectivity Access Network Level should be authenticated and authorized by using existing registration/security/QoS policy control mechanisms of the IP-CAN.\n6.\tCo-ordination between Session Control and QoS Signalling/Resource Allocation\na.\tIn establishing an IMS session, it shall be possible for an application to request that the resources needed for bearer establishment be successfully allocated before the destination user is alerted.\nb.\tIn establishing an IMS session, it shall be possible, dependent on the application being offered, to prevent the use of the bearer until the session establishment is completed.\nc.\tIn establishing an IMS session, it shall be possible for a terminating application to allow the destination user to participate in determining which bearers shall be established.\nd.\tSuccessful bearer establishment shall include the completion of any required end-to-end QoS signalling, negotiation and resource allocation.\ne.\tIn establishing an IMS session, it shall be possible to use already allocated bearer resources, if these resources fulfil the needs of the session. However, note that QoS policy control mechanisms of the IP-CAN may not allow to use already allocated bearer resources.\nThe initiation of any required end-to-end QoS signalling, negotiation and resource allocation processes at different network segments shall take place after the initiation and delivery of a session set-up request.\n7.\tThe Efficiency of QoS Signalling and Resource Allocation\nThe sequence of end-to-end QoS signalling, negotiation and resource allocation processes at different network segments should primarily consider the delay in negotiating end-to-end QoS and reserving resources that contributes to the session set-up delay. Parallel or overlapping QoS negotiation and resource reservation shall be allowed where possible.\n8.\tDynamic QoS Negotiation and Resource Allocation\nChanges (upgrading or downgrading) of QoS provided to an active IMS session shall be supported based on either the request from the IM application or the current network loads or link quality (e.g. radio link quality).\nIt shall be possible to maintain a resource allocation in excess of the resources needed for current media flows (but within the restrictions imposed by points #4 and #5 above), in order to e.g. switch to different media flow characteristics without risk of admission control failure.\n9.\tPrevention of Theft of Service\nThe possibility for theft of service in the IM CN subsystem shall be no higher than that for the corresponding packet data and circuit switched services.\n10.\tPrevention of Denial of Service\nThe system unavailability due to denial of service attacks in the IM CN subsystem shall be no greater than that for the corresponding packet data and circuit switched services.\n",

It is possible for a representation of the IMSI to be contained within the NAI for the private identity.\n-\tThe Private User Identity is not used for routing of SIP messages.\n-\tThe Private User Identity shall be contained in all Registration requests, (including Re-registration and De-registration requests) passed from the UE to the home network.\n-\tAn ISIM application shall securely store one Private User Identity. For UEs supporting only non-3GPP accesses or UEs accessing IMS via SNPN, if neither ISIM nor USIM is present, but IMC is present, the Private User Identity shall be stored in IMC.

The Public User Identity is used by any user for requesting communications to other users. For example, this might be included on a business card.\n-\tBoth telecom numbering and Internet naming schemes can be used to address users depending on the Public User identities that the users have.\n-\tThe Public User Identity shall take the form as defined in TS 23.003 [24].\n-\tAn ISIM application shall securely store at least one Public User Identity.

Subscriber-specific services for unregistered users may nevertheless be executed as described in clause 5.12.\n-\tIt shall be possible to register globally (i.e. through one single UE request) a user that has more than one public identity via a mechanism within the IP multimedia CN subsystem (e.g. by using an Implicit Registration Set). This shall not preclude the user from registering individually some of his/her public identities if needed.\n-\tPublic User Identities are not authenticated by the network during registration.\n-\tPublic User Identities may be used to identify the user's information within the HSS (for example during mobile terminated session set-up).\nA Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) is an identity that identifies a unique combination of Public User Identity and UE instance that allows a UE to address a SIP request to a specific Public User Identity UE combination instance, as opposed to a Public User Identity, in order to ensure that the SIP request is not forked to another registered UE of the same Public User Identity. There are two types of GRUUs; Public GRUUs (P-GRUUs) and Temporary GRUUs (T-GRUUs). P-GRUUs are GRUUs that reveal the Public User Identity of the user and are very long lived. T-GRUUs are GRUUs that contain a URI that do not reveal the Public User Identity of the user and are valid until the contact is explicitly de-registered or the current registration expires. The IM CN subsystem shall support the capability for IMS UEs to obtain both T-GRUUs and P-GRUUs when performing IMS registration, exchange GRUUs using SIP requests and responses and use GRUUs to address SIP requests to specific UEs according to RFC 5627 [49].\nThe following architectural requirements shall apply to support of GRUU in the IMS:\n0.\tIf a UE could become engaged in a service (e.g. telephony supplementary service) that potentially requires the ability to identify and interact with a specific UE even when multiple UEs share the same single Public User Identity then the UE should support GRUU.\n1.\tA GRUU shall be registered in the IMS network with a unique combination of specific Public User Identity and UE.\n2.\tIf a UE supports GRUU, it shall indicate support for a GRUU that is associated with a specific Public User Identity at the time of registration of the Public User Identity. The UE shall use the same instance ID for all registration requests regardless of the access network used for registration. A function that registers on behalf of a UE shall use the same Instance ID as if that UE had performed the registration itself.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UICC is replaced the UE is still considered to be same UE instance and so the UE instance ID is not changed by using a different UICC.\n3.\tThe IMS network shall be able to receive an indication of support for GRUU for a specific Public User Identity at a specific UE instance and be able to generate both P-GRUU's and T-GRUU's and return them back to the UE that indicated support for GRUU.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE may have a registration request that indicates GRUU support, but the GRUU will not be returned if IMS network does not support generation of GRUUs.\n4.\tWhen the IMS network receives indication of GRUU support for a specific Public User Identity from the UE during a registration request, the IMS network shall also generate P-GRUU's and T-GRUU's for all implicitly registered Public User Identities belonging to the same implicit registration set. The IMS network shall communicate all these other GRUUs to the UE.\n5.\tRegistrations of all GRUUs associated with a specific Public User Identity shall also be directed to the same S-CSCF.\n6.\tThe IMS network will be able to generate GRUU's for any UE registered with a valid SIP URI.\n7.\tThe IMS network shall generate the same P-GRUU for a given Public User Identity and Instance Identifier combination.\n8.\tThe IMS network shall generate a different T-GRUU for a given Public User Identity and Instance Identifier combination for each registration and re-registration.\n9.\tThe IMS network shall be able to derive the Public User Identity directly from the P-GRUU. The Public User Identity derived from the P-GRUU used to identify the contact address of the sender shall be same as the Public User Identity used to identify the initiator or an associated Public User Identity. If the URI in the SIP Contact header of the sender carries a parameter indicating that it is a GRUU but does not comply with the stated requirement or if there is no registration corresponding to the GRUU, then the IMS network should reject the request.\n10.\tThe IMS network shall be able to route requests destined to a GRUU to the UE instance registered with that GRUU.\n11.\tThe IMS network shall not fork SIP requests addressed to a GRUU to separate UEs.\n12.\tA UE that is capable of supporting GRUUs shall be able to differentiate between a GRUU and a Public User Identity.\n13.\tThe IMS network shall support establishment of session or non-session related communication using a GRUU.\n14.\tA UE supporting GRUUs shall be able to inter-work with an IMS network not supporting GRUUs.\n15.\tA UE supporting GRUUs shall be able to inter-work with a UE not supporting GRUUs per RFC 5627 [49].\n16.\tA UE or network that supports GRUUs shall not negatively affect networks or UEs that do not support GRUUs.\n17.\tIt shall be possible to define iFCs that match the Public User Identity part of a GRUU.\n18.\tIt shall be possible for iFCs to determine whether the Request URI of a message contains a GRUU, and then trigger to Application Servers that are only applicable for GRUUs.\n19.\tIt shall be possible to provide terminating services to a GRUU associated with a currently unregistered subscriber.\nNOTE 3:\tThe network may not be able to validate the unregistered GRUU of a currently unregistered or registered subscriber, such that operator policy might restrict the services available to the GRUU under these conditions.\n20.\tIt shall be possible to apply same level of privacy irrespective whether GRUU is used or not.\nIt shall be possible to support a wildcarded Public User Identity. A wildcarded Public User Identity expresses a set of Public User Identities grouped together. It shall be possible to include and express the wildcarded Public User Identity in the implicit registration set according to clause 5.2.1a.\nOnly distinct Public User Identities shall be used for explicit registration. The implicit registration of a wildcarded Public User Identity shall be handled in the same manner as the implicit registration of a distinct Public User Identity from a network perspective, with only one service profile associated to the wildcarded Public User Identity.\nIt shall be possible for a user to have a distinct Public User Identity even if it matches a wildcarded Public User Identity. Such a distinct Public User Identity may have a different service profile than the wildcarded Public User Identity.\nEditor's note:\tIt is to TBD if a distinct Public User Identity shall be included in the same implicit registration or not. If stage 3 protocol solution found for this issue, then they can be in separate implicit registration set.\nThe matching of a distinct Public User Identity shall take precedence over matching of wildcarded Public User Identity. When the value of a Public User Identity matches what is expressed as an implicitly registered wildcarded Public User Identity and there is no better match, then the procedures are the same as in the case that the identifier matches an implicitly registered distinct Public User Identity.\nRouting of SIP signalling within the IMS shall use SIP URIs or other (non SIP) AbsoluteURIs. AbsoluteURIs are defined in IETF RFC 3986 [13]. Routing of SIP signalling within the IMS using AbsoluteURI (non SIP) shall only be supported for IMS signalling from IMS user to external networks. E.164 [2] format Public User Identities shall not be used for routing within the IMS, and session requests based upon E.164 format Public User Identities will require conversion into SIP URI format for internal IMS usage.\nWhen using a phone number as the dialled address, the UE can provide this number in the form of a SIP URI or a TEL URI. This phone number can be in the form of E.164 format (prefixed with a '+' sign), or a local format using local dialling plan and prefix. The IMS will interpret the phone number with a leading '+' to be a fully defined international number.\nIf a terminating session with a TEL URI is used, the HSS and the SLF (in the case that more than one independently addressable HSS is utilized by a network operator) shall support the TEL URI format Public User Identity.\nThe home network operator is responsible for the assignment of the Private User Identities, and Public User Identities; other identities that are not defined by the operator may also exist.\nThe figure depicts a relationship between the Private User Identity (PUI) and the Public User Identity (PUI) in a 5G network. It illustrates the various paths through which a user's identity can be transmitted, including the use of private and public networks. The figure also highlights the importance of network security and privacy in 5G networks.\nFigure 4.5: Relationship of the Private User Identity and Public User Identities\nThe IMS Service Profile is a collection of service and user related data as defined in TS 29.228 [30]. The Service Profile is independent from the Implicit Registration Set, e.g. Public User Identities with different Service Profiles may belong to the same Implicit Registration Set. Initial filter criteria in the service profile provide a simple service logic comprising of user / operator preferences that are of static nature i.e. they do not get changed on a frequent basis. It shall be possible to identify Alias Public User Identities. See clause 4.3.3.2 for more details.\nApplication servers will provide more complex and dynamic service logic that can potentially make use of additional information not available directly via SIP messages (e.g. location, time, day etc.).\nThe IMS service profile is defined and maintained in the HSS and its scope is limited to IM CN Subsystem. A Public User Identity shall be registered at a single S-CSCF at one time. All Public User Identities of an IMS subscription shall be registered at the same S-CSCF. The service profile is downloaded from the HSS to the S-CSCF. Only one service profile shall be associated with a Public User Identity at the S-CSCF at a given time. Multiple service profiles may be defined in the HSS for a subscription. Each Public User Identity is associated with one and only one service profile. Each service profile is associated with one or more Public User Identities.\nAn ISIM application shall securely store the home domain name of the subscriber. For UEs supporting only non-3GPP accesses or UEs accessing IMS via SNPN, if neither ISIM nor USIM is present, but IMC is present, the home domain name shall be stored in IMC. It shall not be possible for the UE to modify the information from which the home domain name is derived.\nIt is not a requirement for a user to be able to register on behalf of another user which is third party registration specified in IETF RFC 3261 [12] or for a device to be able to register on behalf of another device or for combinations of the above for the IM CN subsystem for this release.\nPublic User Identities may be shared across multiple Private User Identities within the same IMS subscription. Hence, a particular Public User Identity may be simultaneously registered from multiple UEs that use different Private User Identities and different contact addresses. If a Public User Identity is shared among the Private User Identities of a subscription, then it is assumed that all Private User Identities in the IMS subscription share the Public User Identity.\nThe relationship for a shared Public User Identity with Private User Identities, and the resulting relationship with service profiles and IMS subscription, is depicted in Figure 4.6.\nAn IMS subscription may support multiple IMS users.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Public User Identity sharing mechanism described above is not intended to support sharing of identities across large numbers of Private User Identities, since this would result in all these users being forced to be associated with the same IMS subscription and hence the same S-CSCF.\nNOTE 2:\tSubscription data is assumed to indicate which Public User Identities within a subscription are shared and which are not.\nThe figure depicts a network setup with multiple Public User Identities (Public-ID-2) and Private User Identities (Private-ID-1) connected to a shared Public User Identity (Public-ID-2). The Public-ID-2 is a key component in the network, acting as a bridge between the Public and Private networks. The Private-ID-1 is a user's private identity, ensuring secure communication. The figure illustrates the interconnection of these identities, highlighting the importance of network security and privacy.\nFigure 4.6: The relation of a shared Public User Identity (Public-ID-2) and Private User Identities\nAll Service Profiles of a user shall be stored in the same HSS, even if the user has one or more shared Public User Identities.\nEach Public User Identity may have one or more Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs). There are two types of GRUU, P-GRUUs and T-GRUUs which are associated with Public User Identities and are generated and assigned to the UE together during registrations and re-registration in a pair of one P-GRUU and one T-GRUU. Each pair of a P-GRUU and a T-GRUU is associated with one Public User Identity and one UE. During subsequent re-registrations the same P-GRUU will be assigned to the UE but a new and different T-GRUU will be generated and assigned. After a re-registration all the previous T-GRUUs generated during the period of this registration are all still valid. A UE may retain some or all of the previous T-GRUUs obtained during the initial registration or previous re-registrations along with the new T-GRUU or the UE may replace some or all of the previous T-GRUUs with the new T-GRUU. The current set of the P-GRUU and all T-GRUUs which are currently valid during this registration period is referred to here as the GRUU set. This relationship is depicted in figure 4.6a. If a UE registers (explicitly or implicitly) with multiple Public User Identities, a separate GRUU set is associated with each. If different UEs register with the same Public User Identity, a different GRUU set is associated with each.\nNOTE:\tIf the UICC is replaced the UE is still considered to be same UE instance and if that UE instance with a different UICC registers the same Public User Identity as was registered with the previous UICC the same P-GRUU will be assigned for that Public User Identity UE instance combination.\nThe figure depicts the relationship between Public User Identities (PUIs), Generic Routing Unit (GRUUs), and User Equipment (UE) in a 5G network. It illustrates the various types of users and their connections, highlighting the importance of network segmentation and the use of Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 4.6a: The relationship of Public User Identities, GRUUs, and UEs\n",

The actual ENUM/DNS database(s) used to perform address translations are outside the scope of 3GPP and are therefore a matter for the network operator. There is no requirement that the universal ENUM service on the Internet be used. As such, it is possible that the ENUM/DNS mechanism uses a different top level domain to that of \"e164.arpa.\" (as mandated in IETF RFC 3761 [16], clause 1.2), therefore, the top level domain to be used for ENUM domain names shall be a network operator configurable option in all IMS nodes that can perform ENUM/DNS resolution.\nIn some scenarios, owners of ENUM servers may require information on who is the querying IMS operator, to determine an appropriate response (including whether to respond at all). This capability is required on the egress of the IMS network, particularly in the presence of shared network elements and intermediary IMS network(s) between the originating IMS operator and target ENUM/DNS server(s).\nENUM databases may contain Number Portability information. Number Portability is further described in clause 4.18.1.\nThe S-CSCF shall support the ability to translate the E.164 address contained in a Request-URI in the Tel: URI format (as specified in IETF RFC 3966 [15]) to a SIP routable SIP URI using the ENUM/DNS translation mechanism as specified in clause 4.3.5.1. If this translation succeeds, then the session shall be routed according to the returned SIP URI. If this translation fails, then the session may be forwarded to a BGCF for further routing (e.g. to the PSTN) as described in clause 5.19 or appropriate notification shall be sent to the originating session endpoint, depending on network operator configuration.\nWhen clause 4.15a (Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local Breakout) is in use, and the Home Network decides to loop-back the call to the visited network, the Home network can choose not to translate the E.164 address in the Request URI to a globally routable SIP URI, and leave it to the visited network.\nPer network operator policy, the network may attempt to resolve and route a SIP URI representing a telephone number and a domain that does not own the target user using the ENUM/DNS translation mechanism specified in clause 4.3.5.1. The need for address resolution may be triggered by the S-CSCF, and the I-CSCF or transit function, as determined by network operator configuration. Procedures applied to the S-CSCF, I-CSCF and transit functions are outlined below.\nWhen an originating S-CSCF receives an originating request with a Request-URI containing the SIP representation of an E.164 number, network operator policy shall dictate whether the procedure shall be carried out for all the domains of the SIP URI where those domains belong to the home network, or not at all. If operator policy indicates that the procedure is to be performed, then the S-CSCF shall reuse the procedure specified in clause 4.3.5.for handling of Tel URIs.\nIf the operator policy at the originating S-CSCF dictates that the procedure shall not be performed or the SIP URI containing the representation of an E.164 number contains a domain that does not belong to the home network, then the S-CSCF shall handle and route the request in the same manner as a SIP URI.\nPrior to an HSS Location Query, the I-CSCF shall translate a SIP URI representing a telephone number contained in a Request-URI into the Tel: URI format specified in IETF RFC 3966 [15]. The resultant Tel URI shall then be used for performing the HSS Location Query.\nIf the HSS Location Query response indicates that the user does not exist, and if configured by operator policy, the I-CSCF shall invoke the portion of transit functionality that translates the E.164 address contained in the Tel URI in the Request-URI into a routable SIP URI, reusing the procedure specified in 4.3.5.2 for handling of Tel URIs.\nNOTE:\tThe entire transit functionality is not required for this purpose.\n",

                            "text_content": "An IMS Communication Service Identifier (ICSI) provides a framework for the identification of IMS communication services utilising the IMS enablers. An IMS communication service is provided via the use of the IMS enablers. At terminals, the use of a communication service identifier is similar to the use of the port concept in TCP/IP, in that it allows applications in a terminal and the network that use SIP for communication purposes to be identified. In the terminal this means dispatching a SIP message to the correct application, and in the network it means selection of the correct application server over ISC. Examples of IMS based applications and communication services are OMA messaging and OMA PoC.\nAn IMS communication service defines restrictions to which SIP procedures are possible within a single SIP session or standalone transaction and how those SIP procedures are used. The IMS communication service contains an aggregation of zero, one, or several media components and the service logic managing the aggregation, represented in the protocols used. Its behaviour and characteristics may be standardized as done for the two examples above, or proprietary and specific for e.g. an operator or an enterprise.\nA service description specifies this behaviour and states e.g. the allowed media combinations and state transitions as a consequence of signalling and use of IMS enablers in the network and terminals.\nNOTE 1:\tThe application server(s) required to support the IMS communication service are required to be included in the path of the standalone transaction or SIP session at the establishment of the SIP dialogue and therefore can not be linked in after the initial SIP request, i.e. once a SIP session has been established, it is not possible to change the IMS communication service for that session. A UE can establish a new SIP session with another IMS communication service identifier if it is required to add a media that is not supported by the existing IMS communication service.\nThe need of applying a service identifier is to be taken within the specification of each individual service.\nThe communication service identifier identifies IMS communication services and shall be included in the relevant SIP methods.\nThe IMS communication service identifier shall fulfil the following requirements:\n1.\tIt shall be possible for the UE and an Application Server (AS) to set the IMS communication service identifier in a SIP request, e.g. in the REGISTER and INVITE request.\n2.\tBased on operator policy the S-CSCF or an AS shall be able to validate an IMS communication service identifier in a SIP request. This includes e.g. to check the syntactical correctness of a service identifier, and policing the usage of a communication service identifier. It shall also be possible for the S-CSCF and an AS to indicate that the value of the IMS communication service is validated. An asserted IMS communication service identifier shall be able to be indicated by the service in SIP responses to the SIP request along with information that the IMS communication service identifier is asserted.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the asserted IMS communication service provided in the SIP response differs from the requested IMS communication service, the UE can make a local decision on whether it wish to continue the session. The UE will ignore any IMS communication service it does not support. User interaction is not needed.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the asserted IMS communication service provided in the SIP response differs from the requested IMS communication service, the VPLMN can make a local decision on whether it wish to continue the session. If continuing, the asserted IMS communication service is used in VPLMN for the remainder of the session (e.g. to provide service aware charging).\n3.\tIt shall be possible, e.g. for the UE, S-CSCF and AS, to identify an IMS service uniquely by the IMS communication service identifier.\n4.\tIt shall be possible for the S-CSCF to invoke appropriate service logic based on the IMS communication service identifier contained in a SIP request, e.g. route a SIP request containing a service identifier based on initial filter criteria to the correct AS.\n5.\tIt shall be possible for the UE to invoke appropriate application based on the IMS communication service identifier contained in a received SIP request.\n6.\tIt shall be possible for the UE to indicate its service capabilities to the network, e.g. during registration, using the IMS communication service identifier.\nNOTE 4:\tThe UE does not need to indicate all the service capabilities it supports to the network.\n7.\tIt shall be possible for the network to inform the UE about service capabilities, represented by ICSIs, of the network.\n8.\tThe structure of the IMS communication service identifier shall be as simple as possible, i.e. the IMS communication service identifier shall be limited to identify a service.\n9.\tBased on operator policy S-CSCF and AS shall consider the IMS communication service identifier for online and offline charging, e.g. put appropriate data into call detailed records.\n10.\tThe communication service identifier shall be capable of being an input into the policy control and charging rules.\n11.\tIt shall be possible to use the IMS communication service identifier as a means to authorize whether a subscriber is allowed to initiate or receive request for a communication service.\n12.\tThe communication service identifier shall be taken into account when selecting the correct UE(s), if multiple UEs are registered for the same Public User Identity(s).\n13.\tThe usage of communication service identifiers shall not adversely affect interoperability between IMS networks and interoperability with external SIP networks and CS networks. The behaviour of a network receiving the IMS requests without an IMS communication service identifier is a matter of operator policy.

This is similar to the normal Mobile Terminating cases for IMS, but in this case the CS domain subscribers do not have an IMS subscription.

Traffic from the enterprise network arrives at a provisioned routing entity and needs to be routed to either an IP network or to the PSTN depending on the terminating endpoint.\nc)\tIMS operator providing transit functionality to other network operators:\nIn this case the operator is serving as an IMS session based routing backbone for a PSTN operator or another IP network and provides connectivity to both PSTN and IP endpoints (PSTN <-> PSTN, IP <-> IP, PSTN <-> IP). Traffic from the PSTN operator arrives at configured MGCFs for translation to SIP. IMS traffic arrives at a configured entry point.

The specification of these databases is out of the scope of this document, but the NP data may be accessed through ENUM/DNS or accessed via existing (PSTN- and CS-domain) NP databases using the legacy PSTN/CS-domain protocols, such as TCAP.\nSupport of NP within a network and the exact means to make the number portability data available to IMS, is subject to and configured per operator policy. NP is not mandated by this specification on any network operator.\nAs configured per operator policy, IMS ENUM interfaces can be updated to support handling of the PSTN ENUM service per IETF RFC 4769 [57], which provides a URI containing an E.164 number with NP routing information and NP dip indicators.

All long distance calls from a subscriber are routed to the long distance circuit carrier when preferred circuit carrier access applies. A SIP message parameter indicates the preferred circuit carrier selected. This parameter can be delivered to the PSTN. An application server can be used to insert preferred circuit carrier parameters. The BGCF needs to consider, and can insert, the preferred circuit carrier parameters when routing calls towards an MGCF.\nPreferred Circuit Carrier Selection per call, also known as Dial-around, allows the subscriber to request a long distance carrier for a specific call. A dial-around request is dialled by the subscriber along with the called party number at call origination. As configured per operator policy, the dial-around circuit carrier selection can take precedence over other preferred circuit carrier selection that can be configured in the network. Therefore, based on operator policy, the preferred circuit carrier parameter is not to be replaced if already present in a SIP message with a dial-around indicator. A SIP message parameter indicates the preferred circuit carrier selected with a dial-around indicator. This parameter is delivered to the PSTN.\nSupport of preferred circuit carrier access and dial-around is optional within a network and is subject to, and configured per, operator policy.\n",

To enable P-CSCF discovery after the establishment of IP connectivity, the IP-Connectivity Access Network shall provide the following P-CSCF discovery option to the UE:\n-\tUse of DHCP to provide the UE with the domain name and/or IP address of a Proxy-CSCF and the address of a Domain Name Server (DNS) that is capable of resolving the Proxy-CSCF name, as described below in clause 5.1.1.1.\n-\tThe UE may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP IMS Management Object (MO), TS 24.167 [64] or in the ISIM, TS 31.103 [69]) to know the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the P-CSCF or its IP address.

See clause 5.2.1a for details.\n10.\tIt shall be possible to register a Public User Identity that is simultaneously shared across multiple contact addresses (at the same or via separate UEs) via IMS registration procedures. However, each registration and each de-registration process always relates to a particular contact address and a particular Private User Identity.\nThe number of allowed simultaneous registrations is defined by home operator policy, e.g. locally configured at the S-CSCF or, when registration is requested via separate UEs, per subscribed value if received from the HSS.\n10a.\tIt shall be possible for the UE to indicate to the network whether the registration adds a new contact to an existing registration from the same UE.\n11.\tRegistration of a Public User Identity shall not affect the status of already registered Public User Identity(s), unless due to requirements by Implicit Registration set defined in clause 5.2.1a.\n12.\tWhen multiple UEs share the same public identity (es), each UE shall be able to register its contact address(es) with IMS.\n13.\tThe UE may indicate its capabilities and characteristics in terms of SIP User Agent capabilities and characteristics described in IETF RFC 3840 [38] during IMS registration. The UE may also update its capabilities by initiating a re-registration when the capabilities are changed on the UE.\n14.\tIf a UE supports GRUU, the UE shall indicate its support for GRUUs and obtain a P-GRUU and a T-GRUU for each registered Public User Identity during IMS registration as described in RFC 5627 [49].\n15.\tThe P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the IMS Signalling connectivity after successful initial user IMS Registration.\n16.\tWhen the access network type information is available from the access network, the P-CSCF shall ensure that the IMS registration request received from the UE to the SIP server (e.g. S-CSCF) contains the correct information.

                            "text_content": "The additional requirement for the registration information flow for this clause is:\n1.\tA Serving-CSCF is assigned at registration, this does not preclude additional Serving-CSCFs or change of CSCF at a later date. Procedures for use of additional CSCFs are not standardised in this release.\nThe following are considered as assumptions for the registration procedures as described in clause 5.3.2.3:\n1.\tIP-CAN bearer is already established for signalling and a mechanism exists for the first REGISTER message to be forwarded to the proxy.\n2.\tThe I-CSCF shall use a mechanism for determining the Serving-CSCF address based on the required capabilities. The I-CSCF obtains the name of the S-CSCF from its role as an S-CSCF selector (Figure 5.1) for the determination and allocation of the Serving-CSCF during registration.\n3.\tThe decision for selecting the S-CSCF for the user in the network is made in the I-CSCF.\n4.\tA role of the I-CSCF is the S-CSCF selection.\nIn the information flows described in clauses 5.2.2.3 and 5.2.2.4, there is a mechanism to resolve a name and address. The text in the information flows indicates when the name-address resolution mechanism is utilised. These flows do not take into account security features such as user authentication. The description of the impact of IMS security features is done in TS 33.203 [19].\nThe application level registration can be initiated after the registration to the access is performed, and after IP connectivity for the signalling has been gained from the access network. For the purpose of the registration information flows, the user is considered to be always roaming. For user roaming in their home network, the home network shall perform the role of the visited network elements and the home network elements.\nThe figure depicts a registration process for a user who is not registered, highlighting the need for proper user identification and authentication in telecommunication systems.\nFigure 5.1: Registration – User not registered\n1.\tAfter the UE has obtained IP connectivity, it can perform the IM registration. To do so, the UE sends the Register information flow to the proxy (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, home network domain name, UE IP address, Instance Identifier, GRUU Support Indication).\n2.\tUpon receipt of the register information flow, the P-CSCF shall examine the \"home domain name\" to discover the entry point to the home network (i.e. the I-CSCF). The proxy shall send the Register information flow to the I-CSCF (P-CSCF address/name, Public User Identity, Private User Identity, P-CSCF network identifier, UE IP address). A name-address resolution mechanism is utilised in order to determine the address of the home network from the home domain name. The P-CSCF network identifier is a string that identifies at the home network, the network where the P-CSCF is located (e.g. the P-CSCF network identifier may be the domain name of the P-CSCF network).\n3.\tThe I-CSCF shall send the Cx-Query/Cx-Select-Pull information flow to the HSS (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, P-CSCF network identifier).\nThe HSS shall check whether the user is registered already. The HSS shall indicate whether the user is allowed to register in that P-CSCF network (identified by the P-CSCF network identifier) according to the User subscription and operator limitations/restrictions if any.\n4.\tCx-Query Resp/Cx-Select-Pull Resp is sent from the HSS to the I-CSCF. It shall contain the S-CSCF name, if it is known by the HSS, or the S-CSCF capabilities, if it is necessary to select a new S-CSCF. When capabilities are returned, the I-CSCF shall construct a name from the capabilities returned.\nIf the checking in HSS was not successful the Cx-Query Resp shall reject the registration attempt.\n5.\tThe I-CSCF, using the name of the S-CSCF, shall determine the address of the S-CSCF through a name-address resolution mechanism. The name-address resolution mechanism is allowed to take the load information of the S-CSCFs (e.g. obtained using network management procedures) into consideration when deciding the address of the S-CSCF. The I-CSCF also determines the name of a suitable home network contact point, possibly based on information received from the HSS. I-CSCF shall then send the register information flow (P-CSCF address/name, Public User Identity, Private User Identity, P-CSCF network identifier, UE IP address to the selected S-CSCF. The home network contact point will be used by the P-CSCF to forward session initiation signalling to the home network.\nThe S-CSCF shall reject the registration if the number of registered contact addresses for a Public User Identity from the same UE exceeds the limit of simultaneous registrations configured at the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF shall also reject the registration from separate UEs if the allowed number of simultaneous registrations according to the S-CSCF configuration or per subscribed value for a Public User Identity received from the HSS exceeds the limit of simultaneous registrations. The S-CSCF shall store the P-CSCF address/name, as supplied by the visited network. This represents the address/name that the home network forwards the subsequent terminating session signalling to the UE. The S-CSCF shall store the P-CSCF Network ID information.\n6.\tThe S-CSCF shall send Cx-Put/Cx-Pull (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, S-CSCF name) to the HSS.\n7.\tThe HSS shall store the S-CSCF name for that user and return the information flow Cx-Put Resp/Cx-Pull Resp (user information) to the S-CSCF. The user information passed from the HSS to the S-CSCF shall include one or more names/addresses information which can be used to access the platform(s) used for service control while the user is registered at this S-CSCF. The S-CSCF shall store the information for the indicated user. In addition to the names/addresses information, security information may also be sent for use within the S-CSCF.\n8.\tBased on the filter criteria, the S-CSCF shall send register information to the service control platform and perform whatever service control procedures are appropriate.\n9.\tThe S-CSCF shall return the 200 OK information flow (home network contact information, a GRUU set) to the I-CSCF.\n10.\tThe I-CSCF shall send information flow 200 OK (home network contact information, a GRUU set) to the P-CSCF. The I-CSCF shall release all registration information after sending information flow 200 OK.\n11.\tThe P-CSCF shall store the home network contact information, and shall send information flow 200 OK (a GRUU set) to the UE. The P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the IMS Signalling connectivity from PCRF/PCF (see TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95] for more details).\nIf the S-CSCF receives the priority information of the MPS subscribed-UE as a part of user profile from the HSS, the S-CSCF provides the priority information to the P-CSCF and the P-CSCF stores this information for the MPS-subscribed UE.\nPeriodic application level re-registration is initiated by the UE either to refresh an existing registration or in response to a change in the registration status of the UE. A re-registration procedure can also be initiated when the capabilities of the UE have changed or the IP-CAN has changed. The UE should perform IMS re-registration when the IP-CAN used by the UE changes between 3GPP access and WLAN access.\nRe-registration follows the same process as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 \"Registration Information Flow – User not registered\". When initiated by the UE, based on the registration time established during the previous registration, the UE shall keep a timer shorter than the registration related timer in the network.\nNOTE 1: if the UE does not re-register, any active sessions may be deactivated.\nThe figure depicts a user currently registered in a 5G network, with a focus on the re-registration process. The user is shown as a red dot, indicating their current status, and the re-registration process is depicted as a green line, indicating the path to re-register. The figure also includes a label \"User currently registered\" to clearly identify the user's status.\nFigure 5.2: Re-registration - user currently registered\n1.\tThe UE initiates a re-registration. For periodic registration, the UE initiates a re-registration prior to expiry of the agreed registration timer. To re-register, the UE sends a new REGISTER request. The UE sends the REGISTER information flow to the proxy (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, home network domain name, UE IP address, capability information, Instance Identifier, GRUU Support Indication).\n2.\tUpon receipt of the register information flow, the P-CSCF shall examine the \"home domain name\" to discover the entry point to the home network (i.e. the I-CSCF). The proxy does not use the entry point cached from prior registrations. The proxy shall send the Register information flow to the I-CSCF (P-CSCF address/name, Public User Identity, Private User Identity, P-CSCF network identifier, UE IP address). A name-address resolution mechanism is utilised in order to determine the address of the home network from the home domain name. The P-CSCF network identifier is a string that identifies at the home network, the network where the P-CSCF is located (e.g. the P-CSCF network identifier may be the domain name of the P-CSCF network).\nNOTE 2:\tThe P-CSCF may force the UE to attempt initial registration with another P-CSCF, instead of forwarding its re-registration request. This is useful e.g. to move users from a P-CSCF to another P-CSCF without interrupting the service to these users.\n3.\tThe I-CSCF shall send the Cx-Query information flow to the HSS (Public User Identity, Private User Identity and P-CSCF network identifier).\n4.\tThe HSS shall check whether the user is registered already and return an indication indicating that an S-CSCF is assigned. The Cx-Query Resp (indication of entry contact point, e.g. S-CSCF) is sent from the HSS to the I-CSCF.\n5.\tThe I-CSCF, using the name of the S-CSCF, shall determine the address of the S-CSCF through a name-address resolution mechanism. The I-CSCF also determines the name of a suitable home network contact point, possibly based on information received from the HSS. I-CSCF shall then send the register information flow (P-CSCF address/name, Public User Identity, Private User Identity, P-CSCF network identifier, UE IP address to the selected S-CSCF. The home network contact point will be used by the P-CSCF to forward session initiation signalling to the home network.\nThe S-CSCF shall store the P-CSCF address/name, as supplied by the visited network. This represents the address/name that the home network forwards the subsequent terminating session signalling to the UE.\n6.\tThe S-CSCF shall send Cx-Put/Cx-Pull (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, S-CSCF name) to the HSS. Note: Optionally as an optimisation, the S-CSCF can detect that this is a re-registration and omit the Cx-Put/Cx-Pull request.\n7.\tThe HSS shall stores the S-CSCF name for that user and return the information flow Cx-Put Resp/Cx-Pull-Resp (user information) to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF shall store the user information for that indicated user.\n8.\tBased on the filter criteria, the S-CSCF shall send re-registration information to the service control platform and perform whatever service control procedures are appropriate.\nNOTE 3:\tThe service control environment can be notified of the current IP-CAN type serving the UE via this procedure.\n9.\tThe S-CSCF shall return the 200 OK information flow (home network contact information, a GRUU set) to the I-CSCF.\n10.\tThe I-CSCF shall send information flow 200 OK (home network contact information, a GRUU set) to the P-CSCF. The I-CSCF shall release all registration information after sending information flow 200 OK.\n11.\tThe P-CSCF shall store the home network contact information, and shall send information flow 200 OK (a GRUU set) to the UE.\nIf the S-CSCF receives the priority information of the MPS subscribed-UE as a part of user profile from the HSS, the S-CSCF provides the priority information to the P-CSCF and the P-CSCF stores this information for the MPS-subscribed UE.\nTable 5.1 provides an indication of some of the information stored in the indicated nodes during and after the registration process. Note that Table 5.1 is not an exhaustive list of stored information, i.e. there can be additional information stored due to registration.\nTable 5.1 Information Storage before, during and after the registration process\n\n",

To ensure stable S-CSCF operation and carrier grade service, a mechanism to handle the ungraceful session termination issue is required. This mechanism should be at the SIP protocol level in order to guarantee access independence for the IM CN subsystem.\nThe IM CN subsystem can initiate a Network Initiated De-Registration procedures for the following reasons:\n-\tNetwork Maintenance.\nForced re-registrations from users, e.g. in the case of data inconsistency at node failure, in the case of UICC lost, etc. Cancelling the current contexts of the user spread among the IM CN Subsystem network nodes at registration, and imposing a new IM registration solves this condition.\n-\tNetwork/traffic determined.\nThe IM CN subsystem must support a mechanism to avoid duplicate registrations or inconsistent information storage. This case will occur when a user roams to a different network without de-registering the previous one. This case may occur at the change of the roaming agreement parameters between two operators, imposing new service conditions to roamers.\n-\tApplication Layer determined.\n The service capability offered by the IM CN Subsystem to the Application Layers may have parameters specifying whether all IM CN subsystem registrations are to be removed, or only those from one or a group of terminals from the user, etc.\n-\tSubscription Management\nThe operator must be able to restrict user access to the IM CN subsystem upon detection of contract expiration, removal of IM subscription, fraud detection, etc. In the case of changes in service profile of the user, e.g. the user subscribes to new services, it may possible that new S-CSCF capabilities, which are required from the S-CSCF, are not supported by the current S-CSCF which has been assigned to the user. In this case, it shall be possible to actively change the S-CSCF by using the network initiated de-registration by HSS procedure.\nThe following clauses provide scenarios showing SIP application de-registration. Note that these flows have avoided the strict use of specific SIP protocol message names. This is in an attempt to focus on the architectural aspects rather than the protocol.\nTwo types of network-initiated de-registration procedures are required:\n-\tTo deal with registrations expirations.\n-\tTo allow the network to force de-registrations following any of the approved possible causes for this to occur.\nThe following flow shows a network initiated IM CN subsystem terminal application (SIP) de-registration based on a registration timeout. A timer value is provided at initial registration and is refreshed by subsequent re-registrations. The flow assumes that the timer has expired. The locations (home or visited network) of the P-CSCF and S-CSCF are not indicated as the scenario remains the same for all cases.\nThe figure depicts a network initiated application de-registration and registration timeout process, illustrating the steps taken to ensure the proper functioning of the network.\nFigure 5.4: Network initiated application de-registration, registration timeout\n1.\tThe registration timers in the P-CSCF and in the S-CSCF expire. The timers are assumed to be close enough that no external synchronisation is required. The P-CSCF updates its internal databases to remove the Public User Identity from being registered. It is assumed that any cleanup of IP-Connectivity Access Network resources will be handled by independent means. If the P-CSCF has an active subscription to notifications of the status of the IMS Signalling connectivity, the P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription (see TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95] for more details).\n2.\tBased on the filter criteria, the S-CSCF shall send de-registration information to the service control platform and perform whatever service control procedures are appropriate. Service control platform removes all subscription information related to this specific Public User Identity.\n3.\tBased on operator choice the S-CSCF can send either Cx-Put (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, clear S-CSCF name) or Cx-Put (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, keep S-CSCF name), and the Public User Identity is no longer considered registered in the S-CSCF. If the user has (originating – see 5.6.5, or terminating – see 5.12) services related to unregistered state, the S-CSCF sends Cx-Put (Public User Identity, Private User Identity, keep S-CSCF name) in order to keep the S-CSCF name in the HSS for these services.\nThe HSS then either clears or keeps S-CSCF name for that Public User Identity according to Cx-Put the request. If the S-CSCF name is kept, then the HSS shall be able to clear the serving S-CSCF name at any time.\n4.\tThe HSS shall send Cx-Put Resp to the S-CSCF to acknowledge the sending of Cx-Put.\nFor different reasons (e.g. subscription termination, lost terminal, etc.) a home network administrative function may determine a need to clear a user's SIP registration. This function initiates the de-registration procedure and may reside in various elements depending on the exact reason for initiating the de-registration.\nOne such home network element is the HSS, which already knows the S-CSCF serving the user and that for this purpose makes use of the Cx-Deregister. Another home network element that could initiate the de-registration is the S-CSCF, in which case it makes use of the Cx-Put to inform the HSS. Other trusted/secured parties may also initiate de-registration to the S-CSCF.\nThe following flow shows a network initiated IM CN subsystem terminal application (SIP) de-registration based on an administrative action for example. The IP transport infrastructure is not notified. If complete packet access is to be denied, a transport layer administrative mechanism would be used. This scenario does not address the administrative mechanisms used for updating any subscriber records, EIR records, access authorization, etc. This scenario only addresses the specific action of clearing the SIP application registration that is currently in effect.\nAs determined by the operator, on-going sessions may be released by using network initiated session release procedures in clause 5.10.3.\nThe figure depicts a network initiated application de-registration process, where HSS (Home Service Switching) is used to manage network-initiated applications. The process involves de-registering the application from the network, which can be initiated by the user or the application itself. This is done to ensure that the application is not consuming network resources unnecessarily. The figure also shows the administrative interface where the de-registration process can be initiated and managed.\nFigure 5.5: Network initiated application de-registration by HSS, administrative\n1.\tHSS initiates the de-registration, sending a Cx-Deregister (user identity) which may include the reason for the de-registration.\n2.\tBased on the filter criteria, the S-CSCF shall send de-registration information to the service control platform and perform whatever service control procedures are appropriate.\n3.\tThe S-CSCF issues a de-registration towards the P-CSCF for this user and updates its internal database to remove the user from being registered.

If the P-CSCF has an active subscription to notifications of the status of the IMS Signalling connectivity, the P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription (see TS 23.203 [54] for more details).\n6.\tWhen possible, the UE sends a response to the P-CSCF to acknowledge the de-registration. A misbehaving UE or a UE that is out of P-CSCF coverage could not answer properly to the de-registration request. The P-CSCF should perform the de-registration in any case, e.g. after the timer for this request expires.\nIf the UE does not perform automatic re-registration due to the de-registration the user shall be informed about the de-registration and of the reason, if available.\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 4 and 5 may be done in parallel: the P-CSCF does not wait for an answer from the UE before answering to the S-CSCF\n7.\tThe S-CSCF returns a response to the entity that initiated the process.\nNOTE 2:\tAnother trusted/secured party may also request for de-registration via HSS through administrative mechanisms provided by the operator.\nA service platform may determine a need to clear a user's SIP registration. This function initiates the de-registration procedure and resides in a service platform.\nThe following flow shows a service control initiated IMS terminal application (SIP) de-registration.\nThe figure depicts a network initiated application de-registration process, with the service platform being the central element. The application de-registration process is initiated by the network, which is a crucial step in ensuring the smooth functioning of the network. The service platform is responsible for managing the de-registration process, ensuring that the application is deactivated and removed from the network. This process is essential for maintaining network stability and efficiency.\nFigure 5.5a: Network initiated application de-registration, service platform\n1.\tThe S-CSCF receives de-registration information from the service platform and invokes whatever service logic procedures are appropriate. This information may include the reason for the de-registration.\n2.\tThe S-CSCF issues a de-registration towards the P-CSCF for this user and updates its internal database to remove the user from being registered.

The use of default codecs within the UE enables the IM CN subsystem to interwork with other networks on an end to end basis or through transcoding.\nThe IM CN subsystem is also able to interwork with the CS networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, CS domain of some PLMN) by supporting transcoding in the IMS MGW element. Furthermore to allow interworking between users of the IM CN subsystem and IP multimedia fixed terminals and other codecs may (this is implementation dependent) be supported by the MGW.\nIn order to support existing network capabilities, it is required that IMS supports endpoints (e.g. UE, MRFP, MGCF for interworking with the PSTN) able to send or receive DTMF tone indications using the bearer, i.e. inband signalling. An additional element for bearer interworking is the interworking of these DTMF tones and out-of-band signalling between one network and another.

The session signalling shall ensure that these resources (including IP-Connectivity Access Network resources and IP multimedia backbone resources) are made available or reserved before the destination UE rings.\nThis should nevertheless not prevent the UE from offering to the end-user the choice of accepting or rejecting the components of the session before establishing the bearers.\n2.\tDepending on regulatory requirements, the IP multimedia service shall be able to charge the originating party for the IP-Connectivity Access Network service of both originating and destination side or when reverse charging applies to charge the terminating party for the IP-Connectivity Access Network service of both originating and terminating side. This implies that it should be easy to correlate CDR held by the IP-Connectivity Access Network service with a session.\n3.\tThe session control function of IP multimedia network of an operator (CSCF) shall be able (according to operator choice) to have a strict control (e.g. on source /destination IP address, QoS) on the flows associated with session established through SIP entering the IP multimedia bearer network from IP-Connectivity Access Network service.

This is needed in order to route these session requests through certain nodes, e.g. the ones performing Service Control, or interconnect functions. CSCFs are assumed to perform certain actions:\n1.\tCSCFs (Proxy and Serving) store a certain part of the session path determined during session initiation. This allows CSCFs to generate requests that traverse all elements on a Route path.\n2.\tThe P-CSCF shall check correct usage of the header values. Should an UE build inaccurate header(s) in a SIP request, the P-CSCF may reject the request. If an operator policy requires enforcing the routes stored in P-CSCF, the P-CSCF shall overwrite the header(s) provided by the UE with the appropriate values.\nAll SIP signalling to or from the UE traverses the P-CSCF.\nAll initial requests to or from the UE traverse the S-CSCF assigned to the UE. The S-CSCF uses the \"Record-Route\" mechanism defined in IETF RFC 3261 [12] to remain in the signalling path for subsequent requests too; in short terms: the S-CSCF \"record-routes\". This is considered the default behaviour for all IMS communication. However, if Application Servers under operator control guarantee the home control of the session, then it may not be required that all subsequent requests traverse the S-CSCF. In such cases the operator may choose that the S-CSCF does not \"record-route\". The detailed record-route behaviour is configured in the S-CSCF, e.g. on a per-service basis. The S-CSCF decides whether it performs record-routing or not based on operator configuration in the S-CSCF.\nSee also Annex F for background information.\n",

In addition, the destination user may have different preferences of type of media depending on who is originating and on the situation e.g. being in a meeting or driving the car, etc.\nThe general objectives concerning terminal capabilities and end-user behaviour are listed below.\n-\tThe capabilities of the terminal have impact on the SDP description in the SIP session flows, since different terminals may support different media types (such as video, audio, application or data) and may have implemented different set of codecs for audio and video. Note that the capabilities of the terminal may change when an external device, such as a video camera is attached to the terminal.\n-\tThe configuration of the terminal changes the capabilities of the terminal. This can be done by attaching external devices or possibly by a user setting of certain parameters or profiles in the terminal.\n-\tThe preferences of the destination user may depend on who is originating the session and on the situation. Cost, associated with the session, may also be another factor, i.e. depending on time of the day or day of the week etc. Due to this reason the user may want to accept or reject certain media components.\n-\tThe available resources in the network play an important role, as certain media streams, consuming high bandwidth, may be denied. Therefore, before the user is alerted that the session set up is successful, it is assumed that the network has guaranteed and has reserved the needed resources for one or several media streams of the session. This does not preclude the possibility for the user to indicate his/her preferences regarding the session also after the alerting, in which case the initial resource reservations may have to be modified.\n-\tEnd-to-end quality of service may be provided by using a variety of mechanisms, including guaranteed end-to-end QoS and best effort. The network may not be able to guarantee the requested end-to-end QoS. This may be the case when the user is establishing sessions through the public Internet. On the other hand, certain sessions, with the agreement of the initiating and terminating endpoints, should have the right to go through even without having the requested QoS guarantee.\nFrom the end-user point of view the following user interactions can be listed:\n-\tFor outgoing sessions, it is assumed that the user would like to select certain parameters that define the proposed session. This can be pre-configured as preferences or defined on a per session basis.\n-\tFor incoming sessions, it is assumed that the terminal will establish a dialogue with the user. Such dialogue allows the user to manually accept some of the proposed parameters by the originator. This is typically media type (audio, video, whiteboard) and different quality parameters per media type. As an alternative, the user preferences may be pre-configured.\n-\tBefore establishing or accepting a new session, the user may define or agree on the following parameters. Some of these parameters may be pre-configured and others are defined on a per session basis.\n1.\tType of media, i.e. audio, video, whiteboard, etc. This represents the user preferences of media types.\n2.\tCombination of QoS attributes and selection of codec. This represents the quality of the media component, the cost and the probability of availability of resources both in the access network and in the core network.\n3.\tSubset of capabilities used in the terminal. Terminals can have different set of capabilities. However, the user may or may not want to use the maximum set of capabilities. For instance, a user might want to establish a low cost video session with a small window on the screen.\n4.\tEnd-to-end quality of service. For certain media streams, the user may want assured end-to-end QoS while for other streams the QoS may be optional or even not desired at all (best effort).\nIn order to fulfil the above requirements, it is needed that the destination user can be pre-alerted before the bearer establishment and negotiation and IP-Connectivity Access Network bearer activation has taken place. This gives room for the destination user to choose the media streams and codecs required before an expensive resource (as the air interface is) is established.\nFigure 5.7 shows the mechanism for the bearer establishment in which the pre-alerting occurs before the initial bearer creation procedures are performed. Furthermore, a user interaction may also occur after the initial bearers are created as shown in figure 5.7. If the session originator receives multiple provisional responses for the same session indicating that the session has been forked in the network, the UE may choose to process a pre-configured number of responses. In the case of multiple responses, the resources requested by the UE shall be the \"logical OR\" (i.e. least upper bound) of the resources indicated in the multiple responses to avoid allocation of unnecessary resources. The UE shall never request more resources then was originally proposed in the Original INVITE.\nThe \"Other x-CSCFs\" entity in figure 5.7 comprises several CSCFs: I-CSCF and S-CSCFs. For the sake of simplicity only the IP-Connectivity Access Network is shown, and the Policy Decision Functions have been omitted from the diagram.\nThe figure depicts a bearer establishment with optional pre-alerting, illustrating the process of establishing a bearer connection. The diagram shows the steps involved, including the use of pre-alerting to ensure the connection is established correctly.\nFigure 5.7: Bearer establishment showing optional pre-alerting\n1.\tUE(A) starts a Session Initiation procedure to UE(B) that includes an SDP proposal.\nThe steps 2-4 are optional and may depend on terminal implementation and/or terminal pre-configured settings.\n2.\tThe user at UE(B) is pre-alerted.\n3.\tAn indication of the pre-alerting may be sent towards UE(A).\n4.\tUser at UE(B) will then interact and express his/her wishes regarding the actual session.\n5.\tUE(B) generates accepted SDP based on terminal settings, terminal pre-configured profiles and optionally the user's wishes.\n6.\tThe accepted SDP is forwarded to UE(A) in the payload of a reliable SIP response.\n7.\tInitial bearer creation procedure is performed. During this bearer creation step the resources in the UE(A)'s and UE(B)'s IP-CANs are reserved. Bearer resources in external networks may also be reserved at this point.\nThe steps 8-10 are also optional and may be skipped.\n8.\tTerminal at UE(B) starts ringing.\n9.\tThe alerting indication is sent towards UE(A).\n10.\tUser at UE(B) may interact and express his/her wishes regarding the actual session.\n11.\tUE(A) and UE(B) may perform bearer modification procedure at this point, if the initial bearers reserved in step 7 and the wishes of user at UE(B) are different. During this bearer modification step the resources in the IP-CANs of UE(A) and UE(B) may be modified, and the resource reservation in the external network may also be modified.\n12.\tSession initiation procedure is acknowledged.\nThe pre-alerting or alerting indications returned to the originating UE shall enable the originating UE to inform the calling user of the session progress prior to the arrival of the incoming media (for example the originating UE may synthesise ringing locally).\n",

It is operator choice whether to offer both or only one of these alternatives for accessing the IM Subsystem.\nWhen using IP-CAN without Policy and Charging Control, IP-CAN bearers are established according to the user's subscription, local operator's IP bearer resource based policy, local operator's admission control function and roaming agreements.\nWhen using IP-CAN with Policy and Charging Control, PCC decisions (e.g. authorization and control) are also applied to the IP-CAN bearer.\nThe description in this clause and the following clauses (clauses 5.4.7.1 - 5.4.7.7) is applicable for the case when Policy and Charging Control is employed.\nThe IP-Connectivity Access Network contains a Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF, in 5GS corresponding to the combination of SMF and UPF) that has the capability of policing packet flow into the IP network, and restricting the set of IP destinations that may be reached from/through an IP-CAN bearer according to a packet classifier.\nNOTE:\tHow PCEF is distributed in SMF and UPF in 5GS is specified in TS 23.501 [93] and TS 23.203 [54].\nThis policy 'gate' function has an external control interface that allows it to be selectively 'opened' or 'closed' on the basis of IP destination address and port. When open, the gate allows packets to pass through (to the destination specified in the classifier) and when closed, no packets are allowed to pass through. The control is performed by a PCRF/PCF (the interface between the PCRF/PCF and the P-CSCF is the Rx interface standardised in TS 23.203 [54] or the N5 interface (using the Npcf_PolicyAutorization service), standardised in TS 23.503 [95] and TS 29.514 [96]).\nThere are eight interactions defined for Policy and Charging Control:\n1.\tAuthorize QoS Resources.\n2.\tResource Reservation.\n3.\tEnabling of media flows authorized in (1), e.g. 'open' the 'gate'.\n4.\tDisabling of media flows authorized in (1), e.g. 'close' the 'gate'.\n5.\tRevoke Authorization for IP-CAN and IP resources.\n6.\tIndication of IP-CAN bearer release from the PCEF in the IP-Connectivity Access Network to the PCRF/PCF.\n7.\tAuthorization of IP-CAN bearer modification.\n8.\tIndication of IP-CAN bearer modification from the PCEF in the IP-Connectivity Access Network to the PCRF/PCF.\nThese requirements and functional description of these interactions are explained further in the following clauses. The complete specification of the interface between the PCRF/PCF and the PCEF is contained in TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95].\nThe Policy and Charging Control can also be used to enable the P-CSCF to retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information from the access network as specified in TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95].\nThe Authorize QoS Resources procedure is used during an establishment and a modification of a SIP session. The P-CSCF shall use the SDP contained in the SIP signalling to derive the session information that is relevant for Policy and Charging Control and forwards it to the PCRF/PCF. The PCRF/PCF shall use the received information to calculate the proper authorization. This enables the PCRF/PCF to authorize the required QoS resources.\nNOTE:\tAlthough session information is incomplete in the terminating side P-CSCF at the reception of the SDP offer, it can be sent to PCRF/PCF whenever the SDP offer (contained in the session establishment request or session modification request) indicates no requirements for resource reservation or that the required resources are already available on the originating side, as in such cases no SDP answer is received before the PCRF/PCF is requested to authorize the required QoS resources.\nThe authorization shall be expressed in terms of the IP resources to be authorized and shall include limits on media flows, and may include restrictions on IP destination address and port. The PCC shall authorize each SIP session independently (including additional parallel sessions, e.g. Call Waiting) and shall take into consideration the amount of IP resources the user's subscription allows.\nThe IP-CAN provides the Policy and Charging Enforcement Point that implements the policy decisions for performing admission control and authorising the IP-CAN and IP BS QoS Resource request, and policing media flows entering the external IP network.\nAuthorization of IP-CAN and IP QoS Resources shall be required for access to the IP Multimedia Subsystem. The IP-CAN shall determine the need for authorization, possibly based on provisioning and/or based on requested parameters, which may be IP-CAN specific.\nResource Reservation is initiated either by the UE or the IP-CAN depending on the bearer establishment mode selected for the IP-CAN session, see TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95]:\n-\tResource reservation requests initiated from the UE shall (if possible for the used IP-CAN) contain the traffic mapping information which enables the IP-CAN to correctly match the reservation request to the corresponding authorization. The authorization is normally 'Pulled' from the PCRF/PCF by the PCEF within the IP-CAN when the reservation request is received from the UE.\nNOTE:\tWhen a UE combines multiple media flows onto a single IP-CAN bearer, all the traffic mapping information related to those media flows are provided in the resource reservation request.\nWith a request for IP-CAN QoS resources, the PCEF within the IP-CAN shall verify the request is less than the sum of the authorized IP resources (within the error tolerance of the conversion mechanism) for all of the combined media flows.\n-\tResource reservation requests initiated by the IP-CAN take place after successful authorization of QoS resources. The PCRF/PCF \"Pushes\" the authorization for IP-CAN bearer resources to the PCEF within the IP-CAN, which then enforces the authorization by either modifying the characteristics of one existing IP-CAN bearer or requesting the establishment of a new one.\n-\tResource reservation requests initiated by the IP-CAN shall (if possible for the used IP-CAN) contain the traffic mapping information which enables the UE to correctly match the reservation request to the corresponding media of the SIP session.\nThe PCRF/PCF makes policy decisions and provides an indication to the PCEF within the IP-CAN that the user is now allowed to use the allocated QoS resources for per-session authorizations unless this was done based on Policy and Charging Control at the time of the Resource Reservation procedure. If there is more than one response for the same session, indicating that the session has been forked in the network, the PCRF/PCF may authorize the \"logical OR\" of the resources requested in the responses. When the session established indication has been received, if the PCRF/PCF earlier have authorized the \"logical OR\" of the resources then the PCRF/PCF will modify the authorization and enable the corresponding media flows according to the session established indication.\nThe PCEF within the IP-CAN enforces the policy decisions. The IP-CAN shall restrict any use of the IP resources prior to this indication from the PCRF/PCF, e.g. by keeping the gate closed and disabling the use of resources for the media flow. Based on local policy, IP-CAN and/or IP resources may be allowed to be used by the user at the time they are authorized by the PCRF/PCF.\nThe PCRF/PCF makes policy decisions and provides an indication to the PCEF within the IP-CAN about revoking the user's capacity to use the allocated QoS resources for per-session authorizations. The indication for disabling media flows shall be sent as a separate decision to the PCEF within the IP-CAN corresponding to the previous request to enable media flows.\nThe PCEF within the IP-CAN enforces the policy decisions. The IP-CAN shall restrict any use of the IP resources after this indication from the PCRF/PCF, e.g. by closing the gate and blocking the media flow.\nAt IP multimedia session release, the UE should deactivate the IP-CAN bearer(s) used for the IP multimedia session. In various cases the UE will be unable to perform this release itself. The PCRF/PCF provides indication to the PCEF within the IP-CAN when the resources previous authorized, and possibly allocated by the UE, are to be released. The IP-CAN shall deactivate the IP-CAN bearer used for the IP multimedia session.\nAny release of IP-CAN bearer(s) that were established based on authorization from the PCRF/PCF shall be reported to the PCRF/PCF by the PCEF within the IP-CAN.\nThis indication is forwarded to the P-CSCF and may be used by the P-CSCF to initiate a session release towards the remote endpoint e.g. if all IP-CAN bearer(s) associated with the session were released, the procedures in clause 5.10.3.1 can be executed.\nNOTE:\tIf only a subset of IP-CAN bearer(s) were released, then the UE can update the ongoing session with the remainder of allowed media flows or a subset of allowed media flows.\nWhen an IP-CAN bearer is modified by the UE, such that the requested QoS falls outside of the limits that were authorized at IP-CAN bearer activation (or last modification) or such that new binding information is received, then the PCEF within the IP-CAN shall verify the authorization of this IP-CAN bearer modification.\nIf the PCEF within the IP-CAN does not have sufficient information to authorize the IP-CAN bearer modification request, the PCEF within the IP-CAN shall send an authorization request to the PCRF. The PCRF authorizes the modified IP-CAN bearer based on the current session information. Note that the P-CSCF sends an update of the session information in the case of a modification of a SIP session which results in an update of the authorization as described in clause 5.4.7.1.\nWhen the P-CSCF sends an update of the session information and the bearer establishment is controlled by the IP-CAN, the PCRF/PCF shall send an updated authorization to the PCEF. The PCEF within the IP-CAN enforces the policy decision accordingly (e.g. by requesting the reservation of new IP-CAN bearer resources in the case of the addition of a new media component to the session or release of previously reserved resources if a media component has been removed from the IP Multimedia session).\nWhen an IP-CAN bearer is modified such that the maximum bit rate (downlink and uplink) is downgraded to 0 kbit/s or changed from 0 kbit/s to a value that falls within the limits that were authorized at IP-CAN bearer activation (or last modification) then the PCEF within the IP-CAN shall report this to the PCRF/PCF.\nThis indication is forwarded to the P-CSCF and may be used by the P-CSCF to initiate a session release towards the remote endpoint.\nThe following scenarios for concurrent sessions are subject to resource sharing:\n-\tThe UE is engaged in a session, puts the session on hold, then initiates a new session to a new UE.\n-\tThe UE is engaged in a session and receives an incoming session, puts the ongoing session on hold to accept the incoming session.\n-\tThe UE is engaged in multiple sessions, puts all sessions on hold and creates a conferencing session.\nFor a UE engaged in multiple sessions, with only one active session at any time, the network may be able to share resources for media components of the same type and that are common to these multiple sessions.\nResource sharing shall only be indicated for concurrent sessions that employ resource reservation based on TS 23.203 [54] or TS 23.503 [95].\nWhen a UE puts a session on hold, it may put all or a subset of the media components of the session on hold. In such a case, the resource sharing applies only to the media components that are on hold and not to the rest of media components belonging to this IMS session\nAn emergency session shall not share resources with any other session.\nNOTE:\tResource sharing to be shared for any media component can be allowed for one direction as well as both directions. According to TS 24.229 [10a] and TS 24.610 [91] it is not prohibited that a UE may send media towards a held UE, i.e. uplink media can occur even when a UE puts a remote UE on hold. The P-CSCF or SIP AS can therefore be locally configured to allow resource sharing in both directions if the P-CSCF or SIP AS knows that the UE will not send media to a remote UE on hold.\nIf the P-CSCF is configured to apply resource sharing, it may at establishment of a new Rx session or a new Npcf_PolicyAutorization application session context with the PCRF/PCF, indicate that resources may be shared in uplink and/or downlink direction by assigning an uplink and/or downlink tag to each media component of an IMS session unless it is an IMS emergency session.\nNOTE:\tThe assignment of tags to media components is regardless of any future sharing decision.\nIf this is the first IMS session of a UE, the P-CSCF shall assign new tags. Upon detection by the P-CSCF that a UE is engaged in multiple sessions, it shall determine if these sessions fulfil the criteria specified in clause 5.4.7.8.1 and have common media components that can share resources. If so, the P-CSCF may activate resource sharing by assigning the same existing tag to each media component whose resources can be shared amongst the IMS sessions. Otherwise, the P-CSCF shall assign new tags that are different from any tag previously assigned for this UE. The PCRF/PCF may then authorize resource sharing based on these tags. For further information, see TS 23.203 [54].\nWhenever resource sharing is active, the P-CSCF shall ensure that the UE can only receive the media flow for one session at a time by closing the gates for all other media flows that can share the same resource, i.e. having the same tag.\nSIP AS may indicate to a supporting P-CSCF to apply resource sharing to each media lines included in SDP of an IMS session. When SIP AS is used, P-CSCF, based on the local policy, may follow the resource sharing policy from SIP AS. The interaction between P-CSCF and SIP AS for handling Resource sharing procedure is defined in TS 24.229 [10a].\n\nThe P-CSCF may indicate to the PCRF/PCF that the resource allocation for a media flow is allowed to use the same priority as other media flows of the same media type for the UE engaged in multiple sessions by providing a priority sharing indicator and an optional pre-emption control information in addition to the application identifier and the service priority. For MCPTT, the service priority and the priority sharing indicator are defined in TS 23.179 [92]. The pre-emption control information is used to indicate to the PCRF/PCF how to perform pre-emption in accordance to TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95].\nThe following scenario is subject to priority sharing:\n--\tThe P-CSCF receives a priority sharing indicator associated with the media flow from the Application Server.\nUpon detection by the P-CSCF that a session includes a priority sharing indicator for a media flow and may optionally include pre-emption control information, the P-CSCF shall convey to the PCRF/PCF the priority sharing indicator and, when available, the pre-emption control information as described in TS 23.203 [54] and TS 23.503 [95].\nNOTE 1:\tThe Application Server is not supposed to include the priority sharing indicator for an emergency session.\nNOTE 2:\tThe priority sharing enables the usage of one bearer per QCI/5QI for a UE having multiple sessions; otherwise sessions with different service priorities would end up in different bearers.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause contains concepts for the relation between the resource reservation procedure and the procedure for end-to-end sessions.\nA precondition is a set of constraints about the session, which are introduced during the session initiation. The recipient of the session generates an answer, but does not alert the user or otherwise proceed with session establishment until the preconditions are met. This can be known through a local event (such as a confirmation of a resource reservation), or through a new set of constraints sent by the caller.\nThe set-up of a \"QoS-Assured\" session will not complete until required resources have been allocated to the session. In a QoS-Assured session, the QoS bearer for the media stream shall be successfully established according to the QoS preconditions defined at the session level before the UE may indicate a successful response to complete the session and alert the other end point. The principles for when a UE shall regard QoS preconditions to be met are:\n-\tA minimum requirement to meet the QoS preconditions defined for a media stream in a certain direction, is that an appropriate IP-CAN bearer is established at the local access for that direction.\n-\tSegmented resource reservation is performed since the end points are responsible to make access network resource reservations via local mechanisms.\n-\tThe end points shall offer the resources it may want to support for the session and negotiate to an agreed set. Multiple negotiation steps may be needed in order to agree on a set of media for the session. The final agreed set is then updated between the end points.\n-\tThe action to take if a UE fails to fulfil the pre-conditions (e.g. failure in establishment of an RSVP session) depends on the reason for failure. If the reason is lack of resources in the network (e.g. an admission control function in the network rejects the request for resources), the UE shall fail to complete the session. For other reasons (e.g. lack of RSVP host or proxy along the path) the action to take is local decision within the UE. It may for example 1) choose to fail to complete the session, 2) attempt to complete the session by no longer requiring some of the additional actions.\nNOTE 1:\tTo avoid unwanted session setup delay and IP-CAN signalling load, QoS-Assured sessions needs to be used with care and it is decided per application which media that require resource reservation.\nThe following cases exist in the context of using \"QoS-Assured\" preconditions for IMS:\na.\tThe IMS session requires the reservation of additional bearer resources, and the UE requires confirmation from the other endpoint of the fulfilment of the pre-conditions related to this resource reservation. An endpoint may not require the reservation of bearer resources, and may therefore immediately indicate the local fulfilment of the pre-conditions. One example of such SIP endpoint is the MGCF used for PSTN interworking. In these cases, one or both of the reservation confirmation messages may not be sent.\nb.\tThe IMS session does not require the reservation of additional bearer resources, and both endpoints indicate in their initial session setup message that the pre-conditions are fulfilled.\nc.\tThe IMS session does not require the reservation of additional bearer resources, and the endpoints do not use the mechanism to indicate \"QoS-Assured\" pre-conditions.\nNOTE 2:\tThe flows of clauses 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 depict the case where both UEs require confirmation from each other of the fulfilment of the pre-conditions. The flow in clause 5.7a depicts the case where the IMS session does not require the reservation of additional bearer resources and the endpoints do not use pre-conditions.\n",

The stimulus for initiating the service event related information message may come from e.g. a service logic residing in an Application Server.\nIn addition, the end points shall also be able to send information to each other. This information shall be delivered using SIP based messages. The corresponding SIP messages shall be forwarded along the IMS SIP signalling path. This includes the S-CSCF but may also include SIP Application Servers. The information may be related or unrelated to any ongoing session and/or may be independent of any session. Applicable mechanisms (for e.g. routing, security, charging, etc) defined for IMS SIP sessions shall also be applied for the SIP based messages delivering the end-point information. The length of the information transferred is restricted by the message size (e.g. the MTU), so fragmentation and re-assembly of the information is not required to be supported in the UE. This information may include e.g. text message, http url, etc.\nThis mechanism considers the following issues:\n-\tThe IMS has the capability to handle different kinds of media. That is, it is possible to provide information contained within several different media formats e.g. text, pictures or video.\n-\tThe UE's level of supporting service event related information and its exchange may depend on the UE's capabilities and configuration.\n-\tA UE not participating in the service related information exchange shall not be effected by a service related information exchange possibly being performed with another UE of the session.\nNOTE:\tThe service event related information exchange may either take place in the context of a session, or independently outside the context of any existing session.\nThe figure depicts a flowchart illustrating the process of providing service event-related information to a related endpoint. It includes various steps such as data collection, processing, and transmission, ensuring that the information is delivered accurately and efficiently.\nFigure 5.8: Providing service event related information to related endpoint\n1.\tWhen a service event occurs that the S-CSCF or the Application Server wishes to inform an endpoint about, the S-CSCF or the Application Server generates a message request containing information to be presented to the user. The contents may include text describing the service event, a list of URI(s) or other service modification information.\n2.\tP-CSCF forwards the message request.\n3.\tUE presents the service-related information, to the extent that it conforms to its capabilities and configuration, to the user.\n4.\tPossibly after interaction with the user, the UE will be able to include information in the response to the S-CSCF.\n5.\tP-CSCF forwards the response.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE may retrieve service event related information using IP-CAN or IMS procedures.\nNOTE 2:\ttransport aspects of the information transfer described above may require further considerations.\nThe SIP-event notification mechanism allows a SIP entity to request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain standardised events have occurred. Examples of such of events are changes in presence states, changes in registration states, changes in Subscription authorization policies (see TS 23.141 [36]) and other events that are caused by information changes in e.g. Application Servers or S-CSCF.\nIt shall be possible to either fetch relevant information once or monitor changes over a defined time. It shall be possible for a user to subscribe to events related to his/her own subscription (e.g. when the user subscribes to his own registration state) or to events related to other users' subscription (an example is when a watcher subscribes to presence information of a presentity, see TS 23.141 [36]).\nThe S-CSCF is not mandated to stay in the path after the initial SubscribeEvent request and ACK has been exchanged, if the S-CSCF does not execute any functions for the subsequent requests and responses of the dialog. The example, in figure 5.8a below, assumes that the S-CSCF does not want to execute any functions for the subsequent requests.\nFigure 5 illustrates the subscription to an event in an Application Service (AS) in an 800 Series network.

Note that only the username part of a PSI is definable within a predefined hostname(s).\nWhenever possible, routing to/from a Public Service Identity (PSI) should be provided using basic principles used for IMS routing.\nThe Application Server hosting the PSI may be invoked as an originating Application Server. This can be achieved by modifying the filter information within the subscription information of the users intending to use the service identified by the PSI. The PSI is then made available to these users.\nThe SIP requests are directed to the corresponding Application Server hosting the service according to the originating filtering rules in the S-CSCF of the user who is using the service.\nSuch statically pre-configured PSIs are only accessible internally from within the IMS of the operator's domain where the PSI is configured.\nThe Application Server hosting the PSI may be invoked as a terminating Application Server via information stored in the HSS. Such PSIs are globally routable and can be made available to users within and outside the operator domain, and can take the following form:\n-\tDistinct PSIs are defined in TS 23.003 [24]. Distinct PSIs can be created, modified and deleted in the HSS by the operator via O&M mechanisms. Distinct PSIs can also be created and deleted by users using the Ut interface using the means described in clause 5.4.12.3 for subdomain-based PSIs.\n-\tThe distinct PSI may be activated in the HSS by the AS using the Sh interface.\n-\tWildcarded PSIs are defined in TS 23.003 [24]. Wildcarded PSI ranges can be created, modified and deleted in the HSS by the operator via O&M mechanisms. Specific PSIs within a wildcarded range can be created and deleted by users using the Ut interface to the AS hosting the wildcarded range, or by the operator via O&M mechanisms.\nFor both the distinct PSIs and wildcarded PSIs, there are two ways to route towards the AS hosting the PSI:\na)\tThe HSS maintains the assigned S-CSCF information and ISC Filter Criteria information for the \"PSI user\" to route to the AS hosting the PSI according to IMS routing principles. In this case, the I-CSCF receives SIP requests at the terminating side, queries the HSS and directs the request to the S-CSCF assigned to the \"PSI user\". The S-CSCF forwards the session to the Application Server hosting the PSI according to the terminating ISC Filter Criteria.\nb)\tThe HSS maintains the address information of the AS hosting the PSI for the \"PSI user\". In this case, the AS address information for the PSI is returned to the I-CSCF in the location query response, in which case the I-CSCF will forward the request directly to the AS hosting the PSI.\nThe AS hosting the PSI in combination with its entry in the HSS is referred to as \"PSI user\".\nFigure 5. 19d depicts a routing example for incoming session where the session request is routed directly to the AS hosting the PSI.\nFigure 5.19e depicts an example routing scenario where the basic IMS routing via S-CSCF is used to route the session.\nSubdomains defined for PSIs allow both operators and users to define specific PSIs within subdomains for specific applications. For this purpose, subdomains can be defined by the operator in the DNS infrastructure. Specific PSIs within a subdomain can be created and deleted by users using the Ut interface to the AS hosting the subdomain, or by the operator via O&M mechanisms.\nSubdomain based PSIs are globally routable and can be made available to users within and outside the operator domain.\nIn this case, there are two ways to route towards the AS hosting the PSI:\na)\tWhen the subdomain name is defined in the global DNS, then the originating S-CSCF or a Transit Function receives the IP address of the AS hosting the PSI, when it queries DNS. The principles defined in IETF RFC 3263 [44] may be used. For example, a NAPTR query and then a SRV query may be used to get the IP address of the AS.\nb)\tThe PSI is resolved by the global DNS to an I-CSCF address in the domain where the AS hosting the PSI is located. The I-CSCF recognises the subdomain (and thus does not query the HSS). It resolves the same PSI to the address of the actual destination AS hosting the PSI using an internal DNS mechanism, and forwards the requests directly to the AS.\nFigure 5.19f shows an example of DNS based routing of an incoming session from an external network. The routing from the external network leads to the entry point of the IMS subsystem hosting the subdomain of the PSI.\nIn order to support configuration of an AS hosting a PSI, the distinct PSIs and/or wildcarded PSI ranges hosted in the AS need to be configured in the HSS. The configuration shall include procedures to allow:\n-\tDistinct PSIs and wildcarded PSI ranges to be configured in the HSS via operation and maintenance procedures,\n-\tAuthorization and verification of access as \"PSI user\" with the Public Service Identity hosted by the AS, e.g. for AS-originating requests,\n-\tAccess to \"PSI user\" information (e.g. the S-CSCF assigned) over the Cx reference point from the CSCF nodes,\n-\tDefining the \"PSI user\" similar to the principle of IMS user, without requiring any subscription/access information (e.g. CS/PS domain data) that are required for IMS user.\nNote that the PSI configuration in the HSS does not affect the filter criteria based access to an AS as defined in the user profiles.\nThe AS hosting the PSI may originate requests with the PSI as the originating party. For such originating requests, the home IMS network shall be capable to perform the following functions:\n-\tNetwork Domain Security, TS 33.210 [20], shall be used where applicable.\n-\tCharging requirements such as providing appropriate accounting and charging functions via the charging entities shall be supported according to TS 32.240 [25].\n-\tIf the target identity is a Tel URI (as specified in IETF RFC 3966 [15]), ENUM translation needs to be performed as described in clause 4.3.5.2, and the request shall be routed based on the translation result appropriately.\nRouting from the Originating AS hosting the PSI can be performed as follows:\na)\tIf the AS supports routing capabilities (e.g. ENUM support, etc), the AS may forward the originating request to the destination network without involving a S-CSCF. If this option is applied where the target identity is a Tel URI, the AS shall perform an ENUM query and route the request based on the translation result.\nb)\tIf the AS does not support routing capabilities, the AS may forward the originating request to the IMS Transit Functions. The IMS Transit Functions will then route the session initiation request to the destination.\nc)\tIf the session requires the use of a S-CSCF: either the PSI has an S-CSCF assigned, in which case the AS forwards the originating request to this S-CSCF, which then processes the request as per regular originating S-CSCF procedures, or the PSI has no S-CSCF assigned, in which case the AS sends the session initiation request to an I-CSCF that will allocate an S-CSCF to the PSI.\nTo prevent fraudulent or unsecure IMS traffic possibly caused by AS originated requests, security and authentication procedures may be performed towards the AS.\n",

The diagram highlights the role of the network slicing, which allows for the creation of virtual networks for different applications. The use of virtualized network functions (VNFs) enables efficient resource allocation and improved network performance. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing in enabling the efficient use of network resources and the ability to adapt to changing network conditions.\nFigure 5.9: Overview of Session Flow Sections\nThe following procedures are defined:\nFor the origination sequences:\n-\t(MO#1) Mobile origination, roaming , see clause 5.6.1;\n-\t(MO#2) Mobile origination, home, see clause 5.6.2;\n-\t(PSTN-O) PSTN origination, see clause 5.6.3;\n-\t(NI-O) Non-IMS network origination (external SIP client), see clause 5.6.4;\n-\t(AS-O) Application Server origination, see clause 5.6.5.\nFor the termination sequences:\n-\t(MT#1) Mobile termination, roaming, see clause 5.7.1;\n-\t(MT#2) Mobile termination, home, see clause 5.7.2;\n-\t(MT#3) Mobile termination, CS Domain roaming, see clause 5.7.2a;\n-\t(PSTN-T) PSTN termination, see clause 5.7.3;\n-\t(NI-T) Non-IMS network termination (external SIP client), see clause 5.7.4;\n-\t(AS-T#1) PSI based Application Server termination, direct, see clause 5.7.5;\n-\t(AS-T#2) PSI based Application Server termination, indirect, see clause 5.7.6;\n-\t(AS-T#3) PSI based Application Server termination, direct, using DNS, see clause 5.7.7;\n-\t(AS-T#4) PUI based Application Server termination, indirect, see clause 5.7.8.\nFor Serving-CSCF/MGCF-to-Serving-CSCF/MGCF sequences:\n-\t(S-S#1) Session origination and termination are served by different network operators, see clause 5.5.1;\n-\t(S-S#2) Session origination and termination are served by the same operator, see clause 5.5.2;\n-\t(S-S#3) Session origination with PSTN termination in the same network as the S-CSCF, see clause 5.5.3;\n-\t(S-S#4) Session origination with PSTN termination in a different network to the S-CSCF, see clause 5.5.4.\nThe media being offered and acknowledged to can take multiple negotiation steps or only one negotiation may be used. In these flows, a minimum of two negotiations has been shown. But the subsequent responses may not carry any media information and just confirm the initial media set agreement.\nFor example, for a non-roaming user initiating a session to another non-roaming user, each a subscriber of the same network operator, it is possible to construct a complete end-to-end session flow from the following procedures:\n-\t(MO#2) Mobile origination, home,\n-\t(S-S#2) Single network operator,\n-\t(MT#2) Mobile termination, home.\nThere are a large number of end-to-end session flows defined by these procedures. They are built from combinations of origination, serving to serving, and termination procedures, as determined from the following table. For each row of the table, any one of the listed origination procedures can be combined with any one of the serving-serving procedures, which can be combined with any one of the termination procedures.\nService control can occur at any point during a session, based on the filter criteria.\nNote that the flows show service control only for the initial INVITE for originating and terminating party as an example.\nThe flows assume precondition mechanism is used, but as shown in clause 5.7a, a UE may originate a session without using preconditions.\nTable 5.2: Combinations of session procedures\n\n",

This signalling path depends on:\n-\twhether the originator and destination are served by the same network operator,\n-\twhether the network operators have chosen to hide their internal configuration.\nThe Serving-CSCF handling session origination performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines whether it is a subscriber of the same network operator or a different operator.\nIf the analysis of the destination address determined that it belongs to a subscriber of a different operator, the request is forwarded) to a well-known entry point in the destination operator's network, the I-CSCF.

This signalling path is determined at the time of UE registration, and remains fixed for the life of the registration.\nA UE always has a proxy (P-CSCF) associated with it. This P-CSCF performs resource authorization, and may have additional functions in handling of emergency and priority sessions. The P-CSCF is determined by the CSCF discovery process, described in clause 5.1.1 (Local CSCF Discovery).\nAs a result of the registration procedure, the P-CSCF determines the next hop toward the Serving-CSCF. This next hop is to the S-CSCF in the home network (MO#1). These next-hop addresses could be IP addresses, or could be names that are translated via DNS to an IP address.\nSessions originated in the PSTN to a destination in an IMS network are a special case of the Origination procedures. The MGCF uses H.248 [18] to control a Media Gateway, and communicates with the SS7 network. The MGCF initiates the SIP request, and subsequent nodes consider the signalling as if it came from a S-CSCF.\n",

The AS finds an I-CSCF by using the same mechanism as the S-CSCF uses to find an I-CSCF of the terminating network (see clauses 5.5.1 and 5.5.2). The request shall indicate that it is an originating request sent on behalf of the Public User Identity or the Public Service Identity.\nNOTE 1:\tIf border control concepts are applied, the contact point within an operator's network may be different, see clause 4.14 and Annex I for details.\nNOTE 2:\tThe procedure described below can be used by an external AS that cannot access HSS data using the Sh interface.\nThe procedure described below assumes that the Application Server takes care of the user plane connection.\nThis is shown by the information flow in figure 5.16c:\nThe figure depicts a selection process for S-CSCF (Selective Call Switching) and I-CSCF (Inter-CSCF) for an AS Originating call procedure.

The I-CSCF must indicate that it is an originating request sent on behalf of the Public User Identity/Public Service Identity.\n6.\tThe S-CSCF sends Cx-Put/Cx-Pull (Public User Identity/Public Service Identity, S-CSCF name) to the HSS. When multiple and separately addressable HSSs have been deployed by the network operator, then the S-CSCF needs to query the SLF to resolve the HSS. The HSS stores the S-CSCF name for Public Service Identity or Public User Identities of that user. This will result in all traffic related to the Public Service Identity or the Public User Identities of that user being routed to this particular S-CSCF until the registration period expires or the user attaches the Public User Identity to the network.\nNOTE 4:\tOptionally the S-CSCF can omit the Cx-Put/Cx-Pull request if it has the relevant information from the user profile.\n7.\tThe HSS shall store the S-CSCF name for that user or service and return the information flow Cx-Put Resp/Cx-Pull Resp (user information) to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF shall store it.\n8.\tThe S-CSCF invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this call attempt, if required.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the Public User Identity/Public Service Identity is not registered and has no initial filter criteria related to the unregistered state, the S-CSCF just routes the request further without invoking any service logic for this request.\n9.\tThe session setup continues as for normal origination procedures.\n",

This resolution mechanism is implemented using a Subscription Locator Function (SLF) or a Diameter Proxy Agent that proxies the request to the HSS. This resolution mechanism is not required in networks that utilise a single HSS e.g. optionally, it could be switched off on the I-CSCF and on the S-CSCF and/or on the AS using O&M mechanisms. An example for a single HSS solution is a server farm architecture. By default, the resolution mechanism shall be supported.\nOn REGISTER and on MT INVITEs, the I-CSCF queries the HSS for user's subscription specific data, e. g. the actual location or authentication parameters. This also has to be accomplished by the S-CSCF on REGISTER. In the case when more than one independently addressable HSS is utilized by a network operator, the HSS where user information for a given subscriber is available has to be found. To get the HSS name the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF query the SLF entity or the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF send the query to the HSS via a Diameter Proxy Agent.\nThe SLF is accessed via the Dx interface or via the Dh interface. The Dx interface is the standard interface between the CSCF and the SLF and the Dh interface is the standard interface between the AS and the SLF. The synchronisation between the SLF and the different HSSs is an O&M issue.\nA way to use the SLF is described in the following.\nThe Dx interface provides:\n-\tan operation to query the SLF from the I-CSCF or from the S-CSCF, respectively.\n-\ta response to provide the HSS name towards the I-CSCF or towards the S-CSCF, respectively.\nBy sending the Dx-operation DX_SLF_QUERY the I-CSCF or the S-CSCF indicates a user identity of which it is looking for an HSS. By the Dx-operation DX_SLF_RESP the SLF responds with the HSS name. The I-CSCF or the S-CSCF, respectively, continues by querying the selected HSS.

The flow for this case is shown in Figure 5.26.\nOther network initiated session release scenarios are of course possible.\nThe figure depicts a network initiated session release, where a P-CSCF (Physical Session Control Channel) initiated session is released after the removal of an IP-CAN bearer.

The procedures are independent of whether the P-CSCF is located in the subscriber's home or visited network.

This is done through an end-to-end message exchange to determine the complete set of media characteristics, then the decision is made by the session initiator as to the initial set of media flows.\nThe session initiator includes an SDP in the SIP INVITE message that lists every media characteristics (including codecs) that the originator is willing to support for this session. When the message arrives at the destination endpoint, it responds with the media characteristics (e.g. common subset of codecs) that it is also willing to support for the session. Media authorization is performed for these media characteristics. The session initiator, upon receiving the common subset, determines the media characteristics (including codecs) to be used initially.\nThe negotiation may take multiple media offered and answered between the end points until the media set is agreed upon.\nOnce the session is established, the procedures of clause 5.11.3.2 may be used by either endpoint to change to a different media characteristic (e.g. codec) that was included in the initial session description, and for which no additional resources are required for media transport. The procedures of clause 5.11.3.3 may be used by either endpoint to change the session, which requires resources beyond those allocated to the existing session.\nThe flow presented here assumes that Policy and Charging Control is in use.\nThe figure depicts the codec negotiation process during the initial session establishment in a 5G network. It shows the negotiation between the sender and the receiver, with the sender transmitting a codeword and the receiver responding with a codeword. The figure illustrates the use of different codecs, such as LDPC and Turbo codes, to improve the reliability and efficiency of the communication.\nFigure 5.30: Codec negotiation during initial session establishment\nThe detailed procedure is as follows:\n1.\tUE#1 inserts the codec(s) to a SDP payload. The inserted codec(s) shall reflect the UE#1's terminal capabilities and user preferences for the session capable of supporting for this session. It builds a SDP containing bandwidth requirements and characteristics of each, and assigns local port numbers for each possible media flow. Multiple media flows may be offered, and for each media flow (m= line in SDP), there may be multiple codec choices offered.\n2.\tUE#1 sends the initial INVITE message to P-CSCF#1 containing this SDP\n3.\tP-CSCF#1 examines the media parameters. If P-CSCF#1 finds media parameters not allowed to be used within an IMS session (based on P-CSCF local policies, or if available bandwidth authorization limitation information coming from the PCRF/PCF), it rejects the session initiation attempt.

If the change is within the resources already reserved, then it is only necessary to synchronise the change with the other endpoint. Note that an admission control decision will not fail if the new resource request is within the existing reservation.\nThe flow presented here assumes that Policy and Charging Control is in use.\nThe figure depicts a codec or media flow change, where the same reservation is used to represent the change in the codec or media flow. This is important for ensuring that the same reservation is used across different media flows, which helps in maintaining consistency and reliability in the network.\nFigure 5.31: Codec or media flow change - same reservation\nThe detailed procedure is as follows:\n1.\tUE#1 determines that a new media stream is desired, or that a change is needed in the codec in use for an existing media stream. UE#1 evaluates the impact of this change, and determines the existing resources reserved for the session are adequate.

The UE has already established an IM CN session and is generating an invite to add another media (e.g. video to a voice call) to the already established session. Note that the invite to add media to an existing session could be originated by either end. The invite, and subsequent flows, are assumed to follow the path determined when the initial session was established. Any I-CSCFs that were included in the initial session would be included in this session.\nThe originating party addresses a destination that is a subscriber of the same network operator.\nThe destination party is a UE located within the service area of the network operator to which it is subscribed.\nThe flow presented here assumes that Policy and Charging Control is in use.\nThe figure depicts a multimedia session flow, illustrating the addition of another media component. The flow includes the initial media, the addition of the second media, and the final media. The flow is represented by a series of arrows, indicating the progression of media components. The figure is a visual representation of the multimedia session flow, providing a clear and concise overview of the process.\nFigure 5.33: Multimedia session flow - addition of another media\nStep-by-step processing of this end-to-end session flow is as follows:\n1.\tUE#1 sends a SIP INVITE request, containing new SDP for the new media and including the original SDP, to P-CSCF#1, which was obtained from the CSCF discovery procedures.\n2.\tP-CSCF#1 forwards the INVITE to the next hop name/address, as determined from the registration procedures.

The display name is a text string which may identify the subscriber, the user or the terminal.\nThis clause gives information flows for the procedures for providing the authenticated Public User Identity and the optional display Name information of the originating party to the terminating party. It also describes the mechanisms for blocking the display of Public User Identity and optional display name if requested by the originating party.\nAuthentication of the subscriber is performed during the registration procedures, as described in clause 5.2.2.3. As a result of the registration procedures, one or several Public User Identity(ies) of the originating party is/are stored in P-CSCF#1. As part of this procedure, the display name associated with each Public User Identity, if provided by the HSS, is also returned via the S-CSCF and stored in the P-CSCF#1. This is shown in the sub-procedure represented in the following information flow in step 1.\nWhen UE#1 attempts to initiate a new session, the UE shall include one of the Public User Identities the UE received during the SIP registration in the INVITE request. The P-CSCF#1 ensures that the INVITE request includes an authenticated Public User Identity, including the associated display name if provided by the S-CSCF during the registration procedures, before forwarding the INVITE request to the S-CSCF#1.\nIn the following call flow, it is assumed that no privacy has been required by UE#1.If the Public User Identity supplied by UE#1 in the INVITE request is incorrect, or if the UE did not provide a public identify, then the P-CSCF may reject the request, or may overwrite with the correct URI, including the associated display name if provided by the S-CSCF during the registration procedures.\nThe figure depicts a cryptographic protocol used in telecommunication networks to authenticate the identity of the originating party. It illustrates the process of digitally signing messages, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the data.

This is a function performed by the destination P-CSCF. In this way, the terminating party is still able to do a session-return, session-trace, transfer, or any other supplementary service.\nIn this call flow, it is assumed that privacy has been required by UE#1 on Public User Identity (i.e. 'id' privacy).\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of a communication system, specifically focusing on the role of identity-based blocking in preventing eavesdropping. The diagram illustrates the various components involved, such as the sender, receiver, and eavesdropper, with the identity-based blocking mechanism highlighted. This technique uses a set of rules to determine which party is the legitimate one, ensuring that eavesdropping attempts are detected and blocked. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the system's architecture and the role of identity-based blocking in maintaining communication security.\nFigure 5.35: Blocking the identity of the originating party\nThe detailed procedure is as follows:\n1.\tUE#1 initiates a new multi-media session, by sending an INVITE request to P-CSCF#1.

The decision to redirect a session to a different destination may be made for different reasons by a number of different functional elements, and at different points in the establishment of the session.\nThree cases of session redirection prior to bearer establishment are presented, and one case of session redirection after bearer establishment.\nThese cases enable the typical services of \"Session Forward Unconditional\", \"Session Forward Busy\", \"Session Forward Variable\", \"Selective Session Forwarding\", and \"Session Forward No Answer\", though it is important to recognise that the implementation is significantly different from the counterparts in the CS domain.\nOne of the functional elements in a basic session flow that may initiate a redirection is the S-CSCF of the destination user. The user profile information obtained from the HSS by the 'Cx-pull' during registration may contain complex logic and triggers causing session redirection. S-CSCF#2 sends the SIP INVITE request to the I-CSCF for the new destination (I-CSCF#F in the diagram), who forwards it to S-CSCF#F, who forwards it to the new destination.\nIn cases when the destination user is not currently registered in the IM CN subsystem, the I-CSCF may assign a temporary S-CSCF to invoke the service logic on behalf of the intended destination. This temporary S-CSCF takes the role of S-CSCF#2 in the following information flow.\nThe service implemented by this information flow is typically \"Session Forward Unconditional\", \"Session Forward Variable\" or \"Selective Session Forwarding\". S-CSCF#2 may also make use of knowledge of current sessions in progress at the UE, and implement \"Session Forwarding Busy\" in this way.\nThis is shown in the following information flow:\nFigure 5.36 illustrates the session redirection initiated by S-CSCF to IMS, demonstrating the process of redirecting a session from one network to another. This figure is crucial in understanding the communication process and the role of S-CSCF in session management within the IMS network.\nFigure 5.36: Session redirection initiated by S-CSCF to IMS\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1.\tThe SIP INVITE request is sent from the UE to S-CSCF#1 by the procedures of the originating flow.\n2.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n3.\tS-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the network operator to whom the destination subscriber belongs.

As a result of this service control logic, S-CSCF#2 determines that the session should be redirected to a new destination URI within the IP Multimedia Subsystem. Based on operator policy and the user profile, S-CSCF#2 may restrict the media streams allowed in the redirected session.\n8.\tS-CSCF#2 sends a SIP INVITE request to an I-CSCF (I-CSCF#F) for the network operator to whom the forwarded destination subscribes.\n9.\tI-CSCF#F queries the HSS (HSS#F) for current location information of the destination user.\n10.\tHSS#F responds with the address of the current Serving CSCF (S-CSCF#F) for the terminating user.\n11.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#F, who will handle the session termination.\n12.\tS-CSCF#F invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt\n13.\tS-CSCF#F forwards the INVITE toward the destination UE, according to the procedures of the terminating flow.\n14-19.\tThe destination UE responds with the SDP message, and the session establishment proceeds normally.\nThe S-CSCF of the destination user (S-CSCF#2) may determine that the session is to be redirected to a PSTN Termination; e.g. CS-domain endpoint, or to the PSTN. For session redirection to PSTN termination where the S-CSCF of the called party (S-CSCF#2) wishes to remain in the path of SIP signalling, the S-CSCF forwards the INVITE to a BGCF. Then the BGCF (in the local network or in another network) will forward the INVITE to a MGCF, which will forward towards the destination according to the termination flow.\nIn cases when the destination user is not currently registered in the IM CN subsystem, the I-CSCF may assign a temporary S-CSCF to invoke the service logic on behalf of the intended destination. This temporary S-CSCF takes the role of S-CSCF#2 in the following information flow.\nHandling of redirection to a PSTN Termination where the S-CSCF#2 forwards the INVITE is shown in the figure 5.37:\nThe figure depicts a session redirection to PSTN Termination (S - CSCF #2) in a 5G network, where INVITE is forwarded to the PSTN Termination (S - CSCF #2) for further processing.\nFigure 5.37: Session redirection to PSTN Termination (S-CSCF #2 forwards INVITE)\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1.\tThe SIP INVITE request is sent from the UE #1 to S-CSCF#1 by the procedures of the originating flow.\n2.\tS-CSCF#1 performs whatever service control logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n3.\tS-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the network operator to whom the subscriber belongs. The INVITE message is sent to an I-CSCF for that operator.\n4.\tI-CSCF queries the HSS for current location information of the destination user.\n5.\tHSS responds with the address of the current Serving CSCF (S-CSCF#2) for the terminating user.\n6.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#2, who will handle the session termination.\n7.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt. As a result of this service control logic, S-CSCF#2 determines that the session should be redirected to a PSTN termination. S-CSCF#2 determines that it wishes to remain in the path of the SIP signalling.\n8.\tS-CSCF#2 forwards the INVITE using the Serving to Serving procedures S-S#3 or S-S#4. The PSTN terminating flows are then followed.\n9-12.\tThe destination responds with the SDP message, and the session establishment proceeds normally.\nThe S-CSCF of the destination user (S-CSCF#2) may determine that the session is to be redirected to a PSTN Termination; e.g. CS-domain endpoint, or to the PSTN. For session redirection to PSTN termination where the S-CSCF of the called party (S-CSCF#2) wishes to use the SIP REDIRECT method, the S-CSCF#2 will pass the new destination information (the PSTN Termination information) to the originator. The originator can then initiate a new session to the redirected to destination denoted by S-CSCF#2. The originator may be a UE as shown in the example flow in figure 5.37a, or it may be any other type of originating entity as defined in clause 5.4a. The endpoint to which the session is redirected may be the PSTN as shown in figure 5.37a, or it may be any other type of terminating entity as defined in clause 5.4a. The originator may alternately receive a redirect from a non-IMS network SIP client. Only the scenario in which a call from a UE is redirected by S-CSCF service logic to a PSTN endpoint is shown.\nHandling of redirection to a PSTN Termination where the S-CSCF#2 REDIRECTS to the originating UE#1 is shown in the figure 5.37a:\nThe figure depicts a session redirection to PSTN Termination (REDIRECT to originating UE#1) in a 5G network. It illustrates the process of redirecting a session to a PSTN termination point, which is essential for terminating a session and ensuring proper communication. The figure shows the connection between the session and the PSTN termination, highlighting the importance of this step in the 5G network architecture.\nFigure 5.37a: Session redirection to PSTN Termination (REDIRECT to originating UE#1)\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1.\tThe SIP INVITE request is sent from the UE#1 to S-CSCF#1 by the procedures of the originating flow.\n2.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n3.\tS-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the network operator to whom the subscriber belongs. The INVITE message is sent to an I-CSCF for that operator.\n4.\tI-CSCF queries the HSS for current location information of the destination user.\n5.\tHSS responds with the address of the current Serving CSCF (S-CSCF#2) for the terminating user.\n6.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#2, who will handle the session termination.\n7.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt. As a result of this service control logic, S-CSCF#2 determines that the session should be redirected to a PSTN termination.\nS-CSCF#2 determines that it wishes to use the SIP REDIRECT method to pass the redirection destination information (the 'redirected-to PSTN Termination' information) to the originator (UE#1).\n8.\tS-CSCF#2 sends a SIP Redirect response to I-CSCF with the redirection destination.\n9.\tI-CSCF sends a Redirect response to S-CSCF#1, containing the redirection destination.\n10.\tS-CSCF#2 forwards the Redirect response to UE#1, containing the redirection destination\n11.\tUE#1 initiates a session to the 'redirected-to PSTN Termination' according to the mobile origination procedures supported in the UE (e.g. CS, IMS).\nThe S-CSCF in the scenario above may determine that the session is to be redirected to an endpoint outside the IP MultiMedia System and outside the CS-domain. Examples of these destinations include web pages, email addresses, etc. It recognizes this situation by the redirected URI being other than a sip: URI or tel: URL.\nIn cases when the destination subscriber is not currently registered in the IM CN subsystem, the I-CSCF may assign a temporary S-CSCF to invoke the service logic on behalf of the intended destination. This temporary S-CSCF takes the role of S-CSCF#2 in the following information flow. For session redirection to a general endpoint where the S-CSCF of the called party (S-CSCF#2) wishes to use the SIP REDIRECT method, the S-CSCF#2 will pass the new destination information to the originator. As a result the originator should initiate a new session to the redirected-to destination provided by S-CSCF#2. The originator may be a UE as shown in the example flow in figure 5.38, an Application Server or a non-IMS network SIP client. The originator may also receive a redirect from a non-IMS network SIP client. Only the scenario in which the originating UE receives a redirect based on S-CSCF service logic is shown.\nHandling of redirection to a general URI is shown in the following information flow:\nThe figure depicts a session redirection initiated by S-CSCF to a general endpoint, illustrating the process of redirecting a session from a specific endpoint to a general one. This process is crucial in ensuring the smooth functioning of the network, as it allows for the efficient routing of data packets.\nFigure 5.38: Session redirection initiated by S-CSCF to general endpoint\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1.\tThe SIP INVITE request is sent from the UE to S-CSCF#1 by the procedures of the originating flow.\n2.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n3.\tS-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the network operator to whom the subscriber belongs. The INVITE message is sent to an I-CSCF for that operator.\n4.\tI-CSCF queries the HSS for current location information of the destination user.\n5.\tHSS responds with the address of the current Serving CSCF (S-CSCF#2) for the terminating user.\n6.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#2, who will handle the session termination.\n7.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt. As a result of this service control logic, S-CSCF#2 determines that the session should be redirected to a new destination URI outside the IMS and outside the CS domain, i.e. other than a sip: URI or tel: URL.\n8.\tS-CSCF#2 sends a SIP Redirect response back to I-CSCF, with redirection destination being the general URI.\n9.\tI-CSCF sends a Redirect response back to S-CSCF#1, containing the redirection destination.\n10.\tS-CSCF#1 forwards the Redirect response back to UE#1.\n11.\tUE#1 initiates the session to the indicated destination.\nOne of the functional elements in a basic session flow that may initiate a redirection is the P-CSCF of the destination user. In handling of an incoming session setup attempt, the P-CSCF normally sends the INVITE request to the destination UE, and retransmits it as necessary until obtaining an acknowledgement indicating reception by the UE.\nIn cases when the destination user is not currently reachable in the IM CN subsystem (due to such factors as roaming outside the service area or loss of battery, but the registration has not yet expired), the P-CSCF may initiate a redirection of the session. The P-CSCF informs the S-CSCF of this redirection, without specifying the new location; S-CSCF determines the new destination and performs according to clauses 5.11.5.1, 5.11.5.2, or 5.11.5.3 above, based on the type of destination.\nThis is shown in the following information flow:\nFigure 5.39 illustrates the session redirection initiated by P-CSCF (Policy-Centric Session Control Function) in a 5G network. This function is responsible for managing session control and session reconfiguration, ensuring efficient and secure communication. The figure shows the P-CSCF function in action, with the session redirection initiated by the P-CSCF, which then redirects the session to the appropriate control plane. This process is crucial for maintaining network stability and performance in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.39: Session redirection initiated by P-CSCF\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1.\tThe SIP INVITE request is sent from the UE to S-CSCF#1 by the procedures of the originating flow.\n2.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n3.\tS-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the network operator to whom the subscriber belongs. The INVITE message is sent to an I-CSCF for that operator.\n4.\tI-CSCF queries the HSS for current location information of the destination user.\n5.\tHSS responds with the address of the current Serving CSCF (S-CSCF#2) for the terminating user.\n6.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#2, who will handle the session termination.\n7.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n8.\tS-CSCF#2 forwards the INVITE request to P-CSCF#2.\n9.\tP-CSCF#2 forwards the INVITE request to UE#2.\n10.\tTimeout expires in P-CSCF waiting for a response from UE#2. P-CSCF therefore assumes UE#2 is unreachable.\n11.\tP-CSCF#2 generates an Unavailable response, without including a new destination, and sends the message to S-CSCF#2.\n12.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session redirection. If the user does not subscribe to session redirection service, or did not supply a forwarding destination, S-CSCF#2 may terminate the session setup attempt with a failure response. Otherwise, S-CSCF#2 supplies a new destination URI, which may be a phone number, an email address, a web page, or anything else that can be expressed as a URI. Processing continues according to clauses 5.11.5.1, 5.11.5.2, or 5.11.5.3 above, based on the type of destination URI.\nThe next functional element in a basic session flow that may initiate a redirection is the UE of the destination user. The UE may implement customer-specific feature processing, and base its decision to redirect this session on such things as identity of caller, current sessions in progress, other applications currently being accessed, etc. UE sends the SIP Redirect response to its P-CSCF, who forwards back along the signalling path to S-CSCF#1, who initiates a session to the new destination.\nThe service implemented by this information flow is typically \"Session Forward Busy\", \"Session Forward Variable\" or \"Selective Session Forwarding\".\nThis is shown in the following information flow:\nIn this figure, we see a session redirection initiated by an UE (User Equipment) in a 5G network. The UE sends a session ID to the network, which is then redirected to the appropriate network segment. This process ensures that the UE's session is not lost and can be rerouted to the correct network segment. The figure also shows the network segment, which is a part of the 5G network that the UE is connected to. The figure is important for understanding the flow of data in a 5G network and how sessions are managed.\nFigure 5.40: Session redirection initiated by UE\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1.\tThe SIP INVITE request is sent from the UE to S-CSCF#1 by the procedures of the originating flow.\n2.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n3.\tS-CSCF#1 performs an analysis of the destination address, and determines the network operator to whom the subscriber belongs. The INVITE message is sent to an I-CSCF for that operator.\n4.\tI-CSCF queries the HSS for current location information of the destination user.\n5.\tHSS responds with the address of the current Serving CSCF (S-CSCF#2) for the terminating user.\n6.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#2, who will handle the session termination.\n7.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session setup attempt.\n8.\tS-CSCF#2 forwards the INVITE request to P-CSCF#2.\n9.\tP-CSCF#2 forwards the INVITE request to UE#2.\n10.\tUE#2 determines that this session should be redirected, and optionally supplies the new destination URI. This new destination URI may be a phone number, an email address, a web page, or anything else that can be expressed as a URI. The Redirect response is sent to P-CSCF#2.\n11.\tP-CSCF#2 forwards the Redirect response to S-CSCF#2.\n12.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session redirection. If UE#2 does not subscribe to session redirection service, or did not supply a new destination URI, S-CSCF#2 may supply one or may terminate the session setup attempt with a failure response. The new destination URI may be a phone number, an email address, a web page, or anything else that can be expressed as a URI. The procedures of clause 5.11.5.1, 5.11.5.2, or 5.11.5.3 given above are followed, based on the type of URI.\nThe UE of the destination user may request the session be redirected after a customer-specified ringing interval. The UE may also implement customer-specific feature processing, and base its decision to redirect this session on such things as identity of caller, current sessions in progress, other applications currently being accessed, etc. UE sends the SIP Redirect response to its P-CSCF, who forwards back along the signalling path to the originating endpoint, who initiates a session to the new destination.\nThe service implemented by this information flow is typically \"Session Forward No Answer\".\nThe originating end point may be a UE as shown in the example flow in figure 5.41 or it may be any other type of originating entity as defined in clause 5.4a. Redirect to another IMS endpoint (e.g. a sip: URI) is shown in the figure. The redirecting endpoint may be a UE as shown or an Application Server or a non-IMS network SIP client. Further, the endpoint to which the session is redirected may be a UE as shown in figure 5.41, or it may be any other type of terminating entity as defined in clause 5.4a. Only the scenario in which a call from the first UE is redirected by a second UE to a third UE is shown.\nThe flow presented here assumes that Policy and Charging Control is in use.\nFigure 5.41 illustrates the session redirection process after bearer establishment in a 5G network. This process involves the use of session identifiers (SID) to establish a session between a mobile device and a base station (gNB). The figure shows the flow of data from the mobile device to the gNB, with the session identifier being used to redirect the data to the appropriate network segment. This process ensures that the data is transmitted securely and efficiently, reducing the risk of interception and unauthorized access.\nFigure 5.41: Session redirection after bearer establishment\nStep-by-step processing is as follows:\n1-10.\tNormal handling of a basic session establishment, up through establishment of the bearer channel and alerting of the destination user or by a previous session redirection after bearer establishment procedure.\n11.\tBased on a timeout or other indications, UE#2 decides the current session should be redirected to a new destination URI. This new destination URI may be a phone number, an email address, a web page, or anything else that can be expressed as a URI. The Redirect response is sent to P-CSCF#2.\n12.\tP-CSCF#2 shall revoke any authorization for QoS for the current session.\n13.\tP-CSCF#2 forwards the Redirect response to S-CSCF#2.\n14.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this session redirection. If UE#2 does not subscribe to session redirection service, or did not supply a new destination URI, S-CSCF#2 service logic may supply one or may terminate the session setup attempt with a failure response. The new destination URI may be a phone number, an email address, a web page, or anything else that can be expressed as a URI. If S-CSCF#2 service logic requires that it remain on the path for the redirected request, the service logic generates a private URI, addressed to itself, as the new destination.\n15.\tS-CSCF#2 sends a SIP Redirect response back to I-CSCF, containing the new destination URI.\n16.\tI-CSCF sends a Redirect response back to S-CSCF#1, containing the new destination.\n17.\tS-CSCF#1 service logic may check the number of redirections that have occurred for this session setup attempt, and if excessive, abort the session. If S-CSCF#1 service logic requires that UE#1 not know the new destination URI, the service logic stores the new destination information, generates a private URI addressed to itself pointing to the stored information, and generates a modified Redirect response with the private URI.\n18.\tS-CSCF#1 sends the Redirect response to P-CSCF#1.\n19.\tP-CSCF#1 revokes any authorization for QoS for the current session and sends the Redirect response to UE#1.\n20.\tUE#1 initiates a new INVITE request to the address provided in the Redirect response. The new INVITE request is sent to P-CSCF#1.\n21.\tP-CSCF#1 forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#1.\n22.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this new session setup attempt. The service logic may retrieve destination information if saved in step #17.\n23.\tS-CSCF#1 determines the network operator of the new destination address. If the service logic in step #14 did not provide its private URI as a new destination, the procedure continues with step #26, bypassing steps #24 and #25. If the service logic in step #14 did provide a private URI as a new destination, the INVITE message is sent to I-CSCF#2, the I-CSCF for S-CSCF#2.\n24.\tI-CSCF forwards the INVITE to S-CSCF#2.\n25.\tS-CSCF#2 decodes the private URI, determines the network operator of the new destination, and sends the INVITE request to the I-CSCF for that network operator.\n26-30.\tThe remainder of this session completes as normal.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause gives information flows for the procedures for performing session transfers. This is presented in two steps: first a basic primitive that can be used by endpoints to cause a multi-media session to be transferred, and second the procedures by which this primitive can be used to implement some well-known session-transfer services.\nThe refer primitive is an information flow indicating a \"Refer\" operation, which includes a component element \"Refer-To\" and a component element \"Referred-By\". The end point receiving a referral may be UE#1 as shown in the example flow in figure 5.42 or it may be any other type of originating entity as defined in clause 5.4a. The referring endpoint may be either UE#2 as shown, an Application Server or a non-IMS network SIP client. The referred-to destination may be UE#F as shown in figure 5.42 or it may be any other type of terminating entity as defined in clause 5.4a. Only the scenario in which a call from the first UE is referred by a second UE to a third UE is shown.\nAn information flow illustrating this is as follows:\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the refer operation in a 5G network, illustrating the steps involved in referring a signal from a base station (gNB) to a user equipment (UE) or another base station (BS). The figure shows the various components involved in the refer operation, such as the gNB, UE, and other BSs, as well as the path between them. The figure highlights the importance of proper signaling and network management to ensure reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 5.42: Refer operation\nStep-by-step description of the information flow:\n1.\tA multi-media session is assumed to already exist between UE#1 and UE#2, established either as a basic session or by one of the supplemental services described in this clause.\n2.\tUE#2 sends the Refer command to P-CSCF#2, containing \"Refer-To\" UE#F and \"Referred-By\" UE#2. If UE#2 knows the GRUU of UE#F and desires to reach a particular instance of UE#F, the \"Refer-To\" contains the GRUU of UE#F otherwise the \"Refer-To\" contains the Public User Identity of UE#F.\n3.\tP-CSCF#2 forwards the message to S-CSCF#2.\n4.\tS-CSCF#2 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this request. If UE#2 does not subscribe to a transfer service, service logic may reject the request. If S-CSCF#2 service logic requires that it remain on the path for the subsequent request, the service logic generates a private URI, addressed to itself, the \"Refer-To\" value in the request with the private URI.\n5.\tS-CSCF#2 forwards the message to S-CSCF#1.\n6.\tS-CSCF#1 invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this request. To hide the identities of UE#2 and UE#F, S-CSCF#1 service logic stores the \"Refer-To\" and \"Referred-By\" information and replaces them with private URIs.\n7.\tS-CSCF#1 forwards the message to P-CSCF#1.\n8.\tP-CSCF#1 forwards the message to UE#1.\n9.\tUE#1 initiates a new multi-media session to the destination given by the \"Refer-To\", which may either be a URI for UE#F, a private URI pointing to S-CSCF#2, or a private URI pointing to S-CSCF#1.\n10.\tP-CSCF#1 forwards the INVITE request to S-CSCF#1.\n11.\tS-CSCF#1 retrieves the destination information for the new session, and invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this new session.\n12.\tS-CSCF#1 determines the network operator addressed by the destination URI, and forwards the INVITE to either S-CSCF#F or S-CSCF#2 (actually I-CSCF#F or I-CSCF#2, the public entry points for S-CSCF#F and S-CSCF#2, respectively). If S-CSCF#1 forwards the INVITE to S-CSCF#F, the procedure continues with step #14, bypassing step #13.\n13.\tS-CSCF#2 decodes the private URI destination, and determines the final destination of the new session. It determines the network operator addressed by the destination URI. The request is then forwarded onward to S-CSCF#F as in a normal session establishment.\n14.\tS-CSCF#F invokes whatever service logic is appropriate for this new session, and forwards the request to P-CSCF#F.\n15.\tP-CSCF#F forwards the request to UE#F.\n16-21.\tThe normal session establishment continues through bearer establishment, optional alerting, and reaches the point when the new session is accepted by UE#F. UE#F then sends the 200-OK final response to P-CSCF#F, which is forwarded through S-CSCF#F, S-CSCF#2 (optionally), S-CSCF#1, P-CSCF#1, to UE#1. At this point a new session is successfully established between UE#1 and UE#F.\n22-26.\tThe Refer request was successful, and UE#1 sends a 200-OK final response to UE#2. This response is sent through P-CSCF#1, S-CSCF#1, S-CSCF#2, P-CSCF#2, and to UE#2.\n27-31.\tUE#2 clears the original session with UE#1 by sending the BYE message. This message is routed through P-CSCF#2, S-CSCF#2, S-CSCF#1, P-CSCF#1, to UE#1.\n32-36.\tUE#1 acknowledges the BYE and terminates the original session. It responds with the 200-OK response, routed through P-CSCF#1, S-CSCF#1, S-CSCF#2, P-CSCF#2, to UE#2.\nNOTE:\tThe last BYE message to clear the original session can be issued either by UE#1 or by UE#2.\nThis clause shows how the Refer primitive given above can be used to provide common session-transfer services.\nA Blind Transfer starts with an existing session, established between the Initiator (I) and the Recipient (R). In a typical case, this session was actually initiated by R. In the end it is desired that the Recipient has a session with the Target (T).\nFrom the starting configuration, shown in the leftmost diagram, I sends a Refer message to R, who then initiates a session with the Target (T), as shown in the middle diagram. Immediately after sending the Refer message to R, I issues the BYE message to terminate its connection with R. The end configuration is shown in the rightmost diagram.\n\n\nAn Assured Transfer is identical to the above, except that I waits until the Refer successfully completes before issuing the BYE message to terminate its connection with R. If the new session from R to T were to fail, R would still have a session with I.\nA Consultative Transfer again starts with an existing session, established from the Initiator (I) to the Recipient (R). The Initiator first consults with the Target (T), then decides to transfer the original session to T.\nFrom the starting configuration, as shown in the leftmost diagram in the previous clause, I places the session with R on hold and establishes a new session with T. This is shown in the leftmost diagram below. I then sends a Refer message to T, causing T to establish a session with R. This is shown in the second diagram. When the Refer operation completes, I clears its two active sessions, first with R (leaving the configuration as shown in the third diagram) then with T. The end configuration is shown in the rightmost diagram.\n\n\nA three-way session starts with an existing session, between the Initiator (I) and party (A). The initiator places this session on hold, and establishes a second session with party (B). The initiator then decides to create an ad-hoc conference of all three parties.\nFrom the point where the initiator decides to create the ad-hoc conference, shown in the leftmost diagram below, the initiator establishes another session with a third-party conference bridge service. This is shown in the centre diagram. The initiator then transfers both of the existing sessions, I->A and I->B, to the bridge, ending in the configuration shown in the rightmost diagram.\n\n\nThe conference bridge service is in control of the termination sequence. On termination of one of the three sessions, it may either terminate the other two sessions by use of the session clearing procedures of clause 5.11, or may utilize the procedures of clause 5.11.6.2.1 above to transfer one of the remaining endpoints to the other, resulting in a simple two-party session.\n",

The AS may then hold the MESSAGE request and deliver the MESSAGE request when the UE#2 becomes reachable. In this case, depending on user settings UE#2 controls the delivery of the pending MESSAGEs.\n9-12.\tThe MESSAGE request is acknowledged with an appropriate acknowledgement response. The acknowledgement response traverses the transaction path back to UE#1.\nIMS users shall be able to send a single immediate message to multiple recipients, as specified in TS 22.340 [29a]. The following means are supported to achieve this:\n-\tA PSI identifying a new group is created in the appropriate Application Server, and members are added to this group (e.g. by the user via the Ut interface or by the operator via O&M mechanisms). Immediate messages addressed to this PSI will be routed to the AS hosting the PSI, and this AS shall create and send immediate messages addressed to a group member of the group identified by the PSI.\n-\tThe user can send an immediate message by indicating the individual addresses (Public User Identities for IMS recipients) of the intended recipients as part of the immediate message. The AS of the user shall then create and send immediate messages addressed to each one of the intended recipients.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause describes architectural concepts and procedures for fulfilling the requirements for Session-based Messaging described in TS 22.340 [29a].\nSession-based IMS messaging communications shall as much as possible use the same basic IMS session delivery mechanisms (e.g. routing, security, service control) as defined in clause 4 and 5 of this document. For session based messaging the session shall include a messaging media component, other media components may also be included.\nAs the messaging media component usually does not require QoS beyond best-effort, use of the preconditions mechanism as defined in IETF RFC 3312 [41] is not required for session based messaging establishment that only includes a messaging media component.\nNOTE:\tPre-conditions mechanism may still be required for session establishment with additional media components that require the establishment of additional IP-CAN bearers.\nOnce the session containing a messaging media component is established, messages in the session are transported between the session participants as per the parameters defined in the messaging media component part of the session description (SDP).\nThe invited UE shall host the message session (accept a connection for the message session from the other endpoint). In order to host the message session the UE needs an appropriate IP-CAN bearer, on which it can accept the connection for the message media component. This IP-CAN bearer may be e.g. a general purpose bearer available prior to starting the session initiation or a dedicated bearer that is established during session establishment. Messages within a message session should be transported over a connection-oriented reliable transport protocol. Message sessions may be either established end to end between two UEs or may involve one or more intermediate nodes (e.g. a chat server for multi party chat or an Application Server to perform per message charging).\nFor addressing chat-group-type session based messaging the concept of Public Service Identities is used.\nSession based messaging is available for users that are registered in the IMS.\nThe session based messaging shall be able to provide the following functionality:\n-\tPer-message-based charging, as well as content- and size-based charging.\n-\tOperator-controlled policy to be set on the size and content of the messages.\n-\tSupport for indication of maximum message content size that a UA will accept to be received.\n-\tSupport for a messaging media component as part of a session where other media components are also included.\n-\tSupport for messaging-only sessions.\nIf charging mechanisms like charging based on the message content, message type or number of sent and/or received messages (see TS 22.340 [29a]) are required, then an intermediate node (messaging AS) shall be involved, which is able to inspect the SIP signalling as well as the exchanged messages and their content. Such an intermediate node may also provide support for time- and/or volume based charging.\nIMS users shall be able to exchange session-based messages with each other by using the procedures described in this clause. These procedures shall allow the exchange of any type of multimedia content (subject to possible restrictions based on operator policy and user preferences/intent), for example but not limited to:\n-\tPictures, video clips, sound clips with a format defined in the respective access specific documents.\nThe following procedure shows the establishment of a message session between two registered UEs where the UEs are able to exchange messages end-to-end. The signalling flow is based on the general flow shown in clause 5.7a of this specification.\nFigure 5.48a illustrates the message session establishment process in a 5G network, where a mobile device initiates a session by sending a message to a base station (gNB). This process involves the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) to ensure efficient channel utilization and efficient resource allocation. The figure also highlights the use of carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) to prevent collisions and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 5.48a: Message session establishment\n1-30.\tThese steps are identical to the steps 1 to 30 in the flow of clause 5.7a. After that the message session is established. For session based messaging the SDP offer in the first INVITE request may indicate the maximum message size UE#1 accepts to receive and the 200 OK (Offer response) to the INVITE request may indicate the maximum message size UE#2 accepts to receive.\n31.\tUE#1 establishes a reliable end-to-end connection with UE#2 to exchange the message media.\n32.\tUE#1 generates the message content and sends it to UE#2 using the established message connection.\n33.\tUE#2 acknowledges the message with a response that indicates that UE#2 has received the message. The response traverses back to UE#1. After receiving the message UE#2 renders the multimedia content to the user.\nFurther messages may be exchanged in either direction between UE#1 and UE#2 using the established connection. The size of the messages exchanged within the session shall be within the size limits indicated by UE#1 and UE#2 respectively.\nSession based messaging between more than two UEs require the establishment of a session based messaging conference.\nWithin session based messaging conferences including multiple UEs (e.g. multiparty chat conferences) an MRFC/MRFP or an IMS AS shall be used to control the media resources.\nWhen MRFC/MRFP are used, then conferencing principles are used to provide the chat service:\n-\tMRFP must be able to establish message connections with all involved parties.\n-\tMRFC/MRFP must be able to receive messages from conference participants and to distribute messages to all or some of the participants.\n-\tIn order to enable the UE managing information related to the session based messaging conference the MRFC may be co-located with an IMS AS.\n-\tMRFC/MRFP roles and interactions with an AS are described in more detail in clauses 4.7, 5.14.1 and 5.14.2.\n-\tThe interface for session based messaging between MRFC and MRFP is not standardised in this release. When an AS is used, then the IMS service control architecture is used to provide the chat service. Both signalling and user plane are then supported by the AS. For more details, see clause 4.2.\nThe following flow shows the originating session based messaging set up using an intermediate server for a chat service. In this case the intermediate chat server is addressed by the UE#1 using a PSI. It is assumed that UE#1 is the first UE entering the chat session.\nNOTE:\tInteractions between MRFC and MRFP are not shown in the flows below since these interactions are not standardized. An optional ringing response from MRFC/AS to the UE is not shown in the following procedure.\nFigure 5 illustrates a session-based messaging system using a chat server, where users can send and receive messages in real-time. The system uses a chat server to store messages and allows users to initiate a conversation. The figure shows the user interface and the chat server's architecture, including the chat server, message queue, and user interface components.\nFigure 5.48b: Session based messaging using a chat server\n1.\tUE #1 sends the SIP INVITE request addressed to a conferencing or chat PSI to the P-CSCF.

An optional ringing response from AS to the UE or vice versa is not shown in the following procedure.\nThe figure depicts a session-based messaging system with an intermediate node, illustrating the communication process.\nFigure 5.48c: Session based messaging with an intermediate node\n1.\tUE#1 sends the SIP INVITE request addressed to UE#2, containing an initial SDP, to the P-CSCF.

It is assumed that UE#1 is the session host.\nThe figure depicts a message session release procedure, illustrating the steps taken to release a message session in a network. The figure shows a message session release process, including the initiation of a session, the transmission of a session key, and the release of the session. The release procedure is depicted in a step-by-step manner, with each step clearly labeled and accompanied by a corresponding visual element. The figure is a crucial visual aid in understanding the message session release process and its components.\nFigure 5.48d: Message session release procedure\n1–6.\tUE#1 indicates its intent to terminate the message session by sending a BYE request to UE#2.

The refreshing period is typically in the range of several tens of minutes / hours. The mechanism is intended as a complementary mechanism for the \"Network initiated session release\" described in clause 5.10.3. Whether the session refresh mechanism is used for a particular session is negotiated between the endpoints of the session upon session initiation.\nIMS entities acting as User Agents as defined in IETF RFC 3261 [12] should support the refresh mechanism of SIP sessions.

                            "text_content": "This clause presents some high level flows to describe the procedures for supporting IMS transit network scenarios.\nThe IMS Transit Functions perform an analysis of the destination address, and determine where to route the session. The session may be routed directly to an MGCF, BGCF, or to another IMS entity in the same network, to another IMS network, or to a CS domain or PSTN. The address analysis may use public (e.g. DNS, ENUM) and/or private database lookups, and/or locally configured data. As described in clause 4.15 there are various transit configurations possible that may be supported.\nFor the case where an operator is providing transit functions for other operators and/or enterprise networks, the configuration is as shown in Figure 5.49. The configuration in Figure 5.49 is also intended to cover scenarios where an operator routes traffic from other IMS- or SIP-networks to CS domain or PSTN customers through the IMS transit network. In this case the terminating network as shown in the figure indicates the operator's CS domain or PSTN.\nThe IMS transit network, depicted in Figure 5.49, illustrates the intricate network architecture used for inter-modal transportation. This figure showcases the various components and their interconnections, including the intermodal transport hubs, the transit network, and the intermodal transport services. The figure highlights the importance of efficient routing and scheduling to ensure smooth and timely transit of passengers and goods.\nFigure 5.49: IMS transit network\nFor the transit operator in Figure 5.49, ISUP messages that arrive at a configured MGCF, are translated into SIP, and are passed to the IMS Transit Functions. SIP messages may arrive directly at the configured entity supporting the transit functions or first pass through an IBCF before arriving at the IMS Transit Functions. The IMS Transit Functions determine whether to route directly to an MGCF, BGCF, or to another IP entity on the path (e.g. an IBCF). In this transit operator configuration, the IMS Transit Functions might reside in a stand-alone entity or might be combined with the functionality of an MGCF, a BGCF, an I-CSCF, an S-CSCF or an IBCF. When residing in a stand-alone entity the IMS Transit Functions shall be able to generate CDRs.\nFor the case where the operator is the terminating network operator handling a terminating service for its own customers, the configuration and operation may be more complex as shown in figure 5.50.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the case of Fixed Broadband Access to IMS the term \"CS domain\" in the following text and in figure 5.50 may be replaced by the term \"PSTN\".\nThe figure depicts a terminating IMS network with transit support, illustrating the various transit functions that are essential for ensuring reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 5.50: Terminating IMS network with transit support, Transit Functions first\nFor the operator in figure 5.50, ISUP messages arriving at an MGCF may be destined for an IMS or a CS domain customer (see clause 4.15). The ISUP messages are translated into SIP.\nThe operator can choose whether to route all traffic through the IMS Transit Functions, which subsequently route to the I-CSCF for IMS terminating call scenarios or to an MGCF for the case of CS domain subscribers as described above. This is depicted in figure 5.50. In this case, there may be an additional delay for terminating sessions destined for IMS subscribers.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this case, the IMS Transit Functions perform selection of the appropriate domain to terminate the call to, followed by routing to the CS domain (for CS domain destined traffic).\nAs an alternative, the operator may choose to route all traffic to the I-CSCF directly and then identify those sessions that are not destined to IMS subscribers based on an HSS query. Based on the response from the HSS, sessions are either routed to an S-CSCF or to the CS domain (optionally via Transit Functions). In this case there may be an additional delay for terminating sessions destined for the CS domain subscribers.\nNOTE 3:\tIf in this case, the I-CSCF becomes aware that the call is not destined to an IMS subscriber and forwards it to the Transit Function for further routing, then the Transit Functions only perform routing to the CS domain.\nIt is the operator's choice to determine which way to route the SIP messages, first through IMS Transit Functions or first to an I-CSCF. This may depend on whether the majority of the sessions that enter the IMS network, are destined to IMS or CS domain subscribers.\nNOTE 4:\tIn either configuration of the terminating network scenario, once it is determined that the call is not destined for an IMS subscriber, it is necessary to verify that the call is destined for a CS domain subscriber rather than to a ported number or to a wrong number. At which stage of the session establishment this decision is made is FFS.\nIn the terminating network configuration shown in figure 5.50, the IMS Transit Functions might reside in a stand-alone entity or might be combined with the functionality of an MGCF, a BGCF, an I-CSCF, an S-CSCF, or an IBCF. When residing in a stand-alone entity the IMS Transit Functions shall be able to generate CDRs.\nFor the case where an IMS network serves as a transit network and as a terminating network (depending on the destination of the session), the configuration and operation resembles that of the previous case as shown in figure 5.50a and figure 5.50b.\nThe figure depicts a terminating/transit IMS network, illustrating the first stage of the network's function. It shows the termination of the network at the IMS (Intermediate System) and the transit functions that occur before the network is fully functional.\nFigure 5.50a: Terminating/Transit IMS network, Transit Functions first\nThe figure depicts a terminating/transit IMS network, with the I-CSCF (Intermediate Switching Center) first. It illustrates the network's architecture, including the I-CSCF, I-BSC (Intermediate Base Station Switching Center), and I-BSC (Intermediate Base Station), as well as the I-CSCF's role in terminating and transitioning traffic.\nFigure 5.50b: Terminating/Transit IMS network, I-CSCF first\nFor the operator in figure 5.50a and figure 5.50b, ISUP messages arriving at an MGCF may be destined for the own IMS network of for a succeeding network. The ISUP messages are translated into SIP. This is not depicted in figure 5.50a and figure 5.50b.\nThe operator can choose whether to route all traffic through the IMS Transit Functions, which subsequently route to the I-CSCF for sessions destined for subscribers of the own IMS network, to the own CS domain for sessions destined to subscribers of the own CS domain, or to a succeeding network for sessions not destined for subscribers of the own IMS network or the own CS domain. This is depicted in figure 5.50a. In this case there may be an additional delay for sessions destined to subscribers of the own network.\nNOTE 5:\tIn this case, the Transit Functions perform selection of the appropriate domain to terminate the call to, for subscribers of the own network, followed by routing to another network (if the session is not destined to the own network).\nAs an alternative, the operator may choose to route all traffic to the I-CSCF directly and then identify those sessions that are not destined to IMS subscribers of the own IMS network based on an HSS query. Based on the response from the HSS, sessions are either routed to an S-CSCF of the own IMS network or to Transit Functions. The Transit Functions subsequently route the session to either the CS domain of the own network or to a succeeding network. This is depicted in figure 5.50b. In this case there may be an additional delay for sessions not destined to subscribers of the own IMS network.\nIt is the operator's choice to determine which way to route the SIP messages, first through IMS Transit Functions or first to an I-CSCF. This may depend on whether the majority of the sessions that enter the IMS network, are destined to subscribers of the own IMS network or not. This operator's choice may be implemented as a functionality of an entry functions such as an IBCF.\nIn the terminating/transit network configuration shown in figure 5.50a and figure 5.50b, the IMS Transit Functions might reside in a stand-alone entity or might be combined with the functionality of an MGCF, a BGCF, an I-CSCF, an S-CSCF, or an IBCF. When residing in a stand-alone entity the IMS Transit Functions shall be able to generate CDRs.\n",

The AS or the S-CSCF may assert the authorization for priority in the INVITE. The AS then forwards the INVITE (with MPS priority indication and the Service User's priority level) to the next entity in the network via the S-CSCF as part of the normal IMS routing.

The \"X.Y.Z.\" refers to the clause heading number.\nThe figure A.1 illustrates the information flow in a 5G network, showing how signals are transmitted from the source to the destination. The diagram includes various components such as base stations (BSs), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Key elements include the base station (BS), which is responsible for transmitting signals, the user equipment (UE), which receives the signal, and the scatterers, which are obstacles that can interfere with the signal. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure A.1: Information Flow Template\nThis clause consists of subparagraphs each dedicated to one information flow of the IF diagram. For each information flow, a detailed description is provided on the information flow name, certain information elements (IEs) within the information flow, whether the IE is mandatory or optional (M/O), in the sequence as shown in the IF diagram. FE actions (FEA) are also provided in this clause. This clause format is proposed as follows:\n1.\tInitial information flow: One should normally describe the initiating FE Action (FEA) leading to the first flow. Any information that is specifically required to support the operation should be mentioned (e.g. this flow conveys the user identity to the HSS).\n2.\tEach paragraph should contain a brief description of the flow and any specific start and end FEAs. When information to be conveyed is optional, the conditions for its inclusion should be specified and the response to its presence when received should also be specified (e.g. Include IP Address when condition xyz occurs). For an information flow that is required, the description should indicate whether a response is required based on successful outcome to the received IF, failed outcome, both or neither. e.g. \"Response is required indicating Success or Failure\".\n3.\tFlows may occur in either direction but not both at the same time. To indicate a shorthand for multiple flows, use a procedure box as in flow 5 or 6.\n4.\tFlows that are an optional part of the procedure should be shown as dotted arrows as in flow 4. These may appear in either direction.\n5.\tA set of flows, representing a common procedure, is shown by a box. The procedure should be numbered and named with a name that corresponds to the procedure as described elsewhere. The location of the box on an entity represents the start of the common procedure regardless of the number of the entities involved in the procedure.\n6.\tAn optional set of flows is represented as a dashed box. Otherwise the use is the same as in flow 5.\n7.\tA small number of alternative flows may be shown within a dashed box. The alternatives are shown by a letter immediately following the flow number, e.g. 7a, 7b, 7c, etc. Where a single alternative results in multiple flows, they must be shown with an indication of the proper sequence, e.g. 7b1, 7b2. The subparagraph describing the information flow must describe the decision process taken in choice of alternatives.\n7a.\tAlternative (a) is described. If alternative (a) is a single information flow, the contents and purpose of that information flow is included here.\n7b.\tAlternative (b) is described.\n7b1.\tThe first information flow of alternative (b) is described\n7b2.\tThe second information flow of alternative (b) is described. Etc.\n8.\tThe final flow in a procedure may provide additional information regarding other procedures that might follow it but such information is not required.\nThe general characteristics of the information flow template are as follows:\n-\tAll relevant functional entities are contained in the flow diagram. Only relevant entities need be shown.\n-\tWhen an element occurs only in an information flows for which several alternatives exist, the description box for the functional entity and the vertical line shall be dashed lines.\n-\tThe specific network affiliation of functional entities may be shown using a labelled bracket over the specific entities as shown in the figure (e.g. Home Network). Such labelling is not required unless the flow would not be clear without it.\n-\tThe number associated with each flow provides a \"handle\" to the functional entity action (FEA) executed by the FE receiving the flow. This number is known only within the scope of the specific information flow diagram. The description of this functional entity action (FEA) immediately follows the information flow description.\n-\tCommon Procedures described elsewhere can be used in the information flows in order to simplify the diagram. These may be either required or optional.\n-\tEach common procedure is treated as a single action and therefore is given a unique number.\n-\tAn optional flows (flows 4 and 6) are indicated by a dashed arrow or box.\n-\tCo-ordinated flows or flows that illustrate parallel actions are indicated by the flow text description. For example one might see a description such as: \"flows 5 and 6 may be initiated any time after flow 3\".\n-\tSequential operation is assumed unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n",

The functionality is defined in TS 26.114 [76] and affects the following system entities: UE, RAN, P-CSCF and PCRF/PCF.\nDuring SIP registration or emergency registration if the network supports ANBR as specified in TS 26.114 [76] and RAN-assisted codec adaptation as specified in TS 36.300 [99] and TS 36.321 [100], the P-CSCF indicates 'anbr' support to the UE.\nNOTE:\tWhen IMS services are provided in deployments with home routed traffic a supporting P-CSCF does not indicate its capability to handle the 'anbr' SDP attribute unless it is configured to know that the roaming partner supports RAN assisted codec adaptation with access network bitrate recommendation.\nAs specified in TS 26.114 [76]:\n-\tsupport for RAN assisted codec adaptation can be used only if it is supported end-to-end.\n-\tsupport for RAN assisted codec adaptation is assumed to be homogeneous in a PLMN i.e. all affected system entities in a PLMN including equivalent PLMNs need to support it. RAN support is required on E-UTRA.\n-\tthe UE includes the 'anbr' attribute in the SDP offer only if the P-CSCF has indicated its ability to handle it.\n-\tthe P-CSCF forwards the 'anbr' attribute if it has received it in the SDP offer from the UE.\n-\twhen the 'anbr' attribute is successfully negotiated end-to-end, the PCRF/PCF uses MBR>GBR setting for the corresponding IP-CAN bearer relying on RAN assisted codec adaptation.\nA UE supporting Multimedia Telephony and RAN assisted codec adaptation shall support the procedures described in TS 26.114 [76].\nThis annex provides some background information related to clause 5.4.5.3.\nThe S-CSCF is the focal point of home control. It guarantees operator control over sessions. Therefore IMS has been designed to guarantee that all initial session signalling requests goes through the Home S-CSCF on both terminating and originating side. A number of tasks performed by the S-CSCF are performed either at registration time or immediately during session set-up, e.g. evaluation of initial filter criteria. However, there are tasks of the S-CSCF, which require the presence of the S-CSCF in the signalling path afterwards:\n-\tMedia parameter control: If the S-CSCF finds media parameters that local policy or the user's subscriber profile does not allow to be used within an IMS session, it informs the originator. This requires record-routing in the S-CSCF. For example, change of media parameters using UPDATE would by-pass a S-CSCF, which does not record-route.\n-\tCDR generation: The S-CSCF generates CDRs, which are used for offline charging and for statistical purposes. A S-CSCF, which does not record-route, would not even be aware of session termination. If the CDRs at the S-CSCF are needed, then the S-CSCF must record-route.\n-\tNetwork initiated session release: The S-CSCF may generate a network-initiated session release, e.g. for administrative reasons. For that purpose a S-CSCF needs to be aware of ongoing sessions. In particular it must be aware of hard state dialogs that are required to be terminated by an explicit SIP request.\n-\tIf a UE registered to the S-CSCF uses a Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) assigned by the S-CSCF as a contact address when establishing a dialog, then the S-CSCF needs to remain in the signalling path in order to translate mid-dialog requests addressed to that contact address.\nThe above criteria are particularly important for \"multimedia telephony\" type peer-to-peer communication.\n-\tMedia parameter control guarantees that the user does not use services he or she did not pay for.\n-\tFor telephony type services the session charging component is the most important one.\n-\tIf a subscriber is administratively blocked, the network shall have the possibility to terminate ongoing communication.\nMore generally, all the tasks are needed; thus they need to be provided elsewhere if the S-CSCF does not record-route.\nOn the other hand there are client-server based services, which may be offered by the home operator. An example of such service available today where the no record route principle is applied, is Presence, where notifications need not go through the S-CSCF. Another example could be where the UE initiates a session to an Application Server (AS) in the home operator's domain, e.g. video download. In such cases:\n-\tThe server implementation (or the server's knowledge of user subscription data) may limit the allowed media parameters.\n-\tCharging will be mostly event-based charging (content charging) and depends on the information provided from the AS.\n-\tThe AS can terminate sessions. And the dialogs may be soft state dialogs, which are not required to be terminated by an explicit SIP request (e.g. SUBSCRIBE dialogs).\nHowever not in all cases the AS would receive the necessary information, which usually triggers session release (e.g. for administrative reasons).\nThus, for some client-server based services, it might not be necessary to keep the S-CSCF in the path. It may be desirable for an operator to avoid the load in the S-CSCF and control the service from the AS. For such services \"no record-routing in S-CSCF\" may be configured together with the initial filter criteria, as defined in clause 5.4.5.3.\n",

In the rest of this clause NAT will be used for all of the devices that perform one or more of NA(P)T and NA(P)T-PT functions.\nNote that the procedures of this Annex shall only be applied when they are necessary. If the terminal and/or the access network provide a transparent way of NAT traversal or no IP address translation is needed between the IP-CAN and the IMS domain on the media path then the function as defined in this Annex shall not be invoked.\nIt is expected the NAT traversal methods of this Annex will co-exist. UE may support one or more of these methods. It shall be possible for an operator to use one or more of NAT traversal methods in its IMS domain. The selection of the method for a particular case shall depend on the UE's capabilities, the capabilities of the network and policies of the operator.\nWhere possible, usage of these procedures shall not adversely impact usage of power saving modes in the UEs, i.e. when the NAT is integrated with the IMS Access Gate way which is under operator control, the reserved temporary addresses and port (binding) should be retained without requiring keep-alive messages from the UE. If the access type to IMS is GPRS, then the UE is not required to initiate any keep-alive messages, see clause E.6 for more information.\nNOTE:\tA solution to allow power saving modes when non-operator controlled NATs are used is not defined in this version of the specification.\n",

The figure shows the various stages of packet forwarding, including the initial transmission from the source to the IMS Access Gateway, the routing of the packet through the IMS Access Gateway, and the final transmission to the destination. The figure highlights the importance of packet forwarding in ensuring the smooth functioning of the Internet's transport layer.\nFigure G.5: Packet forwarding in the IMS Access Gateway\n1)\tUE_A sends a media packet to the transport address of the IMS Access Gateway that was received during the session establishment/modification.\n2)\tAfter receiving the media packet the IMS Access Gateway recognizes the media flow based on the transport address where the packet arrived at. The IMS Access Gateway changes the source transport address to its own transport address that was given to the UE_B as the destination transport address during session establishment/modification and the destination transport address to the transport address of UE_B.\nThe IMS Access Gateway can learn the transport addresses where the inbound (i.e. towards the UE) media packets shall be forwarded to in two ways, depending on whether there is a NAT device in the path or not. In absence of a NAT device in the path, it is the P-CSCF that signals the destination transport address for the inbound media flows.

The IBCF inserts additional codecs in the SIP signalling. The calling UE capabilities are contained in the SDP offer. Based on the interworking agreement between IM CN subsystems, terminating IBCFs acting as the network entry points may also insert additional codecs in the SIP signalling.\nThe IBCF and TrGW in Figure I.4 below may be located in the originating network (the IBCF acts as an exit point), or in the terminating network (the IBCF acts as an entry point). There can also be additional IBCF's and TrGW's (not shown) in the case of scenarios involving transit networks.\nThe figure depicts a proactive transcoding invocation in a network, illustrating the process of transcoding video content to optimize network performance. The invocation is initiated by a proactive transcoder, which is a device that automatically adjusts the video encoding parameters based on the network conditions. This helps to reduce the network load and improve the overall quality of the video stream. The figure shows the network architecture, including the proactive transcoder, the transcoding engine, and the transcoding queue. The figure also highlights the importance of network performance and the role of proactive transcoding in optimizing video streaming.\nFigure I.4: Proactive transcoding invocation\n1.\tUE (A) initiates an IMS session towards User B, via the session path for IMS and the session is analysed at the IMS network of UE (A).\n2.\tThe IMS network of UE (A) determines that the User B's domain need be communicated via IBCF and forwards the request to the IBCF.\n3.\tThe IBCF checks the SIP message and decides whether additional codec(s) need be inserted into SIP message based on the session information (such as ICSI , SDP) and interworking agreement. When inserting additional codec(s), the network should be able to indicate the preferred codec order. A TrGW is allocated.\n4.\tThe IBCF generates a new SIP message towards User B network based on the received SIP message where additional codec(s) have been added and where the transport address and port information has been altered to indicate the addresses associated by the TrGW.\n5.\tUser (B) selects a codec from the offer modified by IBCF, and responds with an SDP answer.\n6.\tWhen receiving the SDP answer, if the IBCF invoked the TrGW in step 3, it now configures the TrGW with address and port towards UE (B). The IBCF checks if the agreed codec belongs to the original offer it received in step 3 or it is one of the codecs that was added by IBCF. If the agreed codec was added by the IBCF, the IBCF configures the TrGW to enable the transcoding functionality. Otherwise, the IBCF will not invoke the transcoding function.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the IBCF forwards an SDP offer without allocating a TrGW and changing the connection information, and the subsequent SDP answer indicates selection of a transcoding option associated with the TrGW, then the IBCF needs to allocate a TrGW and initiate another SDP offer/answer transaction to forward the TrGW connection information. If the IBCF forwards an SDP offer with connection information for its TrGW, and the subsequent SDP answer indicates the use of an original codec (transcoding is not needed), then the IBCF can initiate another SDP offer/answer transaction to forward the original connection information, and de-allocate the TrGW. The details are not shown.\n7.\tThe IBCF generates a new response message back to UE (A) based on the received response message where the codec received from peer side has been replaced with the selected codec.\nNOTE 2:\tOn the new response message the selected codec will based on the SDP offer received by IBCF on step 3.\n8.\tSession signalling path is established between User (A) and IBCF, IBCF and User (B).\n9.\tThe media path is established between the UE (A) and the TrGW, and then between the TrGW and user B.\nAt session release, the codec transcoding resource will be released.\nThe following example session flow shows a reactive transcoding scenario where IBCF located at the network exit point first determines if a session can be established without addition of transcoding options and, will insert additional codecs in the SIP signalling only after failure to establish a session due to lack of a common codec. Based on the interworking agreement between IM CN subsystems the terminating IBCF may also perform this function.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the event a session is being forked in the terminating network, the reactive transcoding will only be performed if all UEs receiving the forked request initially reject the session for any reason, e.g. due to lack of support for the offered codecs.\nThe figure depicts a reactive transcoding invocation in a network, illustrating the process of transcoding a video stream from one format to another. The figure shows the network architecture, including the network elements such as the transcoding server, transcoding engine, and transcoding client. The figure also highlights the use of network protocols like HTTP and RTSP for the transcoding process.\nFigure I.5: Reactive transcoding invocation\n1.\tUE (A) initiates an IMS session towards User B, and the session is analysed at the IBCF. The SDP offer is forwarded toward User B without the proactive addition of transcoding options.\n2.\tA subsequent entity in the signalling path determines that it does not support any codec in the SDP offer and answers with an appropriate error response. This response may include a list of supported codecs.\nNOTE 2:\tThe subsequent entity in the signalling path can be a network entity in a transit network, in the terminating network, or UE (B).\n3.\tBased on the response, the IBCF detects the need for reactive transcoding invocation.\n4.\tThe IBCF instructs the TrGW to allocate media processing resources for the session, allocate appropriate transcoding resources for the session and bridge the media flows between the calling and called party endpoints.\n5.\tBased on the response from the TrGW, the IBCF creates a new SDP offer that contains the codec and transport address information received from the TrGW. If no information about supported codecs was available from the error response, the IBCF may offer all codecs supported by the transcoding device. The IBCF sends this SDP offer towards UE (B).\n6.\tUE (B) selects a codec and acknowledges the SDP offer with an SDP answer.\n7.\tUpon receipt of the SDP answer, the IBCF updates the TrGW with the information from the SDP answer.\n8.\tThe IBCF prepares an SDP answer to the SDP offer in step 1, including the selected codec and transport address information for the originating side of the TrGW. The session between the end-points is now established with the media flow traversing the transcoding device.\nAt session release, the codec transcoding resource will be released.\n",

For such a call to succeed, a NAPT-PT capable media relay is needed to be inserted in the media path. The alternatives for this are: to deploy either IMS-AGWs either in home or visited network; or TURN servers in visited network.\nTo use IMS-AGWs in the home network is the way the home operator is able to control whether the IMS user plane traffic shall be routed home or not in this scenario. Thus, it is possible to do NAPT-PT, but it will be done in the home network, which means all traffic that needs interworking will be home routed.\nTo use TURN servers requires all IPv6 terminals to support TURN IPv4 - IPv6 interworking, and that the visited network supports TURN IPv4 - IPv6 interworking.\nNOTE 1:\tSince IPv4 - IPv6 interworking must be done on IPv6 side, IPv6 originating sessions to IPv4 UEs may need an extra INVITE because first INVITE may fail.\nNOTE 2:\tAn IP type PDU session for a 5GS UE will have either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address, see Annex Y.\n",

The figure shows the network topology, with the P-CSCF acting as a central point for routing and control, and the VPLMN providing a private network for the cloud services.\nFigure M.3.1.3: Example scenario with P-CSCF located in visited network and with VPLMN routing\n1.\tThe roaming UE sends an INVITE request to the P-CSCF.\n2.\tP-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to the visited IBCF.

A loopback indicator is included in the INVITE request to inform the VPLMN that this request is being routed back to the VPLMN for call routing. The S-CSCF can also forward UE location information to the VPLMN. If a reference to the preferred Transit and Roaming Function is available in the request, the S-CSCF uses this information to route the session back to the VPLMN.

The Transit and Roaming Function routes the request toward the destination network based on available SIP URI, ENUM lookup, or BGCF routing. The Transit and Roaming Function can use information such as originating UE location to select a nearby egress point for media anchoring.\n12.\tIf the called party is determined to be available in IMS, the call is routed towards the remote end through an IBCF. If the called party is determined to be available in CS, the call is broken out to CS through an MGCF. If the called party is determined to be available in VPLMN, the call is routed to the I-CSCF.

It illustrates the flow of information from the source to the destination, with the trigger logic determining when to initiate the transcoding process.

            "description": "The purpose of optimal media routing (OMR) is to identify and remove unnecessary media functions from the media path for each media stream associated with a session.\nThe IP Multimedia Subsystem has the option to deploy media functions such as TrGWs on the media path associated with each media stream associated with a session. These media functions can perform only transport level functions such as firewall or NAT, or can also perform application level functions such as transcoding or conferencing. These media functions are typically allocated proactively during SDP offer/answer signalling within a session since it is unknown which of the functions are actually needed for a media stream until the SDP offer/answer signalling completes. For example, a transcoder can be allocated during session establishment but whether transcoding is needed is determined once the SDP offer reaches the far endpoint. In another example, the IBCFs at the boundary of a network allocate TrGWs to protect media functions within the network or to provide address translation to the private address space used within the network, however it might be determined later during session establishment that no media resources are needed within the network, thus making the TrGWs unnecessary.\nAny SIP signalling entity within the IMS network that allocates, to a session flow, a media function that might later be determined to be unnecessary may implement the procedures in this Annex to assist in the removal of unnecessary media functions. In particular, any entity with an IMS-ALG may implement the OMR algorithm. This includes the IBCF (see Annex I) and P-CSCF (see Annex G). Any AS performing as a B2BUA controlling media resources may also implement the OMR procedures. Annex Q shows every controlling OMR entity as an IMS-ALG and every controlled media resources as a TrGW, but other options are possible. An MGCF or AS performing as UA may also implement OMR procedures to assist in the removal of unnecessary media functions in some cases. MGCF and AS procedures can be derived from the procedures in this annex by collocating an IMS-ALG with the MGCF or AS.\nThe OMR procedures identify and name the IP address realm used for each media path segment among UAs and TrGWs. The terms IP realm and realm are equivalent to the term IP address realm in this annex. An IP realm name is associated with each set of IP endpoints that are mutually reachable via IP routing and without address translation. Endpoints in different IP realms usually require allocation of a TrGW between those IP realms for connectivity and possibly for NAT.\nWhen endpoints in different IP realms are mutually reachable without allocation of a TrGW, then OMR procedures may use provisioned information about such connected IP realms to determine possible optimal media paths through these connected realms.\nNOTE:\tConnected IP realms are particularly useful when there are bilateral IP transport connections between operator networks, e.g. using IP tunnels via IP transport networks. In this case, each operator network can manage its own IP realm for inter-operator interconnection and provision the names of connected IP realms. Without the concept of connected IP realms, each bilateral connection (e.g. IP tunnel) in this example would need to be defined as its own IP realm.\nIMS-ALGs implementing OMR shall include information in forwarded SDP regarding IP realm, codec and IP connectivity information for TrGWs on the media path to assist in bypassing unnecessary TrGWs. A TrGW can be bypassed when it is not required to transcode, when it is unnecessary to protect a network resource, and when a successive TrGW on the path is reachable by a previous TrGW on the path via a common IP realm.\nThe OMR procedures have the following additional characteristics:\n-\tThey build on the ALG NAT traversal model that is an alternative to the ICE NAT traversal model.\n-\tThey usually complete within a single end-to-end SDP offer/answer transaction. Some transcoding scenarios require additional signalling to complete optimisation.\n-\tThey apply independently to each media stream established by an SDP offer/answer transaction.\n-\tThey apply to media streams established between any types of endpoints (e.g. UEs, media servers, media gateways).\n-\tThey apply to media streams established using SIP 3pcc procedures. OMR applies to the endpoints of an SDP offer/answer transaction and not necessarily to the endpoints of a SIP dialog.\n-\tThey apply separately to each dialog when forking occurs. An IMS-ALG shall delay the release of a TrGW for OMR until it is clear that no forked dialog needs the TrGW.\n-\tFor early media negotiated with the same SDP as normal media, the OMR procedures have no direct impact on early media handling since path modifications are in place as soon as the SDP offer/answer transaction completes. An IMS-ALG can anchor in place any TrGW needed for blocking of unauthorized early media by removing OMR SDP extension attributes as necessary. For separate early-session disposition SDP the OMR algorithm shall not be applied.\n-\tThey do not require endpoints to support new procedures, although some additional optimisations are possible in some special cases.\n",

The SDP offer may contain SRTP, ICE and Data Channel information. The WIC-1 IP address is IP1.\n2.\tThe eP-CSCF-1 receives the SDP offer from WIC-1. The eP-CSCF-1 allocates eIMS-AGW1 and configures it to terminate ICE procedures and provide interworking (e.g. transcoding, or transport interworking between a Data Channel and transport outside a Data Channel). eIMS-AGW1 allocates address IP2. It also requests the media gateway to provide a transport port suitable for a transparent forwarding of the media. IMS-AGW1 allocates port P2t for that purpose. Depending on configuration, it either configures the IMS-AGW1to terminate or to transparently forward the DTLS layer for transparent media. The eP-CSCF-1 shall not apply OMR procedures according to Annex Q.\n3.\tThe eP-CSCF-1 describes the new media2 that result from the interworking and inserts the address IP2 at the eIMS-AGW1 in the SDP offer connection line it sends. Within the SDP offer, the eP-CSCF-1 also indicates that the media1 targeted for transparent forwarding (those media are called \"transparent media\" in what follows) can be selected instead and also encapsulates in SDP attribute(s) information about those transparent media (SDP attributes, SDP media line including transport protocol and port P2t, Data Channel related information, but no ICE related information. A DTLS fingerprint is included, and depending on configuration, it either contains the fingerprint received from the WIC-1 or a fingerprint allocated by eIMS-AGW1). To enable the check in step 6 wether intermediates which do not support switching to the encapsulated media are inserted into the media path, the eP-CSCF-1 also encapsulates the address IP2.\n4.\tA possible intermediate (e.g. IBCF with attached TrGW or MTFC with attached MRFP) may also insert a media gateway into the user plane. Such an intermediate may optionally also support switching to the transparent media; this is required to allow the transparent media to be selected when its media gateway is present in the media path. Intermediates which do not support switching to the transparent media will be detected and will cause media 2 to be selected in step 6.\nThe possible intermediate can also apply OMR procedures according to Annex Q to offer that its media gateway is bypassed by an optimised media path.\n5\tThe intermediate replaces the transport address within the connection line in the SDP offer with the address IP3 allocated at its media gateway. If the intermediate supports switching to the transparent media, it also modifies the transparent media information encapsulated in SDP attribute(s) by replacing the encapsulated transport address with IP3 and the port information with P3t.\n6.\teP-CSCF-2 allocates eIMS-AGW2. It compares the transport address in the SDP connection line with the transport address in the transparent media information encapsulated in SDP attribute(s). Because both addresses match, the eP-CSCF-2 takes the transparent media information into consideration. Otherwise it shall ignore the transparent media information. The eP-CSCF-2 shall not apply OMR procedures according to Annex Q and shall discard any received OMR related information. Because eP-CSCF2 knows that the served WIC-2 is a WIC, it decides that the transparent media information is appropriate and configures the eIMS-AGW2 to transparently forward those media; depending on configuration, eP-CSCF2 either configures the eIMS-AGW2 either transparently forward the DTLS layer or to terminate it, and it either forwards the fingerprint received as part of the transparent media information or a fingerprint allocated by eIMS-AGW2.\n7.\tThe eP-CSCF-2 forwards SDP offer with the transparent media1 and the transport address IP4 allocated at eIMS-AGW2 to WIC-2.\n8.\tWIC2 selects media3 from the offered media1 and sends the selected media3 in the SDP answer to the eP-CSCF-2.\n9.\tThe eP-CSCF-2 forwards the SDP answer including connection information for eIMS-AGW2 and the unmodified media3, and includes an indication that the transparent media have been selected. Depending on configuration, it either forwards the fingerprint received from WIC2 or a fingerprint allocated by eIMS-AGW2.\n10.\tThe possible intermediate reconfigures its MGW to transparently pass media3.\n11.\tThe intermediate forwards the SDP answer with unmodified media3 and indication that the transparent media have been selected and includes address information IP7 of the controlled MGW.\n12.\tAccording to received SDP answer, the eP-CSCF-1 knows that there is no bearer level protocol conversion.

A media termination includes media resources for one or multiple media streams on the Mb interface.\nEach media resource context is identified by a Media Resource Context ID.\nEach media termination is identified by a Termination ID.\nEach media stream is identified by a Media ID and specified by a media descriptor.\nNOTE:\tTermination is a concept widely used in media protocols like H.248. When a media stream, e.g. application data channel, pass through the MF, there is one termination for the input stream and one termination for the output stream. In this case, the two terminations can use the same media ID.\nFigure AA.2.5.2.1-1illustrates the above.

                    "text_content": "Figure AC.7.1-1depicts a signalling flow diagram for establishing a bootstrap data channel in a person-to-person use case. The MF anchors the bootstrap data channel, and the originating network is offering a bootstrap data channel to the remote peer as well for application download.\nIn the call flow the two UEs have already established an IMS audio session, and the originating UE is updating the IMS audio/video session to an IMS data channel session.\nNOTE 1:\tSome SIP signalling not relevant for the procedure, is not shown in the call flow below.\nThe figure depicts a detailed setup for the Bootstrap Data Channel, which is a crucial component of the signalling procedure in an AC.7 network. The diagram illustrates the various components, such as the base station (BTS), the user equipment (UE), and the signal path, which are essential for the efficient transmission of data. The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy and failover mechanisms, ensuring the reliability of the network.\nFigure AC.7.1-1: Bootstrap Data Channel set up Signalling Procedure\nThe steps in the call flow are as follows:\n1.\tUE#1 sends the SIP INVITE request with an initial SDP to the IMS AS, through P-CSCF and S-CSCF in the originating network. The initial SDP contains offers for the bootstrap data channel establishment request with bootstrap DC stream ID. In this example procedure, the SDP contains both bootstrap data channel offers for originating side and terminating side.\nNOTE 2:\tThis SIP INVITE can also be a SIP re-INVITE performed after the initial IMS audio session is setup.\n2.\tIMS AS validates user subscription data to determine whether the data channel call request should be notified to DCSF.\nIf the IMS AS determined, based on the user profile, that data channel call request needs to be notified to DCSF, the IMS AS selects a DCSF for this user based on local configuration or discovery and selection of a DCSF instance via NRF.\nIf the IMS AS determined, based on the user profile, that the data channel call request need not to be notified to DCSF, or DCSF decides that DC request is not allowed, the IMS AS proceeds with normal IMS procedures to setup the MMTel session without performing Data Channel bootstrapping, by deleting DC related media information and sending the updated SIP INVITE to the originating S-CSCF.\n3.\tIMS AS notifies the DCSF of the DC call event by sending Nimsas_SessionEventControl_Notify (SessionEstablishmentRequestEvent, Session ID, Calling ID, Called ID, Session Case, Event initiator, Media InfoList, DC Stream ID) request to the DCSF.\n4.\tAfter receiving the DC control request, the DCSF determines the policy about how to process the bootstrap data channel establishment request based on the related parameters in the Data Channel control request (e.g. CallingID, CalledID, DC Stream ID) and/or DCSF service specific policy.\n5.\tSince the SessionEstablishmentRequestEvent indicates that served user is offered local bootstrap media, DCSF, based on its policies reserves originating side MDC1 media information, as well as the terminating side MDC1 remote bootstrap media (targeting remote UE), which are used to receive UE request for application downloading from MF or MRF.\n6.\tDCSF invokes the Nimsas_MediaControl_MediaInstruction (Session ID, Media Instruction Set) operation based on its policies instructing the IMS AS how to set up bootstrap data channel with MF both for originating and terminating side. The MediaInstructionSet provided by the DSCF, includes its MDC1 media endpoint addresses created in step 5, DC Stream ID, and the replacement HTTP URL representing the application list offered via the MDC1 interface.\nIn this scenario, the DCSF instructs the IMS AS to terminate bootstrap data channel establishment request on originating MF, and initiate remote bootstrap data channel establishment request(targeting remote UE) as well as forwarding remote bootstrap data channel establishment request of served user (targeting remote DCSF) towards terminating network.\n7.\tThe IMS AS selects a MF based on local configuration or discovers and selects a MF instance or MRF supporting DC media function via NRF.\n8.\tIMS AS invokes Nmf_MRM_Create(List of Media Termination Descriptors) service operation to instruct MF to allocate required data channel media resources. IMS AS request creation of two different Media Terminations, one representing the local bootstrap media to be terminated and the other representing the remote bootstrap media to be offered to remote UE. Each Media Termination includes information required to allocate resources in both Mb and the MDC1 interfaces. The MF responds with the negotiated data channel media resource information to IMS AS. If MRF is used, IMS AS uses Mr'/Cr to the MRF to reserve data channel media resources.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MF media resource allocation in step 8 could be done with one or multiple service invocations.\n9.\tIMS AS responds to the MediaInstruction request received in step 6. The response may include the atomic success result of operation and also includes negotiated data channel media resource information for MDC1.\n10.\tThe DCSF stores the media resource information and responds to the Notify Request received in step 3.\n11-13.\tIMS AS sends the INVITE which includes the updated SDP offer adding media information of MF or MRF via the originating S-CSCF to remote network side and UE#2. In this scenario, the SDP offer for bootstrap data channel to UE#2 is included.\n14.\tUE#2 and terminating network returns an 18X response with the SDP answer to bootstrap data channel to originating network. According to the received SDP answer, IMS AS may instruct MF or MRF to update data channel media resource information for UE#2.\n15-16:\tUE#2 and terminating network returns a 200 OK response.\n17.\tThe IMS AS notifies the successful session establishment event, Nimsas_SessionEventControl Notify (SessionEstablishmentSuccessEvent, Session ID, Media Info List) to DCSF.\n18.\tThe DCSF responds to the Nimsas notification request.\n19.\t200 OK forwarded to UE#1 which indicates the bootstrap data channel has been established.\n20-23:\tThe bootstrap data channels have been established between originating MF or MRF and UE#1/UE#2. The UEs send application request messages to MF or MRF to request a data channel application or an application list if multiple DC applications are available, via the established bootstrap data channel with its data channel capabilities. The MF or MRF replaces the root URL with the replacement URL received in steps 8 and forwards the message to received media point of DCSF. The DCSF provides the application list and proper data channel applications further to UE#1 and UE#2 based on their data channel capabilities and their choices through MF or MRF.\nThe bootstrap data channels have also been established between terminating MF or MRF and UE#1/UE#2. The data channel application is requested and downloaded to UE#1 and UE#2 from terminating DCSF\nSteps 20-23 may be executed after step 14, if the SDP answer in 200 OK to the PRACK and UPDATE messages contain the information required to establish bootstrap data channels.\nNOTE 4:\tIMS-AGW needs to allow the establishment of bootstrap data channels based on the information in the 200 OK to PRACK and UPDATE messages.\n24.\tSubsequent procedures continue.\nNOTE 5:\tIn the DC application list, the DCSF may provide DC applications supported by both UEs, or only supported by the UE who sends the application request message. The detail of how to provide the application list to the UE and how to use it by the UE are based on implementation and out of scope of 3GPP.\n",
