            "description": "The objective of this document is to address the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) consisting of Ici and Izi reference points between IMS networks in order to support end-to-end service interoperability.\nThe present document addresses the issues related to control plane signalling (3GPP usage of SIP and SDP protocols, required SIP header fields) as well as other interconnecting aspects like security, numbering/naming/addressing and user plane issues as transport protocol, media and codecs actually covered in a widespread set of 3GPP specifications. A profiling of the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) is also provided.\nCharging aspects are addressed as far as SIP signalling is concerned.\nIMS emergency session establishment between IMS networks is addressed as far as SIP signalling is concerned.\nSIP signalling traversing the NNI between a CSCF and MRB, e.g. for media control or Voice Interworking with Enterprise IP-PBX, and SIP signalling traversing the NNI on the Mr interface between the CSCF and the MRFC, or on the Mr' interface between the AS and MRFC, or on the Rc interface between AS and MRB is not considered in the present release of this specification.\nSIP signalling traversing the NNI between an application server and the remaining IMS functional entities (e.g. for MCPTT interface SIP-2 in figure 7.3.1-2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [200]) is not considered in the present release of this specification.\nSIP signalling traversing the NNI between an ISC gateway and an AS in an enterprise network, e.g. for media control and voice interworking with enterprise IP-PBX, on the ISC interface between the ISC gateway and the enterprise network is not considered in the present release of this specification.\n",

For this purpose, Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN subsystem networks is adopted, according to the assumptions coming from 3GPP TS 23.002 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.228 [4].\nNOTE:\tThe end-to-end service interoperability within one IM CN subsystem over the Mi, Mm, Mw and I2 reference points not passing over the Mx reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4] is outside the scope of this document.\nAiming to support the delivery of IMS services between two separated IM CN subsystems, protocol interconnection has to occur:\n-\tat a control plane level, in order that IMS procedures can be supported. In this case the adopted reference point is the Ici; and\n-\tat a user plane level, where media streams are exchanged over the Izi reference point.\nIP multimedia sessions are managed by SIP. The transport mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media transport is IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [2]) or IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [7]). The 3GPP profile of SIP defining the usage of SIP within the IM CN subsystem is specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. Example call flows are provided in 3GPP TR 24.930 [6].\nThe general interconnection model is shown in figure 4.1.\nThe figure depicts the interconnection model for IM and CN subsystems in a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their connections.\nFigure 4.1: Interconnection Model for IM CN subsystems\nThe II-NNI traversal scenarios in this document are covered in figure 4.2, figure 4.3 and figure 4.4.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with various components, including core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design is based on SDN principles, ensuring redundancy and failover reliability.\nNOTE 1:\tAny II-NNI can contain intermediate transit network(s). The intermediate transit network can either be an IMS transit network with or without a transit function as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] or a non-IMS transit network using standards outside the scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 2:\tIMS home network A and IMS home network B represent the IMS home network on originating side and terminating side respectively.\nNOTE 3:\tIMS visited network X and IMS visited network Y represent the IMS visited network on originating side and terminating side respectively.\n\nFigure 4.2: II-NNI traversal scenarios when P-CSCF is located in visited network and when home routeing is used\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with various components, including core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes.

The figure depicts a network topology with various components such as originating IMS network O, terminating IMS network T, and a PSAP. The figure also includes a note indicating that the IMS network O represents the IMS network to which the originating UE is attached, and the terminating IMS network T represents the IMS network which accommodates a PSAP. This information is crucial for understanding the network's structure and the relationships between different components.\nNOTE 1:\tOriginating IMS network O represents the IMS network to which the originating UE is attached to, and terminating IMS network T represents the IMS network which accomodates a PSAP.\nNOTE 2:\tOriginating IMS network O can be a visited IMS network or a home IMS network.\nNOTE 3:\tThe E-CSCF is located in the originating IMS network O.\nNOTE 4:\tAny II-NNI between originating IMS network O and terminating IMS network T does not use any specific capabilities for roaming II-NNI, and is treated as non-roaming II-NNI.\n\nFigure 4.4: IMS emergency session traversal scenario on non-roaming II-NNI\nThe possible functional entities involved in the signalling plane interconnection (IBCF, I-CSCF, P-CSCF, ATCF, S-CSCF, E-CSCF, BGCF, MSC Server enhanced for ICS, MSC server enhanced for SRVCC, MSC server enhanced for dual radio and TRF) and in the user plane interconnection (TrGW) are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], in 3GPP TS 24.292 [121], 3GPP TS 29.292 [130], 3GPP TS 29.162 [8] and in 3GPP TS 24.237 [131].\nIP Version interworking is described within 3GPP TS 29.162 [8].\nExamples of usage of the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) for roaming scenarios are described in 3GPP TR 29.949 [192].\n",

It highlights the TRF's ability to function independently or in conjunction with other functional entities, such as the Trunk Relay (TR) and the Trunk Relay Function (TRF). The figure illustrates the TRF's role in ensuring network reliability and efficiency by providing redundancy and failover capabilities.\nNOTE:\tThe TRF can reside in a stand-alone entity or can be combined with another functional entity.\nFigure 5.1.1: Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface between two IM CN subsystem networks\nThe protocols over the two reference points Ici and Izi make up the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface.\nThe Ici reference point allows IBCFs to communicate with each other in order to provide the communication and forwarding of SIP signalling messaging between IM CN subsystem networks. The Izi reference point allows TrGWs to forward media streams between IM CN subsystem networks.\nIMS roaming performed by using II-NNI is considered, when the IBCFs are inserted at the network borders. The applicability of roaming scenario by using II-NNI is based on agreement between the operators.\nWhenever the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface is used to interconnect two IM CN subsystem networks belonging to different security domains, security procedures apply as described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [10].\nWhen an IMS transit network is providing application services and interconnecting two IM CN subsystem networks, as described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4], interfaces on both sides of the IMS transit network are within the scope of this document.\nWhen two IM CN subsystem networks are interconnected for IMS emergency session establishment as described in 3GPP TS 23.167 [215], the interface between these IM CN subsystem networks is within the scope of this document.\nNOTE:\tImplementations of functional entities at the IMS network edge might include functions that are not described in this Release of the specification, for example fault management that sends SIP OPTIONS requests between the two IBCFs over the Ici.

                    "text_content": "The following URI formats in SIP messages may be applied at the Ici as standardized in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]:\n-\tSIP URI defined in IETF RFC 3261 [13];\n-\ttel URI defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14];\n-\tIM URI defined in IETF RFC 3860 [15]; and\n-\tPRES URI defined in IETF RFC 3859 [16].\nAccording to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], the IBCF acting as an exit or entry point in the IMS network supports these URI formats. These URI formats shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI. The SIP URI format shall be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI. For the loopback traversal scenario both the SIP URI and the tel URI shall be supported. The tel URI, IM URI and PRES URI formats may be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI based on agreement between operators. For the loopback traversal scenario the IM URI and PRES URI may be supported based on agreement between operators. Other URI formats may be supported over the II-NNI depending on the operator agreements.\nA global number as defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14] shall be used in a tel URI or in the user portion of a SIP URI with the user=phone parameter when conveyed via a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario in the Request-URI and in the P-Asserted-Identity header field, except when agreement exists between the operators to also allow other kinds of numbers.\nNOTE 1:\tIn a SIP URI the user portion of the Request-URI represents a telephone number only if the SIP URI includes the user=phone parameter.\nNOTE 2:\tAgreements can exist between operators to allow local number (e.g. national service numbers, business trunking numbers, or private numbers) at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario. A SIP URI with such a number, a user=phone parameter, and a phone-context parameter agreed between the operators can then be used.\nNOTE 3:\t3GPP TS 24.229 [5] allows to restrict the number within a SIP Request-URI with user=phone parameter at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario to be a global number (i.e. E.164 in international format) via an appropriate Application Server. Suitable configuration by the operator is needed to achieve the desired modification of the format.\nNOTE 4:\tThe allowed phone number formats in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of a served user are configured by the operator. According to 3GPP TS 23.003 [35], international E.164 format is used within a P-Asserted-Identity header field.\nNOTE 5:\tThe global number format usage within a SIP Request-URI with the user=phone parameter at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario allows the terminating network to find the called subscriber, via HSS interrogation, without any further number translation and thus improves the success of the interconnection between IMS operators.\nNOTE 6:\tAccording to 3GPP TS 23.003 [35] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], public user identity takes the form of either SIP URI or tel URI.\nNOTE 7:\tAgreements can exist between operators to allow the \"Unavailable User Identity\" as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [35] in the P-Asserted-Identity header field at a non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario.\nThe optional \"oli\" and \"cpc\" tel URI parameters associated with a tel URI or a SIP URI with user=phone are described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.12 and can be part of the P-Asserted-Identity header field. Depending on operator agreements, those URI parameters may be supported at the non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario.\nThe \"sos\" SIP URI parameter associated with a URI in the Contact header field of a REGISTER request or a 200 (OK) response to REGISTER request is described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. The \"sos\" SIP URI parameter shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI.\nThe \"sos\" SIP URI parameter associated with the Request-URI for all dialogs and standalone SIP requests described in clause 5.2.10.3 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and shall be supported at the roaming II-NNI.\nThe \"rn\" and \"npdi\" number portability parameters for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone as described within IETF RFC 4694 [75] can be part of the Request-URI. Depending on operator agreements these parameters may be exchanged over the non-roaming II-NNI or for the loopback traversal scenario.\nNOTE 7:\tThe \"rn\" and \"npdi\" parameters can be used to address the entry point of the terminating operator depending on national rules for number portability.\nThe \"isub\" tel URI parameter for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone as described within IETF RFC 3966 [14] can be part of the Request-URI, To header field and P-Asserted-Identity header field. Depending on operator agreements, this URI parameter may be exchanged over the II-NNI.\nThe \"premium-rate\" tel URI parameter for the tel URI and the SIP URI with user=phone as described within 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] clause 7.2A.17 can be part of the Request-URI. Depending on operator agreements, this URI parameter may be exchanged at the roaming II-NNI.\nThe public service identity (PSI) that takes a form of a SIP URI without including a port number as described in clause 13.5 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [35] may be exchanged over the II-NNI depending on operator agreements.\n",
