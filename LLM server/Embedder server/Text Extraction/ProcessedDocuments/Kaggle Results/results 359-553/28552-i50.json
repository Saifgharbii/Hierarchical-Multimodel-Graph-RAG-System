With performance measurements allowing the operator to obtain or derive the UL and DL user plane delay information separately, the operators can pinpoint the services performance problems to specific problems in UL or DL.\nThe DL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the delay of any packet within NG-RAN, including air interface delay until the UE receives the packet. A gNB deployed in a split architecture, the user plane delay will occur in gNB-CU-UP, on the F1 interface, in gNB-DU and on the air interface. Therefore, the delay measurements related to the four segments needs to be monitored for the DL delay to pinpoint where end user impact from packet delay occurs.\nThe average DL delay needs to be measured to give a general indication of the delay performance; further more the delay distributions (into bins with delay ranges) need to be measured, to tell the occurrences about the packets with each certain range of delay and better reflect the user experience.\nThe UL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the delay of any packet within NG-RAN, including air interface delay until the packet leaves gNB-CU-UP. There are 4 components associated to UL delay (UL over-the-air interface delay, gNB-DU delay, F1-U delay, CU-UP delay). Therefore, the delay measurements related to these four segments needs to be monitored for the UL delay to pinpoint where end user impact from packet delay occurs. The beamforming capabilities of the NRCellDU and of the UE can be different. This might create a difference in the successful reception probability of the DL data transmitted by the gNB-DU, versus the UL data transmitted by the UE as the later might involve more retransmission than the former one. This will increase the UL over-the-air delay compared to the DL over-the-air delay.\nFor multi-operator RAN sharing scenario, different operators may have different requirements on the packet delay. It is of great importance to enable each operator to monitor the packet delay within its PLMN, also it helps the operators to pinpoint the network and service performance problems in a specific PLMN.\nDifferent network slices may have different requirements on the delay, so the delay needs to be measured for each S-NSSAI.\nTo further pinpoint a detected delay performance problem, the packet delay measurement separation may be based on mapped 5QI (or for QCI in case of NR option 3).\nNOTE: It is an asumtion that the DL/UL delay on the F1 interface is equal, only DL measurement is defined.\n",

            "description": "QoS flow is the key and limited resource for 5G RAN (including NG-RAN and non-3GPP access) to deliver services. The release of the QoS flow needs to be monitored as:\n-\tan abnormal release of the QoS flow will cause the call(/session) drop, which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks, and the satisfaction degree of the end user;\n-\ta successfully released QoS flow can be used to setup other requested calls(/sessions). The QoS flow failed to be released will still occupy the limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested calls(/sessions).\nFrom a retainability measurement aspect, QoS flows do not need to be released because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access when new data arrives.\nTo define (from a QoS flow release measurement point of view) if a QoS flow is considered active or not, the QoS flow can be divided into two groups:\nFor QoS flows with bursty flow, a UE is said to be \"in session\" if there is user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any QoS flow data on a Data Radio Bearer (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms. \nFor QoS flows with continuous flow, the QoS flow (and the UE) is seen as being \"in session\" in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state, and the session  time is increased from the first data transmission on the QoS flow until 100 ms after the last data transmission on the QoS flow.\nA particular QoS flow is defined to be of type continuous flow if the 5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.\nThe specific reason causing the abnormal and failed release of the QoS flow is required in order to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions. And due to different priority and tolerance for different service type with different QoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened on each service type with QoS level.\nThe QoS flow can be released by PDU Session Resource Release procedure, UE Context Release procedure, Reset procedure either initiated by 5G RAN (including NG-RAN and non-3GPP access) or AMF and NG Path Switch procedure (see TS 38.413 [11]).\nSo performance measurements related to QoS flow Release (see TS 38.413 [11]) and UE Context Release (see TS 38.413 [11]) procedure for each service type with QoS level are necessary to support the monitor of QoS flow release.\nThe abnormal release of the QoS flow has potential scenario where, regardless of receiving the UE Context Release Command with the cause related to abnormal release, the end user does not perceive it as abnormal. This scenario is explicitly related to 5QI 1 calls, for other services it is not possible to determine the reason behind the cause code. It is typical to encounter such scenario, a so called \"double UE Context\", when Radio Link Failure occurs during an ongoing 5QI 1 call and RRC Connection Re-establishment attempt fails on target or other cell. If then the UE does a new RRC Connection the 5QI 1 QoS flow is set-up during Initial Context Setup in the target or other cell. However, when AMF receives that service request with the Initial UE message through the target or other cell, it realizes that it already has the same UE Context but from the source cell (it has not been released yet). In such case, AMF sends UE Context Release Command to the source cell. As the 5QI 1 QoS flow has been successfully setup in the target or other cell, the 5QI 1 QoS flow release in the source cell may not be perceived as a drop (abnormal release) by the end user, as the service has been sustained with some interruption time, and can't be considered as a drop in the 5QI 1 QoS flow Drop Ratio. This interruption time may be monitored in order to evaluate how it can impact the QoS of the 5QI 1 Flows due to double NG (double UE context)\". Moreover, the 5QI 1 QoS Flows that can be immediately released due to radio reasons with UE connectivity lost (when T-RLF timer was not started) may be delayed by time interval based on this average interruption time to possibly transform them to double NG scenario to keep the calls active and reduce further the 5QI 1 QoS flow Drop Ratio.\nFrom QoS perspective it is important to focus also on call duration as in some cases wrong quality perceived by the end user is not fully reflected by drop ratio nor retainability KPI. Typical case is when due to poor radio conditions the end user redials (the call was terminated normally) to the same party to secure the quality. But in this case the drop ratio KPI will not show any degradation. Secondly, although the call is dropped the end user may or may not redial depending on dropped call duration compared to the case when the call would be normally released. It is therefore highly recommended to monitor average and distribution of duration of normally and abnormally released calls.\n",

Once a QoS flow reaches a gNB it will trigger setup of a new DRB or it will be mapped to an existing DRB. The decision on how to map QoS flows into new or existing DRBs is taken at the CU-CP. CU-CP also defines one set of QoS parameters (one 5QI) for the DRB. If a QoS flow is mapped to an existing DRB, the packets belonging to that QoS flow are not treated with the 5QI of the QoS flow, but they are treated with the mapped 5QI of the DRB.\nThe release of the DRB needs to be monitored as:\n-\tan abnormal release of the DRB will cause the call(/session) drop, which directly impacts the QoS and slice delivered by the network, and the satisfaction degree of the end user;\n-\ta successfully released DRB can be used to setup other requested calls(/sessions). The DRB failed to be released will still occupy the limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested calls(/sessions).\nFrom a retainability measurement aspect, DRBs do not need to be released because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access when new data arrives.\nTo define (from a DRB release measurement point of view) if a DRB is considered active or not, the DRB can be divided into two groups:\n-\tFor DRBs with bursty flow, a DRB is said to be active if there is user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any data (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms.\n-\tFor DRBs with continuous flow, the DRB is seen as being active in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state, and the session time is increased from the first data transmission on the DRB until 100 ms after the last data transmission on the DRB.\nA particular DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped 5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.\nDue to different priority and tolerance for different service type with different QoS level in the DRB, the measurement needs to be performed per mapped 5QI, to be able to judge the result.\nSimilarly, the abnormal and failed DRB releases will affect different Service Level Agreements in the networks. Therefore, each S-NSSAI needs to be monitored.\nThe DRB can be released by PDU Session Resource Release procedure, UE Context Release procedure, Reset procedure either initiated by NG-RAN or AMF and NG Path Switch procedure (see TS 38.413 [11]).\nTherefore, performance measurements related to DRB Release (see TS 38.413 [11]) and UE Context Release (see TS 38.413 [11]) procedure for each QoS level (mapped 5QI) and each S-NSSAI are necessary to support the monitor of DRB release.\n",

When the 5GC wants to page (CN initiated paging) a UE, it has to page it in all cells that belong to the TA(s) to which the UE is registered.\nThe paging load per cell and gNB is an important measure for the operator as it allows the operator to properly dimension the resources for paging in the NR Cell and gNB.\nAt an NR Cell and gNB it makes sense to measure the number of discarded paging messages if this is due to some problem in the gNB, such as paging occasion overflow. In that scenario the periodicity of paging occasions can be reconfigured in order to ensure that all paging messages are transmitted by the gNB in the first available paging occasion, thereby avoiding paging delays and extended call setup delay.\nOperators need to know when such an event occurs, in order to identify if the problem is at the NR cell or gNB level or not.\nIn addition to discarded paging records measurement, it is important to know total paging records received so that discarded paging records ratio can be derived.\nTotal number of paging records received is important in the sense that, it may be fine if the discarded paging records are high if discarded paging records ratio is small. On the other hand, it may be problematic if discarded paging records are low, if discarded paging records ratio turn out to be high.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state, RAN paging is based on RNA which is introduced in order to resume a suspended RRC connection fastly. In this scenario, the gNB who triggered the RAN Paging can know if the paging is success or not by the response from UE or other gNB. Measurements for NG-RAN initiated paging sent by gNB-CU can avoid duplicate counts of RAN Paging and improve accuracy of RAN paging success rate statistics. The total paging number and successful paging number of NG-RAN initiated paging sent by the gNB-CU can derive RAN paging success rate, which can be used to optimize the RNA range configuration.

In this case, the downlink signals of an aggressor base station can travel a long distance and interfere with the uplink signals of a victim base station that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as 'remote interference'. When it happens, the IoT of the victim base station demonstrates a \"sloping\" characteristic, the closer the uplink symbol is to gap, the higher interference it experienced. The reason behind this is that, the remote interference is caused by accumulated signals from a number of remote base stations with different distances.\nThis type of interference affects the effective reception of SRSs, resulting in a series of problems affecting user experience, such as call drops, access failures, and low rates. Therefore, some related measurements, such as GP symbol interference, SRS symbol interference and PUSCH symbol interference measurement, are needed to monitor/detect remote interference.\n",

Keeping track of UE throughput in NG-RAN is helpful for cell configurations and features scheduling to ensure user satisfaction and network performance.\nWith Bandwidth Adaptation (BA), the receive and transmit bandwidth of a UE needs not to be as large as the bandwidth of the cell and can be adjusted (e.g., to shrink the bandwidth during the period of low activity to save power). A subset of the total cell bandwidth is referred to as a Bandwidth Part (BWP) and BA is achieved by configuring the UE with BWP(s) and telling the UE which of the configured BWPs is currently the active one. The value of the activated BWP of the UE will affect the UE throughput and thus the cell throughput. The larger BWP is activated, the higher the throughput will achieve.\nWhen monitoring the quality of a cell with a 100MHz bandwidth, in case that all UEs are activated with 100 MHz BWP, it is reasonable to consider the cell as a poor-quality cell if the UE throughput is lower than a fixed threshold. However, when small bandwidth BWP is activated, for example, to save power, some UEs in the cell are activated with 20 MHz Dedicated BWP, other UEs are activated with 100Mhz Dedicated BWP, the previous fixed threshold for judging poor-quality cell is not applicable since peak throughput of some users is limited by the small active BWP. In this case, the UE throughput per BWP needs to be considered to set the proper threshold, so as to correctly estimate whether the cell quality is poor or not. Therefore, measurements and monitoring of UE throughput per BWP are needed.\n",

            "description": "The NWDAF containing Model Training Logical Function (MTLF) can train Machine Learning (ML) models and provides ML model provisioning service.\nFrom operators' point of view, in most of the cases, the model provisioning services provided by NWDAF are based on the implementation. It may not be feasible to identify the internal working procedure of NWDAF related to the ML model provisioning services. However, it is possible to monitor the overall time consumed by the NWDAF on model provisioning services.\nIf it is measured that the overall time consumed by the NWDAF to response the model provisioning services request exceeds a time length threshold which is provided based on experience, it may indicate that the NWDAF is requesting, using or calling for more resource to perform model provisioning related operations, for example, model training, and the amount of resource or the workload of NWDAF exceeds certain level, and they are not negligible. As a result, the performance can be estimated based on this measurement.\nMoreover, based on the deployment, if the NWDAF instance is able to perform the model training, with the help of the smart classifying criteria used as the threshold, it is also possible to detect the model training and it is even possible to estimate the number of the model training performed by NWDAF with acceptable accuracy.\nThe ML model trained by NWDAF is available for one or more Analytics ID(s) (see TS 23.288 [59]). There, the time consumption of model provisioning services can be further associated with the Analytics IDs based on the model used to provide the analytic report.\nMonitoring of machine learning model provisioning at NWDAF is essential for the management of NWDAF. Operators can use these measurements for configuration, resource allocation or load balance purpose related to the management of NWDAF.\n",

NWDAF Analytics Logical Function (AnLF) can deploy trained ML models for generating analytics based on the request from multiple analytics consumers. Considering that the NWDAF AnLF may host several ML models for generating analytics for multiple analytics IDs at the same time, there is a need for monitoring the usage of ML models deployed in NWDAF AnLF as it reflects the service load of the NWDAF AnLF. The operators can use this information for resource optimization or load balancing of NWDAF AnLF.\n\n",
