The AS is responsible for managing the network's traffic and ensuring that it is efficiently distributed among the various nodes. The figure illustrates the AS's interaction with the MSGin5G Server, including the process of registering, obtaining the necessary information, and verifying the registration.

The figure shows the AS (Access Server) and the MSGin5G Server, with the AS Deregistering process taking place in the middle of the network. This step is essential for ensuring the proper functioning of the 5G network and preventing potential issues.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.2-1: AS Deregistering from MSGin5G Server\nTo deregister itself from the MSGin5G Server, the AS shall send HTTP DELETE message to the MSGin5G Server on the \"AS DeRegistration\" collection resource, as specified in clause 8.1.2.3.3.2.\nUpon receiving the HTTP DELETE request, the MSGin5G Server shall:\n1.\tverify the identity of the AS and check if the AS is authorized to deregister the AS registration information;\n2.\tif the AS is authorized to deregister the AS registration information, then the MSGin5G Server shall deregister the AS profile from the MSGin5G Server and delete the resource representing AS registration information; and\n3.\treturn the HTTP \"200 OK\" status code to the AS, indicating the successful deregistration of the AS information and shall include ASRegistrationAck data structure within the response body or HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code to the AS.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the MSGin5G Server shall apply error handling procedures as specified in clause 8.1.6.\n",
