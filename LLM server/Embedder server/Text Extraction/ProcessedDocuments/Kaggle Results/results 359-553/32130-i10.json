            "description": "Network sharing is emerging as a mechanism for operators to substantially and sustainably improve network costs and to efficiently utilize network capacity. The traditional model of single ownership of all network layers and elements is being challenged and more and more operators are adopting network sharing as a means of cutting the heavy costs involved in initial roll-out, capital expenditure (CAPEX) and  (OPEX).\nIn general, an increasing number of operators are sharing their mobile networks. Main arguments presented are:\n-\tIncreased rollout speed.\n-\tQuickly expanding coverage to meet customer demand for wider coverage.\n-\tSharing low traffic areas.\n-\tSharing high license burdens.\n-\tLower CAPEX and OPEX.\nNetwork sharing has some major implications on the operations of the network. Alignment on operational priorities, common network planning/evolution strategy, sharing end user data/subscriber data, sharing performance data, alarms etc. in the shared network need to be considered carefully. Privacy, security and competitive information are also important for the operations of a shared network.\n",

The figure highlights the importance of network sharing in ensuring network reliability and efficiency.\nFigure 4.1-1: E-UTRAN MOCN network sharing scenario\n\nThe figure depicts a network sharing scenario in a 5G-RAN (Radio Access Network) MOCN (Multi-Cell Network) network, where the same cell identity is broadcast to all users. The network is designed to support multiple users in a single cell, ensuring efficient resource allocation and reducing the need for additional infrastructure. The figure shows the distribution of users across different cells, with each cell having its own set of users. The network is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for the addition or removal of users without affecting the overall network performance.\nFigure 4.1-2: NG-RAN MOCN Network Sharing with same cell identity broadcast scenario\n\nThe figure depicts a network sharing scenario in a 5G network, where the network functions are shared among multiple cell identities. The network sharing is achieved through the use of multiple cell identities, which are broadcasted to the network. This allows for efficient resource allocation and improved network performance.\nFigure 4.1-3 NG-RAN MOCN Network Sharing with multiple cell identity broadcast scenario\nIn GWCN, besides sharing Radio Access Network nodes, the POPs also share Core Network nodes (see TS 23.251 [5] – clause 4.1).\nThe figure depicts a gateway core network (GWCN) in a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The network consists of a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and distributed nodes, with redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and automation.\nFigure 4.1-4: GateWay Core Network (GWCN)\n",

The detailed RRMPolicy definition for NG-RAN see the clause 4.3.36 of TS 28.541 [8]. Following is one example of RRMPolicy for corresponding POP A and POP B. In this example,\n-\tPOP A has 20% dedicated radio resources, 30% prioritized resources and 50% shared resources.

The diagram illustrates the partitioning of radio resources, including the number of radio access points (RAPs) and the number of radio resources (RRs) allocated to each POP. The RRMPolicy is designed to ensure efficient resource allocation and management in the RAN, with the goal of maximizing network performance and user experience.\nFigure 5.4.6-1 Example of structure RRMPolicy for radio access network resource partitioning for POP A and POP B\nNote: If the network slicing feature is supported, the RRMPolicy is defined for each RRMPolicyMemberList which contains both PLMNId and S-NSSAI. In this case, the RRMPolicy is defined in RRMPolicyMember (combination of PLMNId and S-NSSAI) granularity.\n\nMOP-NM (play the role of MnS consumer) obtains the radio resource partitioning policies the shared radio access network based on above agreement, and sends the radio resource partitioning policies to MOP-SR-DM (play the role of MnS prodcuer) to configure the shared NG-RAN NEs. MOP-SR-DM derives the radio resource partitioning policies for corresponding cells of each shared NG-RAN NE and configures the corresponding shared NG-RAN NE with corresponding radio resource partitioning policies for corresponding cells (see RRMPolicy defined in TS 28.541[8] which is contained by RRMPolicyManagedEntity).\nMOP-SR-DM monitors the radio usage resources measurement (e.g. UL/DL PRB used for data traffic, RRC connections) for POP A and POP B, and send such radio usage resources measurements to MnS consumer.  Based on the radio resources usage measurements and other information (e.g. service traffic requirements changes) for POP A and POP B, the radio resources partitioning policies may be updated based on the agreement between POP A and POP B. The MOP-NM requests the MOP-SR-DM to reconfigure the updated radio resources partitioning policies of the shared radio access network for corresponding POP A and POP B.\n",

For the concrete PLMN granularity measurements, see TS 28.552[9].\nMnS producer sends the individual measurements for POP A and POP B in PLMN granularity to MnS consumer.\nFor the Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-4 and Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-5\nMnS consumer determines the individual EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U MOI (see corresponding attributes in TS 28.541[8]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and requests MnS producer to create and configure these MOIs for each POP. In case of common F1 intertface configuration, the values of the EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U MOI attributes (including localAddress and remoteAddress) contained by different POP's OperatorDU MOI of the same GNBDUFunction MOI should be same.\nMnS producer creates and configures the individual EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U MOI for each POP based on the requests from MnS consumer. The EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U MOI are name contained by corresponding POP's OperatorDU and associated to it's own GNBCUCPFunction MOI and GNBCUUPFunction MOI.\nFor the Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-6\nMnS consumer determines the NRCellRelation MOI(s) (see corresponding attributes in TS 28.541[8]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and requests MnS producer to create and configure NRCellRelation MOI(s) for each POP.\nMnS producer configures the NG-RAN NE(s) (i.e. subtree of ManagedElement) based on the requests from MnS consumer, including creates and configures the individual NRCellRelation MOI for each POP.\n\nPrior to any network sharing deployment, the MOP and the POPs have to agree on legal, financial, technical and operational aspects. Among operational aspects, the network sharing agreement captures the following (non-exhaustive list):\n-\tOrganizations involved (i.e. Operators) and their roles in the network sharing deployment.\n-\tExhaustive list of shared and unshared resources in the shared network.\n-\tRights attached to each role (e.g. rights to configure network resources, rights to receive alarms, etc.).\n- \tDuties attached to each role (e.g. obligation for the MOP to provide POPs with monthly KPIs, etc.).\n-\tDelegations (if any) given by any organization to another organization.\n-\tService Level Agreements (SLAs).\n\n\n\n",
