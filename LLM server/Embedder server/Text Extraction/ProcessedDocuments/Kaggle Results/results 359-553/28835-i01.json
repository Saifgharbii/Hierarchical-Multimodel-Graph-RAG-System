So far, requirements of configuration, management authority and performance measurement for network sharing have been covered in TS 32.130 [4]. The NRM and part of performance measurement for 5G MOCN network sharing have been defined in TS 28.541 and TS 28.552 [3]. With the deployment and operation of 5G MOCN network sharing, more and more new detailed management requirements need be investigated for 5G MOCN network sharing. For example, preventing data modification by MOP-NM and ensuring data fairness per POP, MOP-NM needs to get different data from MOP-SR-DM, and put different data to different POP-NM. The performance measurement in TS 28.552 [3] cannot fully evaluate the network performance of 5GMOCN network sharing.\nTo enhance the sharing mechanism, the present document studies on management aspects of 5G MOCN network sharing, including potential requirements, impact on interaction between MOP and POP/NEP, and management architecture, and more potential performance measurements in management system.\n",

Which means individual OperatorCU instance and NROperatorCellCU needs to be created and configured for each POP.\nThe figure depicts a 2-1 network architecture, where the 2-1 network is enhanced to support NG-RAN sharing, which is a key feature of the 5G network. This enhancement enables the sharing of control and data planes between the 5G network and the 5G network core, enabling more efficient use of network resources and improved performance. The figure also shows the use of multiple network resources, such as the 5G network core and the 5G network core, to support the sharing of control and data planes between the 5G network and the 5G network core.
