SRVCC with eCall over IMS continuity from E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN CS accesses is covered in this specification. SRVCC with priority handling from E-UTRAN to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN CS accesses for voice or voice and video calls is also covered in this specification. The handover of non-voice PS bearer from E-UTRAN is specified by the procedures defined in TS 23.401 [2], TS 23.060 [10], TS 25.413 [11] and TS 43.129 [12].

For the case of emergency voice service continuity, the request includes a Request-Type = \"emergency handover\" and the MEID (e.g. IMEI) is included.\n6.\tThe E-UTRAN sends an Uplink S1 cdma2000 Tunnelling (MEID, RAND, 1x Origination, Reference CellID) message to the MME. The eNodeB will also include CDMA2000 HO Required Indication IE to Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message, which indicates to the MME that the handover preparation has started.\n7.\tUpon reception of the Uplink S1 cdma2000 Tunnelling message, the MME selects a 3GPP2 1xCS IWS as specified in clause 5.3.3.1.2 and encapsulates the 1x Origination Message along with the MEID and RAND in a S102 Direct Transfer message (as \"1x Air Interface Signalling\").\n8.\tThe traffic channel resources are established in the 1x RTT system and 3GPP2 1xCS procedures for initiation of Session Transfer are performed as per 3GPP2 X.S0042 [4].\nNOTE 1:\tStep 9 and 3GPP2 1xCS procedures in step 8 are independent of each other.\nNOTE 2:\tFor non-emergency session transfers, the \"VDN\" parameter referred to in 3GPP2 X.S0042 [4] corresponds to the STN-SR parameter defined in TS 23.237 [14].\nNOTE 3:\tThe emergency session transfer procedures and procedures for the 1x CS SRVCC UE obtaining the local emergency STN-SR will be specified by 3GPP2.\n9.\tThe 3GPP2 1xCS IWS creates a 1x message and encapsulates it in a S102 Direct Transfer message (1x message, Handover indicator). If the 3GPP2 access was able to allocate resources successfully, the 1x message is a 1x Handover Direction message and the handover indicator indicates successful resource allocation. Otherwise, the handover indicator indicates to the MME that handover preparation failed and the embedded 1x message indicates the failure to the UE.\n10.\tThe MME sends the 1x message and CDMA2000 HO Status IE in a Downlink S1 cdma2000 Tunnelling message to the E-UTRAN. The CDMA2000 HO Status IE is set according to the handover indicator received over the S102 tunnel.\n11.\tIf the CDMA2000 HO Status IE indicates successful handover preparation, the E-UTRAN forwards the 1x Handoff Direction message embedded in a Mobility from EUTRA Command message to the UE. This is perceived by the UE as a Handover Command message. If handover preparation failed, DL Information transfer message will be sent instead, with the embedded 1xRTT message that indicates the failure to the UE.\n12.\tOnce the UE receives the traffic channel information from the cdma2000 1xRTT system, the UE retunes to the 1xRTT radio access network and performs traffic channel acquisition with the 1xRTT CS access (e.g., 1xRTT BSS).\n13.\tThe UE sends a 1xRTT handoff completion message to the 1xRTT CS access (e.g., 1xRTT BSS).\n14.\tThe 1xRTT CS Access sends message to 1xRTT MSC to indicate of handoff done.

The E-UTRAN/EPS context may be released based on the normal E-UTRAN/EPS procedure.\n16.\tThe eNodeB sends an S1 UE Context Release Request (Cause) message to the MME. Cause indicates the S1 release procedure is caused by handover from E-UTRAN to 1xRTT.\n17.\tThe MME deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. PS-to-CS handover indicator is notified to P-GW for voice bearer during the bearer deactivation procedure. The MME starts preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message towards S-GW. The S-GW releases S1-U bearers for the UE and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s). The MME stores in the UE context that the UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW. The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\n18.\tS1 UE Context in the eNodeB is released as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\n19.\tFor an emergency services session after handover is complete, if the control plane location solution is used on the source side, the source MME shall send a Subscriber Location Report carrying the reference cell ID to the GMLC associated with the source side as defined in TS 23.271 [29] to support location continuity. This enables location continuity for the 1xRTT side. Alternatively, if the control plane solution is not used on the source side, location continuity procedures shall be instigated on the 1xRTT side.\nNOTE 4:\tLocation continuity on the 1xRTT side will be specified by 3GPP2.\nIf the UE has returned to E-UTRAN after the CS voice call was terminated, then the UE shall resume PS service by sending TAU to MME. The MME will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. Resuming the suspended bearers in the S-GW and in the P-GW should be done by implicit resume using the Modify Bearer Request message if it is triggered by the procedure in operation, e.g. TAU or Service Request. The S-GW is aware of the suspend state of the bearers and will forward the Modify Bearer Request to the P-GW. Explicit resume using the Resume Notification message should be used in cases when Modify Bearer Request is not triggered by the procedure in operation.\n",

The E-UTRAN places the \"old BSS to new BSS information IE\" for the CS domain in the generic Source to Target Transparent Container. The SRVCC HO indication indicates to the MME that target is only CS capable, hence this is a SRVCC handover operation only towards the CS domain. The message includes an indication that the UE is not available for the PS service in the target cell.\n4.\tBased on the QCI associated with the voice bearer (QCI 1) and the SRVCC HO indication, the source MME splits the voice bearer from the non-voice bearers and initiates the PS-CS handover procedure for the voice bearer only towards MSC Server.\n5.\tThe MME sends a SRVCC PS to CS Request (IMSI, Target ID, STN-SR, C-MSISDN, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, MM Context, Emergency Indication) message to the MSC Server. If SRVCC with priority is supported, the MME also includes priority indication in SRVCC PS to CS Request if it detects the SRVCC requires priority handling. The detection is based on the ARP associated with the EPS bearer used for IMS signalling. The priority indication corresponds to the ARP information element. The Emergency Indication and the equipment identifier are included if the ongoing session is emergency session. Authenticated IMSI and C-MSISDN shall also be included, if available. The MME received STN-SR and C-MSISDN from the HSS as part of the subscription profile downloaded during the E-UTRAN attach procedure. The MM Context contains security related information. CS security key is derived by the MME from the E-UTRAN/EPS domain key as defined in TS 33.401 [22]. The CS Security key is sent in the MM Context.\n6.\tThe MSC Server interworks the PS-CS handover request with a CS inter-MSC handover request by sending a Prepare Handover Request message to the target MSC. If SRVCC with priority is supported, and the MSC Server receives the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request, the MSC server/MGW sends Prepare Handover Request message to the Target MSC with priority indication mapped from the ARP. The MSC Server maps the ARP to the priority level, pre-emption capability/vulnerability for CS services based on local regulation or operator settings. The priority indication indicates the CS call priority during handover as specified in TS 48.008 [23] for GSM/EDGE. The MSC Server assigns a default SAI as Source ID on the interface to the target BSS and uses BSSMAP encapsulated for the Prepare Handover Request.\nNOTE 1:\tThe value of the default SAI is configured in the MSC and allows a release 8 and later BSC to identify that the source for the SRVCC Handover is E-UTRAN. To ensure correct statistics in the target BSS the default SAI should be different from the SAIs used in UTRAN.\n7.\tTarget MSC performs resource allocation with the target BSS by exchanging Handover Request/ Acknowledge messages. If the MSC Server indicated priority, the target BSS allocates the radio resource based on the existing procedures with priority indication, as specified in TS 23.009 [18] and in TS 48.008 [23] for GSM/EDGE.\n8.\tTarget MSC sends a Prepare Handover Response message to the MSC Server.\n9.\tEstablishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW associated with the MSC Server e.g. using ISUP IAM and ACM messages.\n10.\tFor non-emergency session, the MSC Server initiates the Session Transfer by using the STN-SR e.g. by sending an ISUP IAM (STN-SR) message towards the IMS. If this is a priority session, the MSC Server includes priority indication to the IMS and the IMS entity handles the session transfer procedure with priority. The priority indication in the Session Transfer is mapped by the MSC Server from the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request received in step 5. The mapping of the priority level is based on operator policy and/or local configuration, and the IMS priority indicator should be the same as for the original IMS created over PS. For emergency session, the MSC Server initiates the Session Transfer by using the locally configured E-STN-SR and by including the equipment identifier. IMS Service Continuity or Emergency IMS Service Continuity procedures are applied for execution of the Session Transfer, see TS 23.237 [14].\nNOTE 2:\tThis step can be started after step 8.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the MSC Server is using an ISUP interface, then the initiation of the session transfer for non-emergency session may fail if the subscriber profile including CAMEL triggers is not available prior handover (see clause 7.3.2.1.3 in TS 23.292 [13]), and can also fail if CAMEL triggers are available and local anchor transfer function is used (see TS 23.237 [14]). If the subscriber profile is available prior handover then CAMEL triggers others than those used in clause 7.3.2.1.3 of TS 23.292 [13] are not used during the transfer.\n11.\tDuring the execution of the Session Transfer procedure the remote end is updated with the SDP of the CS access leg. The downlink flow of VoIP packets is switched towards the CS access leg at this point.\n12.\tSource IMS access leg is released as per TS 23.237 [14].\nNOTE 4:\tSteps 11 and 12 are independent of step 13.\n13.\tMSC Server sends a SRVCC PS to CS Response (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source MME.\n14.\tSource MME sends a Handover Command (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source E-UTRAN. The message includes information about the voice component only.\n15.\tSource E-UTRAN sends a Handover from E-UTRAN Command message to the UE.\n15a.\tIf the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and the source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the reporting is performed as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\n16.\tUE tunes to GERAN.\n17.\tHandover Detection at the target BSS occurs, then the target BSS sends Handover Detection message to the target MSC. At this stage, the target MSC can send/receive voice data. The UE sends a Handover Complete message via the target BSS to the target MSC. If the target MSC is not the MSC Server, then the Target MSC sends an SES (Handover Complete) message to the MSC Server.\n18.\tThe UE starts the Suspend procedure specified in TS 23.060 [10], clause 16.2.1.1.2. The TLLI and RAI pair are derived from the GUTI as described in TS 23.003 [27]. This triggers the Target SGSN to send a Suspend Notification message to the Source MME. The MME returns a Suspend Acknowledge to the Target SGSN.\nNOTE 5:\tThis step may take place in parallel with steps 19-22.\nNOTE 6:\tThe MME might not be able to derive the GUTI from the received P-TMSI and RAI pair and therefore it might not be able to identify which UE context is associated with the Suspend Notification message. Also in this case the bearers are deactivated and/or suspended as in step 22a.\n19.\tTarget BSS sends a Handover Complete message to the target MSC.\nNOTE 7:\tThis step may take place immediately after Handover Detection at the target BSS occurs in step 17, before the BSS has received a Suspend message from the UE.\n20.\tTarget MSC sends an SES (Handover Complete) message to the MSC Server.

Source MME acknowledges the information by sending a SRVCC PS to CS Complete Acknowledge message to the MSC Server.\n22a.\tThe MME deactivates bearers used for voice and other GBR bearers. All GBR bearers are deactivated towards S-GW and P-GW by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. PS-to-CS handover indicator is notified to P-GW for voice bearer during the bearer deactivation procedure. For GTP-based S5/S8, the S-GW requests the P-GW to delete all GBR bearer contexts by sending a Delete Bearer Command message. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the P-GW may interact with PCRF as defined in TS 23.203 [32]. For PMIP-based S5/S8, S-GW interacts with the PCRF which in turn updates PCC rules for GBR traffic in the P-GW.\nThe MME starts preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message towards S-GW. For these non-GBR bearers, the S-GW releases S1-U bearers for the UE and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s). The MME stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW. The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\n22b.\tThe source MME requests the release of the resources, including release of the S1 signalling connection, to the Source eNodeB. The Source eNodeB releases its resources related to the UE and responds back to the MME.\n23a.\tFor non-emergency sessions and if the HLR is to be updated, i.e. if the IMSI is authenticated but unknown in the VLR, the MSC Server performs a TMSI reallocation towards the UE using its own non-broadcast LAI and, if the MSC Server and other MSC/VLRs serve the same (target) LAI, with its own Network Resource Identifier (NRI).\nNOTE 8:\tThe TMSI reallocation is performed by the MSC Server towards the UE via target MSC.\nNOTE 9:\tFor emergency services sessions the HLR will not be updated. TMSI reallocation may be performed based on IMSI presence.\n23b.\tFor non-emergency sessions and if the MSC Server performed a TMSI reallocation in step 23a, and if this TMSI reallocation was completed successfully, the MSC Server performs a MAP Update Location to the HSS/HLR.\nNOTE 10:\tThis Update Location is not initiated by the UE.\n24.\tFor an emergency services session after handover is complete, the source MME or the MSC Server may send a Subscriber Location Report carrying the identity of the MSC Server to a GMLC associated with the source or target side, respectively, as defined in TS 23.271 [29] to support location continuity.\nNOTE 11:\tAny configuration of the choice between a source MME versus MSC Server update to a GMLC needs to ensure that a single update occurs from one of these entities when the control plane location solution is used on the source and/or target sides.\nAfter the CS voice call is terminated and if the UE is still in GERAN (or for any other reason specified in TS 24.008 [44]), then the UE shall resume PS services as specified in TS 23.060 [10]. A Gn SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [10] to resume the PDP Context(s). An S4-SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [10] to resume the bearers, and will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. If the UE has returned to E-UTRAN after the CS voice call was terminated, then the UE shall resume PS service by sending TAU to MME. The MME will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. Resuming the suspended bearers in the S-GW and in the P-GW should be done by implicit resume using the Modify Bearer request message if it is triggered by the procedure in operation, e.g. RAU, TAU or Service Request. The S-GW is aware of the suspend state of the bearers and will forward the Modify Bearer request to the P-GW. Explicit resume using the Resume Notification message should be used in cases when Modify Bearer Request is not triggered by the procedure in operation.\nThe call flow for this scenario is similar to the call flow depicted in figure 6.2.2.1-1, with the exceptions that the Suspend procedure (step 18 and step 22a in figure 6.2.2.1-1) is not performed and that the MME only deactivates bearers used for voice (step 22a in figure 6.2.2.1-1) and sets the PS-to-CS handover indicator. The scenario requires that eNB can determine that the target is either GERAN with DTM but without DTM HO support and that the UE is supporting DTM or that the target is UTRAN (HSPA) without PS HO support.\nNOTE:\tThe eNB can be configured to use this procedure according to operator's policy when 5GS is deployed.\nThe message in step 3 in figure 6.2.2.1-1 includes an indication to the MME that the UE is available for PS service in the target cell. Furthermore, if the target is GERAN, the E-UTRAN places in the generic Source to Target Transparent Container the \"old BSS to new BSS information IE\", while if the target is UTRAN, the generic Source to Target Transparent container is encoded according to the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE definition. At the end of the procedure described in figure 6.2.2.1-1, the remaining PS resources are re-established when the UE performs the Routeing Area update procedure. Triggers for performing Routeing Area update procedure are described in TS 23.060 [10]. The target SGSN may deactivate the PDP contexts that cannot be established as described in TS 23.060 [10].\nDepicted in figure 6.2.2.2-1 is a call flow for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support, including the handling of the non-voice component. The flow requires that eNB can determine that either the target is UTRAN with PS HO or the target is GERAN with DTM support and the UE is supporting DTM.\nThe figure depicts the SRVCC (Serving Radio Voice Channel) from E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) to UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio Network) with PS HO (Physical Service Header) or GERAN (Generalized E-UTRAN) support. The figure illustrates the various paths and configurations of the SRVCC, including the use of PS HO and GERAN, which are used to support different types of services and network configurations.\nFigure 6.2.2.2-1: SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN with PS HO or GERAN with DTM HO support\n1.\tUE sends measurement reports to E-UTRAN.\n2.\tBased on UE measurement reports the source E-UTRAN decides to trigger an SRVCC handover to UTRAN/GERAN.\n3.\tIf target is UTRAN, the source E-UTRAN sends a Handover Required (Target ID, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, SRVCC HO indication) message to the source MME. SRVCC HO indication indicates to MME that this is for CS+PS HO.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the source E-UTRAN indicates using SRVCC HO Indication that target is both CS and PS capable and this is a CS+PS HO request, the source MME sends the single received transparent container to both the target CS domain and the target PS domain.\nIf target is GERAN, the source E UTRAN sends a Handover Required (Target ID, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, additional Source to Target Transparent Container, SRVCC HO Indication) message to the source MME. The E-UTRAN places the \"old BSS to new BSS information IE\" for the CS domain in the additional Source to Target Transparent Container. The differentiation between CS and PS containers is described in TS 36.413 [30]. In this case, the MME identifies from SRVCC HO Indication that this is a request for a CS+PS handover.\n4.\tBased on the QCI associated with the voice bearer (QCI 1) and the SRVCC HO Indication, the source MME splits the voice bearer from all other PS bearers and initiates their relocation towards MSC Server and SGSN, respectively.\n5a)\tSource MME initiates the PS-CS handover procedure for the voice bearer by sending a SRVCC PS to CS Request (IMSI, Target ID, STN-SR, C-MSISDN, Source to Target Transparent Container, MM Context, Emergency Indication) message to the MSC Server. If SRVCC with priority is supported, the MME also includes priority indication in SRVCC PS to CS Request if it detects the SRVCC requires priority handling. The detection is based on the ARP associated with the EPS bearer used for IMS signalling. The priority indication corresponds to the ARP information element. The Emergency Indication and the equipment identifier are included if the ongoing session is emergency session. Authenticated IMSI and C-MSISDN shall also be included if available. The message includes information relevant to the CS domain only. MME received STN-SR and C-MSISDN from the HSS as part of the subscription profile downloaded during the E-UTRAN attach procedure. MM Context contains security related information. CS security key is derived by the MME from the E-UTRAN/EPS domain key as defined in TS 33.401 [22]. The CS Security key is sent in the MM Context.\n5b)\tMSC Server interworks the PS-CS handover request with a CS inter-MSC handover request by sending a Prepare Handover Request message to the target MSC. If SRVCC with priority is supported and the MSC Server receives the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request, the MSC server/MGW sends Prepare Handover Request message to the Target MSC with priority indication mapped from the ARP. The MSC Server maps the ARP to the priority level, pre-emption capability/vulnerability for CS services based on local regulation or operator settings. The priority indication indicates the CS call priority during handover as specified in TS 25.413 [11] for UMTS and TS 48.008 [23] for GSM/EDGE. If the target system is GERAN, the MSC Server assigns a default SAI as Source ID on the interface to the target BSS and uses BSSMAP encapsulated for the Prepare Handover Request. If the target system is UTRAN, the MSC Server uses RANAP encapsulated for the Prepare Handover Request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe value of the default SAI is configured in the MSC and allows a release 8 and later BSC to identify that the source for the SRVCC Handover is E-UTRAN. To ensure correct statistics in the target BSS the default SAI should be different from the SAIs used in UTRAN.\n5c)\tTarget MSC requests resource allocation for the CS relocation by sending the Relocation Request/Handover Request message to the target RNS/BSS. If the MSC Server indicated priority, the RNC/BSS allocates the radio resource based on the existing procedures with priority indication, as specified in TS 23.009 [18] and in TS 25.413 [11] for UMTS and TS 48.008 [23] for GSM/EDGE. If the target RAT is UTRAN, Relocation Request/Handover Request message contains the generic Source to Target Transparent Container. If the target RAT is GERAN, Relocation Request/Handover Request message contains the additional Source to Target Transparent Container.\n6.\tIn parallel to the previous step the source MME initiates relocation of the PS bearers. The following steps are performed (for details see TS 23.401 [2] clauses 5.5.2.1 and 5.5.2.3):\na)\tSource MME sends a Forward Relocation Request (generic Source to Target Transparent Container, MM Context, PDN Connections IE) message to the target SGSN. If the target SGSN uses S4 based interaction with S-GW and P-GW, the PDN Connections IE includes bearer information for all bearers except the voice bearer. The handling of security keys for PS handover of the remaining non-voice PS bearers is specified in TS 33.401 [22].\nNOTE 3:\tIf the target SGSN uses Gn/Gp based interaction with GGSN the Forward Relocation Request will contain PDP Contexts, instead of PDN Connections IE, including bearer information for all bearers except the voice bearer.\nb)\tTarget SGSN requests resource allocation for the PS relocation by sending the Relocation Request/Handover Request (Source to Target Transparent Container) message to the target RNS/BSS.\n7.\tAfter the target RNS/BSS receives both the CS relocation/handover request with the PS relocation/handover request, it assigns the appropriate CS and PS resources. The following steps are performed:\na)\tTarget RNS/BSS acknowledges the prepared PS relocation/handover by sending the Relocation Request Acknowledge/Handover Request Acknowledge (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the target SGSN.\nb)\tTarget SGSN sends a Forward Relocation Response (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source MME.\n8.\tIn parallel to the previous step the following steps are performed:\na)\tTarget RNS/BSS acknowledges the prepared CS relocation/handover by sending the Relocation Request Acknowledge/Handover Request Acknowledge (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the target MSC.\nb)\tTarget MSC sends a Prepare Handover Response (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the MSC Server.\nc)\tEstablishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW associated with the MSC Server e.g. using ISUP IAM and ACM messages.\nNOTE 4:\tThe Target to Source Transparent Container sent to the target SGSN is step 7a and the Target to Source Transparent Container sent to the target MSC in step 8a, include the same allocation of CS and PS resources (e.g. the target BSS includes the same DTM Handover Command in both containers).\n9.\tFor non-emergency session, the MSC Server initiates the Session Transfer by using the STN-SR e.g. by sending an ISUP IAM (STN-SR) message towards the IMS. If this is a priority session, the MSC Server sends the SIP Session Transfer message with the priority indication to the IMS and the IMS entity handles the session transfer procedure with priority. The priority indication in the SIP Session Transfer message is mapped by the MSC Server from the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request received in step 5. The mapping of the priority level is based on operator policy and/or local configuration, and the IMS priority indicator should be the same as for the original IMS created over PS. For emergency session, the MSC Server initiates the Session Transfer by using the locally configured E-STN-SR and by including the equipment identifier. IMS Service Continuity or Emergency IMS Service Continuity procedures are applied for execution of the Session Transfer, TS 23.237 [14].\nNOTE 5:\tThis step can be started after step 8b.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the MSC Server is using an ISUP interface, then the initiation of the session transfer for non-emergency sessions may fail if the subscriber profile including CAMEL triggers is not available prior handover (see clause 7.3.2.1.3 of TS 23.292 [13]), and can also fail if CAMEL triggers are available and local anchor transfer function is used (see TS 23.237 [14]). If the subscriber profile is available prior handover then CAMEL triggers others than those used in clause 7.3.2.1.3 of TS 23.292 [13] are not used during the transfer.\n10.\tDuring the execution of the Session Transfer procedure the remote end is updated with the SDP of the CS access leg according to TS 23.237 [14]. The downlink flow of VoIP packets is switched towards the CS access leg at this point.\n11.\tThe source IMS access leg is released according to TS 23.237 [14].\nNOTE 7:\tSteps 10 and 11 are independent of step 12.\n12.\tThe MSC Server sends a SRVCC PS to CS Response (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source MME.\n13.\tSource MME synchronises the two prepared relocations and sends a Handover Command (Target to Source Transparent Container) message to the source E-UTRAN.\nNOTE 8:\tWhen the target cell is GERAN, the MME may receive different Target to Source Transparent Containers from the MSC Server and from the SGSN, i.e. a \"New BSS to Old BSS Information\" (see TS 48.008 [23]) may be received from the MSC Server and a \"Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container\" (see TS 48.018 [24]) may be received from the SGSN.\n14.\tE-UTRAN sends a Handover from E-UTRAN Command message to the UE.\n14a.\tIf the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and the source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the reporting is performed as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\n15.\tUE tunes to the target UTRAN/GERAN cell.\n16.\tHandover Detection at the target RNS/BSS occurs, then the target RNS/BSS sends Handover Detection message to the target MSC. At this stage, the target MSC can send/receive voice data. The UE sends a Handover Complete message via the target RNS/BSS to the target MSC. If the target MSC is not the MSC Server, then the Target MSC sends an SES (Handover Complete) message to the MSC Server. At this stage, the UE re-establishes the connection with the network.\n17.\tThe CS relocation/handover is complete. The following steps are performed:\na)\tTarget RNS/BSS sends Relocation Complete/Handover Complete message to the target MSC.\nb)\tTarget MSC sends an SES (Handover Complete) message to the MSC Server.

This triggers MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. The MME does not send deactivation request toward the eNodeB on receiving PS-to-CS Complete Notification in step 17d.

It illustrates the steps taken by the network to ensure a smooth handover from one network to another. The figure shows the handover process from the vSRVCC (Virtual Service Router VLAN Channel) to the vSRVCC (Virtual Service Router VLAN Channel) in a 5G network. The handover involves the use of handover protocols, such as handover algorithms and handover procedures, to ensure that the network is transferred smoothly and without any disruptions. The figure also includes visual elements such as handover signals, handover procedures, and handover protocols, providing a clear and concise representation of the vSRVCC handover procedure in a 5G network.\nFigure 6.2.2.3-1: vSRVCC handover procedure\n1.\tUE sends measurement reports to E-UTRAN.\n2.\tBased on UE measurement reports and QCI=1 indications, the source E-UTRAN decides to trigger a SRVCC handover to UTRAN.\n3.\tThe source E-UTRAN sends a Handover Required (Target ID, generic Source to Target Transparent Container, SRVCC HO indication) message to the source MME.

If SRVCC with priority is supported and the MSC Server receives the priority indication (i.e. ARP) in the SRVCC PS to CS Request, the MSC server/MGW sends Prepare Handover Request message to the Target MSC with priority indication mapped from the ARP. The MSC Server maps the ARP to the priority level, pre-emption capability/vulnerability for CS services based on local regulation or operator settings.

The S-GW releases all RNC related information (address and TEIDs) for the UE if Direct Tunnel is established, and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s).\nThe SGSN stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW. The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\n22b)\tThe source SGSN sends a Iu Release Command to the Source RNC. The Source RNC releases its resources related to the UE and responds with an Iu Release Complete message.\n23a.\tFor non-emergency sessions and if the HLR is to be updated, i.e. if the IMSI is authenticated but unknown in the VLR, the MSC Server performs a TMSI reallocation towards the UE using its own non-broadcast LAI and, if the MSC Server and other MSC/VLRs serve the same (target) LAI, with its own Network Resource Identifier (NRI).\nNOTE 6:\tThe TMSI reallocation is performed by the MSC Server towards the UE via target MSC.\nNOTE 7:\tFor emergency services sessions the HLR will not be updated. TMSI reallocation may be performed based on IMSI presence.\n23b.\tFor non-emergency sessions if the MSC Server performed a TMSI reallocation in step 23a, and if this TMSI reallocation was completed successfully, the MSC Server performs a MAP Update Location to the HSS/HLR.\nNOTE 8:\tThis Update Location is not initiated by the UE.\n24.\tFor an emergency services session after handover is complete, the source SGSN or the MSC Server may send a Subscriber Location Report carrying the identity of the MSC Server to a GMLC associated with the source or target side, respectively, as defined in TS 23.271 [29] to support location continuity.\nNOTE 9:\tAny configuration of the choice between a source SGSN versus MSC Server update to a GMLC needs to ensure that a single update occurs from one of these entities when the control plane location solution is used on the source and/or target sides.\nAfter the CS voice call is terminated and if the UE is still in GERAN or UTRAN (or for any other reason according to TS 24.008 [44]), then the UE shall resume PS services (as specified in TS 23.060 [10]). A Gn/Gp SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [10] to resume the PDP Context(s). An S4-SGSN will also follow TS 23.060 [10] to resume the bearers, and will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. Resuming the suspended bearers in the S-GW and in the P-GW should be done by implicit resume using the Modify Bearer request message if it is triggered by the procedure in operation, e.g. RAU, TAU or Service Request. The S-GW is aware of the suspend state of the bearers and will forward the Modify Bearer request to the P-GW. Explicit resume using the Resume Notification message should be used in cases when Modify Bearer Request is not triggered by the procedure in operation.\nThe call flow for this scenario is similar to the call flow depicted in figure 6.3.2.1-1, with the exceptions that the Suspend procedure (step 18 and step 22a in figure 6.3.2.1-1) is not performed and that the source SGSN only deactivates bearers used for voice and sets the PS-to-CS handover indicator. The scenario requires that NB can determine that the target is either GERAN with DTM but without DTM HO support and that the UE is supporting DTM or that the target is UTRAN (HSPA) without PS HO support. The message in step 3 in figure 6.3.2.1 1 includes an indication to the SGSN that the UE is available for PS service in the target cell. At the end of the procedure described in figure 6.3.2.1-1, the remaining PS resources are re-established when the UE performs the Routeing Area update procedure. Triggers for performing Routeing Area update procedure are described in TS 23.060 [10]. The target SGSN may deactivate the PDP contexts that cannot be established as described in TS 23.060 [10].\nDepicted in figure 6.3.2.2-1 is a call flow for SRVCC from UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support, including the handling of the non-voice component.\nThe figure depicts the transmission of a voice call over a 3GPP-compliant network, specifically the use of the Enhanced Voice Codec (SRVCC) for voice transmission.

                            "text_content": "Depicted in Figure 6.4.3.1-1 is an overview call flow for SRVCC to E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) from GERAN without DTM/PS HO support. The flow is based on the assumption that the source is GERAN without DTM/PS HO support or that the UE is without DTM/PS HO support and that all PS bearers are suspended.\nThe CS to PS SRVCC procedure will only be successfully performed under the following conditions:\n-\tthe UE has indicated to be CS to PS capable,\n-\tthe CS to PS allowed indication was part of the subscriber data received from HSS,\n-\tthe UE is IMS registered; and\n-\tthe UE has at least one PS bearer (usable for SIP signalling).\nThe figure depicts a simplified schematic of a 3GPP-compliant network, specifically highlighting the transition from a GERAN (GPRS Enhanced) network to an E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) network. The figure includes various components such as the SRVCC (Serving Radio Virtual Circuit) to E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and E-UTRAN to UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) interfaces, as well as the GERAN to E-UTRAN interface. The figure also includes a depiction of the HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) network, which is a subset of 3GPP's HSPA+ (High Speed Packet Access Plus) standard. The figure is a simplified representation, and actual network configurations may vary.\nFigure 6.4.3.1-1: SRVCC to E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) from GERAN without DTM / PS HO and SRVCC to E-UTRAN from UTRAN\nNOTE 1:\tFor SRVCC to UTRAN (HSPA) the target SGSN may use Gn/Gp for the connection to the GGSN/PGW SGSN. In that case SGSN uses GTPv1 signalling, i.e. send Update PDP Context Request in step 12 and the user plane path is established for all bearers between the UE, target NodeB, the SGSN and the SGW/PGW (GGSN) and use the GTPv1 version of the SGSN Context Request in steps 4 and 5. Furthermore, the step 16 is triggered for the setup of a Secondary PDP Context instead of a Dedicated Bearer.\n1.\tThe RNC/BSC sends a HO required to the MSC Server including an indication this HO is for CS to PS. If an inter-MSC CS HO has occurred prior to the CS to PS HO procedure, the MSC Server forwards the HO required to the anchor MSC Server.\n1a.\tThe MSC retrieves P-TMSI+RAI+P-TMSI signature or GUTI from the UE.\n2.\tThe MSC Server sends an Session Transfer Notification to IMS, which indicates that IMS should prepare for the transfer of media to PS. IMS allocates media ports in the network for the transfer. The media ports and codec information allocated by IMS are provided to the MSC Server in the response message\n3.\tThe MSC Server selects the target MME/SGSN based on Target ID contained in the HO required and sends a SRVCC CS to PS HO request to the target MME/SGSN. If required, the IMSI is provided for identifying the UE, and the GUTI or P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and RAI as provided by the UE (see clause 5.3.4.3) are provided to the target MME/SGSN.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 2 and Step 3 can be performed independently of each other.\n4.\tIf the target MME/SGSN has no UE context it sends Context Request using GUTI or P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and RAI to find the old MME/SGSN.\n5.\tThe old MME/SGSN responds with Context Response message including all UE contexts.\n6.\tThe target MME/SGSN allocates resources for all PS bearers in E-UTRAN or UTRAN (HSPA). The target MME/SGSN determines if the Serving GW is to be relocated, e.g. due to PLMN change.\n7.\tA SRVCC CS to PS HO response is returned from the target MME/SGSN to the MSC Server.\n8.\tMSC Server sends CS to PS command to the RAN, possibly via the target MSC, and the RAN send HO command to UE, indicating CS to PS handover. The MSC Server also includes in that message the IP address/ports and selected codec for the IMS media anchoring.\n9.\tA Session Transfer Preparation Request is sent to IMS to trigger IMS to have the media path switched to the IP address/port of the UE on the target access.\n10. The UE sends Handover confirmation to the eNodeB/NodeB.\n11. The eNodeB send Handover Notify to the MME/SGSN.\n11a. The MME/SGSN sends a SRVCC CS to PS Complete Notification message to the MSC Server to confirm the completion of the handover. The source MSC Server acknowledges the information by sending a SRVCC CS to PS Complete Acknowledge message to the MME/SGSN. When receiving the SRVCC CS to PS Complete Notification message, the MSC Server may release the local resource toward the BSS/RAN but not for the resources toward IMS (i.e. will not send any session release towards IMS).\n12.\tThe MME/S4-SGSN sends Modify Bearer Request to the SGW, which may be forwarded to the PGW to update PS bearer contexts according to IRAT HO procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. At this stage the user plane path is established for all bearers between the UE, target eNodeB/NodeB, Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target Serving GW) and PDN GW and the voice session may continue temporarily on the default bearer until the dedicated bearer has been setup.\nIn this procedure, the MME/SGSN includes the CS to PS SRVCC indication. When dynamic PCC is deployed and PCRF has subscribed to the corresponding event as specified in TS 23.203 [32], the CS to PS indication is provided to the PCRF. This causes PCRF to make policy decisions to permit traffic towards the ATGW on the default bearer. Otherwise, when GTP is used, the PGW can install the filters locally to allow the default bearer to temporarily permit traffic towards the configured ATGWs.\nNOTE 3:\tAn alternative of using temporary filters on the default bearers is to ensure that the filters are always open towards the IMS ATGW. As the ATGW is a media gateway, such gateway will ensure that non-authorized media cannot be sent through the system.\n13.\tIf the target MME/SGSN has received Context Response from the old SGSN/MME, the target MME/SGSN sends the Context Acknowledge to the Context Response to the old SGSN/MME. A timer in the old SGSN is started to supervise when resources in the old BSC/RNC and the old Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation) shall be released according to IRAT HO procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\n14.\tWhen the timer at the old SGSN started in step 13 expires, the old SGSN will clean-up all its resources towards old BSC/RNC if the UE is Iu/Gb Connected.\n15.\tThe UE initiates the Session transfer procedures according to TS 23.237 [14].\n16.\tAs a result of the Session transfer procedures, the setup of a dedicated bearer or PDP Context for voice is performed according to the dedicated bearer/PDP Context activation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2] or TS 23.060 [10]. After the setup of a dedicated bearer for voice and the respective filters in UE and PGW, the default bearer is not longer used for voice media and the PCRF revert any policy decision made in step 12 for the purpose of CS to PS SRVCC procedures.\nNOTE 4:\tWhere the bearer contexts are suspended depends on if the CS call was triggered by SRVCC from E-UTRAN or from CS procedures while the UE was attached to 2G/3G. If the CS call was triggered by SRVCC from E-UTRAN the bearers are suspended in an MME, and step 4 is sent to the old MME only in the case of MME change, or if the CS call was triggered while UE was in 2G/3G, the bearers are suspended in the old SGSN. The new MME uses P-TMSI and RAI or the GUTI received from the MSC in the SRVCC CS to PS HO request to find the old SGSN/MME.\nNOTE 5:\tThe UE will trigger the TAU according to TS 23.401 [2] if the target network is E-UTRAN or a Routing Area Update according to TS 23.060 [10] if the target network is UTRAN. The MME/SGSN knows that this relates to the CS to PS SRVCC procedures.\nThe call flow for this scenario is similar to the call flow depicted in figure 6.4.3.1-1, except that the old PS node in this case is an SGSN and step 4 is performed towards the old SGSN which is in the same routing area as the BSC/RNC. The target MME/SGSN shall send Context Request using P-TMSI and RAI to find the old SGSN to obtain the bearer contexts of the UE.\nThe call flow for this scenario is similar to the call flow depicted in figure 6.4.3.1-1, with the clarification that the BSC/RNC shall only send CS to PS HO required to MSC Server when CS to PS HO is supposed to be triggered. The PS to PS HO required shall not be sent to the old SGSN. Hence, no PS HO signalling is initiated. The target MME/SGSN shall send Context Request using P-TMSI and RAI to find the old SGSN to obtain the bearer contexts of the UE.\n",
