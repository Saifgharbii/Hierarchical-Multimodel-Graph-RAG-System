The HSS selection function in UDM selects an HSS instance based on the available HSS instances (obtained from the NRF or locally configured).\nWhen the NRF is used for HSS discovery, the HSS registers in the NRF using the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister Request message as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [5].\nDifferent HSS instances managing different sets of IMSI/MSISDN ranges may be deployed in a given PLMN. In this case, the HSS instances register in NRF using either different ranges of IMSI/MSISDN and/or HSS Group IDs.\nNOTE 1:\tIn deployments where simple IMSI/MSISDN ranges are not suitable to describe the IMSI/MSISDN sets served by HSS instances, it is expected the HSS instances only register HSS Group IDs.\nWhen NRF is used for HSS discovery, the UDM sends a Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request to NRF as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [5] to discover HSS instances within a given PLMN. The UDM may store all returned HSS instances and their NF profiles for subsequent use, including, if applicable, supported IMSI/MSISDN ranges, and/or HSS Group IDs.\nThe UDM may use Nnrf_NFStatusSubscribe/Unsubscribe service operations with NRF as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [5] to receive Nnrf_NFStatusNotify service operation for updates to the NF profiles of HSS instances registered in NRF.\nThe UDM always selects an HSS within its own PLMN. The HSS selection should consider one of the following factors when available to the UDM entity:\n1.\tHSS Group ID of the UE's IMSI.\n2.\tIMSI; the UDM selects an HSS instance based on the IMSI range the UE's IMSI belongs to or based on the results of a discovery procedure with NRF using the UE's IMSI as input for HSS discovery.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this release of the specification there is not identified need for the UDM to be able to select the HSS based on IMS identifiers (IMPI, IMPU) neither based on MSISDN or External Group ID.\n",

In this case, the UDM requests the generation of the Authentication Vector for 5GS to the HSS.\nNOTE:\tThe HSS acts as ARPF rather than as AuC and it is required to generate authentication vectors as defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6].\nWhen the UDM receives an authentication information Request from the AUSF it shall check (by means of an 5GS-UDR query or local configuration in the UDM) whether the subscribed authentication method is 5G_AKA or EAP_AKA_PRIME and if so whether 5G authentication vector generation for the identified subscriber shall be done in the HSS. If so, the UDM shall make use of the Nhss_UEAuthentication_Get service operation to retrieve a 5G authentication vector from the HSS.\nFigure 5.2.2-1 shows the scenario where the authentication vector request for a 5G subscriber who also has an EPS subscription is received by the UDM.\nThe figure depicts a 5G subscriber authentication system, where the authentication vector is generated in the HSS (Hybrid Service Set). This system utilizes a combination of physical and logical security measures to ensure secure communication.\nFigure 5.2.2-1: Authentication for 5G subscriber with authentication vector generation in HSS\n1.\tThe UDM receives an Authentication Vector request, containing the identity of the user (SUPI or SUCI). If SUCI is received, the UDM performs SUCI to SUPI de-concealment. For details of the Nudm_UEAuthentication Service see 3GPP TS 23.502 [5] and 3GPP TS 33.501 [6].\n2.\tIf the 5GS-UDR is used, the UDM queries the 5GS-UDR using the SUPI to retrieve Authentication Subscription Information. In this scenario the Authentication Subscription Information contains a subscribed authentication method of 5G_AKA or EAP_AKA_PRIME and an indicator indicating that authentication vector generation shall be performed in the HSS. Optionally, the indication that the authentication vector generation shall be performed in the HSS could be locally configured at the UDM/ARPF.\n3.\tThe UDM uses the Nhss_UEAuthentication_Get service operation to retrieve an authentication vector from the HSS. The request contains the IMSI the authentication method and serving network name.\n4.\tThe HSS reads authentication subscription data from the EPS-UDR. This step is omitted if all relevant authentication subscription data are stored locally in the HSS.\n5.\tThe HSS (AuC/ARPF) calculates the requested authentication vector taking into account the serving network name and authentication method received in step 3 and the authentication subscription information retrieved from the EPS-UDR.\n6.\tThe calculated authentication vector is sent to the UDM.\n7.\tThe HSS updates the EPS-UDR with the new sequence number.

The UDM checks whether any NF (e.g. the HSS) has subscribed to notification on UE Reachability for SMS over IP events, querying 5GS-UDR if applicable. If the HSS has subscribed to such notification, the UDM notifies the HSS (step 2c). As the IP-SM-GW has subscribed to the event of UE being reachable again as described in clause 5.5.6.3, the HSS shall notify the IP-SM-GW (step 2d).

                            "text_content": "The status of some specific monitoring events that are detected locally at the HSS and UDM (e.g. IMEI(SV)/PEI change, roaming status change) is kept synchronized between UDM and HSS as defined in this clause. This is, when the HSS detects e.g. that the IMEI(SV) for a UE changes (e.g. during an Update Location in EPS), the HSS informs the UDM about the IMEI(SV) change which stores the new IMEI(SV)/PEI accordingly and when UDM detects e.g. that the IMEI(SV)/PEI for a UE changes (e.g. during an AMF registration procedure in 5GC), the UDM informs HSS about the IMEI(SV)/PEI change as described in section 5.4.6.\nHSS and UDM can store the last IMEI(SV)/PEI and Roaming Status even when the UE is not currently located/registered in EPS or 5GC access respectively. If the UE has never registered in 5GC and last PEI is not stored, UDM shall notify HSS about the new PEI received and retrieve the last IMEI stored in HSS to notify the change of PEI/IMEI event when applicable.\nNOTE:\tThe synchronization of the status of these monitoring events shall be enabled bled in both HSS and UDM based on local policieswhenever common exposure is supported or last known IMEI is required in HSS/UDM.\nThis allows that the subscriptions to these specific monitoring events are applied in both domains when the PEI type is IMEI(SV). The UDM is capable of notifying these events taking place in EPS to the combined SCEF+NEF using SBI procedures.\nFigure 5.6.3-1 shows the scenario where the UDM receives a request from a combined SCEF+NEF to subscribe to a monitoring event in 5GC and EPC that is reported by the UDM.\nThe figure depicts the synchronization of status of monitoring events between HSS and UDM in a 5G network. It illustrates the use of HSS (Hybrid Service Set) and UDM (User Data Management) to ensure efficient communication and data management. The figure shows the status of monitoring events, such as signal strength, packet loss, and latency, being transmitted between the HSS and UDM. This synchronization is crucial for maintaining network performance and ensuring data integrity.\nFigure 5.6.3-1: Synchronization of Status of Monitoring Events between HSS and UDM\n1.\tThe UDM receives a request from a combined SCEF+NEF to configure a monitoring event for a UE. The request indicates that the subscription applies also to EPC (e.g. IMEI(SV)/PEI change) and UDM is expected to report the event.\n2.\tThe UDM stores in the 5GS-UDR the monitoring event together with the notification address (e.g., the NEF notification address) of the combined SCEF+NEF.\n3.\tThe UDM replies to the combined SCEF+NEF including a confirmation that the configuration of the event was also successful in EPC domain.\nNOTE:\tA UDM that supports interworking with EPC relies on the HSS to synchronize the status of these monitoring events in the EPC domain with the UDM (i.e. the UDM does not need to subscribe to the monitoring event towards the HSS) for UEs that have subscription data in EPC and 5GC.\n4.\tAt a later stage, the HSS detects the event (e.g. IMEI(SV) change) for the UE in the EPC domain (e.g. during an Update Location Request procedure).\n5.\tThe HSS synchronizes with the UDM about the event using the Nudm_UECM_Update service operation.\n6.\tThe UDM stores the information received from HSS (e.g. a new PEI for the UE) in the 5GS-UDR and checks if a related subscription to the related monitoring event exists.\n7.\tThe UDM notifies the NEF accordingly.\n8.\tAlternatively, the monitoring event may be detected by the UDM.\n9. The UDM notifies the NEF accordingly.\n10. The UDM synchronizes with the HSS about the event using the Nhss_UECM_Update service operation.\n11.\tThe HSS stores the status of the monitoring event received from the UDM in the EPS-UDR.\n",
