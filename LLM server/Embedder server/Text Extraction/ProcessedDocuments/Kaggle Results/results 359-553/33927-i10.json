                    "text_content": "A 3GPP generic virtualized network product class defines a set of functions that are implemented on that product, which includes, but not limited to minimum set of common 3GPP functions for that product covered in 3GPP specifications, other functions and softwares not covered by 3GPP specifications, as well as interfaces to access that product. A generic type 1 of virtualized network product may also include software, and OS components that the product is implemented on. The present document describes the threats and the critical assets in the course of developing 3GPP security assurance specifications for a particular network product class.\nNOTE: \tConsidering the situation that type 2 and/or type 3 of virtualized product class are dependent of pre-mature specifications from other standard organization, only type 1 of virtualized product class are specified in present document.\nApplicability of the GVNP security assurance specification to products: Assume a telecom equipment vendor wants to sell a product to an operator, and the latter is interested in following the Security Assurance Methodology as described in TR 33.936 [3], then, before evaluation according to TR 33.936 [3] in a testing laboratory can start, it first needs to be determined which security assurance specifications written by 3GPP apply to the given product.\nDifferent with 3GPP GNP defined in TR 33.926 [2], based on different implementation, 3GPP VNP will be categorized as 3 types. As a result, a type 1 of 3GPP Virtualized Network Product may be composed with software (e.g. operating system, drivers, applications, services, protocols), and interfaces (e.g. console interfaces and O&M interfaces) that allow the 3GPP network product to be managed and configured locally and/or remotely. A GVNP is a 3GPP network product.\nGVNP Security Assurance Specification (GVNP SCAS): The GVNP SCAS provides descriptions of the security requirements (which are including test cases) pertaining to type 1 of generic virtualized network product class.\nNeed for a GVNP network product model: This minimum set of functions listed in clause 4.2 is exclusively meant as a membership criterion for the GVNP Class. It is not meant to restrict the functionality of a GVNP, nor the scope of the present document in any way. On the contrary, it is clear that GVNPs will contain many more functions than those from the minimum set listed in clause 4.2, and the GVNP will contain requirements relating to functions not contained in this minimum set. Some of these functions, beyond the minimum set, can be found from various 3GPP specifications, but by far not all these functions. This implies that there is a need to describe the functions that cannot be found from 3GPP specifications in some other way before the GVNP can be written so that the GVNPs can make reference to this description. This description is the GVNP model, cf. clause 4.3.\nEXAMPLE 1: \t3GPP specifications do not describe a local management interface, but GVNPs will have to take it into account, so a local management interface needs to be part of a GVNP model.\nEXAMPLE 2: \tA GVNP sometimes says e.g.: \"Authentication events on the local management interface shall be logged.\" This implies the presence of a logging function. The logging function is not part of the defining minimum set of functions from clause 4.2. If a product implements this minimum set, but no logging function, then this just means that the product is a GVNP, but will fail the evaluation against the GVNP SCAS.\nThe GVNP models are further used in clauses 5 and 6 in various ways, e.g. the critical assets can point to parts of the GVNP model, threats and requirements can refer to interfaces shown in the GVNP model, etc.\n",

The realistic deployment scenarios are summarized in ETSI NFV-SEC 001 [7], based on which a 3GPP network operator can deploy 3GPP defined functionalities in three modes:\n-\tMode 1. A network operator purchases 3GPP VNFs from its vendors and deploys it on a third party NFVI.\n-\tMode 2. A network operator purchases 3GPP VNFs and the Virtualization layer (e.g. hypervisor) from its vendors, and deploys them on a third party hardware layer.\n-\tMode 3.

Unlike a generic physical network product defined in [2], a 3GPP-denfined function can be deployed in multiple VMs and the feature s supported in different VM of the GVNP are up to the implementation of vendors.\nTo maintain generality and avoid overlap, the GVNP SCAS intends to explicitly address all GVNP functions that, if present in a GVNP, need to be evaluated and hence covered by the requirements in the GVNP SCAS.\nA GVNP will also contain functionalities not or not fully covered in 3GPP specifications.\nExamples include, but are not limited to, remote management functions.\nThe present document assumes that the functions of GVNP are implemented on multiple VMs. Each VM which is running on a common platform requires a guest operating system to run.\nCompared to generic physical network product defined in [2], GVNP has also two types of logical interfaces, i.e. execution environment interfaces and remote logical interfaces.\nThe remote logical interfaces are interfaces which can be used to communicate with the GVNP from another network node and also include the remote access interfaces to the GVNP for its maintenance through e.g. an Element Management (EM), a Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM).\nA GVNP hosts the following remote logical interfaces:\n-\tService interfaces that are defined in pertinent 3GPP specifications\n-\tService interfaces that are not defined by 3GPP-\tAccess interfaces to the GNP for its maintenance through e.g. an Element Management System (EMS) or other management functions, e.g. remote OAM interface, interface between EM (Element Management) and VNF which proprietary interface (see figure 4.3-3).\n-\tInterface defined by ETSI NFV specifications [5] and [6]:\n-\tInterface between VNF and VNFM for GVNP lifecycle management, configuration information exchange, state information exchange necessary for network service lifecycle management, etc. This interface refers to Ve-Vnfm in the figure 4.3-3.\n-\tAn execution environment interface is an interface that can be used to provide the GVNP with the underlying execution environment, to guarantee hardware independent lifecycle, portability, and performance requirements of the GVNP. A GVNP type 1 hosts the following execution environment interface:\n-\tInterface towards the underlying Virtualization layer for execution environment provision. This interface refers to Vn-Nf in the figure 4.3-3.\nThe figure depicts a NFV reference architectural framework, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. It highlights the role of the network function virtualization (NFV) layer, which enables the creation of virtualized network functions (VNFs) and their deployment on physical infrastructure. The framework also includes the reference architecture, which provides a standardized design for NFV deployments.The figure depicts a NFV reference architectural framework, illustrating the various components and their interconnections.

                            "text_content": "In clause 5.3.1 of TR 33.926 [2], the identified threats are grouped into seven categories, one covering threats relating to 3GPP-defined interfaces and the other six corresponding to the categories proposed by STRIDE. Since these seven categories are for generic 3GPP network products, they are also applicable to GVNP of type 1. In addition, GVNP of type 1 also needs to consider the threats related to ETSI-defined interfaces. As a result, there are eight categories of threats for GVPN of type 1. The following clauses describe the threats according to these security categories and use the template of threat description in clause 5.3.1 of TR 33.926 [2]. For threats descriptions of current seven categories, the present document will focus on the differences between GVNP threats and GNP threats which are described in TR 33.926 [2].\nFor GVNP of type1 and GNP in TR 33.926 [2], the threats related to 3GPP-defined interfaces are the same. So, all texts in clause 5.3.2 of TR 33.926 [2] apply to GVNP of type 1. It means that there is no need repeat the threats relating to 3GPP-defined interfaces which are covered in 3GPP security specifications. If threats relating to 3GPP-defined interfaces are found not sufficiently covered in existing 3GPP security specifications, they need to be addressed in the SCAS for virtualised network products.\nTwo of the interfaces defined in ETSI NFV specification [5] are identified as the critical assets of GVNP type 1, i.e. interface between VNF and VNFM, interface between 3GPP VNF and virtualisation layer. The threats on these interfaces are as follows.\n-\tThreats on interface between 3GPP VNF and VNFM: if the interface is not protected, an attacker can attack all the requests/responses sent between the VNF and the VNFM. For example, the attacker can insert, tamper or delete e.g. scaling requests, healing requests, subscribe requests, query requests and other management related requests sent from the instantiated GVNP of type 1 to the VNFM, hence the virtualised resource or relevant status information obtained by the instantiated GVNP of type 1 is not as requested. This affects the normal operation of the instantiated GVNP of type 1, and even causes DoS attacks, information leakage.\nNOTE:\tThe Virtualisation layer is out of 3GPP scope, but its protection will affect the security of the upper layer it supports. If the Virtualisation layer is compromised, the VNF on top of it could also be easily compromised. In such case, the messages sent over the VNF-VNFM interface can be manipulated by the compromised VNF, which is however not a threat coming from the VNF-VNFM interface. The analysis above focuses on the threats directly placed on VNF-VNFM interface, when it is not well protected.\n-\tThreats on interface between 3GPP VNF and virtualisation layer: an attacker can attack an instantiated GVNP of type 1 through a compromised virtualisation layer. For example, cryptographic keys or other security critical data of an instantiated GVNP of type 1 could be stolen by an attacker with access to the virtualisation layer, or the virtualised resource provided by the Virtualisation layer to the instantiated GVNP of type 1 can be manipulated or the bootloader of Guest OS of an instantiated GVNP of type 1 can be tampered by an attacker via a compromised virtualisation layer.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.1 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe difference is that VNF is accessed through VNC (Virtual Network Console) rather than through the physical console interface, an attacker can use a default account to access a VNF via VNC.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.2 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP.\nHowever, the attacker using the weak password accesses GVNP through VNC (Virtual Network Console) rather than through the physical console interface.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.3 of TR 33.926 applies to GVNP.\nHowever, the attacker using the peeked password accesses GVNP through VNC (Virtual Network Console) rather than through the physical console interface.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.4 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThere are no differences between direct root accesses for GVNP and GNP described in TR 33.926 [2].\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.5 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nHowever, the objective of unauthorized access is a VNF, not a computer.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.6 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.3.7 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.4.1 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nDifferent from traditional physical network products, as the entire GVNP is instantiated by the image(s) and other information (e.g. configuration data, software environmental parameters, licence terms information, script, manifest file, checksum, etc. as defined in [8]) within a software package, additional threats are analysed as follows:\n-\tThreat Name: Software Tampering\n-\tThreat Category: Tampering\n-\tThreat Description: Compared with GNP software, GVNP software has additional attack surfaces, e.g. in the process of VNF package on boarding, during which the software package of a GVNP can be tampered/altered if not protected. An attacker, for example, can inject malicious code or tamper the information inside the unprotected package during on boarding. Then after the instantiation of the GVNP, the tampered code can be executed to conduct several attacks (e.g. DoS, Information Stealing, Frauds and so on).\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GVNP type 1 as listed in clause 5.2.1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.4.2 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nFor GVNP of type 1, there is no hardware. This is different from external device boot of GNP described in clause 5.3.4.3 of TR 33.926 [2]. The threat is described as follows:\n-\tThreat name: GVNP of type 1 boot tampering\n-\tThreat Category: Tampering\n-\tThreat Description: the GVNP bootloader may be maliciously tampered by an attacker, e.g. the attacker tampers the bootloader of GVNP through a malicious virtualisation layer.\n-\tThreatened Asset: guest operating system\nThe threat in clause 5.3.4.4 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.4.5 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.4.6 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.4.7 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.5.1 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.1 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.2 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.3 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\n-\tThreat name: Insecure Data Storage\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: The GVNP remotely stores sensitive data (e.g. passwords, private keys, logs) on the logical volume that the VIM allocates to the GVNP. An attacker can retrieve these data if they have been stored in an insecure way (e.g. clear text, unsalted hashes).\n-\tThreatened Asset: Any sensitive data stored on the logical volume of the GVNP\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.5 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\n-\tThreat name: Malware.\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure.\n-\tThreat Description: A malware installed on the logical volume that the VIM allocates to the GVNP can access to the stored sensitive data (e.g. subscription data, logs).\n-\tThreatened Asset: Any sensitive data stored on the logical volume of the GVNP.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.7 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.8 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.9 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.10 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.11 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.12 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.13 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.14 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threat in clause 5.3.6.15 of TR 33.926 [2] applies to GVNP of type 1.\nThe threats in all clauses of clause 5.3.7 for TR 33.926 [2] apply to GVNP of type 1.\nIn addition, there is DoS attack due to changing virtualisation resource that is used by GVNP. The detailed threat description is as follows:\n-\tThreat name: changing virtualisation resource without authorization.\n-\tThreat Category: DoS.\n-\tThreat Description: There are several ways to cause a DoS attack for the GVNP: attackers having access to a compromised virtualisation layer can change the virtualisation resource used by the instantiated GVNP of type1 without authorization, or a malicious VM deployed for one instance of a VNF on a host can illegally occupy the resources of the instantiated GVNP of type1 deployed on the same host, resulting in resource limitation of the instantiated GVNP of type1, or attackers having access to a compromised VNFM can scale in a Type 1 or scale down the virtualisation resource used by a GVNP or even terminate a Type 1 instance without authorization.\n-\tThreatened Asset: GVNP applications, sufficient processing capacity.\nThe threats in all clauses of clause 5.3.8 for TR 33.926 [2] apply to GVNP of type 1.\n",
