This includes, e.g. the SA6 and RAN WGs deciding on, what information to be provided on, which members of a public safety group should stay in RRC_CONNECTED and which one(s) are candidates for being transitioned to RRC_INACTIVE.\n-\tIf MBS sessions are temporarily deactivated and are subject to subsequent (re)activation, resulting in UEs in e.g. RRC_INACTIVE state which need to be (re)-awakened to receive MBS service, solutions may enable simultaneously wake up (for MBS reception) for all the UEs associated with the session.\nNOTE 2:\tFor active MBS Session, it is assumed that public safety applications (under the remit of SA6) will initiate minimum number and frequency of requests to transition to RRC_CONNECTED state to perform uplink transmissions, while Public Safety UEs are in RRC_INACTIVE state.\n-\tWhether there is a need for additional solutions to minimize packet loss during MBS reception, this should be addressed together with RAN WGs.\n",

In other words, MB-SMF is used to handle MBS session-level management while SMF performs per-UE MBS session management, e.g. authorization, multicast session information provisioning, managing 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery.\nAn AF creating a multicast session should be able to influence the service quality (more UEs vs. higher reliability) talking into consideration the specific needs of the service it offers. Thus the AF can provide assistance information to help the PLMN to enable or disable the transmission to UEs in RRC-INACTIVE state. The AF may also, based on local configuration or triggered by e.g. event report from the NEF (e.g. \"Number of UEs present in a geographical area\" as specified in clause 4.15.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3]), subscribe to or requests network analytics information (e.g. Observed Service Experience analytics, NF load analytics, Network Performance analytics, User Data Congestion analytics) from the NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [10], and decide to enable or disable the transmission to UEs in RRC-INACTIVE state based on the analytics information. For example, if the User Data Congestion analytics information indicates that the congestion level of the network is (predicted to be) high, then the AF can enable the transmission to UEs in RRC-INACTIVE state (i.e. instructing the NG-RAN to switch the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state to RRC-INACTIVE state); and later on when the analytics information indicates that the congestion is relieved, the AF can disable the transmission to UEs in RRC-INACTIVE state (i.e. instructing the NG-RAN to switch the UE in RRC-INACTIVE state back to RRC-CONNECTED state). The AF provides the indication of enabling or disabling the transmission to UEs in RRC-INACTIVE state (i.e. an indication whether NG-RAN nodes may deliver the MBS session to UEs in the inactive state) as part of the assistance information to the NG-RAN. However, the decision whether to apply transmission to UEs in RRC-INACTIVE state remains in the RAN nodes if transmission to UE in RRC-INACTIVE state is enabled.\nNOTE:\tIf the AF provides assistance information to disable reception in RRC-INACTIVE state, the number UEs in a cell that can receive the MBS session will be more limited but the transmission will be more reliable.\nEditor's note:\tWhether such behaviour is intended is FFS.\nProcedures in the following clauses focus on the following functionalities:\n-\t5GC provisioning necessary parameters to NG-RAN node(s).\n-\tSwitching between RRC Connected and RRC Inactive modes.\nThere are two levels of priority as a part of 5GC-provided parameters, namely:\n-\tMBS session priority: the MBS session priority denotes the priority level of an MBS session, and the priority level defines the relative importance of an MBS session. This allows the NG-RAN nodes deciding (the members of) which MBS session can be switched to RRC Inactive state, to free up resources of NG-RAN node upon e.g. congestion. NG-RAN node may also use it to decide (the members of) which MBS session can be switched to RRC Connected state, once the resources are regarded as sufficient.\nThe details of how the 5GC provides MBS session priority to NG-RAN node are further described in clause 6.1.3.2.\nEditor's note:\tWhether the existing QoS parameters (e.g. ARP, 5QI) of the MBS QoS Flow(s) can be used for the MBS Session priority is FFS.\n-\tUE session priority: the UE session priority denotes the priority level of a certain UE within a certain MBS session, and the priority level defines the relative importance of a UE for an MBS session. This allows the NG-RAN nodes deciding if the UE of an MBS session can be switched to RRC Inactive state, to free up resources of NG-RAN node upon e.g. congestion. NG-RAN node may also use it to decide if the UE of an MBS session can be switched to RRC Connected state, once the resources are regarded as sufficient.\nThe details of how the 5GC provides UE session priority to NG-RAN node are further described in clause 6.1.3.2.\nEditor's note\tWhether and how the NG-RAN use the assistant information will be determined by RAN WGs.\nWhether the transmission mode for inactive reception is applied depends on multiple factors and determined by the NG-RAN node:\n-\tBackward compatibility with UEs supporting Rel-17 MBS but not capable of receiving 5MBS data while in RRC-inactive state. If such UEs that joined a MBS multicast session are in a cell, MBS data need to be transmitted using the Rel-17 transmission mode for RRC-connected reception.\n-\tUE preferences: UEs could prefer to receive MBS data in RRC inactive state to reduce their battery consumption, or in RRC connected state to increase the service quality.\nNOTE:\tIf the UE indicates reception in RRC-INACTIVE state is not preferred and if NG-RAN follows the UE preference, the number UEs in a cell that can receive the MBS session will be more limited but the transmission will be more reliable.\nEditor's note:\tWhether such behaviour is intended is FFS.\n-\tMBS session priority.\nEditor's note:\tHow MBS Session priority could assist the NG-RAN in determining whether to apply transmission for inactive reception is FFS.\n-\tUE session priority.\nEditor's note:\tDetailed usage of combining UE priority and MBS session priority requires more study.\n-\tWhether the transmission for inactive reception is allowed for specific multicast MBS service(s).\n-\tOngoing session of the UEs (e.g. UE has other PDU session activated).\nEditor's note:\tThose assumptions need to be confirmed by RAN WGs.\nAF provides the following information, and MB-SMF stores this information as a part of Multicast MBS Session context, during MBS Session Creation procedures defined in clauses 7.1.1.2 or 7.1.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4] and clause 6.1.3.2:\n-\tMBS session priority.\n-\tWhether the transmission for inactive reception is allowed for specific multicast MBS service(s).\nAF provides the following information, and UDM stores this information as a part of MBS subscription data, during External Parameter Provisioning procedures as defined in clause 6.4.2 of TS 23.247 [4]:\n-\tUE session priority.\n",

The node is connected to the RRC (Radio Resource Control) and is in the process of moving an UE (User Equipment) to the RRC-CONNECTED state, indicating that the UE is now connected to the network and ready to receive data.

In other words, MB-SMF is used to handle MBS session-level management while SMF performs per-UE MBS session management, e.g. authorization, multicast session information provisioning, managing 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery.\nIn general the proposal is based on the additional identifier (i.e. identifier of the broadcast MBS service) provided by AF during MBS session Create procedure. The identifier of the broadcast MBS service is non-PLMN specific, which would be included and the same when AF sends requests for establishing the broadcast MBS session for the same broadcast MBS service to different PLMNs. The MB-SMF includes the received identifier in the N2 MB-SM container, and provided to NG-RAN node. Figure 6.2.2.1-1 demonstrates an example of the proposal.\nThe MOCN network utilizes additional identifiers to share resources, as depicted in Figure 6.2.2.1-1. This feature allows for efficient resource allocation and management, enabling the network to scale and adapt to changing demands.\nFigure 6.2.2.1-1: MOCN network sharing using additional identifier\nIt is assumed that for the MBS sessions identified by the same \"identifier of the broadcast MBS service\", the NG-RAN node will use the same radio resources, but still broadcast the TMGIs for different PLMNs. In other words:\n-\tUE: UEs of different PLMNs behave the same as Rel-17, i.e. listen to the control channel of the TMGIs broadcasted by the NG-RAN node and receive the broadcast data.\n-\tNG-RAN node: NG-RAN node behave the same as Rel-17, i.e. broadcasts the TMGIs of different PLMNs, but the NG-RAN node also use the same radio resources for transmitting the MBS data of different TMGIs but with the same \"identifier of the broadcast MBS service\".\nThe Identifier of the broadcast MBS service is used to denote the broadcast communication service. When creating the MBS session, the AF may additionally include the Identifier in the MBS session create request message. For the same broadcast communication service but transmitted in different PLMNs, the Identifier will be the same.\nThe Identifier of the broadcast MBS service is non-PLMN specific, it is used for globally identify the broadcast service data at the NG-RAN node. The Identifier is in the form of IP addresses, which is the target IP address and optionally includes the source IP address. The source IP address is the source IP address of the data provider, e.g. the address of the AS, and the target IP address can be the destination IP address of the broadcast data, which might be the IP multicast address.\nEditor´s note:\tIt is ffs how a unique identifier can be provided if different AFs act as data source against different core networks.\nIt is proposed to not change the Uu interface for the MOCN scenario, i.e. MCCH/MTCH mechanisms defined by Rel-17 are reused. The sharing NG-RAN node uses the same radio resources for the data transmission, since the data service will be the same between/among different PLMNs.\nNOTE:\tThe above-mentioned parts needs confirmation by the RAN WGs.\n",

The multicast session management include following procedures:\n-\tMBS session activation, the group-based CN paging may be executed. If a UE in RRC-INACTIVE state is allowed to receive multicast data in that state, a paging reaction is not always needed due to it may not need to resume the RRC connection for receiving the MBS data. But paging reaction for other group member UE, which are in RRC-IDLE state or which need to receive the MBS data in the RRC connected state, is still needed.\n-\tMulticast session deactivation/multicast session update, no impact to the existing procedure as defined in TS 23.247 [4].

As defined in TS 23.247 [4] Paging reaction is needed for all UE as they all need go back to CM-CONNECTED with RRC-CONNECTED state.\nPer above consideration, it is suggested to focus on how to page UE due to the MBS session activation and MBS session release. The intention is to avoid RRC-INACTIVE group member UE, which supports receiving multicast service in RRC-inactive state, always resume the RRC connection blindly if the paging event is for activation and MBS session data can be received in RRC-INACTIVE state.\nEditor's note:\tPaging procedures are under remit of the RAN groups and any related enhancements need to be confirmed by RAN groups.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in initiating and terminating multicast sessions, including the use of multicast routing protocols, multicast routing tables, and multicast routing protocols. The figure provides a comprehensive overview of the process, highlighting the importance of multicast routing in ensuring efficient network communication.\nFigure 6.4.3.1-1: Multicast Session Activation/Release Procedure.\n1.\tUE joins the multicast MBS session via the procedure as defined in clause 7.2.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4].\n2.\tIn some cases, e.g. due to radio resource congestion, NG-RAN could move one or multiple multicast group member UEs to RRC-INACTIVE state and those UEs are still able to received multicast MBS data.\n3.\tThe multicast MBS session becomes inactive via the procedure as defined in clause 7.2.5.3 of TS 23.247 [4]. The group member UE can be moved to CM-IDLE or CM-Connected with RRC Connected/Inactive state.\n4.\tAfter some time, MB-SMF triggers the multicast session activation or multicast session release.\n5.\tMB-SMF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify to SMF(s), same as step 2 of clause 7.2.5.2 or step 1a of clause 7.2.2.3 of TS 23.247 [4], which also includes the MBS session status, i.e. activation or release, as event information. In addition the RRC-inactive reception assistance information, which assist NG-RAN to determine whether the MBS session is allowed to be received in RRC-inactive state, is also included.\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 1, 3-5 are same as the one defined in TS 23.247 [4].\n6.\tThe SMF includes the event information and RRC-inactive reception assistance information (if it is received) in Namf_MT_EnableGroupReachability Request to AMF. Other parameters in the Namf_MT_EnableGroupReachability Request to AMF are same as specified in TS 23.247 [4].\n7.\tIf AMF determines that there are UEs in CM-IDLE state among the UEs provided by the SMF in step 6, based on the event information received from SMF, the AMF includes the MBS session ID and a paging cause in the paging message sent to NG-RAN, the paging case is used to indicate the paging is for the received MBS event, e.g. MBS session activation and RRC-inactive state reception assistance information.\n8.\tThe NG-RAN performs the group paging by sending the MBS session ID and paging cause. If paging is for MBS session activation and allowed to be received in RRC-inactive state, the NG-RAN node determines for each cell whether transmission for RRC INACTIVE UE is enabled and includes a paging cause if RRC INACTIVE UE do not need go back to the RRC-CONNECTED state.\nFor RRC-inactive UE(s) that joined the MBS session and receive multicast service in RRC-INACTIVE state, if the UE(s) receives the group paging with the paging cause indicating that the paging is for MBS session activation for MBS session they are receiving and allowed to be received in RRC-inactive state, those UE(s) may remain in RRC-INACTIVE state and do not perform RRC connection resumption. Otherwise, e.g. group paging does not contain a paging cause, this UE sends RRC connection resumption message to NG-RAN.\nFor the UE(s) joined the MBS session and need receive multicast service in RRC-Connected state, the UE initiates the Service Request as usual.\n9.\tFor MBS session activation, steps 6-15 of clause 7.2.5.2 of TS 23.247 [4] is executed with the following difference:\n-\tFor the UE(s) joined the MBS session and allowed to receive multicast service in RRC-INACTIVE state, step 6-10 are skipped.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is to be decided by RAN WG on whether RAN initiated paging is needed or not. If the RAN initiated paging is needed, different paging cause can be included in the paging message for MBS session activation.\nFor MBS session release, steps 3-9 of clause 7.2.2.3 of TS 23.247 [4] is executed.\n",

And ARP of MBS QoS flow also be used by NG-RAN to determine whether or which MBS session can be put into RRC inactive, i.e. the member of multicast MBS session can be moved to RRC inactive state to receive the MBS data.\nEditor's note:\tWhether/how ARP of MBS Session QoS Flow can be used by NG-RAN in determining what UEs can be moved to RRC_INACTIVE is to be determined by NG-RAN.\nSo in addition to \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\", the QoS parameters, e.g. PER and ARP in the 5QI of MBS QoS flow can be used by NG-RAN to determine whether the MBS session can be sent to RRC Inactive state to receives the multicast MBS session data.\nNOTE 2:\tThe QoS parameters of MBS QoS flow is received by NG-RAN from MB-SMF during establishment of shared delivery.\nTo support differentiate the UEs involving in one multicast MBS sessions, the same mechanism can be used. During or after the UE join the multicast MBS session, the AF may provide the PER to SMF which can be used for the associated Qos flow. After the SMF receives the PER for the associated Qos flow, it replaces the PER in the mapped Qos parameters of the associated Qos flow. The PER in the 5QI and ARP of associated QoS flow can be used by NG-RAN to determine whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state to receives the multicast MBS session data. There are two possible method to provide the PER/ARP of associated QoS flow to SMF:\n-\tvia PCF, in the R17, the associated QoS flow is not visible in PCF. But for this feature, the AF need to provides the flow description (e. g, SSM), PER to PCF, and PCF provides the rule to SMF. According to flow information (e.g. SSM), the SMF know this is related to the associated Qos flow.\n-\tsimilar with UDM/UDR based solution, the AF provides the (PER/ARP and related UE list) for the MBS session to UDM/UDM. The SMF obtain these information.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the R18 SID FS_TRS_URLLC, the KI#4 \"How to enable an AF to explicitly provide PER to NEF/PCF\" enable the AF provides the PER to PCF.\nNOTE 4:\tThe UDM/UDR based solution can refer to solution 1. AF provides the PER, MBS session id, UE list, and UDM stores this information as a part of MBS subscription data, during External Parameter Provisioning procedures as defined in clause 6.4.2 of TS 23.247 [4].\nNOTE 5:\tThe NG-RAN can use the physical channel status load of the cell, or any other logic to determine whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state meanwhile meeting the QoS requirement of the multicast service. Decision based on the channel status is out of SA WG2 scope.\nEditor's note:\tRAN WGs need to confirm the proposed NG RAN node behaviour.\n",

A MOCN TMGI is allocated by one of the PLMNs and the MBS session identified by the MOCN TMGI is established only with the PLMN that has allocated the MOCN TMGI. The AF transmits the DL media stream to the PLMN that the MBS session was established. Therefore, the NG-RAN shared by the multiple PLMNs receives the DL media stream only from the 5GC of the PLMN that the MBS session was established and transmits the media stream by using the MOCN TMGI.\nFor the MOCN TMGI, a Shared PLMN ID needs to be created and used by the PLMNs sharing NG-RANs. All the MB-SMFs in the PLMNs sharing NG-RANs are configured with the Shared PLMN ID so that the MB-SMFs can allocate the MOCN TMGIs.

Live stream dramatically grows today, which also uses unicast transport. The video services provided by AF can not only be published by the content provider, but also can be published by users of the content provider dynamically. The consumer will not only be a receiver in today's video stream services, but also a participant to interact with the services, such as sending message to interact with the live stream salesperson, sending message when watching a video to share with all the viewers.\nIn most cases, the users visit the portal for requesting the content, and the AF holds most business logic for providing the services, e.g. the location related operations, the user authentication and authorization per the AF instead of the service, etc. And the service, in most cases, will contain multiple media streams that only part of the steams is demanded to be delivered via multicast transport. This business model is consistent for services provided by AF.\nIn order to use multicast transport for multicast streams of those services, the 5GC needs to identify the multicast data and uses multicast transport for the delivery and do not impact the AF service logic. And in order to not limiting the consumers based on the UE capability, the 5GC and AF needs to prepare unicast mode in case the UE does not support receiving data with multicast transport (this is out of the scope of this study).\nEditor's note:\tFurther explanation is required why the use cases in this clause cannot be addressed with Rel-17 MBS procedures.\nThe Rel-17 MBS AF may first request TMGIs (optional), creates the MBS session, and may provision the authorization information for allowing UEs to join (optional).\nThis solution provides a way for AF to deliver the traffic and knows who really joins the session for starting the interactive data exchange.\nEditor's note:\tMulticast traffic delivery is typically not started each time a user joins a session. The AF could also know that a user requested to join a session via the same application level interactions if the UE subsequently sends the join request as in Rel-17.\nThis solution is based on the unicast business model that UE requests service from AF and AF requests resources from 5GC both for unicast and multicast transport for different flows.\nEditor's note:\tFor unicast delivery no AF interactions are required unless sponsored connectivity or special QoS is envisioned.\nEditor's note:\tCompared to the Rel-17 interactions, sending separate join request for all UES may lead to far more signalling interactions between AF and network.\n",

The AF can send multiple MBS Session data in one tunnel, the 5GC distinguishes the multicast session based on the mapping between the packet filters and the MBS Session ID. The content delivery is requested by the UEs over application layer, and the AF handles the service logic.\nBesides service announcement, the content provider may use a portal, which is out of 3GPP scope, to publish the services, which may be dynamically published, e.g. a live stream arranged by a live streamer, a live interview for breaking news, etc. The user may visit the portal via an APP in the UE and request the content of an MBS service, which may be interactive MBS service, i.e. contains multicast service data and unicast service data. Although service announcement for MBS Session is supported, but currently most content providers still want to use web portal, which is consistent as unicast service announcement.\nEditor's note:\tRel-17 allows for application dependent service announcements.\nSimilar as unicast business model, the AF of the content provider sends the flow descriptions per UE, which includes different multicast services, to the 5GC for asking transport for the services, but the flow descriptions includes multicast information, which could be seen as AF proxies the UE join to 5GC.\nEditor's note:\tFor unicast delivery no AF interactions are typically required.\nEditor's note:\tFor multicast, flow description will not depend on the UE and it may be preferable to provide it only a single time for an MBS session to avoid duplicated signalling.\nThis procedure is for AF triggered MBS Session Join or Leave when dynamic PCC is deployed. If the transport network between the AF and the 5GC does not support multicast transport, pre-configured tunnel is used for delivering multicast data from the AF to the 5GC.\nThe figure depicts a 10x3 matrix with 2x2 cells, representing the AF triggered MBS Session management procedures with PCC. The matrix shows the steps and procedures for managing MBS sessions, including the use of PCC (Policy Control Channel).\nFigure 6.10.3.2-1: AF triggered MBS Session management procedures with PCC\n1.\tThe UE established a PDU Session as described in clause 7.2.1.2 of TS 23.247 [4], during the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the UE indicates the MBS capability to SMF. The content provider may use a portal to publish the services, which may be dynamically published, e.g. a live stream arranged by a live streamer, a live interview for breaking news, etc. The user may visit the portal via an APP in the UE and request the content of an MBS service or stops the content of an MBS service, which may be interactive MBS service, i.e. contains multicast service data and unicast service data. The APP sends UE address and the UDP port for receiving the multicast data to the AF.\nNOTE:\tIn case the UE has multiple PDU Sessions, the URSP in the UE needs to make sure that the APP uses the associated PDU Session for unicast traffic delivery.\n2-5.\tThe steps are same as described in clauses 4.15.6.6 and 4.15.6.6a of TS 23.502 [3], with following differences:\n-\tThe name of service operations exposed by NEF is different, and the flow description(s), if included, includes some packet filters that additionally contains IP multicast address to indicate that the data of the unicast flow can be alternatively sent via multicast (in case unicast transport is used, the network can know that it is for a multicast service), c.f. figure 6.10.3.1-1.\n-\tThe flow description(s) sent to PCF includes some packet filters that additionally contains IP multicast address.\n-\tIf the MBS Session has not been created, the steps 10-17 in clause 7.1.1.2 or steps 10-26 in clause 7.1.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4] are performed to create the MBS Session.\nIf the AF is in trust domain, the AF can perform steps 3, 5, and 11 directly.\n6.\tThe PCF invokes Policy Update Notify towards the SMF, which includes unicast QoS information and flow description(s) that additionally contains IP multicast address (i.e. multicast flow descriptions).\n7.\tThe SMF may initiate PDU Session Modification procedure for updating unicast QoS flows.\n8.\tMBS Session Join: For multicast flow creation, the steps 2-4 in clause 7.2.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4] are performed with following differences:\n-\tIf the authorization fails (feature level authorization is used for this procedure, i.e. whether the UE is allowed to use 5MBS or not based on subscription), go to step 10 and SMF indicates cause value to the PCF. The AF can use unicast transport for the multicast data delivery.\nMBS Session Leave: For multicast flow releasing, the steps 3-6 in clause 7.2.1.4 of TS 23.247 [4] are performed with following differences:\n-\tIf the MB-SMF does not serve the MBS Session any more (i.e. all SMFs unsubscribed the MBS Session Context Status), steps 6-8 in clause 7.1.1.4 or 7-11 in clause 7.1.1.5 of TS 23.247 [4] are performed to delete the MBS Session.\n9.\tMBS Session Join: For multicast QoS information creation, steps 5-12 described in clause 7.2.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4] are performed with following differences:\n-\tThe step 5 is Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer. If the MBS capability of UE is received and multicast streams are demanded, the SMF includes QoS rules for DL only in the N1 Message Container in step 5, which will include MBS Session ID as a parameter in the QoS rules for DL only. The QoS rules for DL only can be used by the UE to perform NATP, i.e. transfer the IP multicast address in the received multicast packets to the UE IP address, and to transfer the destination UDP port in the received multicast packets to the UDP port that the APP in the UE used to receive the data.\n-\tIf the MBS capability of UE is not received, the SMF does not include MBS Session related information in the N2 SM info send to NG-RAN (i.e. individual delivery is selected), as well as instructs the UPF to perform NATP as described in above bullet for the incoming multicast data of the MBS Session towards the UE (i.e. unicast mode is selected).\n-\tIf unicast QoS parameters are received in step 6, the SMF also update the unicast QoS flows during the PDU Session Modification procedure.\n-\tIf the UE denies the join, it can send a cause value to the SMF via PDU Session Modification Ack, and MBS session leave for the UE is triggered by the SMF then.\nMBS Session Leave: For multicast QoS information removal, steps 3-11 and 13 described in clause 7.2.2.2 of TS 23.247 [4] are performed with following differences:\n-\tThe step 7 is Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, and the SMF also update the unicast QoS flows during the PDU Session Modification procedure if unicast QoS flows need to be updated.\n10.\tThe SMF notifies the PCF.\n11.\tThe PCF Notifies the NEF with cause value related to MBS.\n12.\tThe NEF notifies the AF with the cause value. If the PCF does not support MBS (i.e. no corresponding cause value indicated), the corresponding unicast QoS flow will be established, the AF can use unicast transport for the multicast data delivery.\nThis procedure is for AF triggered MBS Session Join or Leave when dynamic PCC is not deployed. If the transport network between the AF and the 5GC does not support multicast transport, pre-configured tunnel is used for delivering multicast data from the AF to the 5GC.\nThe figure depicts a 10x3x3 grid matrix with 10x3x1 cells, representing the AF triggered MBS Session management procedures without PCC. The figure illustrates the process of managing session management in a 5G network, with the MBS (Mobile Base Station) acting as the central controller.

Before a content provider (CP) delivers content, its subscriber needs to firstly request the content by sending application level request (e.g. clicking the \"view\" link). Such framework doesn't take into consideration of the scale of the amount of subscribers.\nAs analysed by S2-2006311:\nif the requested content is real-time, popular, and high data rate (e.g. World Cup Soccer matches, American Football games or Chinese Spring Festival Gala), a huge number of viewers simultaneously watching will put a huge burden on the network service providers (SPs).\nAs more and more people watch content on their UEs, this will also impact MNOs because many duplicate copies of the same content will be delivered by the MNOs.\nOne way to resolve the large scale delivery of real-time high data rate content is to enable on-demand multicast MBS session management triggered by the AF.\nThe trigger by the AF for enabling the on-demand multicast MBS session management, can be further based on network analysis result. To this end, the AF or CP subscribes to or requests the network analytics information from the NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [10]. Based on the analytics information, e.g. Observed Service Experience analytics defined in clause 6.4 of TS 23.288 [10], the AF decides to set/update the multicast related service parameters.\nFor one AF session, the AF uses \"AF session with required QoS update\" procedure\" defined in clause 4.15.6.6a to provide multicast related service parameters, including a multicast indication which indicates that the service data flows of the AF session can be transmitted over a multicast MBS session identified by an MBS session ID, to the PCF via the NEF. Based on multicast related service parameters, the PCF provides the multicast service related policy in PCC rules to the SMF. Then the SMF decides to initiate a multicast MBS session join/establishment procedure based on the multicast service related policy.\nThe following procedures is on top of the procedures specified in clause 7.2.1.3 in TS 23.247 [4].\n",

The figure shows the network topology, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the group of users. The broadcast session is established using a broadcast protocol, which ensures that the message is delivered to all group members.\nFigure 6.13.3.2-1: Broadcast Session Establishment for Group message delivery\nThe procedure is based on clauses 7.3.1 and 7.1.1.1/7.1.1.2 of TS 23.247 [4], and clause 5 of TS 26.502 [11], the delta parts is highlighted at following:\n0.\tAF optionally requests the 5GC to allocate the TMGI, details see steps 1-6 of TS 23.247 [4].

Existing power saving mechanisms include MICO (Mobile Initiated Connection Only) mode, DRX (Discontinuous Reception), eDRX (Extended Discontinuous Reception).\nWhen an MBS Session data delivery is required (e.g. for software/firmware update) is required, service announcement is needed. The service announcement using MBS Session data delivery may not be efficient from the network perspective since the capability-limited devices are not expected to be awake throughout the day, but only infrequently. Furthermore, the capability-limited devices do not wake-up at the same time and they are not reachable while being in power saving mode.\nThis solution proposes to inform the capability-limited devices about a newly scheduled MBS Session data delivery during their wake-up periods when the devices are reachable. When MBS Session data delivery is required, the MBS Session data delivery time can be scheduled as follows:\n-\tWhen a new MBS delivery schedule for capability-limited devices become available, the network will send a service announcement to inform the UEs about the new schedule when they are reachable.\n-\tThe time interval from when MBS Session data delivery schedule is announced to when the first MBS Session data delivery as announced by that schedule will start can be shorter than the minimum power saving period of all capability-limited devices.\n-\tThe network may schedule multiple MBS deliveries.

Configuring Broadcast service and Multicast service for the same public safety service, and allow the UE to decide whether to receive the public safety MBS content via broadcast service if available, or multicast session.\nThe solution relies on GCS AS (MCX AS) activates MBS broadcast session in broadcast service areas where MBS capable UEs are or are expected to be located. For that, the GCS AS (MCX AS) shall use the MBS SAI(s) and/or cell id(s) information to construct the MBS broadcast area parameter. LMS will configure the LMC as defined in TS 23.280 [7] for the parameters to report and determine the \"granularity\" and \"frequency\" of location reports.\nNOTE\tThis solution requires that UEs provide accurate location reports to the GCS AS to enable the GCS AS to determine where UEs are concentrated. Those location reports require that UEs are in connected state and may lead to capacity bottlenecks. It is a trade-off between accuracy and frequency of the location reports and how fast switching between broadcast and multicast can be achieved.\nNOTE 1:\tThe use of GCS AS in reference to this solution refers to stage-2 procedures defined in TS 23.468 [12] and are used for public safety IMS procedures defined in SA6 specifications for GC-1/MCPTT-1 interface. The interface between GCS AS and 5GC is not restricted to be MB2 only. Possible enhancements to other interfaces e.g. xMB, Nmb8 and Nmb10 are possible.\nNOTE 2:\tThe term GCS AS is currently used in EPS only and not same in the context of this solution, the name to be used in 5GS only architecture is FFS.\nThe functional description of the solution is as follows:\n1.\tGCS AS requests to establish a Broadcast service in a \"Broadcast\" Service Area to 5GC via MBS Session Start for Broadcast procedure (see TS 23.247 [4] clause 7.3.1), where the Broadcast Service Area is an identified area where of concentrated large number of UEs.\n2.\tGCS AS also requests to establish a Multicast Service in a \"Multicast\" Service Area to 5GC via MBS Session Creation Procedure (see TS 23.247 [4] clause 7.1.1.2 or 7.1.1.3), where the Multicast Service Area is an identified area for Public Safety service that is larger than the Broadcast Service Area. Multicast and Broadcast service areas may overlap.\n3.\tGCS AS configures the UE with both the Multicast service information (with its respective MBS session ID/TMGI) and the Broadcast service information (with its respective MBS Session ID/TMGI) and indicates to the UE that they correspond to the same public safety service.

It shows the network topology, including the distribution of nodes, the number of nodes, and the number of services. The figure also includes the configuration of the GCS AS, such as the number of services, the number of nodes, and the number of services.\nFigure 6.16.2.1-1: GCS AS configuration of both Broadcast and Multicast Services\nFigure 6.16.2.1-1 shows the order of procedure execution for a GCS AS to provide a same public safety service via broadcast session in a specific service area and via Multicast session in a larger service area.\nNOTE:\tIn Figure 6.16.2.1-1 the 5GC CP (control plane) denotes for simplicity all transport 5GC NFs relevant to MBS procedures, e.g. MB-SMF, MB-PCF, SMF, AMF, NRF, etc.\n1.\tIn order to establish a Multicast session, the GCS AS initiates MBS Session Creation as defined in either clause 7.1.1.2 of TS 23.247 [4] (for case without PCC) or clause 7.1.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4] (for case with PCC). The GCS AS receives Multicast Session information.\n2.\tThe GCS AS may provide to UE(s) the Multicast session information necessary for the UE to join the Multicast session (i.e. TMGI for Multicast session).\n3.\tUE may trigger UE join and Session establishment procedure (see clause 7.2.1 of TS 23.247 [4]) using the TMGI for Multicast provided by GCS AS.\n4.\tWhen there is MBS data the GCS AS initiates MBS Session Activation for the Multicast TMGI (see clause 7.2.5.2 of TS 23.247 [4]). Step 4 may occur in parallel with steps 5 to 7.\n5.\tThe GCS AS may decide to establish a Broadcast session in a specific service area, e.g. based on UE reports in GC1/MCPTT-1 interface and detection of large number of UE receiving the same public safety service in a same area.\n6.\tBased on the decision of step 5, the GCS AS initiates MBS session start for broadcast procedure as defined in TS 23.247 [4] for a Broadcast TMGI.\n7.\tThe GCS AS provides to UEs the information for broadcast reception, including the TMGI allocated for the Broadcast session.\n8.\tA UE that has received both the Broadcast session information (including TMGI for Broadcast session) and Multicast session information (including TMGI for Multicast session) for the same service, determines whether to receive the public safety data via broadcast session or multicast session.\n8.a.\tIf the UE detects that the Broadcast session is available, UE enables reception of Broadcast for the TMGI allocated for the broadcast session, and if already joined ignores reception of Multicast internally. The UE may ignore a paging with the TMGI allocated for the Multicast session.\n8.b.\tIf the UE does not detect that Broadcast session is available, and the UE joined the multicast MBS session in step 3, when it receives paging during MBS session activation for the TMGI allocated for Multicast, the UE follows the behaviour defined in clause 7.2.5 of TS 23.247 [4].\nWhen a UE that is receiving public safety data via Broadcast session detects that it has moved to a cell that is not providing the broadcast session i.e. the UE detects it has stepped out of the Broadcast service data or if NG-RAN based suspension and resumption is used the related multicast radio bearer is \"resumed\", the UE proceeds as follows:\n1.\tIf the UE had not joined yet the corresponding Multicast session, the UE triggers MBS join and Session establishment procedure (see clause 7.2.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4]) using the TMGI allocated for Multicast session.\n2.\tIf the UE had already joined the corresponding Multicast session, the UE follows the procedures defined in TS 23.247 [4].\nWhen a UE that is receiving public safety data via Multicast session detects that it has moved to a cell that is providing the broadcast session, i.e. the UE detects it has stepped inside of the Broadcast service area, the UE proceeds as follows:\n1.\tWhile the UE is in CM-CONNECTED receiving the Multicast data, the UE should maintain this Multicast reception if still available. This avoids ping pongs when the UE steps in and out of the Broadcast service area.\n2.\tFollowing a CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE transition, the UE may decide to receive public safety data via Broadcast session, e.g. at next Broadcast Session Start.\nThe UE based option for switching from multicast reception to broadcast reception assumes that the same content is provided in the same cell using both multicast and broadcast delivery modes.\nIn the case of congestion in multicast session, the related Multicast Radio Bearer (MRB) may also be 'suspended' by NG-RAN and the UE becomes aware using AS signalling.\nFor example, the UE may receive an explicit indication broadcast from the NG-RAN (similar to what is defined for E-UTRAN in MBMS Scheduling Information in TS 36.300 [15] and TS 36.321 [16]), where it is informed that transmission for the multicast MBS bearer is going to be, or has been, suspended or using other mechanisms decided by RAN.\nEditor's note:\tThe details of the AS procedures e.g. whether these are the only possible procedures or other procedures can be considered will be decided in RAN WGs.\nThe procedure used by the UE in these scenarios is depicted in figure 6.16.2.3b-1.\nThe figure depicts a switching MBS delivery scenario in a 5G network, where the bearer suspension by NG-RAN results in a switch to broadcast mode. The figure illustrates the process of switching MBS delivery to broadcast mode, highlighting the importance of maintaining network reliability and performance during such scenarios.\nFigure 6.16.2.3b-1: Switching MBS Delivery to Broadcast following bearer suspension by NG-RAN\n1.\tThe UE has an ongoing group communication using MBS multicast mode.\n2.\tThe GCS AS decides to set up the Broadcast Delivery path for the downlink data for this service following the procedure in clause 7.3.1 of TS 23.247 [4].\n3.\tNG-RAN (e.g. after detecting MBS congestion) decides to suspend one or more MBS bearer(s) (based on e.g. the ARP and/or on the counting results for the corresponding MBS service(s)), and trigger the migration of impacted UEs to receive DL data MBS broadcast mode, by some AS signalling.\nFor example, explicitly informing those UEs that the MBS bearer has been, or is going to be, suspended by broadcasting an indication similar to what is defined for E-UTRAN in MBMS Scheduling Information in TS 36.300 [15] and TS 36.321 [16], or using other mechanism decided by RAN.\nNOTE 1:\tThe decision of suspend in NG-RAN is independent with the broadcast session start from GCS AS, if NG-RAN suspends the MRB based on RAN congestion situation, while the broadcast MBS session hasn't been started by AF based on AF counting, it will cause service interruption for those joined UEs.\n4.\tThe UE detects the suspension of the corresponding MBS bearer service, but continues to monitor for MBS Multicast mode delivery.\n5.\tThe UE receives DL data by broadcast delivery and continues to monitor for resumption of the MBS bearer. RAN removes the radio resources for the \"suspended\" MBS bearer(s).\nNOTE 2:\tUE receiving \"suspend\" signalling for the MBS bearer does not affect the UEs RRC state. For example, if the UE is RRC_CONNECTED for other unicast services, continues to be in RRC_CONNECTED and switches to RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE based on existing RAN triggers.\nNOTE 3:\tThe data associated with the suspended MBS bearer continues to be delivered by the GCS AS on the corresponding multicast transport infrastructure towards NG-RAN (e.g. because it is still delivered via MBS in non-congested cells). This also allows a quicker resumption of the MBMS service when congestion is over.\n",

This solution focuses on the optimization on group paging, which may help group call setup time.\nWhen the MBS session activation request is received, AMF understands the multicast MBS session is activated. The AMF sends group paging request to MBS supporting NG-RAN nodes and individual paging request for non-MBS supporting NG-RAN nodes for those joined CM-IDLE UEs in the AMF. Usually, the MBS session activation request will reach the AMF prior to the enable group reachability request. In case the enable group reachability request reaches the AMF before the MBS session activation request, AMF can also trigger the group paging and individual paging. The AMF triggers paging once for one multicast MBS session activation procedure. The enable group reachability request or MBS session activation request received afterwards will not trigger the paging again.\nNOTE 1:\tRRC_Inactive UEs will be paged using the typically quicker MBS session activation request. They will also not need to send a service request and will thus not benefit from this solution in most cases.\nNG-RAN triggers RAN paging based on MBS session activation request, which is supported in Rel-17.\nEditor's note:\tIt is up to RAN WG to determine whether RAN paging can be performed upon receiving group paging request, if the MBS session activation request has not been received.\nIn this way, CM-IDLE UEs and CM-CONNECTED UEs with RRC_INACTIVE state can be notified for the multicast MBS session activation as early as possible.\nWhen multicast MBS session is activated, NG-RAN is expected to provide a method for those CM-CONNECTED UEs with RRC_INACTIVE state to enable them to receive multicast MBS session data without being RRC-CONNECTED.\nEditor's note:\tIt is up to RAN WG to determine how the method can provided (e.g. NG-RAN updates SIBx/MCCH) when the multicast MBS session is activated.\nWhen CM-CONNECTED UEs with RRC_INACTIVE state are notified by the RAN paging, they can utilize the method provided by NG-RAN or locally stored RRC configuration which was configured by NG-RAN before, to receive the multicast MBS session data, in parallel with sending RRC RESUME to the network.\nEditor's note:\tIt is up to RAN WG to determine whether RRC RESUME is needed for RRC_INACTIVE UE to receive the MBS data.\nAs AMF maintains CM-IDLE UEs which join the multicast MBS session, it may constantly prepare the group paging information to avoid the processing of UE list included in enable group reachability request, before sending the group paging request. Besides benefits of earlier notification, this solution further minimizes the number of the group paging signals between the AMF and the NG-RANs. Regardless the number of involved SMFs, the AMF only needs to send at most one group paging request to each NG-RAN node for one multicast MBS session. However, compared to the subsequent per-UE service request, the number of saved messages is not significant.\nNOTE 2: \tIt requires that SMFs provide UE join/leave information outside N2SM information.\nNOTE 3:\t\tThe constant preparation of group paging information requires the additional processing for UE CM state changes, when multicast MBS session is inactive.\nNOTE 4:\tThe AMF needs to maintain backward compatibility with Rel-17 SMFs that will not provide information about the MBS session for the AMF. And for those Rel-17 SMFs, the AMF has to rely on the provided UE list from them for group paging.\nNOTE 5:\tIn mixed deployments with Rel-17 AMFs and/ or SMFs, the benefit of signalling reductions is not much.\n",

It is assumed that each such AMF only stores MBS session IDs and UE join information for the UEs it serves.  Different AMFs also store information about the MBS session (MBS session ID and involver RAN nodes) when the shared delivery is established. Thus different information about the same multicast session may reside on multiple AMFs.

The paging will be requested from each involved AMF once per MBS session activation procedure. A RAN node can receive paging request from multiple AMFs. A possible enable group reachability request or MBS session activation request received afterwards at the AMF from a different SMF will not trigger the paging again.\nNOTE 1:\tConsidering the service request handling contribute most of the latency for those CM-IDLE UEs, the early notification does not bring significant improvement on the group call setup time. However, the improved paging mechanism can reduce the signalling load between the AMF and the NG-RANs effectively depending on how much SMF serving this MBS session.\nIn step 11, to utilize MBS session activation request to trigger paging in the AMF, the MB-SMF needs to provide the MBS activation information to the AMF outside the N2 container.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 11 to 14 are required to reach those RAN nodes handling CM-CONNECTED UEs (including both RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_INACTIVE states).\nEditor's note:\tIt is up to RAN WG to determine whether RAN paging can be performed upon receiving group paging request in step 5, if the MBS session activation request has not been received.\nNG-RAN provide a method to allow UEs to receive multicast MBS session data without being RRC-CONNECTED:\n-\tAfter step 12, NG-RAN needs to provide a method for those CM-CONNECTED UEs with RRC_INACTIVE state to enable them to receive multicast MBS session data without being RRC-CONNECTED.\nEditor's note:\tIt is up to RAN WG to determine whether and how the method can provided (e.g. NG-RAN updates SIBx/MCCH) when the multicast MBS session is activated.\nUE receives multicast MBS Session data without being RRC-CONNECTED\n-\tThe CM-CONNECTED UE with RRC_INACTIVE state is notified by CN-Paging in step 5 (if share the same Paging Occasion) or RAN-Paging in step 12.

The group member UE can be moved to any state (i.e. CM-IDLE or CM-Connected with RRC Connected/Inactive state).\n4.\tAfter some time, MB-SMF triggers the multicast session activation or multicast session release.\n5.\tMB-SMF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify to SMF(s), same as step 2 of clause 7.2.5.2 or step 1a of clause 7.2.2.3 of TS 23.247 [4], which also includes the MBS session status, i.e. activation or release.\nNOTE:\tSteps 1, 3-5 are same as the one defined in TS 23.247 [4].\n6.\tBased on the event information, the SMF determines whether the event is for MBS session activation or MBS session release. The SMF invokes Namf_MT_EnableGroupReachability Request to AMF as specified in TS 23.247 [4].\nEditor's note:\tWhether SMF needs to know that the function that RRC-INACTIVE UE can receive the MBS data is supported or not is FFS.\n7.\tThe AMF determines that there are UEs in CM-IDLE state among the UEs provided by the SMF in step 6, and triggers group paging as specified in TS 23.247 [4].\nEditor's note:\t When group paging for CM-IDLE UE is performed, whether/how the RRC_INACTIVE UE(s) sharing the same PO will respond and whether related signalling extensions are required is to be decided by RAN WGs.\n8.\tThe NG-RAN performs the group paging by sending the MBS session ID.\nEditor's note:\tHow to handle RRC-inactive UE(s) that joined the MBS session and is able to receive multicast service in RRC-INACTIVE state is to be determined by RAN WGs.\nEditor's note:\tIt needs to be confirmed that RRC-INACTIVE UEs also listen to the paging for RRC IDLE UEs, and not only to RAN paging.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether and how UEs, NG-RAN nodes, or AMF also need to consider the transmission mode used in the cell where the UEs are comping to decide whether they can remain in RRC-INACTIVE state.\nFor the UE(s) joined the MBS session and need receive multicast service in RRC-Connected state, the handling specified in TS 23.247 [4] will apply.\n9.\tFor MBS session activation, steps 6-15 of clause 7.2.5.2 of TS 23.247 [4] applies.\nEditor's note:\tAfter receive step 12 in clause 7.2.5.2 of TS 23.247 [4], it is to be determined by RAN WGs whether the NG-RAN need page the UE if the UE is in RRC Inactive state.\nEditor's note:\tAfter receive step 12 in clause 7.2.5.2 of TS 23.247 [4], it needs clarify the behaviour of RRC-inactive UE after it receives the group paging of the related MBS session ID, e.g. whether it is allowed the UE to be aware it can receive the MBS data in RRC inactive state.\nFor MBS session release, steps 3-9 of clause 7.2.2.3 of TS 23.247 [4] is not executed as for UEs without activated UP, the SMF does not trigger message to the AMF, instead the SMF marks that the UE is to be informed of the MBS Session release. In this case, the SMF initiates PDU Session Modification to inform the UE of the MBS Session release at next UP activation of the associated PDU Session, if needed.\n",

Their location is thus not known at cell level. At the moment only the RAN node serving a UE is aware that it is participating in an MBS multicast session. Additional RAN nodes not handling RRC connected UEs within the multicast session but within RAN notification areas of those UEs may need to be made aware of the multicast session and perform procedures for the multicast session, such as deciding whether to deliver data for the MBS session and choosing the delivery mode, transmitting data of the multicast session and managing the related the shared delivery path.\nEditor's note:\tRelated procedures need to be defined by RAN WGs. It also needs to be studied by RAN WGs whether it is possible to determine the presence of inactive UEs that desire to receive a multicast session in a cell. and whether and how a RAN can decide whether to deliver multicast data in cells without RRC connected UEs. Whether additional RAN nodes not handling RRC connected UEs within the multicast session need to be made aware of the multicast session and perform procedures for the multicast session needs to be decided by RAN WGs.\nRAN nodes not serving any connected UEs in the MBS sessions may thus need to be aware of the MBS session. This solution describes two option to accomplish that with CN impacts:\nOption A: RAN nodes inform their peers serving parts of RAN notification areas of UEs in an MBS session about the MBS session. The peer RAN nodes request assistance information from the CN via shared delivery establishment.\nOption B: The MB-SMF informs all RAN nodes in a service area of an MBS session via the AMF about the MBS session\nEditor's note:\tThe RAN-centric option A is in scope of RAN WGs to a large extent. Whether this option is selected thus depends on RAN WGs.\nEditor's note:\tHow the NG-RAN node determines transmission at one cell is not needed due to no UE camped at that cell need be solved by RAN WG.As service areas are optional for multicast MBS sessions, all RAN nodes in a PLMN are possible affected by Option B.\nNOTE 1:\tIt may be preferable to only inform RAN nodes within RAN paging areas.\nRRC_inactive UEs can move to cells where the transmission mode for RRC connected state is applied and then need to transition to the RRC connected state to receive MBS data.\nThe current MBS session activation procedures use paging for the MBS session and trigger RRC-inactive UEs to transition to RRC-connected state. For the delivery mode for RRC_inactive reception, RRC-inactive UEs should be made aware that the MBS multicast session is activated but remain in RRC-inactive state for multicast data reception.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is not assumed all the RAN node within the same RNA area have the same capability and choose the same delivery mode.\nEditor's note:\tThis assumption needs to be confirmed by RAN WGs. Procedures to support UEs that move between cells with different delivery mode need to be agreed by RAN WGs.\n",

The figure illustrates the MBS session start, which is a crucial component of the radio access network (RAN) sharing process. The MBS session start is initiated by the MBS (Mobile Base Station) and is used to establish a connection with the MOCN (Mobile Core Network) for the purpose of broadcasting. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, highlighting the importance of this step in the RAN sharing process.\nFigure 6.24.3.3-1: Existing MBS Session Start for Broadcast for MOCN RAN sharing (as in clause 7.3.1 of TS 23.247 [4])\nThe following modifications apply compared to clause 7.3.1 of TS 23.247 [4] when MBS Session Start for the second and later broadcast MBS sessions:\n1.\tEach PLMN needs to allocate the TMGIs based on the specific service-ids or ranges of service-ids. For example, MB-SMF of operator A allocates service-id=123456 and MB-SMF of operator B service-id=001234. This can happen in different ways:\na)\tNEF/MBSF will need to pass the afID defined in Nnef_TMGI_Allocate to MB-SMF using Nmbsmf_TMGI_Allocate (i.e. afID needs to be added in TS 29.532 [17]) and therefore allow MB-SMF to have a \"policy\" in TMGI allocation based on identification of AF. The afID is currently encoded in \"string\" format according to TS 29.522 [18], and it needs to provide enough information (e.g. indicating specific content) to NEF/MBSF in order to allocate the TMGI according to the required \"policy\".\nb)\tMB-SMF can delegate a TMGI range to NEF to allocate for that purpose and keep the afID so it can assign based on some policy\nc)\t(if MBSF is used) MB-SMF can delegate a TMGI range to MBSF to allocate for that purpose and it can assign the TMGI based on some \"policy\" depending on the identification of AF\nEditor's note:\tWhether the afID will be provided to MB-SMF will be coordinate with CT WG4.\nNo changes required in steps 2-8.\n9.\tSince NG-RAN is configured with the list of the associated specific service-ids or ranges of service-ids of the TMGIs of each RAN sharing partner whose content has been delivered over the air, the NG-RAN propagates the TMGI for the new PLMN for which the second or later broadcast session is established.\nFor example, if the service-id=123456 (for operator A) and service-id=001234 (for operator B) corresponds to content from \"TV channel X\" and MCCH already advertised TMGI= 123456 234 15, it also adds in MCCH TMGI= 001234 234 10.\nNG-RAN configures the same MTCH for both TMGIs.\nThe UE from operator B, having received the service announcement is able to read the TMGI (001234 234 10) and receive the content.\n15.\tSince NG-RAN understands the broadcast MBS Session is associated with another Broadcast MBS Session identified by the corresponding TMGI whose content has been delivered over the air, the NG-RAN can silently drop packets received in this broadcast MBS session, and do not deliver them again.\nEditor's note:\tDetails will be confirmed by the RAN WGs.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether NG-RAN should avoid establishing UP resources for the second and later broadcast MBS sessions for more saving.\nThe figure depicts a session release for a Broadcast for MOCN RAN sharing, which is a key component of the MOCN RAN architecture.

This requires that many such UEs transition to RRC-inactive state. On the other hand there are requirements for short reaction times for floor control requests and some participants in an MBS session may be so frequent talkers that a very frequent transition between RRC-Connected state and RRC_INACTIVE state would burden the network, and it is thus desirable to keep such UEs in RRC_CONNECTED state.\nFor UEs in one or several MBS sessions, AF identifies UEs that should be kept in connected state, e.g. UEs of likely talkers in an MBS session such as dispatchers for public safety, and provides this information to CN as assistance information. The AF does this via Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create/Update service operations (see clause 4.15.6.2 of TS 23.502 [3]). The NEF only accepts related requests from authorized trusted AFs, e.g. related to public safety.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether AF can identify UEs to be kept in RRC_CONNECTED state or AF should provide priority information (which may cooperate with solutions for KI#1) for NG-RAN to determine RRC states.\nAF may use configuration or frequency of floor requests received from UE as criterion to select UEs and should only keep a small fractions of the UEs participating in an MBS session with many participants in connected state.\nEditor's note:\tDetails how the AF selects a small fraction of UEs will need to be studied by SA6.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the AF selects an excessive number of UEs for the connected state, this will limit the number of UEs that can receive an MBS multicast session and will also negatively impact the overall admission control of a RAN node. AF should remove information that UEs shall always be connected when related MBS session(s) end. The AF may also remove MBS UEs while the session is inactive for longer periods.\nEditor's note:\tSpecifications under the SA6 remit might require updates to ensure that AF to remove information when related MBS session(s) ends.  This requires collaboration with SA6\nNEF stores in UDM users that preferably shall be kept connected. The NEF may restrict the number of UEs that an AF is allowed to suggest for connected state by rejecting requests with the number of UEs exceeding a preconfigured limit.\nEditor's note:\tIt is to be clarified how the preconfigured limit can be determined in NEF.\nFor each indicated UE, the UDM stores as part of the UE subscription data that user shall preferably be kept connected\nSMFs are notified about changes in UE subscription data based on previous subscription or inquire UE subscription data when PDU session is being established. This includes information that user shall preferably be kept connected.\nSMF provides the information that UE shall preferably be kept connected as part of the SM management information via AMF to NG RAN node handling the user.\nNG RAN nodes should keep UE for which such information was received and that are participating in at least one active multicast MBS session in RRC and CM connected state and may select to move other UEs to RRC Inactive or CM idle states if experiencing higher load, as long as this is feasible in its admission control.\nNOTE 2:\tThe RAN does not need check whether the UE is participating in any MBS sessions, as the AF is expected to only select UEs in MBS sessions.\nEditor's note:\tHow the RRC state is handled is to be determined by RAN WGs.\nAs an additional improvement, UEs do not send \"listener reports\" while in MBS service area and in RRC inactive mode. Listener reports can become a problem in particular for UEs close to cell border moving frequently between cells.\nEditor's note:\tCoordination with SA6 is required on the implication that UEs do not send \"listener reports\" while in MBS service area and in RRC inactive mode.\n",

If step 1-6 has not been executed before, the AF may provide a SSM or it may request that the network allocates an identifier for the MBS session (i.e. TMGI). The AF provides the service type (i.e. either multicast service or broadcast service). MBS session information may further include QoS requirements and Any UE indication (indicating whether a multicast MBS session is \"open to any UEs\"), MBS service area, start and end time of the MBS session and MBS session state (Active/Inactive). In addition, MBS information may also indicate whether the allocation of an ingress transport address is requested.\nIf geographical area information or civic address information was provided by the AF as MBS service area, NEF/MBSF translates the MBS service area to Cell ID list or TAI list.\nFor broadcast communication, the AF may determine MBS FSA ID(s) for the Broadcast MBS session based on business agreements and include them in the description of the MBS session\nFor multicast MBS Session, the AF may provide a list of UEs that are to be differentiated (or prioritized) and those UEs are represented by GPSI.\n. . .\n11.\tNEF/MBSF sends Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Create Request (MBS Session ID, service type, TMGI allocation indication, MBS service area information, ingress transport address request indication) to MB-SMF, to request MB-SMF to reserve ingress resources for a MBS distribution session, The NEF/MBSF provides MBS Session ID or request allocation of a TMGI, and indicate the requested service type (either multicast service or broadcast service) and MBS session state (Active/Inactive). It also indicates that the allocation of an ingress transport address is requested if this was requested in step 8, or if the MBSF decides to insert an MBSTF into the user plane for the MBS session. The request also includes the Any UE indication if provided in step 8.\nThe MBS service area is provided by NEF/MBSF to the MB-SMF if provided by the AF in step 8.\nMBS FSA ID(s) are provided by NEF/MBSF to the MB-SMF if provided by the AF in step 8.\nIf requested to do so, or if a source specific multicast is provided as MBS Session ID in step 11, the MB-SMF allocates a TMGI.\nFor broadcast communication, if no MBS FSA ID(s) have been received, the MB-SMF selects MBS FSA ID(s) for the Broadcast MBS session based on local configuration.\nFor multicast MBS Session, the NEF/MBSF forward to the MB-SMF the list of UEs that are to be differentiated (or prioritized) if provided by the AF.\nIn the existing procedure in clause 7.2.1.3 of TS 23.247 [4], there is following enhancement (enhancement text in bold):\n3.\t[Conditional] For each MBS session in step 1, if the SMF has not subscribed to the MBS Session Context, it invokes Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe request (MBS Session ID) towards the MB-SMF to subscribe to events notifications related to the multicast MBS session and to request information about the MBS Session Context. The MB-SMF responds with the information about the indicated multicast MBS session in Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe response (multicast QoS flow information (e.g. QoS profile(s) for the multicast MBS session), [start time], [session state (Active/Inactive)], [Any UE indication], [multicast DL tunnel info], [List of prioritized UEs]).\nIf it is the first time for the MB-SMF to receive Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe request of the indicated MBS Session from any SMF, the MB-SMF learns it is the first UE joining the multicast MBS session. For multicast transport between MB-UPF and content provider, if it is the first UE joining the multicast MBS session, and MB-UPF has not joined the multicast tree in the MBS session creation procedure, described in clause 7.1.1, the MB-SMF requests the MB-UPF to join the multicast tree towards the AF/MBSF, otherwise MB-SMF will not send the request to the MB-UPF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MB-SMF can answer the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe request either based on information received in the MBS session creation procedures in clause 7.1.1 or based on preconfigured information. The pre-configuration also includes information about the MBS session stored in the NRF. If the MB-SMF uses preconfigured information, the pre-configuration also includes MB-UPF configuration.\n4.\tThe SMF determines whether the user is authorized to join the Multicast MBS session taking into account the MBS subscription data received from the UDM and the Any UE indication if received from the MB-SMF. The SMF considers the UE as authorized to the Multicast MBS session if the UE is authorized to use multicast MBS services, and if the MBS Session ID(s) in the PDU Session Modification Request is included in the MBS subscription data or Any UE indication is received. If authorization check fails, the SMF rejects the join request with a cause value. If a UE joins prior to the start time of the multicast MBS session, the SMF may accept the join request and indicate to the UE the start time, or it may reject the join request with an appropriate error cause and optionally a back-off timer. If a UE joins while the multicast MBS session is inactive, the SMF accepts the join request.\n5.\tIf the join request is accepted, the SMF responds to the AMF through Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, MBS Session ID, [updated PDU Session information], [mapping information between unicast QoS flow(s) and multicast QoS flow (s)], [assistant information of UE differentiation/prioritization]), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command)) to:\n-\tcreate an MBS Session Context for the indicated MBS session in the RAN, if it does not exist in the RAN already; and\n-\tinform the NG-RAN about the relation between the Multicast MBS Session Context and the UE's PDU Session context by including the MBS Session ID and the mapping between the multicast QoS flow(s) and associated QoS flow(s).\n-\tInform NG-RAN the assistant information of UE differentiation (or prioritization).\nBased on operator policy, the SMF may prepare for 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery fall-back. The SMF maps the received QoS information of the multicast QoS Flow into PDU Session's unicast QoS Flow information, and includes the information of the QoS Flows and the mapping information about the QoS Flows (termed \"associated QoS flow information\") in the SM information sent to RAN. The SMF compares the QFIs of the multicast QoS Flows received from the MB-SMF with QFIs in use for the PDU Session and assigns unused QFIs to the PDU Session's unicast QoS Flows corresponding to multicast QoS Flows.\n. . .\n6.\tThe N2 message, which includes the MBS Session ID(s) the UE has joined and, if applicable, associated QoS Flow, is sent to the NG-RAN. The N2 message may also include information whether the UE is differentiated/prioritized to assist the NG-RAN when deciding what UEs can be sent to RRC_INACTIVE and continue receiving MBS data.\nIf the MBS is supported by NG-RAN, 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery is adopted. If the MBS is not supported by NG-RAN, 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is used if the PDU Session's unicast QoS Flow include QoS Flows for the multicast session.\nIf the NG-RAN supports MBS, the NG-RAN uses the MBS Session ID to determine that the PDU Session identified by the PDU Session ID is associated with the indicated multicast MBS session.\nIf the NG-RAN supports MBS, the associated unicast QoS flow information, if provided, is not used to allocate the radio resource and CN resource for corresponding QoS flows.\nNOTE 6:\tUE join request via PDU Session signalling will fail if NG-RAN rejects the PDU Session Resource setup request (e.g. due to the number of UEs reaching a limit).\n",

However, details are left to SMF implementation.\nThe present solution avoids the need for an AF to establish the multicast session and fills related gaps that are left to implementation in Rel-17. It allows to have preconfigured policies for such on-demand multicast sessions. It allows to determine whether to establish a multicast session towards the radio based on the number/frequency/location of join requests.\nThe present solution enables that an MBS session for an external IP multicast session is established:\n(a)\teither when the first UE within the PLMN request to join that IP multicast session; or\n(b) when multiple UE within the same PLMN have requested to join that IP multicast session\nNOTE 1:\tWhether Option (b) is required and its merits will be further discussed as part of the evaluation.\nThe present solution also enables UEs to receive data from an IP multicast session even if the network does not establish the multicast session towards the radio:\nOperators may want to enable UEs to join an external IP multicast session via a normal PDU session while not setting up an MBS session in their network. An application on the UE would likely send IGMP join requests to join such external IP multicast sessions. As discussed in Rel-17, this IGMP join request in the user plane will likely be converted to CP join request by the UE protocol stack. If that join request is rejected, the UE is not able to join a multicast session at all. To enable a UE to join, a user plane join request would need to be generated by the UPF, and the UPF also needs to be configured to forward received related multicast packets to the UE. (Even if a UPF receives a UP IP join request and forwards the request, the UE would not receive related multicast packets without special UPF procedures or configuration to forward them.)\nOne could also consider a decentral solution to enable UEs to join an external IP multicast session where each SMF configures the related UPF separately. However, this complicates a subsequent full establishment of an MBS session for the multicast IP session and also makes it hard for an operator to observe that there are many UEs joining the same external IP multicast session. The immediate assignment of an MB-SMF and MB-UPF is meant to enable a subsequent conversion to a full IP multicast session and also provides means to monitor whether many UEs join an external multicast session.\nEditor's note:\tMore clarification and evaluation is required on the benefits of applying individual delivery versus immediately establishing the MBS session towards the radio as in the Rel-17 existing mechanisms, especially in the scenario of the second bullet above.\nThis solution focuses on IP multicast sessions (using the IGMP protocol for joining and source specific multicast addresses as identifiers) provided by an application server in the internet that does not directly interact with the 5GS. It enables the 5GS to dynamically detects that many UEs join the same IP multicast sessions and based on that set up a related MBS multicast session to save transmission resources.\nThe following related issues need to be resolved:\n-\tHow to enable UEs to join multicast IP sessions if no related MBS session exists in the network.\n-\tHow to detect that multiple UEs join the same multicast IP session (possibly at high rate or in proximity to each other).\n-\tHow to establish a related on-demand MBS session based on the detection.\n-\tHow to inform the UEs to join the on-demand MBS session established in step 3.\nNOTE 2:\tThis solutions is only applicable if a source specific IP multicast address is used as MBS session ID.\nNOTE 3:\tThis solutions allows that QoS for a multicast session is preconfigured by the operator, e.g. based on a SLA with a service provider. If there is no such preconfigured information, only a default QoS will be provided for the 5MBS session.\nNOTE 4:\tOnly CP join requests are supported. IP applications on the UE can either use that join method, or the protocol stack in the UE can convert IGMP join requests to CP join requests.\n",

Based on operator policy, the MB-SMF may immediately establish the MBS session towards the radio when the first UE joins or wait until more UEs join the join request for a source specific IP multicast address.\nIf the MB-SMF decides to accept the join request, the MB-SMF registers itself at the NRF as handling the source specific multicast address, and configures the MB-UPF to send an IGMP join request for the source specific IP multicast address towards the external network and to receive related data, irrespective of whether it decides whether to establish the MBS session towards the radio.\nIf the MB-SMF decides not to accept the join request, the SMF rejects the join request.\nIf the MB-SMF decides to establish the MBS session towards the radio, normal MBS multicast procedures apply from that point onwards.\nIf the MB-SMF decides not to establish the MBS session towards the radio, the SMF also informs the MB-SMF about subsequent join request for the same IP multicast request until the MB-SMF decides to establish the multicast session towards the radio.\nIf the MBS session is not to be established towards the radio, the SMF does not add MBS session information to the PDU session but still accepts the join request.

In Rel-17 it was assumed that a UE would only send join request in the control plane signalling. It was anticipated that the protocol stack in the UE could recognise IGMP join requests in the user plane and convert them to control plane join requests. An MB-SMF that it is informed about a join attempt for an IP SSMA with no related MBS session and decides not to establish the MBS session configures the MB-UPF to send an IGMP join request.\n",

In Sol#3, the use case is targeted to public safety only and assuming that the private IP address of the UE is available (as in IMS case). The assistant information is provided via PCF.\nSolution#6: Proposes that existing \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\", and the existing QoS parameters, e.g. PER in the 5QI and ARP of MBS QoS flow can be used by NG-RAN to determine whether the receiving of the multicast MBS session data in RRC inactive state can be enabled and whether UEs can be sent to RRC Inactive state to receive the multicast MBS session data.\nSolution#26: (Solution covers both KI#1 and KI#6) AF indicates for some UEs recommended (that may be part of one or multiple MBS sessions) should to be kept in RRC_Connected state. The indication is independent of an MBS session.\nSolution#27: (Solution covers both KI#1 and KI#6) This solution proposes that AF sends a list of privileged UEs in MBS Session creation. This solution requires that the AF be aware of the UEs’ GPSI. This solution does not depend on PCC deployment.\nComparison of the solutions with assistance information:\nPer MBS session assistance information\nSolution #1 proposes to have explicit assistance information (MBS priority and/or recommendation whether to enable inactive MBS reception to be used to decide which MBS sessions can be allowed RRC_Inactive reception). Solution #6 proposes that the existing QoS parameters, e.g. PER and ARP in the 5QI of MBS QoS flow can be used to support the NG-RAN to decide which MBS can be allowed RRC_Inactive reception. Whereas solution #6 advocates that that the existing QoS parameters, e.g. PER and ARP in the 5QI of MBS QoS flow is sufficient and can be used to support the NG-RAN to decide which MBS can be allowed RRC_Inactive reception.\nPer UE assistance information.\nSolution #1 proposes a UE session priority as assistance information to enable RAN to decide which UEs in the MBS session can be switched to RRC_Inactive state. Solution #3 and solution #27 also suggest that some UEs within an MBS session can be marked as privileged to assist NG RAN to decide which UEs should be kept in RRC_Connected state. Solution#26 proposes that a recommendation can be provided for some UEs that they should be kept in RRC_Connected state; this recommendation is not linked to an MBS session. In all those solutions, it is assumed that an AF provides the related information. Most of the solutions also address key issue 6 as a typical use case could be that a public safety AF has knowledge of privileged or frequently talking users. For such users frequent state transitions between RRC_Connected and RRC_Inactive state can in this manner be avoided.\nOnly solution 1 suggest multiple priority levels.\nSolutions 26 has the advantage that it is well suited for users in multiple MBS sessions (as dispatcher for public safety) and that it avoids possible conflicting state recommendations obtained for the same user via different MBS sessions. If the UE is different role in different MBS session, the AF need coordinate the UE role in different MBS session and depending on which MBS session is in activate state, the AF may need give different information to 5GC.\nThe signalling procedure for the AF to provide the information also differ: Solutions 27 extends the MBS session create procedure. Solution 3 extends AF session with required QoS Create procedure and assumes that the information is propagated via the PCF to the SMF. Solution 26 extends the parameter provisioning procedure.\nFor UE level assistance information, one proposal (solution 6) is to reflect the UE level assistance information via the QoS information of associated QoS flow. This solution assumes that whether the UE can be moved into RRC Inactive state depend on the UE QoS requirement, i.e. RRC Inactive UE has lower QoS requirement because there is no HARQ.\nParameter provision procedure\nFor the MBS session level assistance information, it seems the only way to transmit from AF to 5GC is via the MBS session creation procedure.\nSol#1/#26 propose the AF provides the parameter (list of UE) (same as solution 1 as part of the MBS subscription data) to the UDM.  When the UE joins the MBS session, the SMF fetches the data from UDM, which include the related UE level assistance information. The difference between two solutions is on whether this UE level assistance information is per MBS session or per UE granularity. As mentioned in Sol#26 if the UE level assistance information is per UE level, AF needs to consider whether the related MBS session is in active or inactive state and update the UDM accordingly. However, if this information is per MBS session level, this additional update per MBS session state is not needed. If the UE joins multi MBS session, at the NG-RAN side it may receive different UE level assistance information from different MBS session. NG-RAN nodes need to reconcile the information, e.g. it can take the highest request, e.g. whether the UE level assistance information in one of the MBS session prefer to be in CONNECTED state, as input parameter to decide whether it need keep in Connected state.\nSol#1 and Sol#26 (if Sol#26 is updated to be associated with MBS Session), requires the AF to perform Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create/Update procedure after the MBS Session in created.\nSol#3/#6 propose the AF provides the parameter as part of the QoS information to the PCF and SMF gets the related information during the SM policy association establishment/update procedure. By doing this, the deployment of PCF is mandatory. The AF cannot inject the related information before the UE activates the associated PDU session. Also this update need be done per UE granularity, i.e. for a list of UE, the AF needs to update one by one per UE.\nSol#27 proposes the AF provides the parameter (list of UE) as one parameter during the MBS session creation procedure. The MB-SMF store the received list of UE information. The MB-SMF provides full list of the UE information to all contacted SMF(s). It is possible that some prioritized UEs in the list are not handled by an SMF (if those UEs have not joined yet, or joined in other SMF(s)), and in case the list of UEs is changed, the MB-SMF needs to notify all SMF(s) involved in this MBS session.\nFor the MBS session level assistance information, it is better to be conveyed as other MBS session information parameter, e.g. QoS information. Then it is proposed to be delivered to NG-RAN node as part of the shared delivery tunnel establishment procedure.\nFor the UE level assistance information, all solution proposes to use the PDU session level signaling to deliver the parameter to the NG-RAN node.\n",

If paging is for MBS session activation, the NG-RAN node determines for each cell whether transmission for RRC INACTIVE UE is enabled and includes a paging cause if RRC INACTIVE UE do not need go back to the RRC-CONNECTED state.\nSolution#18: Unlike Solution#4 (where paging cause is used), solution#18 proposes that no paging cause is required for MBS Session activation. It follows existing Rel 17 paging procedures. It also proposes that, for releasing of MBS session, RRC IDLE UEs (without active UP) get notified by SMF only when they reconnect using PDU Session Modification procedure. In case RRC_INACTIVE UE happens to share the same PO with any of the IDLE UEs and responds to paging, the RRC_INACTIVE UE will be brought back to RRC_CONNECTED.\nEditor's note\tWhether the RRC_INACTIVE UE need be aware the group paging is CN initiated or RAN initiated is FFS.\nSolution#19: Existing MBS session activation procedures are used from CN towards RAN nodes. RAN nodes in RNA inform each other about MBS session activation. RRC-Inactive UE in cell shall remain RRC-inactive during MBS session activation when related delivery mode is used in that cell. RAN groups will determine related signalling.\nSolution#22: NG-RAN node keeps the multicast MBS session context and N3mb shared tunnel for the multicast MBS session as long as the NG-RAN has UE context for UEs in the MBS session context which may be in either RRC-CONNECED or RRC_INACTIVE state. (this seems existing REl-17 behaviour) Because of this, when the MBS session is (re-)activated, it should page only RRC_Idle UEs and need not page RRC_Inactive UEs (group paging is not needed).\nSolution#23: Suggests using CN paging also for RRC_Inactive UES. The paging area includes all the registration areas of those UE in CM-IDLE mode, and NG-RAN node where the CM-Connected mode UE(s) is camping. Unclear what the benefits compared to RAN paging would be are quite debatable.\nComparison of the solutions focusing on Activation/Release:\nOn how to efficiently page RRC_Inactive UEs during activation MBS session\nAll the four solutions (#4, #18, #22, #23), propose group CN paging for RRC_Idle UEs. However, they differ in the way they handle the RRC_Inactive UEs.The overall view by all the solution are,\n-\tFor activation, only RRC_Idle UEs should go to RRC_Connected state (after paging) and RRC_Inactive UEs should not switch to RRC_Connected state.\n-\tWhile Sol#4 proposes to include paging cause to not let RRC_Inactive UEs to switch to RRC_Connected state, sol#18 does not use paging cause. Not including the paging cause may allow RRC_Inactive UEs switch to Connected state.\n-\tSolution #22 proposes that only RRC_Idle UEs should be group CN paged. And for RRC_Inactive UEs, the NG-RAN node keeps the multicast MBS session context and N3mb shared tunnel for the multicast MBS session and when the service is re-activated and there are UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, the NG-RAN needs to notify the UEs of this activation. But they fail to explain that without using RAN paging how NG-RAN node can notify UEs.\n-\tSolution 23 proposes that AMF will page all the NG-RAN where there are CM_Idle UEs. For RRC_Inactive UEs, NG-RAN will use RAN paging. However, it is unclear that how RRC_Inactive UEs will react to CN paging.\nOn how to efficiently page RRC_Inactive UEs during release of MBS session\nOnly solutions #4 and #18 talks about paging for release of MBS session. In Sol #18, the Rel-17 solution is assumed how RRC_Inactive UEs can be notified about the release of the MBS session, solution #4 states that RRC_Inactive UEs to be paged to go to RRC_Connected state for release of the MBS session.\nNOTE: Whether/how RRC_INACTIVE UEs behave when group paging for CM-IDLE UE(s) is performed is to be determined by RAN WG(s).\nOn whether the solution can able to differentiate between RRC_Inactive MBS UEs than RRC_Idle MBS UEs?\nOnly solution #4 is proposing to have differentiated paging (with paging cause included) for RRC_Inactive UEs. Because, in case RRC_INACTIVE UE happens to share the same paging occasions with any of the IDLE UEs and responds to paging, the RRC_INACTIVE UE will be brought back to RRC_CONNECTED, which should be avoided.\n",

This solution describes two options to accomplish:\ni)\tsource RAN informs serving/target RAN about MBS;\nii)\tMB-SMF informs all RAN nodes in a service area.\nRRC_inactive UEs can move to cells where the transmission mode for RRC connected state is applied and then need to transition to the RRC connected state to receive MBS data.

The UE performs the RNA update procedure as specified in the R17, if it moves outside RNA. If UE moves out of RA, the UE initiates mobility registration after the RNA update procedure fails. This solution proposes that RAN nodes in the same RNA area may receive the MBS data from one RAN node or multiple RAN nodes which have established the shared delivery tunnel.\nComparison of the solutions focusing on Mobility:\nOn how to manage RRC_Inactive UEs continuation of MBS data Outside RNA.\nMost of the solutions propose to use RNA update procedure by the UE when it moves outside RNA. Solutions #20 and #28 propose to use mobility registration procedure when UE moves outside RA.

                    "text_content": "Soln #2, #7. #8, #9, #24 and #29 are proposed to address Key Issue #2: 5MBS MOCN Network Sharing.\nSoln#2 proposes a solution of providing an additional identifier by the AF towards the MB-SMF when creating MBS sessions. The MB-SMF passes it to the NG-RANs. Based on the additional identifier, the shared NG-RAN can understand multiple Broadcast MBS sessions are transferring the same content and deliver packets from one session over the air.\nSoln#7 proposes to use associated session ID to be passed from the AF to NG-RANs via 5GCs, to enable shared NG-RAN to associate multiple Broadcast MBS sessions. The shared NG-RAN associate multiple Broadcast MBS sessions and deliver packets from one session over the air. The associated session ID can be SSM or TMGI as two options. To further saving CN resources and NG-RAN processing efficiency, Soln#7 proposes to establish one user plane within those broadcast MBS sessions. In case there is a failure in the on-going user plane, shared NG-RAN will initiate the establishment of another user plane towards another 5GC.\nSoln#8 proposes to use MOCN TMGI to create one broadcast MBS session towards one 5GC for those shared NG-RANs, and if all NG-RANs under MBS service area are not shared, also create one broadcast MBS session towards each 5GC for each PLMN for those dedicated NG-RANs.\nSoln#9 proposes pass all the associated TMGIs from the AF towards the MB-SMF when creating MBS sessions. The MB-SMF pass the TMGI list to the NG-RANs. The NG-RAN selects the primary TMGI and return the primary TMGI and its usage area to the AF via the MB-SMF, so that AF can update service announcement to let UEs to understand the TMGIs and their corresponding usage area. To further saving CN resources and NG-RAN processing efficiency, Soln#9 also proposes not to establish the user plane in case the TMGI of the broadcast MBS session is not the primary TMGI.\nSoln#24 proposes to configure the associated TMGIs in NG-RANs, so that shared NG-RAN can associate multiple broadcast MBS sessions and delivery the content of one broadcast MBS session over the air.\nSoln#29 proposes to use the same TMGI to create broadcast MBS sessions towards each 5GC together with a MOCN signalling flag to differentiate from normal broadcast MBS sessions. Soln#29 also proposes to establish one user plane within those broadcast MBS sessions. In case there is a failure, shared NG-RAN will initiate the establishment of another user plane towards another 5GC.\nThe evaluation can be performed from the following aspects:\nWhether the solution can enable shared NG-RAN to optimize radio resource utilization for MOCN network sharing deployment?\nThese criteria can be used to evaluate whether the solution can address KI#2.\nSoln#2 and Soln#7 introduce additional identifier and associated session ID to be provided by the AF. The AF provide it to the MB-SMF in MBS session creation. The MB-SMF passes it to the NG-RANs, so that shared NG-RAN can bring data from one broadcast MBS session over the air.\nSoln#8 proposes to create only one broadcast MBS session towards shared NG-RAN, so the shared NG-RAN will only deliver the data from this broadcast MBS session over the air.\nSoln#9 passes all the relevant TMGIs to the NG-RAN, so that shared NG-RAN will select the primary TMGI and deliver the data from the broadcast MBS session identified by the primary TMGI.\nSoln#24 configures the associated TMGIs in NG-RANs, so that shared NG-RAN can bring data from one broadcast MBS session over the air.\nSoln#29 proposes to create broadcast MBS sessions with the same TMGI and additional MOCN signalling flag, so that the shared NG-RAN can determine and bring one broadcast MBS session over the air.\nAll those solutions can address KI#2.\nWhether the solution can be applied to any deployments?\nIn MOCN network sharing deployment, it is possible that not all NG-RAN nodes are shared. There may be some NG-RAN nodes dedicated to specific PLMN which connected to the corresponding 5GC. The assumption that all NG-RAN nodes are shared in MOCN network sharing deployment cannot be made.\nIn Soln#2, Soln#7, Soln#9, Soln#24 and Soln#29, AF creates each broadcast MBS session separately, so that the shared NG-RAN will receive multiple broadcast session setup requests and offer the service, while the dedicated NG-RAN will receive only the corresponding broadcast session setup request to offer the service.\nIn Soln#8, AF creates one broadcast MBS session towards one 5GC for those shared NG-RAN nodes, and if all NG-RAN nodes under MBS service area are not shared, creates one broadcast MBS session towards each 5GC for those dedicated NG-RAN nodes.\nWhether extra efforts are needed when introducing a new MBS service?\nTo introduce a new MBS service (e.g. a TV channel), it is important to evaluate whether extra efforts are needed.\nIn Soln#2, Soln#7, Soln#8 and Soln#29, AF can perform TMGI allocation and broadcast MBS session creation as in Rel-17. Soln#9 requires all relevant TMGIs to be allocated prior to the broadcast MBS session creation, which are minor implications on the AF. For those solutions, the new MBS service can be introduced by the invoking Nmbsmf or Nmbsf APIs, without additional efforts.\nSoln#24 requires the coordination of the O&M configuration in NG-RANs (provision relevant TMGIs) and service operation (TMGI allocation and broadcast MBS session creation). The O&M configuration is done prior to TMGI allocation, since the TMGI belongs on a pre-agreed service-id range amongst the participating PLMNs. For example, if PLMNs with MCC=234, MNC=15 (operator A) and MCC=234, MNC=10 (operator B) are doing MBS RAN sharing, the corresponding RAN nodes are already configured with the PLMN-ids of each of the sharing partner and can be configured with the specific respective service-id (6 digits numbers) of the TMGIs of two PLMNs that correspond to the same content or even range of service-ids. For instance, service-id=123456 (for operator A) and service-id=001234 (for operator B) corresponds to content from \"TV channel X\".\nFor all solutions, prior to introducing new MBS services, the configuration in all shared NG-RANs need to be done beforehand.\nHow many TMGIs are advertised by a shared NG-RAN?\nThe number of TMGIs advertised will cause some impacts on the radio resource efficiency.\nSoln#2, Soln#7 SSM option and Soln#24 propose to have all the relevant TMGIs advertised, and those TMGIs point to the same radio resource for broadcast data delivery. Soln#7 TMGI option only has one TMGI advertised.\nSoln#8 only has one MOCN TMGI advertised.\nSoln#9 only has the selected primary TMGI advertised.\nSoln#29 only has one common TMGI advertised.\nIs it backward compatible (service announcement impacted)?\nThe backward compatibility is an important aspect in the evaluation. If the solution is backward compatible, it can benefit Rel-17 UEs to work in the optimized way. All the solutions are backward compatible in radio interface, but some are not in the service announcement.\nIn Soln#2, Soln#7 SSM option and Soln#24, there are no impacts on service announcement. Each UE will get the service announcement with its own TMGI with the PLMN ID it belongs to. In Soln#29 and Soln#7 TMGI option, each UE will get the service announcement with a common TMGI, which may have different PLMN ID from its network.\nIn Soln#8, there are no impacts on service announcement as well. Each UE may get the one service announcement with MOCN TMGI and another one with its own TMGI (i.e. TMGI dedicated to PLMN) if all NG-RAN nodes under MBS service area are not shared.\nIn Soln#9, AF needs to consolidate the information it receives from all shared NG-RANs and include TMGIs with their usage area in service announcement.\nHow UE receives broadcast MBS session data?\nThe complexity of the UE logic is not negligible.\nIn Soln#2, Soln#7 SSM option and Soln#24, a UE can receive the broadcast MBS session data with its own TMGI, as indicated in the service announcement. In Soln#29 and Soln#7 TMGI option, a UE receives the broadcast MBS session data with a common TMGI in the service announcement.\nIn Soln#8, each UE may use the MOCN TMGI or its own TMGI to receive the broadcast MBS session data, depends on whether it is served by a shared NG-RAN or dedicated NG-RAN.\nNOTE:\tWhen the UE receives Service Announcement including MOCN TMGI and Service Announcement including its own TMGI (i.e. TMGI dedicated to the PLMN) for same service from the AF, the service layer (e.g. 5MBS client, MC service client) or the application layer of the UE needs to be able to understand the MOCN TMGI and its own TMGI are for same service based on the information in the service announcements, e.g. SDP info with IP multicast address and port#, Service ID, and UE needs to be able to switch the listening TMGI when moving to the new cell without broadcasting the currently used TMGI. However, the lower layer does not have to be aware that these two TMGIs are for same service.\nIn Soln#9, a UE needs to determine its location and find the appropriate TMGI to be used. And then, it can use the selected TMGI to receive broadcast MBS session data.\nIs the solution resource efficient in CN and NG-RAN processing?\nFor those multiple broadcast MBS sessions, only the packets delivered over one broadcast MBS session will be used. The packets over other broadcast MBS sessions will be dropped, which wastes not only 5GC transportation resource, but also NG-RAN processing resource.\nSoln#2 and Soln#24 propose to establish all user planes which improves the service reliability, but less resource efficient.\nSoln#7, Soln#9 and Soln#29 propose to establish one user plane across those broadcast MBS sessions. In case the on-going one fails, NG-RAN initiates the establishment of another user plane, to improve the service reliability. In this approach, there will be some additional service interruption time for the user plane re-establishment (from MB-UPF to NG-RAN). However, compared with the error detection period, the additional user plane establishment period is small.\nIn Soln#8, each NG-RAN has only one broadcast MBS session. Note that there is a trade-off between \"resource efficient in CN and NG-RAN processing\" and \"the efforts to re-establish the shared tunnel when currently used N3mb tunnel is released\". Having multiple shared tunnels could be beneficial for that case.\nAre there signalling impact in 5GC and NG-RAN?\nAll solutions require service operation update provided by MB-SMF, as it is a new feature to be introduced. Some solutions avoid signalling impact in 5GC and NG-RAN, while some require.\nSoln#2 and Soln#7 require an additional identifier (associate session ID) to be passed from the AF to NG-RAN via 5GC. Soln#9 requires the complete TMGI list to be passed. Soln#29 requires a MOCN signalling flag to be passed and the TMGI in use may have different PLMN ID.\nEditor's note:\tIt is to be confirmed by RAN WGs whether a shared NG-RAN can use a TMGI with a different PLMN ID which is not shared PLMN ID.\nSoln#8 requires MB-SMF return shared MBS service area to AF, but there is no signalling impact in 5GC and NG-RAN.\nSoln#24 avoids the signalling impact by the configuration in NG-RAN. However, depends on the alternatives to be chosen, it may require TMGI allocation to be delegated to NEF or MBSF.\nTable 7.2-1 illustrate the comparison of the solutions for KI#2 5MBS MOCN Network Sharing.\nTable 7.2-1: Comparison of solutions for KI#2 5MBS MOCN Network Sharing\n\nBesides those criteria mentioned above, some other issues shall also need to be taken into consideration:\nWhether AF can release MBS sessions flexibly?\nIt is possible for the AF to request to trigger the MBS session deletion procedure for one or several PLMNs after a while.\nSoln#2 and Soln#7 SSM option use extra ID to identify the service, therefore the release of one PLMN will not affect other PLMNs. Soln#24 assumes the relationship is pre-configured therefore releasing will not affect others as well.\nSoln#8, Soln#29, and Soln#7 TMGI option propose to use MOCN TMGI (or same TMGI). However, a TMGI can be allocated and released separately from an MBS session, and thus the MOCN TMGI (or same TMGI) must be kept not deallocated when the MBS session towards this PLMN is stopped, if it is still in use by other PLMNs.\nSoln#9 proposes to pass all the associated TMGIs from the AF towards the MB-SMF when creating MBS sessions. When releasing the broadcast MBS session for one PLMN, the MBS session context of the PLMNs needs to be updated as well, which requires further clarification. Or the AF must keep holding the associated TMGIs till all relevant MBS sessions are released.\nWhether the solution can be compatible with pre Rel-18 NG-RANs?\nWith the compatibility of pre Rel-18 NG-RANs, operators can deploy the MBS service freely. Otherwise, the optimization developed for KI#2 cannot be applied, until all the NG-RAN nodes are upgraded.\nIn Soln#2, Soln#7 SSM Option and Soln#9, the additional information (associated session ID, TMGI list) is sent to NG-RAN as an optional parameter. Pre Rel-18 NG-RANs will ignore the parameter and continue to establish the broadcast MBS sessions in legacy way. The optimization will not be applied to pre Rel-18 NG-RANs, i.e. the same MBS content will be broadcasted several times over the air interface. However, the Soln#9 brings additional requirements on AF to construct the mapping of the primary TMGI and the usage area manually.\nIn Soln#24, no additional information needs to be passed to NG-RAN, and thus pre Rel-18 NG-RANs could work naturally.\nIn Soln#8 uses MOCN TMGI and native TMGI to separately target different NG-RAN nodes. There are no issues for dedicated pre Rel-18 NG-RANs, but for those shared pre Rel-18 NG-RANs, the MOCN TMGI may not be supported.\nSoln#29 assumes the TMGI from one certain PLMN as the common TMGI and uses it as the TMGI together with the MOCN signalling to create broadcast MBS sessions in all of the PLMNs requested by the AF. The MCC/MNC (i.e. PLMN ID) field of the common TMGI can be different from the current PLMN about to establish the broadcast MBS session, and there is no standardized requirement to check those fields or not. A dedicated pre Rel-18 NG-RAN nodes could not support the TMGI if it checks the MCC/MNC. There are different views on whether Rel-17 will be affected and whether the proprietary behavior can be ruled out. Depending on implementation, a shared pre Rel-18 NG-RAN node may only accept the first broadcast MBS session, while reject the later ones with the same TMGI. A shared pre Rel-18 NG-RAN node may accept all broadcast session setup requests with the same TMGI and only store the MBS session context of the latest one. However, the UEs from all PLMNs will be able to receive the MBS session using that TMGI and the MBS data will only be transmitted a single time.\nSoln#7 TMGI option also uses a common TMGI to be associated session ID. Pre Rel-18 NG-RANs will ignore it and continue to establish the broadcast MBS sessions using the native TMGI (the TMGI in MBS session ID). The broadcast MBS session establishment and content delivery work in the legacy way. However, it also requires AF to use native TMGI in service announcement, which leads to the similar service announcement issue as Soln#8 (multiple TMGIs are provided to the UE for the same MBS service).\n",

After the PCF informs SMF (with including the MBS session ID), the residual parts are similar as current defined procedure in TS 23.247 [4] with the following additions: 1) inform the MBS session to the UE via NAS and UE may further perform NATP for the received multicast data, and 2) associate the unicast flow and multicast data to further perform NATP by UPF for pre Rel-18 UE.\n-\tSolution #11 proposes to reuse 4.15.6.6a, and includes MBS session ID to inform the PCF the MBS session that a certain UE wants to join. After the PCF informs SMF (with including the MBS session ID), the residual parts are similar as current defined procedure in TS 23.247 [4].

Based on operator policy, the MB-SMF may immediately establish the MBS session towards the radio when the first UE joins or wait until more UEs join. If the former, then this is Rel-17 solution, and if the latter, it is still to be clarified that is the benefit of applying individual delivery, instead of shared delivery when the first UE(s) join the MBS session.\nSolutions #10 and #11 have a substantial number of unresolved issues.\nEditor's note:\tThe advantages of enabling an AF to request the core network to add users to an MBS session compared to the Rel-17 procedures where the AF invites UEs via service announcement and then the UEs request to join the session are FSS.\nFrom the perspective of impact to 5GC, Solution #10 has the same part as solution #11 with the addition that the 5GC configures the NATP in UE, and optionally SMF uses individual delivery for pre Rel-18 UEs, and UPF performs NATP for them. Solution #11 requires AF provide the MBS session ID, and PCF initiate SM Policy Association Modification procedure with including MBS session ID.\nBoth Solution #10 and Solution #11 enhance the \"AF session with required QoS update procedure.\nCompared to solutions #10 and #11, solution #30 addresses a different use case and thus also proposes entirely different procedures, mainly enhancements to the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusSubscribe and Nmbsmf_MBSSession_ContextStatusNotify procedures between MB-SMF and SMF.\n",

The solutions described in Soln#12 and Soln#13 contain the delivery of the group message, as well as the cancel and the modification of the group message, which are required from group message handling perspective. There are no contradictions between those two solutions.\nFor the Transport-Only Mode, Soln#13 expects the reliability of the group message delivery to be implemented in the AF, and 5GC provides a transparent delivery bearer. In Transport-Only Mode, AF can interact with the MB-SMF/MB-UPF directly without the involvement of the NEF, which is supported in Rel-17. There are no additional benefits needs to include the NEF besides the existing exposure functionality (i.e. utilize the service operations defined for group message). Furthermore, the reliability delivery handling in AF does not fully take the advantage of the MBS. It increases the complexity of the AF implementation and requires each AF to implement the logic of reliable delivery, while such reliable delivery logic has already been offered by 5GC.\nIt is an alternative option to let the NEF packetize the received group message and deliver packets to the MB-UPF. However, without service layer protection, the UEs are not able to deal with any errors during the transmission (e.g. packet loss, packet disorder, etc.). And it is not appropriate to introduce service layer protection to the NEF.\nSoln#13 points out the solution shall be re-used for general group message delivery purposes (not limited to MTC devices), which align with the proposal in group message delivery solution in eMBMS.\nSoln#13 further include the area which does not support MBS in the response message towards the AF. Even though this function is not tightly coupled with group message solution, it could benefit the AF and hide the deployment complexity towards the AF. The solution proposes that the AF can then deliver data to UEs outside the area via unicast, but the AF will in some cases not be aware of the UE location\n",

For example, Solution#14 also suggest to keep UE connected for a while in the middle of an MBS data transfer.\nIn fact the main idea of DRX level control and SDP level control are not against each other, they are, on the other hand, the complementary solutions and therefore can be adopted at the same time. In addition, Solution #25, option 1 also proposes to make use of service announcement to convey the knowledge of session start/end time of the MBS session. Solution #25 option 2 proposes to provide such information via NAS message to UEs in the MBS session and is therefore suited for multicast MBS service.\nSolution 25 Option 2 enables data transmission at times which are not known when the service announcement is performed.\nFor solution #25:\n-\tThe idea of \"periodic or one time transmission\" is to use the start time , which is already part of MBS session context, and provide the start time to the UE either via PDU Session Modification or service announcement, and 5GC triggers the session activation based on the start time.\nThis solution has impact on AF, MB-SMF, SMF and UE. The activation and deactivation of an MBS session is a prerequisite for Rel-17 UEs to enter IDLE state when no data transmission is ongoing.\n-\tThe idea of \"Deferred activation\" is another alternative to provide the time information, i.e. AF provides the wake-up time to 5GC whenever needed, and such information will be provided to UE via individual paging. The proposal uses session activation and provides the MBS information to UE by the AMF. The UEs start to receive MBS data at the configured times.\tFrom system impact perspective, the AMF is not supposed to be involved in the UE’s handling of MBS Session whenever possible (due to the SMF-centric multicast solution chosen in Rel-17), however the new procedure of NAS Transfer in Figure 6.25.3.2-1 is not aligned with that principle.\n\n",

                    "text_content": "Editor's note:\tIt may need to be revised, depending on the conclusion of the updated solution and new solutions.\nSolution #3, #16, #17, #20, #26 and #31 are proposed to address Key Issue #6: Improvement for potential performance issues related to high numbers of public safety UEs.\nBelow is a short summary of the solutions:\nSolution #3 proposes a solution to enable the AF to provide the group member information to NG-RANs via 5GC, which could be utilized by NG-RAN as assistance information when deciding which UEs can be sent to RRC_INACTIVE when needed. The assistance information is provided via PCF.\nSolution #16 proposes a solution to enable AF to offer public safety service via broadcast and/or multicast sessions, which allows the UE to decide whether to receive the public safety MBS content via broadcast MBS Session if available, and/or multicast session.\nSolution #17 proposes a solution to enable AMF to become aware of the list of UEs that has joined a MBS sessions and get the UE list ready for group paging. When requested, the AMF trigger group paging without having to going through the UE list.\nSolution #20 proposes to allow the UE to request multicast MBS session join/leave during mobility registration update procedure, by including the associated PDU session status and the multicast session information container in the Registration Request message. The UE can be in CM-IDLE state or in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state.\nSolution #26 proposes a solution to let AF provide information to 5GC (via parameter provisioning interface) and then to NG-RAN that a UEs should stay in RRC_CONNECTED. It also contains proposals to reduce the cell load for public safety UEs by reducing the amount of Listener Reports. However, it is to be clarified how the Listener Reports are to be reduced.\nSolution #31 proposes that the NG-RAN indicates the resource allocation failure (which can be per slice to the UE and then the UE reports the failure towards the AF which may take further action, e.g. releasing low priority group communications which is using the MBS, switching the group call to broadcast MBS session.\nFollowing is a detailed evaluation of the solutions:\nSolution #3:\nThis solution enables an AF to provide group member information (e.g. privileged or not) as part of the MBS session to assist NG-RAN when deciding which UEs can be sent to RRC_INACTIVE. As there are similar proposals only submitted for KI#1, this solution will be further evaluated in KI#1.\nSolution #26:\nThis solution also enables an AF to provide information about UEs recommended to be kept in RRC_Connected state. The information is provisioned independent of the MBS session and thus applied for privileged users participating in multiple MBS sessions. As there are similar proposals only submitted for KI#1, this aspect of the solution will be further evaluated in KI#1.\nThe solution also contains proposals to reduce the cell load for public safety UEs by reducing the amount of Listener Reports to avoid that UEs frequently need to transition to RRC-Connected state to send such reports This needs to be clarified and evaluated together with SA6.\nNOTE:\tIt is up to SA6 to determine if the amount of Listener Reports should be reduced and how it can be achieved, which is independent from SA2.Solution #20,\nThe solutions enables that the UE requests multicast MBS session join/leave during mobility registration update procedure. In addition to the associated PDU Session status, the multicast session information container is also included in the Registration Request message to indicate whether the UE wants to join or leave (e.g. due to triggers from the application layer) or remain joined in one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the PDU Session, so that:\n-\tthe multicast MBS session join/leave can be performed during the registration procedure.\n-\tthe network will not trigger multicast MBS session establishment towards the NG-RAN if the UE indicates leaving the multicast MBS session.\nConsidering UE(s) in RRC Idle or RRC Inactive state can join the multicast MBS session using mobility registration procedure, and then receive multicast data in RRC Inactive state, it will bring the benefits of less signalling interactions, time and radio resource consumption.\nUtilizing the mobility registration to indicate “join” or “leave”, it requires the conditions for mobility registration update are met when UE requests session join or leave (e.g. due to pending application layer request). Even if such possibility for one UE may be low, it would be beneficial considering the large number of UEs.\nSolution #16,\nThe intention is that AF starts a broadcast MBS session in some dense area and the UEs in that area receives MBS data via broadcast, and when moving out of broadcast coverage, UEs receives data via multicast.\nThe decision to suspend the MRB of multicast MBS session in NG-RAN is based on congestion situation in NG-RAN, and the decision of start broadcast session logic in GCS AS is based on the counting of UEs in a specific area. A possible misconfiguration is that in some areas, AF does not start the broadcast session, but NG-RAN suspends the MRB of the multicast session, which may require those joined UEs to fall back to unicast. It is also possible that in some areas, AF started the broadcast and NG-RAN keeps the MRB of the multicast session, which will cause double resource consumption.\nFurthermore, to start broadcast MBS session effectively, accurate and frequent location reports are required, which may also lead to capacity bottlenecks. There is a trade-off between accuracy and frequency of the location reports and how fast switching between broadcast and multicast can be achieved.\nSolution #17,\nThe intention is to shorten the group call setup time by letting the AMF be aware of UE join and get the list of UEs for group paging ready and constantly calculating the group paging area, which can avoid processing of the UE list when receiving enable group reachability requests. Whenever the multicast MBS session is activated, the AMF can trigger the group paging when receiving the first request (enable group reachability request or multicast session activation request). Furthermore, the AMF triggers a group paging for all the joined CM-IDLE UEs in the AMF, instead of trigging group paging per enable group reachability request. This solution is not intended to address the bottleneck in air interface.\nAs service request handling constitute most of the delay for a CM-IDLE UE in MBS session activation, Solution #17 can reduce the group call setup time but not significantly. The solution requires AMF constantly updates the group paging area for UE CM state change when MBS session is inactive. This requires the involved SMFs to include the joining/leaving message outside the N2SM information.\nAnother aspect, it may minimize the number of group paging requests from the AMF to the NG-RANs, which reduce the number of interactions between the AMF and the NG-RANs. If the frequency of multicast MBS session activation is low, the performance improvement will not be significant as well. Also, this depends on how many SMFs are involved in the MBS session, e.g. if there is only one SMF, the differences are not that much.\nSolution #31,\nThis solution enables the AF to take actions (e.g. releasing low priority group communications which is using the MBS, switching the group call to broadcast MBS session, by the NG-RAN informs the UEs of the resource allocation failure and then the UEs further informs the AF.\nIt is not clear how the solution works in MBS session activation procedure. It requires further explanation on whether such application-level feedback works when the cell is overloaded. And it is to be evaluated the benefits compared with the solution using the join failure event report from the UE to the AF which exist already.\n",

NG-RAN nodes take the responsibility to determine (e.g. during congestion) which UE(s) within an MBS multicast session will be moved from CM-CONNECTED with RRC CONNECTED to CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state and still receive MBS session data.\n-\tThe 5GC provides information about the MBS session as specified for Rel-17 and may provide additional assistance information to help NG-RAN to determine whether to apply delivery enabling reception by UEs in RRC_Inactive state for an MBS session and which UE(s) to be moved to RRC Inactive state.\n-\tThe assistance information may include recommendations whether to enable delivery for reception in RRC_Inactive state for an MBS session and information about UEs that should preferably be kept in RRC_Connected state, i.e. the MBS session level and UE level MBS assistance information, and may be provided by the AF to 5GC and then to NG-RAN.\n-\tFor MBS session level assistance information:\n-\tThe existing MBS session QoS parameters (e.g. ARP, 5QI) can be used as the MBS session level assistance information by NG-RAN to differentiate different MBS sessions.\n-\tFor UE level MBS assistance information:\n-\tThe UE level MBS assistance information is an optional new parameter and set per MBS session. It is indicated by the AF to inform the network whether from the expected traffic pattern of the UE the indicated UE is preferred to be kept in the RRC Connected state even if it is able according to its radio capabilities to receive the MBS session data in RRC_INACTIVE state, e.g. a frequent talker.\nNOTE 1:\tThe protocol detail and how the assistance information is formatted (e.g. as a flag, multiple choices (high/low/medium) or multiple integer values of the assistance information for the expected traffic pattern) is to be defined in normative phase and requires RAN WG feedback.\n-\tThe AF provides the UE level MBS assistance information as part of MBS subscription data during External Parameter Provisioning procedures as defined in clause 6.4.2 of TS 23.247 [4].\n-\tThe SMF provides the received UE level MBS assistance information to NG-RAN node as part of the PDU session information in N2 SM Info and sent to NG-RAN via AMF.\n-\tNG-RAN use the MBS session level and UE level MBS assistance information as help for the decisions on whether to enable delivery for reception in RRC_INACTIVE state for an MBS session and/or on which UEs to keep in RRC_CONNECTED or. RRC_INACTIVE state. How NG-RAN performs those decisions is up to NG-RAN implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the NG-RAN handles the situation without assistance information for RRC Inactive multicast MBS data reception is to be determined by RAN WGs.\nNOTE 3:\tWhat is defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2] for \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" is sent by AMF to NG-RAN and may be used by NG-RAN together with any other MBS session level assistance information and UE level MBS assistance information for deciding whether to send a UE to RRC Inactive state.\n-\tWhen the MBS session is activated, the UEs in RRC Inactive state in cells, where the MBS session is delivered allowing RRC-inactive reception, should be able to remain in RRC Inactive state for receiving the MBS session data.\n-\tFor group paging, the network notifies which MBS session is to be activated. For the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state how the group paging is handled will be decided by RAN WGs.\n-\tHow NG-RAN notifies the UE that the MBS session is re-activated and whether the MBS session is allowed to be received in RRC-inactive state will be decided by RAN WGs.\n-\tWhen an RRC_INACTIVE UE is in the process of receiving ongoing MBS session data and moves to a new cell within the RNA, the UE shall be able to receive MBS session data.\n-\tWhen the UE moves outside the RNA, the UE performs UE Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure to the target RAN node as per existing procedures in TS 23.502 [3].\n-\tWhen the UE receives the MBS data in RRC Inactive state and move out of the RNA area but Connection resume fails, it follows existing procedures and transition to CM-IDLE. When the UE transition to CM-IDLE since is not able to receive the MBS multicast data at the new cell, the UE initiates the mobility registration update or Service Request procedure and activates the associated PDU session, so that the shared tunnel (if not already established) or the individual delivery can be established towards the NG-RAN node for multicast data delivery to the UE.\n-\tWhen the UE moves outside the RA, the UE performs mobility registration procedure and as per the existing procedure in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2] for \"Mobile initiated NAS signalling procedure\" for UEs in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE will resume the RRC Connection.\n-\tDuring the handover procedure, the SMF includes the \"MBS assistance information for RRC Inactive\" if any in N2 SM Info and sent to NG-RAN via AMF.\nThe following requirements, which need be supported by RAN WGs, are concluded:\n-\tBackward compatibility with Rel-17 UEs not supporting the RRC_Inactive reception of MBS multicast data needs to be ensured.\n-\tRAN WG2 define UE radio capability for MBS reception in RRC_INACTIVE state.\n-\tNG-RAN nodes decide for which MBS sessions to apply delivery enabling reception in RRC_Inactive state. The NG RAN nodes handling RRC-Connected UE in an MBS multicast session also decides whether the UEs can transition to RRC_Inactive state and may consider assistance information from the 5G core network for that decision. How NG-RAN performs those decisions is up to NG-RAN implementation.\n-\tWhen the MBS session is activated, the UE in RRC Inactive state in cells where the MBS session is delivered in the delivery mode for RRC-inactive reception should be able to remain in RRC Inactive state for receiving the MBS session data.\n-\tWhen the UE is in RRC Inactive state and moves within the RNA, it shall be able to continue receiving DL multicast MBS data unless it leaves the MBS service area.\n",

Normative work is not required.\n\nThis Annex covers the case when the mission critical enabled UEs are concentrated in a single cell.\nA general public safety use case, for example, can assume that:\n-\ta cell with UEs receiving a mix of public safety and non public safety services: some UEs receive only non public safety services, other UEs receive only public safety services, being engaged in one or more mission critical one-to-one call or on single or multiple simultaneous group calls (e.g. PTT and video), and yet other UEs receive both public safety and non-public safety services at the same time;\n-\tthe number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED state in the cell is at, or very near to, the limit of the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED state that can be accepted in that cell due to various limiting factors;\n-\tat that moment, a number of mission critical enabled UEs (e.g. the occupants of a fire truck) interested in participating in group calls associated with a specific public safety group arrive roughly simultaneously in the cell with their UEs in various RRC states (or possibly, powered off) and attempt to perform the necessary connection steps to the RAN, CN and AF, to be able to connect and associate themselves to the public safety group of interest;\n-\tthis situation results in a larger number of UEs being or attempting to get in RRC_CONNECTED state than can be admitted in the cell in that state. The admission control to the cell and/or pre-emption mechanisms will be activated, resulting in some UEs already in RRC_CONNECTED state being transitioned to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE to \"make room\" for some of the newly arrived mission critical enabled UEs to get to the RRC_CONNECTED state necessary to start/complete their association with the public safety group of interest;\n-\tsome (or all) of the mission critical enabled UEs associated with public safety group(s) of interest which use or intend to use MBS for downlink communication may have to be transitioned to RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE state to ensure that the total number of UEs in the cell in RRC_CONNECTED state does not exceed the limit for that cell;\nNOTE 1:\tThe transition from RRC_CONNECTED state should not happen for just arrived public safety UEs before their association with the public safety group of interest is complete, which is needs to be ensured by public safety applications. Some application-function (AF) provided information about specific public safety participants in group calls (e.g. privilege status, priority) may be used to identify which UEs should be kept in RRC_CONNECTED state and which UEs are candidates for being transitioned to RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE state.\n-\twhether an MBS Session for public safety is active or inactive, a UE in RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE state, may request transition to RRC_CONNECTED state to perform unicast uplink transmissions (e.g. to request the floor, send user data, send location reports, etc.). Since the number of UEs already in RRC_CONNECTED state in the cell may be at or near the cell admissibility limit, one or more UEs already in RRC_CONNECTED state may need to first be moved to RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE state, in order to \"make room\" for the UE wanting to transmit;\n-\twhile in RRC_INACTIVE state receiving user data via MBS under a session, a mission critical enabled UE may request (see bullet above), and be able to additionally start receiving public safety service via MBS, in parallel, under another session.\nNOTE 2:\tTreatment of failure by public safety UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state to receive MBS downlink transmissions when expected to do so, is left to implementation.\n\n\n",
