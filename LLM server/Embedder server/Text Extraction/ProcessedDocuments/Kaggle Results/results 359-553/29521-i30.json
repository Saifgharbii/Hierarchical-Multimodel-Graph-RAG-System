The DRA is described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [14] and can be a service consumer of the Nbsf_Management service.\nDuring the Rx session establishment, the DRA can discover the selected PCF for the related subscriber by using the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation to obtain the related PCF address if it has no stored binding information derived from an ongoing Gx session for that subscriber.\nNOTE 1:\tFor a UE in the EPC there is a Gx session and the DRA stores the binding information. For a UE in the 5GC the Npcf_SmPolicyControl service is used and the BSF stores the binding information.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the DRA has no stored binding information derived from an ongoing Gx session for a subscriber, the DRA needs to request new binding information for each Rx session establishment because the information in the BSF could have changed compared to any previous binding information the DRA requested.\n\n",
