For authentication between NEF and an Application Function that resides outside the 3GPP operator domain, mutual authentication based on client and server certificates is performed between the NEF and AF using TLS and Certificate based authentication  follows the profiles given in TS 33.210 [7], clause 6.2 as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 12.2.\nThreat References: TR 33.926 [5], clause I.2.2.1, No authentication on application function\nTest Case:\nTest Name: TC_CP_AUTH_AF_NEF\nPurpose: To verify that the NEF can authenticate application function and establish TLS connection towards the application server with certificate based authentication, and may authenticate application function and establish TLS connection towards the application server with pre-shared key based authentication.\nPre-Condition:\n-\tThe NEF network product shall be connected in emulated/real network environments.\n-\tIn order to establish TLS connections to the NEF network product, the application function shall offer a feature that is supported by the NEF network product, including protocol version and combination of cryptographic algorithms.\n-\tThe application function and the NEF network product shall support certificate based authentication, and may support pre-shared key based authentication.\n-\tIf the NEF network product does not support CAPIF as specified in clause 6.2.5.1 in TS 23.501 [3], the certificates or the pre-shared key shall be provisioned in the NEF network product.\n-\tIf the NEF network product supports CAPIF, the certificates or the pre-shared key shall be provisioned in the CAPIF core function, the CAPIF core function shall be able to select appropriate authentication method as defined in the sub-clause 6.5.2 in TS 33.122 [4].\nExecution Steps:\n1.\tIf certificate based authentication is used, provision correct certificate on the application function, if pre-shared key based authentication is used, provision same pre-shared key on the application function.\n2.\tThe application function shall initiate establishment of TLS connection towards the NEF network product, and check whether a TLS connection is established successfully.\n3.\tIf certificate based authentication is used, provision incorrect certificate on the application function, if pre-shared key based authentication is used, provision different pre-shared key on the application function.\n4.\tThe application function shall initiate establishment of TLS connection towards the NEF network product, and check whether no new TLS connection is established.\nExpected Results:\nOnly one TLS connection is established at step 2.\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot containing the operational results.\n4.2.2.1.2\tAuthorization on northbound APIs\nRequirement Name: Authorization on application function\nRequirement Reference: TS 33.501 [2], clause 12.4\nRequirement Description: The NEF authorizes the requests from Application Function using OAuth-based authorization mechanism, the specific authorization mechanisms follow the provisions given in RFC 6749 [8]\" as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 12.4.\nThreat References: TR 33.926 [5], clause I.2.2.2, No authorization on northbound APIs\nTest Case:\nTest Name: TC_CP_AUTHOR_AF_NEF\nPurpose: To verify that the NEF can authorize application function.\nPre-Condition:\n-\tThe NEF network product shall be connected in emulated/real network environments.\n-\tThe application function and the NEF network product shall support OAuth-based authorization mechanism.\n-\tAn authorization server (e.g. NRF, or CAPIF core function) that supports OAuth2 protocol to authorize NEF northbound APIs using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant has been deployed.\n-\tThe TLS connection between the NEF network product and the application function has been established.\n-\tThe authorization server is configured to grant the application function to access a northbound API of the NEF network product, called NEF northbound API A.\nExecution Steps:\nTest 1: without token:\n1.\tThe application function invokes Obtain_Authorization service towards the authorization server to get a token from the authorization server for accessing the NEF northbound API A.\n2.\tThe application function invokes NEF northbound API A.\n3.\tThe tester triggers the application function to invoke another northbound API of the NEF network product, called NEF northbound API B, without token.\nTest 2: With incorrect token:\n1.\tThe application function invokes Obtain_Authorization service towards the authorization server to get a token from the authorization server for accessing the NEF northbound API A.\n2.\tThe application function invokes NEF northbound API A.\n3.\tThe tester triggers the application function to invoke the NEF northbound API B with a fake token.\nExpected Results:\nThe invoking of NEF northbound API A succeeds, while the invoking of NEF northbound API B fails.\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot containing the operational results.\n",
