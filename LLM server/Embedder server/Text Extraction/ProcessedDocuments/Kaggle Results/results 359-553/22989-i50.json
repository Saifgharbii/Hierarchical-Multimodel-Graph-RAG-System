            "description": "The present document is an 800 series Technical Report (TR) written by 3GPP TSG SA WG1 (SA1). Such a TR is not normative, i.e. cannot be used for implementation directly and cannot be referred to by other 3GPP specifications. It was primarily written by SA1 to summarise the high-level communication needs of the railway community and to identify the corresponding requirements, which, in another step have been introduced into normative Technical Specifications (TS) of 3GPP.\nAn 800 series TR will not be updated when in the process of introduction of the requirements to TS changes are made to those requirements, i.e. the text of the requirements listed here in this TR will not be aligned with the requirements in the TS. Due to the fact that most of the requirements identified in this document were introduced in already existing Mission Critical Communication (MCX) TS, an alignment with the MCX terminology and functionality was made resulting in most of the requirements in here being reworded in the TS. Also, TS requirements changes due to future work affecting requirements stemming from this TR will not result in updates of this TR.\nHowever, the columns “Comments” of the requirements tables listed below were updated to indicate the disposition of the requirement in the TS and most of the time summarising deviations and decisions taken when introducing those requirement into normative TS. By following these references into the normative TS the functionality provided by 3GPP for railway communication can be derived by the reader.\nFRMCS will adapt 3GPP transport to provide communication to railway users. It eventually will resemble GSM-R and will additionally provide communication capabilities beyond what GSM-R has been able to. It will provide higher data rates, lower data latencies, multimedia communication, and improved communication reliability. FRMCS considers end-to-end use cases and also provides requirements that might or might not be in scope of 3GPP existing specifications. To facilitate smooth migration from legacy communication systems (e.g. GSM) to FRMCS, interworking requirements between legacy communication systems and FRMCS are provided.\nFRMCS Equipment shall connect to application domain through 3GPP radio access or other access. It provides emergency group communication, low latency and high reliable data and video service in high speed train environment. Amongst others it has the following important features:\n-\tPrioritized emergency group communication, train control data and video service\n-\tSeamless connectivity in high speed railway moving environments\n-\tLow latency and high reliable data and video service\n-\tReal time train monitoring and management for safe train operation\n-\tReliable location tracking including in tunnel tracking\n-\tLegacy railway communication interworking to GSM-R system\n\nFRMCS (Frequency Reconfigurable Multilevel Coded Spread Spectrum) is a technology that allows for the efficient transmission of signals over long distances. In Figure 4-1, we can see the high-level relation of FRMCS and legacy systems, highlighting the key differences and similarities between the two. FRMCS is a frequency-reconfigurable modulation scheme that can adapt to different signal conditions, while legacy systems rely on fixed frequency modulation. The figure also shows the use of optical fiber as the backbone for communication, which is a key component in FRMCS.\nFigure 4-1: High-level relation of FRMCS and legacy systems\nBasically, railway communication services [5] can be categorized into\n-\tTrain control services\n-\tMaintenance services\n-\tRailway specific services (such as Railway Emergency Call, functional addressing, and location-based addressing)\n-\tOther services (providing train crews or train Drivers with information of train operation and interworking with the existing railway communication systems)\nThis study categorizes all the use cases by considering inherent characteristics of railway applications. Specifically, the following categories of use cases are considered.\n-\tBasic functionality\n-\tCritical communication applications\n-\tPerformance communication applications\n-\tBusiness communication applications\n-\tCritical support applications\n-\tPerformance support applications\n-\tBusiness support applications\n-\tFRMCS System principles\nThe categories can be depicted conceptually as follows:\n\nThe figure depicts a group of FRMCS applications, illustrating their grouping and their respective functionalities.\nFigure 4-2: Grouping of FRMCS Applications\n",

Receiving such alert will result in immediate actions to be taken by the recipients. These actions are defined by operational rules, e.g. a Driver will slow down train speed to 40km/h, drive on sight, etc.\n-\tBased on operational rules, additional information about the emergency can be exchanged using voice and/or data communication.\nWhile the alert needs to be setup very fast, the information part that may follow is less time critical and not always required. The Railway emergency Communication consists of:\nA mandatory alert phase indicating the emergency;\nAn optional voice and/or data communication phase depending on operational situation and / or operational rules.\nAlert is the general term used that encompasses the different phases initiation, continuation and termination. This receives priority handling which is linked to the application category within the FRMCS System (see 12.10).\nWhen a railway emergency alert is triggered by a FRMCS User, the FRMCS System determines which other FRMCS Users shall receive an alert, depending on following conditions:\n-\tLocation, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity, direction of movement, speed of the initiating entity\n-\tLocation, accuracy of the location, track, functional identity, direction of movement, speed of the FRMCS Users which are concerned of the emergency\n-\tAny additional information provided by the initiating entity\nBy applying alert conditions, only FRMCS Users who are concerned by this emergency will receive an alert. Figure 6.4.2-1 outlines this principle.\nThe figure depicts a user in an emergency alert area, illustrating the FRMCS (Fire and Rescue Mission Critical Systems) system in action. The user is shown in a red emergency alert area, indicating the importance of the system in providing critical information to emergency responders.\nFigure 6.4.2-1\tIllustration of FRMCS Users in an railway emergency alert area\nIndependently of any ongoing interactions between the FRMCS User and the FRMCS Equipment, the railway emergency alert has to be continuously indicated to the FRMCS User until the railway emergency is over (alert is terminated).\nWhile an alert is active, the FRMCS System shall continuously check:\n-\tIf additional FRMCS Users do match to the conditions of the railway emergency alert. FRMCS User entering the emergency area/location/etc. will receive the alert.\n-\tIf an FRMCS User does not fulfil the conditions to be alerted anymore, because the FRMCS User has moved away from the emergency area, the alert will be withdrawn from this FRMCS User.\nA Controller is able to change the conditions to select the applicable FRMCS Users while an alert is active.\nWhile an alert is active on a FRMCS Equipment, the FRMCS User is still able to establish and / or receive other types of communication. If a railway emergency voice communication is established by the FRMCS User of an ongoing alert, any other ongoing voice communications are terminated.\n",

The merging may result in changed alert conditions. The affected FRMCS Users are notified.\nAn FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) is authorized to merge Railway Emergency Alerts. There are two or more ongoing Railway Emergency Alerts. FRMCS Users involved in those alerts have been regrouped into separate temporary groups for use during the alerts.\nIt has been determined that the alert area must be extended to include users involved in the ongoing alerts.\nAn authorized FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) or an External System is able to provide the FRMCS System with changed alert conditions (e.g., extension of the area or combination of track sections) including selection of the appropriate recipients of the new (i.e., merged) Railway Emergency Alert. The FRMCS Users involved in the new/merged alert are regrouped into a new temporary group.\nThe alert condition is declared by the Controller, or authorized FRMCS User, on this new temporary group. The FRMCS system sends the new/merged Railway Emergency Alert to all FRMCS Users in the new temporary group within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see 12.10). The alert notification can include all relevant information including details of the merged alerts, if needed, (e.g., text, voice prompts) which is forwarded to and presented on the end user device of the regrouped FRMCS Users.\nThe FRMCS system continuously check’s if FRMCS Users still meet the alert conditions of the Railway Emergency Alert. The FRMCS User can be, for example, a mobile user, a driver, maintenance staff, a member of a shunting team or a controller.\nThe priority of the Railway Emergency Alert is managed by the arbitration application. The alert has the priority which matches the application category CRITICAL DATA (see 12.10).\nIn the case that a mobile FRMCS User is already active in a Railway Emergency Alert, the new Railway Emergency Alert is sent by the FRMCS System to the end user device. The presentation of the alert(s) to the user is managed by the client arbitration application.\nIn case that a mobile FRMCS User is already active in an ongoing Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communications of another Railway Emergency Alert (i.e., call in progress), the ongoing Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communications is terminated either using normal termination condition (e.g., an authorized user terminate the call) or using configuration parameters of the FRMCS System (e.g., timeout when latest transmission ends).\nWhen ongoing Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communications of another Railway Emergency Alert are terminated, the next request to establish Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communication is made on the associated merged Railway Emergency Alert (i.e., next call occurs on regroup group).\nIf a Railway Emergency Voice and/or Data communication is established by the FRMCS User of an ongoing Railway Emergency Alert, any other ongoing non-emergency-voice communications are put in the queue.\nA FRMCS User - other than the initiating FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) - is not able to manually leave the temporary group of the new Railway Emergency Alert.\nThe FRMCS system notifies the FRMCS Users for whom the Railway Emergency Alert is no longer applicable and terminates the alert of these FRMCS Users. The termination notification of the alert can include additional information (e.g., text, voice prompts) which is presented on the end user device of the FRMCS Users. These FRMCS Users are removed from the merged alert temporary group.\nIn the case an FRMCS User no longer meets the conditions of the Railway Emergency Alert, but there is an ongoing Railway Emergency Voice or Data Communication, the FRMCS User will remain in the ongoing Railway Emergency Voice or Data communication.\nThe initiating FRMCS User (i.e., Controller) is notified which FRMCS Users are still part of the Railway Emergency Alert. FRMCS Users who have left the Railway Emergency Alert are separately indicated to the initiating FRMCS User (i.e., Controller).\nThe communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded data application.\nThe appropriate FRMCS Users remain in the temporary group of the merged Railway Emergency Alert, while non-appropriate FRMCS Users are returned to their previous condition.\n",

For safety reasons trackside maintenance staff need to be informed about approaching trains entering the area of maintenance. Thus, the intention of a trackside warning system is to inform trackside staff about the approaching train.\nTrackside warning system consists of several specific sensors and warning entities. The sensors are responsible to detect the approaching train and warning entities indicate trackside workers about the approaching train. A warning entity provides this indication in form of visual signal e.g. flashing light and an audio signal e.g. tone. In addition, the local maintenance staff will receive the train approaching indication on its FRMCS Equipment. When the train has left the track section, the warning system withdraws the indication.\nSensors and warning entities constitute the warning system that requires continuous communication between the sensors and the warning entities. In addition, it encompasses the communication among the warning system and the FRMCS Equipment of the local maintenance staff.\nDue to the fact that such a warning system deployment is temporary and not always fixed network communication facilities are available at the track, FRMCS System provides necessary mobile communication services for the trackside warning system.\nHence this chapter describes the use cases related to Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication. The following use cases are identified:\nInitiation of a Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication\nTermination of a Trackside Maintenance Warning System communication\n",

Every train regardless the type of composition requires this kind of data communication in a fully automated train operation scenario.\nThe FRMCS Users in this case are the train integrity entities on-board of the train and the ground system. There several options to determine train integrity:\nTrain integrity information will be only determined by the applicable entities at the train. For this approach train integrity entities are located at the front and the end of the train as well as on demand partially between the front and the end. The front entity supplies the train’s integrity status to the safety entity on-board the train responsible for Control Command Signalling. This scenario requires Off-network communication bearer services for multi-user communication.\nTrain integrity information will be determined by the applicable entities at the train and the ground. Train integrity entities are distributed equally over the total length of a train. The ground (train) integrity entity will collect the reported train integrity information and compute the train integrity status of a particular train. This scenario requires On-network communication bearer services.\nThe FRMCS Users (train integrity entities) are authorised to initiate a train integrity data communication.\nThe FRMCS Users (train integrity entities) are authorised to use the train integrity application.\nOff-network communication\nOn demand by the FRMCS Users (train integrity entities), the FRMCS System establishes a communication between the authorised FRMCS Users at the train. The data communication for train integrity requires the QoS class which matches the application category of CRITICAL DATA (see chapter 12.10) within the FRMCS system.

The network consists of a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 7.2.2.1-2. The offload results with uplink speed of 450 Mbps.\n\nThe figure depicts the offload results of a 5G network, showing the uplink speed of 750 Mbps. The network utilizes a combination of 5G core, 4G core, and 3G core, with 4G and 3G core being the most significant.

The system is designed to facilitate efficient communication and collaboration among team members, ensuring that tasks are completed in a timely and effective manner.\nFigure 9.3.2-1: Example of Role management\nIn this definition, it is needed to make a distinction between different types of FRMCS Equipment. The following are, as a principle, defined:\na)\tFRMCS Equipment without MMI, without the possibility to be addressed via a functional identity related to the equipment (e.g. sensor in the track or simple modem operation)\nb)\tFRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity related to the equipment (e.g. maintenance log collecting device connected to a power station) but without other FRMCS User login\nc)\tFRMCS Equipment that can be registered to a functional identity and that allows a FRMCS User to login and register to functional identities related to the user (e.g. cab radio)\nd)\tFRMCS Equipment that cannot register to a functional identity, but that allows a FRMS User to login and to register to functional identities related to the user (e.g. a generic handheld device)\nSteps:\nUE-Power on: The UE has started up and is attached to the FRMCS network on telecoms level. The UE is reachable via its subscriber identity address.\nStart FRMCS Application: On the UE the FRMCS Application start up and is ready for use.\nFRMCS Equipment login: The FRMCS Application is logging in into the FRMCS System and the FRMCS Equipment becomes known to the FRMCS System.\nInitialise FRMCS Equipment type: the type of FRMCS Equipment used is identified.\n\nAt this stage of the user flow four different routes can be followed, based on the determined FRMCS Equipment type of the FRMCS Equipment.\nType a) “sensor”:\nNo action required. The FRMCS Equipment is now reachable via its subscriber identity address.\nAfter this step the process of registration is completed.\nType b) “Announcement System”:\nRegister to a functional identity: the FRMCS Equipment will request for a registration on a functional number. This functional number is related to the equipment and identifies the device, like a PA system on a train.\nFunctional identity added: the request for a functional identity is granted by the FRMCS System. The end user device is now reachable via its functional identity.\nAfter this step the process of registration is completed.\nType c) “cab radio”:\nRegister to a functional identity: the FRMCS Equipment will request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity is related to the FRMCS Equipment and identifies the environment where the equipment is used, like a cab radio in a cabin of a train.\nFunctional identity added: The FRMCS User is now only reachable via all of its functional identities related to the FRMCS Equipment.\nType d) “Handheld”:\nNext, for both the types c) and d) the following steps apply:\nUser login dialog: the user is presented with a log-in MMI action. The user can now login into the FRMCS System. By successfully logging into the FRMCS System the user becomes a FRMCS User.\nFRMCS User: The FRMCS User is now reachable via its FRMCS User Identity (and in case c) the functional identity registered by the FRMCS Equipment).\nRegister to a functional identity: the FRMCS User may request for a registration on a functional identity. This functional identity relates to the FRMCS User and identifies the role of the FRMCS User e.g. driver, controller etc. and the environment e.g. train number.\nFunctional identity added: The FRMCS User is now reachable via all the functional identities registered to the user (Further, the FRMCS Equipment is reachable via its registered functional identity(ies).\nAfter this step the process of registration is completed.\nNote: \tUse cases related to power up the UE until complete initialisation of the equipment type are covered in chapter 5.\n\n",

In this section service interworking between the GSM-R System and the FRMCS System for functional identities and its associated roles will be addressed.\nFunctional Address\nOn top of the E.164 numbering plan alternative addressing scheme called functional addressing is used in the context with GSM-R. Functional addressing scheme allows the establishment of communication without knowing each E.164 number associated with a particular train. A functional address consists of:\nIC+CT+UN\nIC\t\tInternational code is used to route calls to the appropriate GSM-R network\nCT\tCall Type prefix defines how to interpret the User Number (UN) as train function number, engine function number, group calls etc.\nUN\tUser Number is of variable length and depends on the information i.e. train function number etc. Within the UN a Functional Code (FC) is associated and provides the information of the person or equipment on a particular train, or a particular team within a given area. Therefore, the UN consists of User Identification Number (UIN) i.e. train number etc. and the Functional Code (FC) resulting into: UN= UIN+FC\nA functional address only consists of numeric characters.\n9.3.9.2\tPre-conditions\nFollowing user addressing scenarios applies between FRMCS System and GSM-R system when using alternative addressing schemes in FRMCS:\nA GSM-R user is able to obtain communication services from the GSM-R system. E.164 numbering plan and functional addressing scheme applies.\nA FRMCS User is able to obtain communication services from the FRMCS System or from the GSM-R system. If the FRMCS User, in this sense the FRMCS Equipment is registered to the FRMCS System, user addressing of the FRMCS system applies comprising the use of functional identity addressing scheme. If the FRMCS Equipment is registered to the GSM-R system, E.164 numbering plan and functional addressing i.e. IC+CT+UIN+FC scheme applies.\nFor a train route which encompasses both GSM-R and FRMCS coverage areas the functional identity registration for users and equipment travelling this route shall be made in two parallel entries in the respective GSM-R functional addressing and FRMCS Functional Aliasing databases.\nAny subsequent modification of functional addressing or functional aliasing while the user or equipment is registered shall be done in parallel on both systems\nThe deregistration of the functional aliasing or functional addressing for the user or equipment with parallel registration shall be deregistered in parallel.\n9.3.9.3\tService flows\nFRMCS User relocates from GSM-R system to the FRMCS System\nWhen the FRMCS Equipment relocates from GSM-R system to the FRMCS System, the applicable functional address(es) associated with the FRMCS User require(s) a conversion to the functional identity format applicable within the FRMCS System.

Most of railway services are based on on-network communication, which is supported by base station and core networks under 3GPP standard. However, when disaster happens so that the communication infrastructure is not feasible, railway service based on the communication infrastructure cannot be maintained any more. From 3GPP Rel. 12, device-to-device communications has been considered to be supported not only in the transport layer but also in the application layer. In addition, interworking of FRMCS System with legacy systems including GSM-R and TRS is expected to be supported in Rel. 15. As a consequence, off-network and legacy systems will become feasible for group communication services in 3GPP technology. Therefore, by considering not only off-network but also legacy systems, reliability of mission critical group communication service in the on-network can be enhanced. Figure 9.9-1 depicts a required transformation of group communication service mode.\nFRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train operations staff support device to device communications in the perspective of transport layer.\nFRMCS Equipment for train driver, customer service staff, and train operations staff support on-network, off-network group communication services in the perspective of applications layer.\n\nThe figure depicts a transformation of group communication service mode, illustrating the process of transitioning from a traditional group communication service to a new model. The transformation involves the use of a new communication protocol, which is represented by the dotted line connecting the two groups. This new model is designed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, while also enhancing the overall user experience.\nFigure 9.9.3.2-1. Transformation of group communication service mode\n1. After initial disaster happens, emergency message (including voice or data) delivery service based on on-network group communication among train driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff have been preceded without any problem.\n2. Disaster becomes worse, and associated communication infrastructure is destroyed and is not usable anymore.\n3. Transformation of on-network group communication service into off-network or legacy network-based group communication service is accomplished among group members for maintaining the group communication services even in the worse disaster.\nOff-network or legacy network-based group communication among train driver, customer service staff, or train operations staff is activated and group communication service is maintained normally.\n",

If a train can autonomously figure out the positions of the nearby trains and decide its movement authority, the transport capacity of the railway will be enhanced. In the autonomous train control system whose service concept is aligned to the eV2X service, trains share its position by exchanging the information without any centralized server, and each train decides how far it can be authorized to move based on the position information. It is expected that main application area will be mass transportation such as subway.\nThe figure depicts an autonomous train control scenario, showing a train moving along a track with a series of sensors and actuators. The sensors include a camera, a laser, and a radar, while the actuators include a steering wheel, a throttle, and a brake. The train is controlled by a central computer, which is connected to the sensors and actuators through a network of wires. The figure illustrates the complexity of autonomous train control systems, highlighting the need for advanced algorithms and real-time data processing to ensure safe and efficient operation.\nFigure 9.13.-1 An example of autonomous train control scenario\n",

                            "text_content": "One of the important missions that the future railway service should achieve is to increase its transport capacity. A straight-forward solution is to minimize the distance between successive trains so that train interval is reduced. It is difficult to do so in a legacy train control system, because the successive trains need to have distance as much as a safety margin, which should be larger than the full braking distance.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a safety-critical system, specifically a vehicle's braking and acceleration control system. It shows the sharing of acceleration and braking control information between the vehicle's control module and the vehicle's powertrain control module. This information is used to shorten the safety margin, ensuring that the vehicle can safely decelerate or accelerate without causing a loss of control. The figure illustrates the communication between the two modules, with the vehicle's control module sending acceleration and braking control information to the powertrain control module, and the powertrain control module sending acceleration and braking control information back to the vehicle's control module. The figure also shows the communication between the powertrain control module and the vehicle's control module, with the powertrain control module sending acceleration and braking control information to the vehicle's control module, and the vehicle's control module sending acceleration and braking control information back to the powertrain control module. The figure also shows the communication between the powertrain control module and the vehicle's control module, with the powertrain control module sending acceleration and braking control information to the vehicle's control module, and the vehicle's control module sending acceleration and braking control information back to the powert\nFigure 9.14-1 Sharing acceleration and braking control information to shorten safety margin\nThis safety margin can be further shortened if the successive trains share control information (acceleration and braking) and apply it to its own train control. As shown in Figure 9.14.1, the safety margin can be shortened if the following train immediately knows that the leading train starts braking and also triggers braking. This is the fundamental principle and the main purpose of virtual coupling. Figure 9.14.2 shows the basic concept of the virtual coupling scenario. Multiple trains which are in close distance move together as they are physically coupled. As the distance between two trains gets smaller, the control information of a train should be delivered to the other in shorter time.\nThe figure depicts a virtual coupling scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the concept of virtual coupling between base stations (BSs) and users. The diagram shows the various components involved, such as the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Virtual coupling is a technique used to improve the performance of 5G networks by allowing the BSs to share resources with the UE, reducing the need for additional infrastructure. The figure highlights the importance of proper design and implementation of virtual coupling in 5G networks to ensure high-speed data transmission and efficient resource utilization.\nFigure 9.14-2 The concept of virtual coupling scenario\n",

The two trains, which are still far enough to allow a certain amount of end-to-end latency, keep the connection through the 3GPP network.\n3. As the following train further approaches to the leading train, the safe braking distance gets shorter and they are required to have a connection of which end-to-end latency is very short for delicate train control.

This key distribution centre may be located in the same network or in an external network.\nThe users in this case are the Key Management applications both on-board of the train and in the key distribution centre at the trackside (ground system).\nKey Management communication is considered to be user-to-user data communication.\nThe communication of keys may be requested each time that an ATP or ATO communication session is established or at any other time, depending on the specific configuration of the Key Management application.\nThe initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to initiate the Key Management data communication. This is managed by the authorisation of communication application.\nThe receiving application on the FRMCS equipment is authorised to use the Key Management data communication.

The QoS profile of the communication is managed by the QoS Profile application. The data communication requests the QoS profile which matches the application category of CRITICAL DATA (see [QoS]) within the FRMCS system, depending on the application needs.\nThe FRMCS system establishes the bearer service required for the data communication within a setup time specified as IMMEDIATE (see [QoS]).\nThe arbitration is managed by the arbitration application on the FRMCS equipment.\nThe communication is recorded by the Data recording and access to recorded data application.\nThe initiating application on the FRMCS equipment is connected to the receiving application.\nData can be exchanged between the Key Management applications.\n",

Moreover, bearer flexibility aims at improving service availability and performance.\nThe characteristics of bearer flexibility are:\nA Railway Application may use one or several access systems as appropriate.\nConnection of FRMCS Equipment to different access systems is dynamic (i.e. the most appropriate 3GPP or non-3GPP access technologies are selected automatically, potentially using multiple access technologies for one or more Railway Applications).\nThe set of access systems chosen meets the defined QoS and the service requirements e.g. FRMCS User mobility and connectivity which are necessary to guarantee the functionality.\nThe introduction of a new access system should not negatively impact existing Railway Applications.\nThe approach taken within FRMCS allows the integration of 3GPP and non-3GPP radio access evolution.\nIP is used as a generic interface towards Railway Applications, facilitating connectivity, quality of service control, security and the separation of transport system and applications.

                            "text_content": "Case 1 (data communication)\nAs an example the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) application of a train establishes a data communication session with the applicable ground communication entity which is connected via the fixed network service. For ATP message exchange, the on-board system can encompass a railway operated private 3GPP 4G access system and a public 3GPP 5G access system (e.g. a VPN service) as part of the FRMCS System. ATP periodically reports train position information and receives Control Command instructions from the ground communication entity. The FRMCS Equipment is registered to both access systems and uses these simultaneously if applicable.\nSimultaneous use of radio access systems may improve communication resilience, availability, and QoS and increases bandwidth.\nThe concept as described here can generally be extended to other data communication applications and (non-)3GPP access systems.\nCase 2 (railway emergency voice communication)\nThe on-board FRMCS Users are registered to the FRMCS System. An on-board FRMCS User establishes a Railway Emergency Communication (REC) from a specific location in the FRMCS network. This particular communication request takes into account the most appropriate radio access system, for example the railway-operated private 3GPP network. The FRMCS System notifies the applicable users determined by the location of the initiator of the communication by using all available access system(s) e.g. 3GPP (public and private), WLAN or wireline. The applicable Controller is notified via the wireline access system. The intended recipients of the call may be using different access systems.\nThe concept as described here can in general be extended to other voice group communication applications and point to point communication services.\nCase 3 (telemetry operation at a railway depot)\nA train is located in a railway depot where only WLAN coverage (non-3GPP access) as part of the FRMCS System is provided. FRMCS Users of this train are attached to the FRMCS System. An FRMCS User starts a data session towards the applicable vehicle diagnostic entity. At that point in time WLAN provides the radio access system for this telemetry communication. Once the train leaves the depot and enters into a 3GPP coverage area, the FRMCS Equipment adapts the transmission of the telemetry data session to the most QoS effective radio access system (3GPP access). The telemetry session continues uninterrupted when the train changes its location.\nThe concept as described here can in general be extended to other voice and data applications where other combinations of access systems at specific locations are possible.\nCase 4 (Backup operation/resilience)\nIn a certain area with dedicated 3GPP access, coverage fails. Despite unavailability of the dedicated railway 3GPP access, FRMCS Users have the capability to continue communications by using public 3GPP access using an access system which may support the required or some degraded form of QoS and which is provided in the area and which serves as a backup or complementary system. Communication applications on trains continue to operate, service continuity is preserved. When the functionality of the dedicated 3GPP access system is restored, the FRMCS Equipment resumes operation on that system.\nThe concept as described here can generally be extended to any combination of access systems, e.g. WLAN and private 3GPP access.\nCase 5 (Notification of radio bearer availability)\nIn general, there is only little radio spectrum resources allocated to railways in most regions. These should be preferably used for operational rail communication purposes. In parallel, there are communications that require broadband wireless communication services. The availability of broadband wireless access can be limited e.g. to railway stations. Thus, the FRMCS System is able to take into account radio bearer availability at the FRMCS User’s position allowing to start communication such as a file download/upload not harming operational rail communication.\nCase 6 (Use of Satellite Communication)\nIn some regions, trains are circulating in rural areas, on low traffic lines. For such situation, deploying dedicated rail terrestrial radio access is not economically viable and public mobile operator’s service is very limited due to low population density rate. Satellite access is foreseen as an alternative to terrestrial radio access that reduces investment in access infrastructure. In this first approach, satellite access is considered as an enabler to extend communication service of rail lines with FRMCS.\nSome rail applications require service continuity for railways operation. In some situation, rail traffic is stopped when communication services are not available. To overcome situations of temporary outage or total destruction of terrestrial access, use of non-terrestrial access systems by the FRMCS system could be envisaged to deliver a highly resilient transport service. In this second approach, satellite access is foreseen as a backup from terrestrial radio access.\nIt is envisaged that the FRMCS application could be configured with preconditions that trigger an alternate mode of operation.\n",

The main purpose is to specify the list of attributes applicable to the FRMCS bearer service.\nRailway applications exhibit different characteristics, e.g., in terms of latency or reliability. On the other hand, the FRMCS System offers bearer services with different properties.\nIn this context, two types of applications can be distinguished:\nApplications that are aware of their transport service requirements and that are able to request those from the FRMCS System.\nApplications that are not aware of their transport service requirements and that are therefore not able to request those.\nRailway applications require a QoS classification ranging from high to low as low is “best effort”. The most important QoS parameters that determine the quality of the transport system are latency of the user data and reliability of the communication. In addition, guaranteed bandwidth assures the continuation of critical communication.\nQoS impacts train punctuality and the entire utilisation of the track system. Therefore, the FRMCS System has to consider the various QoS requirements.\nApart from high train speed operation, which goes up to 500kmh-1, other fundamental factors affect wireless communication. Railways are facing various radio signal propagation conditions such as in free space and in tunnels. Free space encompasses various structural and constructional scenarios. Railway corridors in hilly terrain or forest aisle are some examples.\nRadio propagation in large railway stations and shunting yards is different from the one of the main lines. Moving trains in stations or moving cargo wagons in shunting yards cause different propagation conditions.\nRadio tower site-to-site distance requires special attention. This distance varies depending on the type of area (rural or urban) and is determined by the boundary conditions of the RF signal (e.g. frequency band and power budget). Railways clearly require to deploy FRMCS while keeping the same distance between the radio towers in order to reuse the infrastructure deployed for GSM-R.\nVoice communication is commonly used during rail operation to give instructions to a driver of a locomotive in shunting operation, track maintenance etc. Rail environmental conditions like slowdown or movement of a train can impact the understandability of the voice.\nRadio propagation conditions in a rail environment are quite specific. For example train speed up to 500km/h or the insertion loss of the radio signal into a train. Staff has to work in the train, beside a train or under the train etc. while voice communication is ongoing. Such conditions shall not lower the intelligibility of the voice.\nRadio spectrum constraints in some regions require high efficiency in terms of radio bandwidth utilisation where voice communication coexists with other communication types simultaneously. The resulting voice codec has to consider these specific conditions.\n",

                            "text_content": "The basis for this use case is the UIC FRMCS URS wherein communication attributes define the QoS to be achieved for the various kinds of railway applications. These attributes are not part of the functional use case description but relevant for the FRMCS System and therefore subject of this use case.\nRegarding the URS communication attributes, not all attributes are covered in the QoS use case. The following items are considered:\nType of communication\nLatency, the delay between action and reaction\nSession Reliability\nSetup of communication, the time to establish a voice or data communication session\nTalker assignment time in group communication\nAudio (Voice) Quality\nFor further details, refer to the corresponding use cases in chapters 5 – 9. In these chapters the QoS requirements are specified on functional level. A reference is used which refers to real values’ in this QoS use case.\nThe pre-conditions of the functional use cases out of chapter 5 – 9 are applicable.\nThe service flows of the functional use cases out chapter 5 – 9 are applicable.\nApplication categories\nApplication categories describe the data transfer characteristic to be achieved by a bearer service. The FRMCS System shall consider the following user plane application categories:\nVoice \tfor user to user or multiuser communication; Voice follows the typical conversational pattern and requires low delay inside the transport system;\nCritical Voice\tfollows the voice conversational pattern but requires immediate session setup;\nVideo\tused for general observations purposes, e.g. maintenance;\nCritical Video\twith indirect impact on train operation, e.g. passenger surveillance;\nVery Critical Video\twith direct impact on safety- related critical train control and operation, e.g. used in driverless ( e.g. GoA3/GoA4) operation for automated detection of objects (no human in the loop) or video-based remote control (human in the loop).\nVery critical data\tfor future rail applications;\nCritical data\tfollows the response pattern and requires high reliable transport. This category comprises future and legacy applications e.g. ETCS;\nNon-Critical data\tused for the exchange of railway system or communication relevant information; requires high reliable transmission and preservation of the response pattern;\nMessaging\tfor the exchange of non-critical short information messages, recorded voice (for example voicemail), data, pictures, video; requires reliable transmission;\nPriority Level\nIn order to reach the QoS applicable for each application category, transport priority levels are required to differentiate among the communication urgency. Priority handling of communication service encompasses the assignment of a priority to a communication and involves the seizing of resources, which are in use by a communication having a lower ranking in the absence of idle resources. Priority handling includes as well discontinuation of an ongoing communication having a lower priority to allow an incoming communication of higher priority. Priority handling needs to be provided to a FRMCS User for all communications.\nPriorities are treated by the FRMCS User/Equipment in the FRMCS System based on the following conditions:\nThe priority level depends on the FRMCS User initiating the communication.\nThe communication can have the priority level selected by the FRMCS User at setup or the priority level is predefined at registration. The treatment of priority level also applies when the FRMCS User is registered to a visited FRMCS network.\nThe definition of the priority level which may cause pre-emption of another ongoing communication needs to be stored and can be changed by the FRMCS User.\nThe FRMCS System is able to allocate setup classes i.e. communication setup time requirements and resource pre-emption capabilities to each priority level.\nIn case of resource pre-emption, the pre-empted FRMCS user needs to be provided with a suitable indication.\nThe priority level can be selected by the FRMCs User on a per communication basis.\nThe FRMCS User may select any priority level up to the authorised priority level. The maximum priority level needs to be stored on the UICC. At communication setup, the FRMCS Equipment and the FRMCS System verify the priority level at setup against the maximum authorised priority level. If the FRMCS User has not selected a priority level at setup, the FRMCS System applies a FRMCS User specific default priority level. If the FRMCS User has selected at setup a priority level higher than the maximum authorised priority level, the maximum authorised priority level is applied for the communication.\nService Attributes\nFrom FRMCS User point of view there are two main service attributes latency and communication reliability.\nFor the Latency two classifications are applicable:\nLow\t\tUser data delay harms the functioning of the application.\nNormal\t\tUser data delay does not harm the sequence and progress of the application.\nFrom FRMCS System point of view, latency quantifies the end-to-end user data transport delay between the involved communication entities.\nReliability (in accordance to TS 22.261): in the context of network layer packet transmissions, percentage value of the amount of sent network layer packets successfully delivered to a given system entity within the time constraint required by the targeted service, divided by the total number of sent network layer packets.\nTwo levels are to be taken into account:\nHigh \t\tThe packet loss at transport level is exceptional rare.\nNormal\t\tThe packet loss at transport level is seldom.\nThe FRMCS System is able to assign multiple individual FRMCS User communications having individual QoS profile to a single IP address.\nTo meet the different application characteristics e.g. conversational pattern, real-time or critical data further itemisation is necessary. The mapping of the service attributes latency and reliability among functional requirements and FRMCS System as well as their target values are summarised in Table 12.10-1.\nTable 12.10-1 - Service attribute mapping\nSome application categories are time stringent e.g. critical voice or critical data.\nThe range of latency and reliability requirements have a certain dependency on the speed of the trains. In general, the requirement is that the service attributes can be guaranteed up to 500kmh-1. Certain combinations of latency and reliability apply only to Low Speed (≤ 40kmh-1).\n\nThe applications are considered as real-time when the FRMCS functional requirement for the latency is specified as “Low” and “Ultra Low”, according to table 12.10 1.\nSession handling\nSetup time of a communication session is essential because of their safety related character. Communication session setup encompasses the value of the elapsed time between the communication establishment request and the indication of successful communication session establishment. The FRMCS User requires two classes:\nImmediate\tThe FRMCS User requires immediate setup of the communication session. The duration of the immediate communication session establishment shall not exceed 1 second.\nNormal\tNormal communication session setup time range does not harm the use of the application. The time duration of the normal communication session establishment shall not exceed 3 seconds.\nTalker assignment time comprises the timeframe between talker request and the permission to talk applicable to group communication. This timeframe shall be lower than 300ms. Talker assignment time assumes that a group communication has been set up.\nSession Loss Rate (SLR) indicates the number of sessions released unintentionally per accumulated session time. SLR shall be <10-2/h.\nCommunication and QoS assignment\nIn order to provide the required level of communication quality, the FRMCS System will request the applicable resources as required for the communication service from the underlying 3GPP transport system and if appropriate also from non-3GPP transport systems. The transport resources are characterised by latency, reliability, guaranteed bitrate/non-guaranteed bitrate and communication service priority.\nIf no specific service attributes are required for a certain communication service, the FRMCS System is able to apply a predefined default.\nEach communication service resource characteristic can be requested independently of the others.\nAs result of the request to the underlying transport system, the FRMCS System may offer different values than the ones requested but which fit to the categories summarised in Table 12.10-1.\nThe available radio spectrum in certain regions, for example in Europe is rather limited, therefore the FRMCS System might apply different resources for the same communication service in different regions to achieve a radio resource efficient use of the available bandwidth.\nAudio quality\nVoice intelligibility strongly depends on the audio bandwidth. FRMCS System has to consider for voice communication following minimum requirements:\nEncoding of speech encompass in minimum the range of 200–7000 Hz;\nThe codec meets the local radio channel and capacity requirements of the FRMCS system;\nThe coding of speech signals is robust to radio impairments sacrificing voice clarity;\nThe post conditions of the functional use cases out of chapter 5 – 9 are applicable.\n\n\nApplication categories and their related service attributes are grouped into specific QoS class. Table 12.10-2 summarises the QoS classes and their applicable service attributes.\n\nTable 12.10-2 - Service and Service Attribute requirements\nRailway specific conditions\nFollowing propagation conditions are to be considered:\nFree space in general\nRailway corridors in general and especially in hilly terrain\nForest Aisle\nUnderground / tunnel environment\nMoving trains or objects in a railway station and shunting yards\nFRMCS System should be able to reuse the existing GSM-R sites. A non-exhaustive example list provides the typical site-to-site deployment scenarios:\nRural environment: between 5 - 7km.\nUrban environment: <5km.\n",

To make interworking between the networks to during provide FRMCS communication, it needs to manage call priority between calls which are made between the networks.\nDuring the interworking between FRMCS and LMR systems including TETRA and P25, FRMCS provides call priority based on factors such as the situation, group priority, level of user, etc. For example, a Railway Emergency Call could be categorized as a public announcement on emergency (low-level priority) or an operation emergency call (high-level priority).\nExamples on the priority of calls in FRMCS are provided in the following table:\nTable 12.13-1: Priority of calls in FRMCS\n\nThe examples in the table 12.13-1 are made by modifying of the call priority of the railway communication system as a mission critical service [4].\nIf an operation emergency call is invoked by a user (maybe a train driver), it should have higher level of priority than the public announcement on emergency call of other user. In this case, all the lower priority calls may need to be pre-empted or queued to allow the operation emergency call.\nIn order to provide the call priority, the interworking needs to be able to maintain the information on the priority of each call and each user who invoked a call or a group call. When a call is invoked, FRMCS should compare the priority between the current call and the new call and decide which one is allowed to go through.\n",

This kind of train positioning is precise enough when the train is moving. Static conditions like in stations, push-pull train operation or the frequent change between static and dynamic conditions during shunting operation require hundreds of fixed mounted balise. Thus, a balise without stationary reference shall overcome this circumstance.\nAccording to Figure 12.14-1, individual coaches, trains, track side worker get equipped which such devices that report continuously the process status towards the applicable control centre enriched with the actual position information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.14-1 Positioning application areas\nTracks/lines or shunting areas are subdivided into autonomous hazard areas (red blocks see Figure 12.14-1). The continuous processing of positioning information allows the control centre to detect when hazard areas start to overlap. Based on the computed risk integral, the control centre is able to instruct the vehicles or trains in the concerned area to lower the speed up to a full stop.\nTo guarantee fail-safe operation in deriving the position of the vehicle, track-side worker etc., and independent positioning sources need to be provided. Beside inertial navigation, GNSS and others, the FRMCS System is required to be part of the positioning data acquisition process. This results from rather low predictable availability of satellite systems especially in mountain regions, multilevel railway station as well as in tunnels. In the worst case, “rough” positioning information only derived from the FRMCS – Land Mobile Network is present.\nThe combination of 3GPP radio access network and the train on-board system is able to support mechanisms that can be used to locate an entire train, stationary as well as non-stationary objects. Together with the positioning information of other sources (see Figure12.14-2) e.g. inertial navigation and GNSS, consolidated positioning information of the train/object will be computed that is able to fulfil higher accuracy of the positioning information. Train Onboard system as well as FRMCS location information system will receive the consolidated location positioning information for further processing by the train safety applications and/or FRMCS location information system.\nThe figure depicts a consolidation of positioning source information, illustrating the process of combining and organizing data from various sources to improve accuracy and efficiency in positioning systems.\nFigure 12.14-2 Consolidation of positioning source information\nThe subject described is applicable to other FRMCS functional use cases.

The destination address can be of the following formats:\nE.164 address\nUniform Resource Identifier (URI) (e.g. SIP address, URL, e-mail address…)\nEIRENE functional number\nFRMCS Functional Identity\nFRMCS User Identity\nFRMCS subscriber identity\nBased on the destination address, the FRMCS System performs the following:\nDetects the correct bearer type including characteristics\nTranslates the destination address to a routable format\nAnalyses if the destination is external to FRMCS System\nSelects an available interconnection for the bearer type. (Interconnection selection can be either a direct or indirect connection, e.g. gateway)\nAttempts to setup the communication session\nCase2 (Communication is to be established from an external network towards FRMCS system)\nAn external network user tries to establish a communication session towards an FRMCS User.

It relies on the flexible use of 3GPP and non 3GPP bearer services and allows user to user as well as multi-user communication.\n\nThe figure depicts a communication mode in a FRMCS (Frequency Reconfigurable Multilevel Coded Spread Spectrum) network, illustrating the on-network communication process. The diagram shows the various components involved, such as the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and the communication medium (CM). The figure highlights the use of frequency reconfiguration to adapt to changing network conditions, ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 12.17-1 FRMCS On-network communication mode\nOn-network communication is used for Mobile FRMCS User (onboard) to Ground FRMCS User (controller) communication.\nOff-network only communication mode uses a dedicated radio bearer service for proximity communication which is supported by FRMCS Equipment. It relies on an appropriate 3GPP bearer service that allows user to user as well as multi-user communication without direct involvement of FRMCS land mobile network. A relay function in Off-network communication mode can extend the range of the communication facilities. FRMCS Equipment may bridge a distance for proximity communications of up to 3km.\n\nThe figure depicts a communication mode for off-network communication in FRMCS (Frequency Reconfigurable Multilevel Coded Spread Spectrum) systems. It illustrates the communication process, including the use of frequency reconfigurability and the use of multiple levels of spread spectrum modulation. The figure shows the communication path, including the base station (BS), the user equipment (UE), and the communication medium (CM). The figure also includes the communication medium, which is a combination of frequency reconfigurability and spread spectrum modulation. The figure is used to illustrate the communication process in FRMCS systems and to understand the communication path and communication medium used in these systems.\nFigure 12.17-2: FRMCS Off-network communication mode\nOff-network communication can be used for e.g. shunting or banking communication where not always a ground FRMCS User i.e. controller is necessary. Off-network communication provides also the backup if On-network communication is unavailable.\nCombined On-and Off-network communication mode encompasses the parallel use of the FRMCS land mobile network and the radio bearer service for proximity communication. There are various sub-categories for this communication mode:\nRelay mode 1: \tA FRMCS Equipment uses On-network and Off-network communication and constitutes an On- and Off-network relay function to other FRMCS Equipment’s that are in Off-network only communication mode.\n\nThe figure depicts a relay mode 1 communication system, illustrating the on-network and off-network communication modes. The system uses a relay network to transmit data between the source and destination nodes. The relay nodes are equipped with a relaying module that can transmit data to the destination node. The relaying module is designed to minimize the energy consumption and maximize the data transmission rate. The figure also shows the communication modes, including the relay mode 1, relay mode 2, and relay mode 3, which are used to transmit data between the source and destination nodes. The relay mode 1 communication system is designed to be energy-efficient and reliable, making it suitable for use in various communication applications.\nFigure 12.17-3: FRMCS On-network and Off-network communication mode - Relay mode 1\nOn-network and off network communication mode relay mode 1 bridge over the coupling loss for FRMCS Users in a train that do not have access to the roof antenna. Hence, relay mode 1 helps to overcome radio link issues in a train.\nRelay mode 2: FRMCS equipment encompasses On-network and Off-network communication that enables Off-network bearer service for an Off-network only communication relay function.\n\nFRMCS (Forward Relay Mode Communication) is a communication mode used in the relay network, where the relay node forwards the data to the destination node. In this mode, the relay node forwards the data to the destination node, and the destination node forwards the data to the source node. The relay node then forwards the data to the destination node, and the source node forwards the data to the relay node. This mode is used to improve the reliability and efficiency of the communication network.\nFigure 12.17- 4: FRMCS On-network/Off-network communication mode - Relay mode 2\nRelay mode 2 is an extension of relay mode 1 that allows e.g. the concatenation of maintenance teams during tunnel maintenance activities.\nRelay mode 3: FRMCS Equipment encompasses On-network and Off-network communication. Each FRMCS Equipment is able to constitute an On-network and Off-network relay function. Interworking between one and several of such relay functions allows the use of multipath transport facilities for communication purposes.\nThe figure depicts a relay mode communication system, where the FRMCS (Forward Relay Mode Communication System) is used for on-network and off-network communication. The relay mode system is designed to provide reliable communication in both on-network and off-network scenarios. The figure shows the communication paths and the relay nodes involved in the system.\nFigure 12.17-5: FRMCS On-network-and Off-network communication mode - Relay mode 3\nRelay mode 3 allows multipath transport facilities for FRMCS Applications that require extreme high communication reliability e.g. control command signaling applications like ATP.\nOn-network only communication\nFRMCS Equipment is authorised to use On-network communication mode.\nFRMCS Users are attached to the FRMCS System and is authorised to establish user to user and/or multi-user communication.\nOff-network only communication\nFRMCS Equipment is authorised to use Off-network only communication mode.

Disturbance in the complex railway system can have a significant impact for example in the manufacturing process if components cannot be delivered in-time. There are significant improvements in train punctuality and track utilisation by using Automatic Train Protection (ATP) systems. Unavailability of the FRMCS System, FRMCS sub-systems or simple components can cause a significant impact to railway operation.\nATP provides different levels of operation. The moving block mode is the most demanding one that requires multiple times more information in one second, e.g., position reports from the train towards the ground controlling entity which computes continuously the risk that consecutive trains can collide.\nIn order to minimise the risk of FRMCS System unavailability, Single Point of Failures (SPOF) need to be eliminated. There are different strategies such as duplication of components, subsystems or the entire system. The mode of system redundancy ranges from hot-standby, warm-standby to cold-standby. Hot-standby is the most demanding mode and requires an instantaneous continuation of the end-to-end service. Also the use of only one spectrum block represents a SPOF. In case one spectrum block become unavailable due to wideband jamming or similar, the FRMCS System needs to be able to make flexible use of spectrum to minimize the risk of radio path unavailability.\nFRMCS System or sub-system maintenance may cause outages of some minutes or hours. Today, a high utilisation of rail tracks already reduces the number of maintenance windows. A redundant deployment of the radio access sub-system allows continuation of rail operation while one part of radio access sub-system is under maintenance.\n",

            "description": "This TR provides use cases and potential requirements for Railway Communication. It is proposed to start normative work based on these potential requirements.\nWhere applicable, it is proposed to include the requirements identified by this work into the set of existing stage 1 missing critical and other specifications.\nRequirements not fitting to any existing specification are proposed to go into a new TS.\nThis annex gives some examples on how Role management is used in the railway environment. This is to better understand the use.\nFunctional identity\nEvery operational railway function e.g. train driver, a shunter or Controller is identified by their functions. A non-exhaustive list is provided in the table underneath.\n\n\nIn order to make a function of a user known to other users, the user has to register itself to a specific functional identity.\nFor example, user can be authorised by the railway undertaking to be a train driver (functional Role) of a train. When the Driver starts the scheduled train ride, from A to B at time x, the train running schedule assigns a specific train running number for this train. In principle the train keeps this number for the complete journey. The train driver uses his communication equipment to register himself, as the leading train driver (functional Role), of train number 123 (functional identity). After registration the train driver is now registered to the FRMCS System as the leading train driver of train 123. In some cases there can be multiple Drivers on one train, so the individual Drivers can register themselves accordingly.\nFRMCS Equipment Type\nThe equipment used in the railway environment can be very specific. The FRMCS Equipment is constituted of an UE and the FRMCS Application on this UE. This depends on the location and situation the equipment is used. The following different equipment types can be used, as an example:\n\nThese different types of FRMCS Equipment are relevant for the registration process of functional identities. For example a train driver cannot register to a functional identity using a FRMCS Equipment which is not fit for the train driver to perform his Role. So a train driver cannot perform a registration as train driver of train 123 if he uses a catering staff FRMCS Equipment (where there is no train emergency button available, no loudspeaker and handset, etc.). The registration request will be rejected by the FRMCS System.\nThe FRMCS Equipment shall also be reachable based on the identity of the FRMCS Equipment. For example the cabin radio of a specific train can be reached by their FRMCS Equipment Identity.\nFRMCS User identity\nThe railway employee (a specific person) is also reachable even if no functional identity has been assigned. This is done by using a unique FRMCS User identity. This can be an E.164 number, any other number according to a specific railways numbering plan or by fully qualified domain names (FQDN). Such a number or FQDN is dedicated/ assigned to a specific railway employee. After the employee has performed the log-in procedure to the FRMCS System, he is reachable via his individual FRMCS User identity.\n\nIn this annex, minimum functional and performance requirements [5]-[6] are introduced for FRMCS from a perspective of Korea's LTE-based railway services. Here, the term ‘minimum’ is used from the fact that the requirements are expected to be satisfied even with previous Rel. version of 3GPP LTE. Specifically, all the functionalities and performance requirements except for the high speed (500km/h) listed in the above have been shown to be fully supported by LTE Rel. 9, which have been validated in a commercial railway with a length of 54.2km [7]. Also, train control service named as Korea Radio-Based Train Control System (KRTCS) has been shown to be feasible by handling priorities among multiple data, where the level of KRTCS is equivalent to European Train Control System (ETCS) level 3 in a train control perspective. All the specific test scenarios regarding functional and performance requirements including KRTCS have been validated in a commercial railway [8]. For promising FRMCS supporting LTE Rel. 15, more enhanced and sophisticated requirements should be provided. In that sense, these requirements can be considered as basic functional and performance requirements for FRMCS.\nMinimum functional requirements\nIn a communication perspective, the followings can be minimum functional requirements for LTE based railway communication systems. The contents of each function and each digital radio equipment are described in detail in [5]-[6].\n\nMinimum performance requirements\nIn the following table, specific performance requirements are listed as a base line of performance requirements for real FRMCS. The detailed performance of a railway communications system and the contents of the interface for each equipment are described in detail in [5]-[6].\n\nThe different types of communication and support applications related to On-Network and Off-Network are covered by the table below:\nTable C-1. Applicability to On-network/Off-network to use cases.\n\n",
