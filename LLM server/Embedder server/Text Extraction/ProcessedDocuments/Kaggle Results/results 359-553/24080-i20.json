X.680 and X.681.\nThe mapping of OPERATION and ERROR to components is defined in clause 3 of this specification.\nThe encoding rules which are applicable to the defined abstract syntax are the Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation One, defined in ITU-T Rec. X.690 with the same exceptions as stated in TS 29.002. For each Supplementary Service parameter which has to be transferred by a Supplementary Service message, there is a PDU field (an ASN.1 NamedType) whose ASN.1 identifier has the same name as the corresponding parameter, except for the differences required by the ASN.1 notation (blanks between words are removed, the first letter of the first word is lower-case and the first letter of the following words are capitalized (e.g. \"bearer service\" is mapped to \"bearerService\"). In addition some words may be abbreviated as follows:\n-\tms\tmobile subscriber;\n-\tss\tsupplementary services;\n-\tcug\tclosed user group.\nThe ASN.1 data type which follows the words \"ARGUMENT\", \"PARAMETER\" or \"RESULT\" (for information objects of class \"OPERATION\" and \"ERROR\") is always optional from a syntactic point of view. However, except specific mention, it has to be considered as mandatory from a semantic point of view. When in an invoke component, a mandatory element is missing in any component or inner data structure, a reject component is returned with the problem code \"Mistyped Parameter\". When an optional element is missing in an invoke component or in an inner data structure while it is required by the context, an error component is returned; the associated type of error is \"DataMissing\".\nIn case an element is defined as mandatory in the protocol description (TS 24.080 including imports from TS 29.002), but is not present according to the service description (stage 1 to stage 3), the ASN.1 protocol description takes precedence over the diagrams in the TS 24.08x and 24.09x-series of technical specifications.\nWhen possible operations and errors are imported from TS 29.002 thereby making the MSC transparent to most of the messages sent to or from the MS.\nTimer values for operations which require timers are shown as ASN.1 comments.\nThe extension marker \"…\" shall be used in the same way as described in TS 29.002 and shall be supported on the radio interface by the MS and the network for all operations defined in this specification including those imported from TS 29.002.\n",

For the definition of the allowed operations for the individual supplementary services, see TS 24.08x and 24.09x-series of technical specifications.\nThis error is returned by the network when it is requested to perform an operation which is not compatible with the current status of the relevant supplementary service. The current status may be given as additional information by use of the SS-parameter.\nThis error is returned by the network when it is requested to perform an operation on a supplementary service which is not available in the current location area.\nThis error is returned by the network when it is requested to perform an operation on a supplementary service, transgressing the subscription restrictions. The nature of the restriction or the transgressed options may be sent as parameters.\nThis error is returned by the network when it is requested for a supplementary service operation incompatible with the status of an other supplementary service or with the teleservice or bearer service for which the operation is requested. This error shall only be used if the operation is not compatible for even a subset of the teleservice group or bearer service group specified in the request. The identity and status of the conflicting service may also be indicated. The additional information may contain the SS-code parameter, the Basic Service Group parameter and the SS-status parameter.\nThis error is returned by the network, when it cannot perform an operation because of a failure in the network.\nThis error is returned by the network when an optional parameter is missing in an invoke component or an inner data structure, while it is required by the context of the request.\nThis error is returned by the network when it receives a parameter with an unexpected value, without type violation.\nThis error is returned when a password registration procedure fails because of abnormal subscriber inputs. A more specific diagnostic may be passed as error parameter and indicates situations such as:\n-\tinvalid password format;\n-\tnew passwords mismatch.\nThis error is returned to indicate the negative result of a password check because the subscriber has not provided the required password or has provided a password which does not match the valid one.\nThis error is returned by the network receiving a request about a facility which is not supported in the PLMN.\nThis error is returned by the network to the MS if temporarily there are no resources to support e.g. a multi party call available in the network.\nThis error is returned by the network to the MS if the request must be rejected because the number of subscribers to join a multi party call would exceed the maximum value.\nThis error is returned by the network to the MS when call independent subscriber control procedures are barred by the operator. The parameter \"operator barring\" shall be included.\nThis error is returned by the network to the MS when the maximum number of wrong password attempts is exceeded.\nThis error is returned when the subscriber has activated the detach service or the system detects the absence condition. This error is not used on the radio interface but only between network entities.\nThis error is returned when illegality of the access has been established by use of authentication procedure. This error is not used on the radio interface but only between network entities.\nThis error is returned when the IMEI check procedure has shown that the IMEI is prohibited listed or not permitted listed. This error is not used on the radio interface but only between network entities.\nThis error is returned by the MS to the network when the MS is not able to process the unstructured supplementary service data operation due to an on-going MMI input of the user or an already existing call independent supplementary service transaction.\nThis error is returned by the MS or the network when the alphabet/language used for the unstructured supplementary service data operation is not known by the network or the MS.\nThis error is returned if the requested deflected-to number is invalid.\nThis error is returned if diversion to a special service code was requested.\nThis error is returned if a diversion to the served subscriber's number was requested.\nThis error is returned by the network when the network rejects User-to-User Signalling service request.\nThis error is returned by the remote party when the remote party rejects User-to-User Signalling service request.\nThis error is returned by the network when the network is unable to obtain any of the location information requested or none of the information obtained satisfies the requested LCS QoS or if requested LCS assistance data could not be transferred or requested deciphering keys for broadcast assistance data could not be returned.\nThis error is returned when a requested operation cannot be performed due to insufficient resources.\nThis error is returned when a requested operation is from a invalid PRU.\nThis error is returned when a requested operation cannot be accepted by the network, e.g., the target LMF is not the correct serving LMF of the PRU, and the routing ID of a new serving LMF may be returned to the PRU.\n",
