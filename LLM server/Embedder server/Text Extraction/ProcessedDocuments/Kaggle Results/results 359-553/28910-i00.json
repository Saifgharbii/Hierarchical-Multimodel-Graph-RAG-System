And in clause 6.1 of TS 28.104 [6], management loop including observation, analytics, decision, execution is specified as well. The management control loop and management loop defined in TS 28.535 [13] and TS 28.104 [6] are similar, and both of them have the similar consideration with the workflow specified in TS 28.100 [4], i.e. awareness, analysis, decision and execution. MDA role in the management loop is within the scope of analytics (see TS 28.100 [4]).\nIn addition to the above four items included in management control loop or management loop, intent handling is also introduced in TS 28.100 [4] which means certain autonomous network levels are required to support intent driven management control loop autonomously. And in clause 4.2.2 of TS 28.312 [5], intent driven MnS is defined with the capabilities including intent translation and intent fulfilment result/information evaluating, which are the main tasks included in the categorization of intent handling defined in clause 4.3.4 of TS 28.100 [4].\nAnd if Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) technology is utilized in autonomous networks, AI/ML model training MnS specified in TS 28.105 [14], can be used to enable analytics or decision autonomy capabilities and thus to achieve certain autonomous network levels.\n",

                            "text_content": "TS 28.100 [4] specifies the framework approach for evaluating autonomous network levels and concrete autonomous network level definition for network optimization, RAN NE deployment and fault management. Each autonomous network level definition includes workflow, classification of autonomous network level, autonomy capability description for management system, MnS requirements and solutions for generic MnS requirements. The autonomous network level definition in TS 28.100 [4] can be used to determine the ANL (L0-L5) for corresponding scenarios.\nAutonomy functionalities such as SON functionalities, MDA functionalities, intent handling functionalities or combination of these management functionalities can be used to satisfy autonomy capabilities identified in different autonomous network level. For example, the CCO functionality can be used to satisfy the autonomy capabilities identified in level 3 for coverage optimization. So, from NOP view, if a NOP have a target to make its network to achieve certain autonomous network level specified by TS 28.100 [4], it is necessary to know which autonomy functionalities provided by corresponding NEP(s) can be used to satisfy the autonomy capabilities in corresponding autonomous network level.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with multiple network functions (NEPs) providing various functionalities, such as network slicing, network slicing, and network slicing.\nFigure 6.3.1.1-1: Autonomy functionalities provided by multiple NEPs\nCorrespondingly, the 3GPP management system should support these autonomy functionalities to realize autonomy capabilities to support certain autonomous network level.\nDifferent MnS Consumers (e.g. Operator) have different autonomy requirements (represented by ANL) for the same or different scenarios. Even same MnS consumer may have different autonomy requirements for different scenarios of same scenario type. For example, MnS consumer expect level 3 for the radio coverage optimization scenario, while expect level 2 for the RAN UE throughput optimization scenario. Several autonomy functionalities implemented by 3GPP management system, such as SON functionalities, MDA functionalities, intent handling functionalities or combination of these management functionalities can be used to satisfy different autonomy requirements. So, based on the expected ANL (e.g. level 3) for certain scenario (coverage optimization), 3GPP management system (as MnS producer) needs to:\n- \tIdentifies corresponding autonomy capabilities for the expected ANL based on the type of the required scenario (e.g. network optimization).\n- \tSelects one or multiple autonomy functionalities (e.g. CCO Function) to satisfy the identified autonomy capabilities and manages their inter-related execution.\n- \tDetermine the MnS(s) which is necessary to support the autonomy functionalities (e.g. specify the control information for the autonomy functionalities).\nMnS consumer needs to be aware of which autonomy functionalities can be used to satisfy its autonomy requirements and which MnS(s) can be consumed to support the performing of the functionalities. So, 3GPP management system also needs to send the identified autonomy functionalities and corresponding MnS(s) to MnS Consumer.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a system with various components, including a request for autonomy functionalities to satisfy autonomy requirements. The figure illustrates the system's architecture, with a focus on the request for autonomy functionalities, which are essential for the system to meet its autonomy requirements.\nFigure 6.3.1.2-1: Request autonomy functionalities to satisfy autonomy requirements\nBased on the obtained autonomy functionalities and corresponding MnS(s) from MnS producer, MnS consumer will assess whether to use these autonomy functionalities to fulfil the expected ANL for the expected scenario. In case MnS consumer decide to use these autonomy functionalities, MnS consumer will request MnS producer to perform these autonomy functionalities and consumer corresponding supported MnS(s) to control and monitor these autonomy functionalities.\nThe figure depicts a request to control and monitor autonomy functionalities, with a focus on the control and monitoring of autonomous vehicles. The figure includes various elements such as a request form, a list of functionalities, and a diagram illustrating the control and monitoring system. The request form includes fields for the user's name, email, and the purpose of the request, while the list of functionalities includes details such as the ability to control the vehicle's speed, steering, and braking. The diagram illustrates the control and monitoring system, showing how the system interacts with the vehicle's sensors and actuators to ensure the vehicle's safety and performance.\nFigure 6.3.1.3-1: Request to control and monitor autonomy functionalities\n",
