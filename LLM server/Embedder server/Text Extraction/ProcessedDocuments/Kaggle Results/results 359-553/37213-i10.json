The basic unit for sensing is a sensing slot with a duration . The sensing slot duration  is considered to be idle if an eNB/gNB or a UE senses the channel during the sensing slot duration, and determines that the detected power for at least  within the sensing slot duration is less than energy detection threshold . Otherwise, the sensing slot duration  is considered to be busy.\n-\tA channel occupancy refers to transmission(s) on channel(s) by eNB/gNB/UE(s) after performing the corresponding channel access procedures in this clause.\n-\tA Channel Occupancy Time refers to the total time for which eNB/gNB/UE and any eNB/gNB/UE(s) sharing the channel occupancy perform transmission(s) on a channel after an eNB/gNB/UE performs the corresponding channel access procedures described in this clause. For determining a Channel Occupancy Time, if a transmission gap is less than or equal to , the gap duration is counted in the channel occupancy time. A channel occupancy time can be shared for transmission between an eNB/gNB and the corresponding UE(s).\n-\tA DL transmission burst is defined as a set of transmissions from an eNB/gNB without any gaps greater than . Transmissions from an eNB/gNB separated by a gap of more than  are considered as separate DL transmission bursts. An eNB/gNB can transmit transmission(s) after a gap within a DL transmission burst without sensing the corresponding channel(s) for availability.\n-\tA UL transmission burst is defined as a set of transmissions from a UE without any gaps greater than . Transmissions from a UE separated by a gap of more than 16s are considered as separate UL transmission bursts. A UE can transmit transmission(s) after a gap within a UL transmission burst without sensing the corresponding channel(s) for availability.\n-\tA SL transmission burst is defined as a set of SL transmissions from a UE without any gaps greater than . The SL transmissions from a UE separated by a gap of more than 16s, are considered as separate SL transmission bursts. A UE can transmit SL transmission(s) after a gap within a SL transmission burst without sensing the corresponding channel(s) for availability.\n-\tA discovery burst refers to a DL transmission burst including a set of signal(s) and/or channel(s) confined within a window and associated with a duty cycle. The discovery burst can be any of the following:\n-\tTransmission(s) initiated by an eNB that includes a primary synchronization signal (PSS), secondary synchronization signal (SSS) and cell-specific reference signal(s)(CRS) and may include non-zero power CSI reference signals (CSI-RS).\n-\tTransmission(s) initiated by a gNB that includes at least an SS/PBCH block consisting of a primary synchronization signal (PSS), secondary synchronization signal (SSS), physical broadcast channel (PBCH) with associated demodulation reference signal (DM-RS) and may also include CORESET for PDCCH scheduling PDSCH with SIB1, and PDSCH carrying SIB1 and/or non-zero power CSI reference signals (CSI-RS).\n",
