If UAV and UAV-C pairing is done dynamically, UAV requests USS authorization for Direct C2 via 5GC using a PDU Session establishment/modification procedure.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether authorization for direct C2 communication over PC5 can be supported using enhancement to existing authorization of C2 communication mechanism as specified in TS 23.256 [5] or via a separate procedure.\nThe PC5 based Unicast link for C2 communication between the UAV and the UAV controller is only supported over NR based PC5 reference point. Figure 6.1.3.2-1 illustrates an example of PC5 unicast link for C2 communication.\nThe figure depicts a two-way communication link between a UAV and UAV-C using PC5 Unicast Link. The UAV-C is equipped with a PC5 Unicast Link, which enables efficient communication between the two UAVs. The figure illustrates the UAV-C's position relative to the UAV, as well as the UAV's position relative to the PC5 Unicast Link. The PC5 Unicast Link is a crucial component of the UAV-C's communication system, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between the two UAVs.\nFigure 6.1.3.2-1: C2 communication between UAV and UAV-C using PC5 Unicast Link\nFor C2 communication over the PC5 unicast link, the principles of Unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication as specified in clause 5.3.4 of TS 23.304 [8] apply with following considerations specific to UAV and UAV-C:\n-\tA PC5 unicast link between the UAV and the UAV-C allows communication between the Application (i.e. the C2 communication service) running in the UAV and UAV-C. The Application used for C2 communication in Figure 6.1.3.1-1 is named as \"C2 communication service\".\n-\tThe Application Layer Identity identifies the UAV and the UAV-C uniquely in the context of the C2 communication. The format of this identifier is outside the scope of 3GPP.\n-\tThe PC5 unicast link supports C2 communication using a single network layer protocol e.g. IP or non-IP.\n-\tThere may be multiple QoS flow in a single PC5 Unicast Link for C2 communication. This is based on the per-flow QoS model as specified in clause 5.6.1 of TS 23.304 [8].\nThis procedure is performed when the UAV is always controlled by a single UAV-C. The Application Layer ID and the Layer-2 IDs of the peers are pre-configured in the UAV and the UAV-C.\nTo perform unicast mode of Direct communication over PC5 reference point for C2 communication, the UE is configured with the related information as described in clause 6.1.3.1.1.\nFigure 6.1.3.2.1-1 shows the PC5 Unicast Link establishment for C2 communication which is based the procedure for Layer-2 link establishment over PC5 reference point as described in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8].\nFor PC5 Unicast link established, only \"UE oriented Layer-2 link establishment\" procedure as described in clause 6.4.3.1 if TS 23.304 [8] (option A) is supported for UAV.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether a single UAV-C can control multiple UAVs at the same time. If so, the UAV-C may broadcast Direct Communication Request and \"ProSe Service oriented Layer-2 link establishment\" procedure as described in clause 6.4.3.1 if TS 23.304 [8] (option B) may be supported.\nThe procedure for Layer-2 link establishment over PC5 reference point as described in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8] is followed with below modification:\nThe figure depicts a PC5 Unicast Link establishment for C2 communication, illustrating the steps involved in establishing a reliable and efficient communication link between two devices. The diagram includes various components such as the PC5 interface, the C2 device, and the communication channel, all of which are essential for the successful establishment of the link. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the process, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 6.1.3.2.1-1: PC5 Unicast Link establishment for C2 communication\n1.\tThe UAV determines the destination Layer-2 ID for reception of signalling related to PC5 unicast link establishment for C2 communication.\n2.\tThe application layer (i.e. the C2 communication service) of the UAV-C provides application information for PC5 unicast communication. The application information shall include the Service Info, UAV-C's Application Layer ID and the target UAV's Application Layer ID.\n3.\tThe UAV-C unicasts a Direct Communication Request message to the UAV using the configured source Layer-2 ID and the destination Layer-2 ID.\n4.\tSame as step 4a in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8].\n5.\tSame as step 5a in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8].\n6.\tSame as step 6 in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8]. C2 communication data can be now transmitted over the established unicast link. The UAV-C sends the C2 data using its own Layer-2 ID as the source Layer-2 ID and UAV's Layer-2 ID as the destination Layer-2 ID for this unicast link. Similarly, the UAV uses its own Layer-2 ID as the source Layer-2 ID and the UAV-C's Layer-2 ID as the destination Layer-2 ID when sending C2 communication data to the UAV-C.\nThis procedure is performed when the UAV is controlled different UAV-C at different time i.e. there is no fixed controller dedicated to a UAV. The UAV-C learns the Layer-2 ID of the UAV using the Direct Discovery procedure and then the UAV-C uses the Layer-2 ID for establishing the PC5 Unicast link.\nFigure 6.1.3.2.2-1 shows the PC5 Unicast Link establishment for C2 communication with dynamic discovery of the UAV.\nThe figure depicts a PC5 Unicast Link establishment for C2 communication with dynamic discovery, illustrating the process of establishing a link between two devices. The figure shows the steps involved in the link establishment, including the use of dynamic discovery to automatically discover new devices. The figure is a visual representation of the process, providing a clear and concise explanation of the steps involved in establishing a PC5 Unicast Link.\nFigure 6.1.3.2.2-1: PC5 Unicast Link establishment for C2 communication with dynamic discovery\n1.\tThe UAV-C uses the Direct Discovery (wither Model A or Model B) as described in clause 6.3 of TS 23.304 [8] to discover the UAV and the associated Layer-2 ID. Restricted discovery mechanism is used for UAV discovery. When model A is used the UAV-C acts as the announcing UE and the UAV acts as the monitoring UE. In model B, the UAV-C acts as the discoverer and the UAV acts as the Discoveree. USS/UTM may act as ProSe Application Server to enable Restricted discovery on behalf of and transparently to USS as described above.\n2.\tAfter the Layer-2 ID of the UAV is learnt by the UAV-C at step 1, it follows the procedure described in clause 6.1.3.2.1 to establish the PC5 Unicast Link.\n3.\tC2 communication data can be now transmitted over the established unicast link. The UAV-C sends the C2 data using its own Layer-2 ID as the source Layer-2 ID and UAV's Layer-2 ID as the destination Layer-2 ID for this unicast link. Similarly, the UAV uses its own Layer-2 ID as the source Layer-2 ID and the UAV-C's Layer-2 ID as the destination Layer-2 ID when sending C2 communication data to the UAV-C.\n",

A UAV without utilizing Uu capabilities may use U2X for BRID and DAA and be configured via U2X1 over a transport outside the scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE:\tUAV UEs without utilizing Uu capabilities are part of the 3GPP ecosystem since they use U2X1 for configuration by a U2X Application Server and implement PC5 connectivity specified by 3GPP.\nFor roaming scenarios, since U2X communication is based solely on PC5, there is no local breakout or home routed scenario. The roaming functional architecture is as follows:\nThe figure depicts a 5G system architecture for U2X communication over PC5, illustrating the local breakout scenario. It shows the various components and their interactions, such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.

The architecture for the Inter-PLMN PC5 case is similar to the one defined in clause 6.5.3.1.\nAs defined in TS 23.287 [9], the 5G System provides NEF services to enable communication between NFs in the PLMN and U2X Application Server.

This architecture is designed to support advanced features such as adaptive frequency reuse, which enables efficient use of spectrum resources. The figure illustrates the various components involved in the system, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers.

Therefore, it is considered useful to provide signal strength/status of C2 connection over PC5 (e.g. strong/good, weak/bad) to the application layer. In particular, this information would be beneficial for UAV-C so that the user (i.e. a drone pilot) can know C2 connection status and decide what to do for C2 communication, e.g. switching to C2 connection over network, C2 connection release after landing UAV, etc. In order to help UAV-C (or its user) decide what to do for C2 communication, indication whether C2 connection over network is possible can be also provided to the application layer of UAV-C.\nIn this solution, the layer of UAV-C that collects the above information related to C2 connection (i.e. C2 connection status information) and provides it to the application is called \"UAS layer\". In the context of UAS, the UAS layer can perform PC5 related operations that are performed by the V2X layer specified in TS 23.287 [9] and the ProSe layer specified in TS 23.304 [8], in the context of V2X and ProSe, respectively.

The AAM includes one or more UEs enabled for use of PC5. The AAM may also have a direct connection to the Data Network. It acts as a TPAE having specific abilities for direct communication with UAVs relevant for the applicable airspace.\n-\tFor the applicable airspace of the area/arena the AAM may define local DAA rules for correspondingly located UAVs. The local DAA rules may e.g.be based on detailed information on the facilities in and maps of the area/arena together with an awareness of the current usage need for the airspace and they.\n-\tThe AAM local DAA rules must comply with the policies for PC5 operations received from the 5GC or being preconfigured in the UE.\n-\tThe ground-based system AAM is able to scan the airspace of the area/arena for drones (UAVs) e.g. by making use of with upward pointing radars and cameras.\n-\tDetected UAVs are identified by their coordinates and Remote ID as retrieved by Broadcast Remote ID (BRID) or Network Remote ID (NRID) mechanisms dependent on the method used by the UAV. The solution is not dependent on what method that is used for transmitting the Remote ID from the UAV as long as it is supported for retrieval by the AAM.\n-\tBased on the retrieved Remote ID, the AAM establishes PC5 communication with each detected UAV. A UAV does not have to know the AAM address in advance.\n-\tTo discover the UAV to set up PC5 direct communication with the AAM uses ProSe Direct Discovery over PC5 reference point using method B as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.304 [8] with an application-service indicating AAM-UAS-control and providing the detected Remote-ID as Application-Layer-ID in the solicitation message. As a result of this procedure the discovered UAV having the specified Remote-ID it's Layer-2-ID to the AAM.\n-\tTo establish the PC5 direct communication link with the discovered UAV the AAM uses the \"UE-oriented link establishment procedure\" described in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8] (option A) to connect to the discovered Layer-2-ID (i.e. to the UAV with the detected Remote-ID).\n-\tFor Direct Discovery over PC5 the UAV and AAM shall comply with the authorization and provisioning principles described in clause 5.1.2 of TS 23.304 [8] including the following:\n-\tPLMNs in which UE is authorized to perform Model B Discoveree operation shall be provided .\n-\tThe destination Layer-2 ID to be used for initial signalling over PC5 interface of discovery message the\n\"AAM-UAS-control\" service.\n-\tSecurity parameters used for direct discovery over PC5 shall provided.\n-\tFor Direct Communication over PC5 the UAV and AAM shall comply with the authorization and provisioning principles described in clause 5.1.3 of TS 23.304 [8] including the following considerations:\n-\tThe service for \"AAM-UAS-control\" shall be included in the list of ProSe services.\n-\tThe destination Layer-2 ID to be used for initial signalling to establish a unicast connection for the \"AAM-UAS-control\" service.\n-\tParameters for Broadcast and Groupcast are not applicable.\n-\tThe AAM uses PC5 to provide each UAS present in the arena/area with local DAA policies. As an example, this might be used to prevent new drones from running into each other or facility details.\n-\tA UAV that receives local DAA related policies from an the AAM over PC5 is expected to forward the policies to its UAV-C.\nNOTE:\tThe policies may be provided as a transparent container to the UAV with the UAV-C as final receiver.\n-\tA UAV-C that receives local policies for DAA from an AAM, is expected to steer the UAV accordingly by use of C2 communication (e.g. over Uu, PC5, or other means) in order to enforce the local policies and avoid collisions.\n-\tA UAV-C that receives local policies for DAA from an AAM, may inform the AAM of its network address (e.g. IP address or URL) to enable direct AAM to UAV-C communication via Data Network.\n-\tUAVs using different PLMNs shall be supported.\n-\tBoth LTE PC5 and NR PC5 are supported.\n-\tThis solution leverages mechanisms as defined in TS 23.287 [9] and TS 23.304 [8] with the differences described in this solution.\n-\tThe UAS, i.e. the UAV and its UAV-C, may use any means for C2 communication. Direct communication over PC5 or Uu communication via the 3GPP system may e.g. be used but also communication methods not specified by 3GPP. For a case where the UAV have the control function (UAV-C) collocated to e.g. act autonomously UAV internal communication may be used.\n-\tReception of the BRID is the responsibility of the AAM.\n-\tIt is assumed that the NRID information is retrieved from the UTM based on the UAV position as detected by the AAM airspace scanning system, i.e. the NRID information is not streamed directly to the AAM from the UAV. The ability for the AAM to access NRID information should be from the UTM, rather than from the individual UAV.\n-\tThe NRID information is assumed to be fetched from the UTM (e.g. RID-USS etc.) based on positioning information retrieved by the AAM using airspace scanning systems like upward radars, cameras etc. Subscription from the UTM on notification of NRID information for UAVs in the applicable area/airspace might be an additional mechanism to use, if needed.\n-\tLocal policies for DAA may be used to avoid collisions between drones or prevent the drones from wandering into obstructions or off-limits areas. It may for example be the owner of the arena that provides these local policies. However, the existence of local policies does not release drones from also following any general policies provided by authorities.\n-\tPC5 Unicast communication is used to provide local policies.\n-\tThe same or different local policies may be provided to the drones in the arena. Drones may for example, be given different fly zones in the arena just like people have different seating in an arena.\n-\tThe typical use case is that one company or organization is in control of the arena or the event area. As such one AAM may be sufficient in the arena/area. If there are multiple AAMs in the same arena/area, they are assumed to be configured to provide the same policies. This solution does not require any online coordination between potential multiple AAMs.\nThe figure depicts a logical architecture for ground-based Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS), illustrating the interconnection of various components such as the base station (BTS), distributed antenna elements (DAEs), and the ground network.

The adaptations in Solution #4 includes reusing CAA-level UAV ID as application layer identity and may derive C2 communication service identifier from the CAA-level UAV ID.\nTwo methods of authorization for C2 communication over PC5 are supported in Solution #1 and Solution #4.

It would also require that the USS supports additional Prose discovery related functionalities such as the management of Prose Restricted code suffixes, masks, etc. or interfaces with such an AF.

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "The description of KI#3 assumes that direct UAV to UAV communication via PC5 based on the enhancements of the existing PC5 direct communication is the baseline mechanism for DAA solution. It also allows exploring network-assisted or ground-based solutions.\nThere are three solutions: Solution #2, Solution #5 and Solution #7, that address Key Issue #3.\nSolution #2 doesn't cover the baseline mechanism and instead focuses on the network-assisted DAA approach. Two Options are proposed, including network-assisted DAA with calculation functionality (Option A) and network-assisted DAA without calculation functionality (Option B). In Option A, the collision detection is performed at the USS based on the \"relative location\" or clearance calculation reported by the GMLC. The solution applies to UAV UEs that register to the network and are in coverage. The solution applies to USS-driven DAA scenarios where the USS triggers DAA deconfliction between pairs of UAVs based on knowledge of flight paths. A significant limitation of Option A is that it is only applicable to the UAVs controlled by the same USS and served by the same PLMN. It also requires new functionalities in the GMLC to support \"relative location\" calculation and report. . In Option B, USS as AF/LCS client obtains UAV location using the legacy LCS procedure, and calculates the relative positioning result by itself. Option B applies to the UAV UEs belonging to the same PLMN or different PLMNs but still has the limitation that UAVs belong to the same USS.\nSolution #2 requires that the absolute location of all the UEs shall be determined exactly at the same time. If the positioning of the UEs is not performed at the same time, the relative distance measurement will not be correct. Considering that the location determination takes several seconds and also the time required varies from UE to UE, it is practically not possible to have exact location of all the UEs at the same time. So, the solution does not work in a real-world scenario. The GMLC or the AF shall also have knowledge about the UAVs flight path in order to provide an accurate notification to the USS.\nAdditionally, periodically obtaining location of all the UEs and performing the relative distance between all the UEs is not at all a scalable solution. For example, if the list contains 10 UEs, the GMLC (or AF in option B) will have to first obtain absolute location of all the 10 UEs (all calculated at the same time), and then determine the relative distance between all of them, which will lead to determining total 45 relative distances (i.e. 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1). As the number of UEs in the list will grow this number of relative distance calculation will also exponentially increase. For example: for 11 UEs 55 relative distances, for 12 UEs 66 relative distances, for 20 UEs 180 relative distances and so on. So the solution, if applied in practice, will lead to huge amount of processing need the GMLC or the AF and will not work for large number of UAVs that are expected to be served by the 3GPP network.\nSolution #7 doesn't address how collision is detected or deconflicted and focuses more on how to enable UAV controllers to follow the \"local DAA policies\" to avoid collisions. It introduces a new ground entity AAM which scans and establishes communication with the UAVs within a local area and passes the local DAA policies through the UAVs to its controllers. The solution only applies to specific scenarios where local DAA policies and ground AAMs are available. It is not clear how local DAA policies can effectively enable the UAVs/UAV-Cs to avoid collisions. The solution assumes local DAA policies are implemented by the UAV-C, and not the UAV. In scenarios of high automation where a UAV-C may control a large number of UAVs, it is FFS whether it is feasible to implement such policies in the UAV-C and not the UAV. The AAM requires a level of thrust and authorization to be able to retrieve NRID information from the UTM.\nSolution #5 covers the baseline mechanism of using direct UAV to UAV communication for DAA. It reuses the existing V2X framework with some adaptations for DAA. The detection and deconflicting of collisions are fully based on direct communication between UAVs over PC5. The solution does not require the involvement of any UTM/USS functionality or knowledge of UAV flight plans. The USS is optionally informed of the collision situation and otherwise doesn't play a role in DAA. The solution re-uses the PC5-based security mechanisms defined in 3GPP and can use an application-layer security solution to be defined outside of 3GPP (as in the case of C-V2X). The solution applies to both in-coverage UAV UEs and out-of-coverage UAV UEs, and whether the solution applies to UAV UEs served by different PLMNs and with subscriptions to different PLMNs depends on the 5G ProSe specification. It applies to most common DAA scenarios and doesn't have the limitations listed for the other solutions. This solution is only applicable to the UAVs with ProSe capability.\nSolution #5 may have the risk of a high potential amount of data that may need to be transferred, since in case of large number of UAVs in an area the solution needs to broadcast of a big amount of data. This issue may also happen to transport Broadcast Remote ID for Key Issue#2 as described in clause 5.2. There may be the scenario that a large number of Vehicle UEs in an area broadcast V2X messages over PC5, e.g. 10 messages per second from each UE. Such scenario has been already investigated for V2X sidelink communication by RAN WGs as in TR 36.885 [19] and can be managed by the AS layer, e.g. Sidelink congestion control performed by RAN node for scheduled resource allocation mode and performed by UE for UE autonomous resource selection mode as defined in TS 36.300 [20], TS 38.300 [21] and TR 37.985 [22]. Therefore, it is considered that there is no issue on the potential large amount of data transfer related to PC5 based DAA mechanism and PC5 based BRID mechanism.\n",

In this case the UAV UE performs C2 communication authorization following the procedure define in TS 23.256 [5], before initiating UAV to UAV-C direct communication over PC5.\nThe Unicast mode 5G Prose Direct Communication procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3 of TS 23.304 [8] is used as the baseline for establishing C2 communication over PC5, with the following enhancements and adaptations:\n-\tProse Service info is replaced with \"C2 Communication Service\".\n-\tC2 Communication Service identifier may be pre-configured or derived from the CAA-level UAV ID.\nBoth UE-oriented and service-oriented unicast link establishment are supported as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [8].\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery needs to be supported and whether UAS NF can produce ProSe AF functionalities to support restricted discovery.\n",
