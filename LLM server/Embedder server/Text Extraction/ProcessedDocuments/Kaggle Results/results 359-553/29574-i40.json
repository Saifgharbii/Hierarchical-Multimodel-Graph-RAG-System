The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/analytics-subscriptions\" as Resource URI representing the \"DCCF Analytics Subscriptions\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create an \"Individual DCCF Analytics Subscription\" according to the information in the message body. The NdccfAnalyticsSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tanalytics subscription information within the \"anaSub\" attribute;\n-\ta notification target address within the \"anaNotifUri\" attribute; and\n-\ta notification correlation identifier in the \"anaNotifCorrId\" attribute;\nand may include:\n-\tthe notification endpoints within the \"notifEndpoints\" attribute, if the \"DataAnaCollect\" feature is supported;\n-\tformatting instructions within the \"formatInstruct\" attribute;\n-\tprocessing instructions within the \"procInstructs\" attribute;\n-\tthe indication for analytics storage within the \"storeInd\" attribute, if the \"DataAnaCollect\" feature is supported;\n-\ta target NWDAF identifier within the \"targetNfId\" attribute or a target NWDAF set identifier within the \"targetNfSetId\" attribute;\n-\tan ADRF identifier within the \"adrfId\" attribute or an ADRF set identifier within the \"adrfSetId\" attribute; and/or\n-\ttime window of performing the requested analytics within the \"timePeriod\" attribute.\nNOTE 1:\tThis time window, over which the requested data collection or analytics was performed or to be performed, is different from the analytics target period, over which the statistics or predictions are requested. For example, in a subscription that requests \"predictions that are performed during the month of May about UE_MOBILITY analytics during the month of July\", this time window is \"May\" while the analytics target period is \"July\". The DCCF can use the provided time window e.g. to determine when to (un)subscribe to the NWDAF and/or what subscription duration to indicate to it.\n-\tthe purpose of data collection within the \"dataCollectPurposes\" attribute.\n-\tthe indication that the NF service consumer has already checked the user consent within the \"checkedConsentInd\" attribute.\n-\tstorage handling information within the \"storeHandl\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and NdccfAnalyticsSubscription data structure as request body, the DCCF shall use the contents of the request (e.g. \"anaSub\" attribute in NdccfAnalyticsSubscription data structure) to determine whether the subscription can already be served or interactions with the NWDAF and/or ADRF (e.g. creation or modification of analytics subscription for Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription service) are required. If the DCCF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, when the request is syntactically valid and there is no DCCF internal error, but the DCCF can neither find an existing subscription to an NWDAF nor construct one based on the received subscription contents.\nIf the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is required for the requested analytics collection depending on local policy and regulations, then the DCCF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [20]. If the DCCF receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted user(s), then the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.\nIf the DCCF determines that the subscription can already be served (without requiring further interactions with NWDAF and/or ADRF) or a successful response from the NWDAF and/or ADRF is received for the creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the DCCF shall:\n-\tcreate a new subscription;\n-\tassign a subscriptionId;\n-\tstore the subscription.\nIf the DCCF created an \"Individual DCCF Analytics Subscription\" resource, the DCCF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, step 2. If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are accepted, then the DCCF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute within the \"anaSub\" attribute, indicating the event(s) for which the subscription failed and the associated reason(s). The DCCF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/analytics-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If the immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the \"evtReq\" attribute of the \"anaSub\" attribute sets to true in the event subscription, the DCCF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response within the \"eventNotifications\" attribute of the \"anaSub\" attribute, or, potentially within the \"immReport\" attribute, if the DataAnaCollect feature is supported.\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"evtReq\" attribute of the \"anaSub\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the DCCF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer).\nEditor's Note: It is FFS to determine whether any further provisions or limitations with regard to the usage of the \"notifFlag\" attribute are needed.\nIf the DCCF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to \"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same analytics, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 4:\tThe default operator policy for how long analytics is to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a NF service consumer's subscription to analytics notifications, with various subscription options and subscription statuses. The figure includes a list of subscription options, their corresponding subscription statuses, and a visual representation of the subscription process.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to analytics notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation to update a subscription to analytics notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/analytics-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual DCCF Analytics Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The NdccfAnalyticsSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/analytics-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI and NdccfAnalyticsSubscription data structure as request body, the DCCF shall use the contents of the request to determine whether the updated subscription can already be served or interactions with the NWDAF and/or ADRF (e.g. modification of analytics subscriptions with the NWDAF) are required. If the DCCF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, when the request is syntactically valid and there is no DCCF internal error, but the DCCF can neither find an existing subscription to an NWDAF nor construct one based on the received subscription contents.\nIf the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is required for the requested analytics collection depending on local policy and regulations, then the DCCF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [20]. If the DCCF receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted user(s), then the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.\nIf the DCCF determines that the updated subscription can already be served (without requiring further interactions with NWDAF and/or ADRF) or a successful response from the NWDAF and/or ADRF is received for the creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the DCCF shall:\n-\tupdate the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and\n-\tstore the subscription.\nIf the DCCF successfully updated the \"Individual DCCF Analytics Subscription\" resource, the DCCF shall respond with:\na)\tHTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 2a. If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are modified successfully, then the DCCF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute within the \"anaSub\" attribute, indicating the event(s) for which the modification failed and the associated reason(s); If the immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the \"evtReq\" attribute of the \"anaSub\" attribute sets to true in the request, the DCCF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response within the \"eventNotifications\" of the \"anaSub\" attribute, or, potentially within the \"immReport\" attribute, if the DataAnaCollect feature is supported; or\nb)\tHTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 2b.\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"evtReq\" attribute of the \"anaSub\" attribute is included in the request with the value \"DEACTIVATE\", the DCCF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer); if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the DCCF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store available events; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the DCCF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.\nEditor's Note: It is FFS to determine whether any further provisions or limitations with regard to the usage of the \"notifFlag\" attribute are needed.\nIf the DCCF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to \"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same analytics, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 3:\tThe default operator policy for how long analytics is to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP PUT request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the DCCF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the DCCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nFigure 4.2.2.2.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the DCCF to subscribe for data notifications.\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer subscribing to data notifications, illustrating the user interface and functionality of the NF service.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.4-1: NF service consumer subscribes to data notifications\nThe NF service consumer (i.e. NWDAF) shall invoke the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation to subscribe to data notification(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-subscriptions\" as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.4-1, step 1, to create a subscription for an \"Individual DCCF Data Subscription\" resource according to the information in message body. The NdccfDataSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\ta notification target address within the \"dataNotifUri\" attribute;\n-\ta notification correlation identifier within the \"dataNotifCorrId\" attribute; and\n-\ta data subscription within the \"dataSub\" attribute, which contains one of the following:\n-\tAMF event exposure subscription within the \"amfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tSMF event exposure subscription within the \"smfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tUDM event exposure subscription within the \"udmDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tNEF event exposure subscription within the \"nefDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tAF event exposure subscription within the \"afDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tNRF event exposure subscription within the \"nrfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tNSACF event exposure subscription within the \"nsacfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tGMLC event exposure subscription within the \"gmlcDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tUPF event exposure subscription within the \"upfDataSub\" attribute, if the \"UpEvents\" feature is supported;\nand may include:\n-\tthe notification endpoints within the \"notifEndpoints\" attribute, if the \"DataAnaCollect\" feature is supported;\n-\tformatting instructions within the \"formatInstruct\" attribute;\n-\tprocessing instructions within the \"procInstructs\" attribute;\n-\tthe indication for data storage within the \"storeInd\" attribute, if the \"DataAnaCollect\" feature is supported;\n-\ta target NF identifier within the \"targetNfId\" attribute\" or a target NF set identifier within the \"targetNfSetId\" attribute\";\n-\tan ADRF identifier within the \"adrfId\" attribute or an ADRF set identifier within the \"adrfSetId\" attribute; and/or\n-\ttime window of the occurrence of the requested data collection within the \"timePeriod\" attribute.\nNOTE 1:\tThe DCCF can use the provided time window e.g. to determine when to (un)subscribe to the data source NF and/or what subscription duration to indicate to it.\n-\tthe purpose of data collection within the \"dataCollectPurposes\" attribute.\n-\tthe indication that the NF service consumer has already checked the user consent within the \"checkedConsentInd\" attribute.\n-\tstorage handling information within the \"storeHandl\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and NdccfDataSubscription data structure as request body, the DCCF shall use the contents (e.g. \"smfDataSub\" attribute in NdccfDataSubscription data structure) of the request to determine whether the subscription can already be served or interactions with data sources (e.g. creation or modification of event exposure subscription for Nsmf_EventExposure service) are required. If the DCCF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this , the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, when the request is syntactically valid and there is no DCCF internal error, but the DCCF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct one based on the received subscription contents.\nIf the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is required for the requested data collection depending on local policy and regulations, then the DCCF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [20]. If the DCCF receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted user(s), then the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.\nIf the DCCF determines that the subscription can already be served (without requiring further interactions with the data sources) or a successful response from the data source(s) is received for the creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the DCCF shall:\n-\tcreate a new subscription;\n-\tassign a subscriptionId;\n-\tstore the subscription.\nIf the DCCF created an \"Individual DCCF Data Subscription\" resource, the DCCF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.4-1, step 2. The DCCF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If an immediate reporting indication is provided in the subscription, the DCCF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response within the \"dataSub\" attribute, or, potentially within the \"immReport\" attribute, if the DataAnaCollect feature is supported.\nWhen the notification flag of the \"dataSub\" attribute (e.g. the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the DCCF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the notification flag to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the DCCF may consider the contents of the muting instructions of the \"dataSub\" attribute (if provided; e.g. the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) and/or local configuration to determine its actions.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the DCCF accepts the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings in the response (e.g. within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the case of AF events). If the DCCF does not accept the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".\nIf the DCCF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to \"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same data, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 4:\tThe default operator policy for how long data is to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a NF service consumer's subscription to data notifications, with various updates and notifications being displayed. The NF service consumer is the central entity, and the updates and notifications are displayed in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for the consumer to understand and manage their subscription.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.5-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to data notifications\nThe NF service consumer (i.e. NWDAF) shall invoke the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation to update a subscription to data notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.5-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual DCCF Data Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The NdccfDataSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.2.4.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI and NdccfDataSubscription data structure as request body, the DCCF shall use the contents of the request to determine whether the updated subscription can already be served or interactions with the data sources (e.g. modification of event exposure subscriptions) are required. If the DCCF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, when the request is syntactically valid and there is no DCCF internal error, but the DCCF can neither find an existing event exposure subscription nor construct one based on the received subscription contents.\nIf the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is required for the requested analytics collection depending on local policy and regulations), then the DCCF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [20]. If the DCCF receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted user(s), then the DCCF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is sent to the consumer.

When a muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the DCCF may consider the contents of the muting instructions of the \"dataSub\" attribute (if provided; e.g. the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) and/or local configuration to determine its actions; if the notification flag is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the DCCF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store available events; if the notification flag is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the DCCF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the DCCF accepts the provided notification flag and muting instructions, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings in the response (e.g. within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the case of AF events).

The NF service consumer is represented by a rectangle, and the analytics notifications are represented by a series of dots. The unsubscription process is depicted by the removal of the dots from the rectangle, indicating that the service is no longer being used. This figure provides a visual representation of the process and helps to understand the steps involved in unsubscribing from analytics notifications.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from analytics notifications\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe from analytics notifications. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement /<apiVersion>/analytics-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI representing an \"Individual DCCF Analytics Subscription\" resource, as shown in figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, step 1, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the identifier of the existing analytics subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/analytics-subscriptions /{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, if the DCCF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the DCCF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription;\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the DCCF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the DCCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nFigure 4.2.2.3.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the DCCF to unsubscribe from data notifications.\nThe figure depicts a network-wide data unsubscription process, where NWDAF (Network Wide Data Aggregation Function) unsubscribes from data notifications. This process is crucial for maintaining network stability and ensuring data integrity.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.3-1: NWDAF unsubscribes from data notifications\nThe NWDAF shall invoke the Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe service operation to unsubscribe to data notifications. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI representing an \"Individual DCCF Data Subscription\" resource, as shown in figure 4.2.2.3.3-1, step 1, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the identifier of the existing data subscription that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-subscriptions /{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, if the DCCF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the DCCF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding subscription;\n-\trespond to the NWDAF:\n-\twith HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is not supported or no stored unsent data events to be included in the response; or\n-\twith HTTP \"200 OK\" status code if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported and including the stored unsent data events in the NdccfDataSubscriptionNotification data type in the response.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the DCCF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the DCCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nThe Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify service operation is used by DCCF to notify NF service consumers about subscribed events related to analytics or data.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the DCCF sends a request to the NF Service Consumer to notify it about analytics event(s).\n\n\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1: DCCF notifies the NF service consumer about a subscribed analytics event\nThe DCCF shall invoke the Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify service operation to notify about a subscribed analytics event.

The profile includes the data collection rate, data collection duration, and data collection frequency. The NF service consumer is responsible for collecting data from the network service provider (NSP) and transmitting it to the network service provider (NSP) for processing.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer registers data collection profile\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Ndccf_ContextManagement_Register service operation to register data or analytics it is collecting to the DCCF. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles\" as Resource URI representing the \"DCCF Data Collection Profiles\", as shown in figure 4.3.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create an \"Individual DCCF Data Collection Profile\" according to the information in the message body. The NdccfDataCollectionProfile data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tone of the following data or analytics collection information:\n-\tanalytics subscription information within the \"anaSub\" attribute;\n-\tdata subscription information within the \"dataSub\" attribute, which contains one of the following:\n-\tAMF event exposure subscription within the \"amfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tSMF event exposure subscription within the \"smfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tUDM event exposure subscription within the \"udmDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tNEF event exposure subscription within the \"nefDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tAF event exposure subscription within the \"afDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tNRF event exposure subscription within the \"nrfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tNSACF event exposure subscription within the \"nsacfDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tGMLC event exposure subscription within the \"gmlcDataSub\" attribute;\n-\tUPF event exposure subscription within the \"upfDataSub\" attribute, if the \"UpEvents\" feature is supported;\n-\tone of the following identifiers related to the NF service consumer:\n-\tNWDAF instance identifier within the \"nwdafId\" attribute;\n-\tADRF instance identifier within the \"adrfId\" attribute;\n-\tNWDAF set identifier within the \"nwdafSetId\" attribute;\n-\tADRF set identifier within the \"adrfSetId\" attribute;\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles\" as Resource URI and NdccfDataCollectionProfile data structure as request body, the DCCF shall:\n-\tcreate a new profile;\n-\tassign a profileId;\n-\tstore the profile.\nIf the DCCF created an \"Individual DCCF Data Collection Profile\" resource, the DCCF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created profile, as shown in figure 4.3.2.2.2-1, step 2. The DCCF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created profile, i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles/{profileId}\".\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nFigure 4.3.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the DCCF to update a registration of a data collection profile to the DCCF.\nThe figure depicts a network service consumer updating its data collection profile, with the NF service consumer being the central entity. The updated profile includes the updated data collection profile, which is crucial for the NF service consumer to ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest data collection requirements. The figure also shows the NF service consumer's connection to the network, with the NF service consumer being the central entity. The updated data collection profile is updated to ensure that the NF service consumer is able to collect the necessary data for its operations.\nFigure 4.3.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer updates registered data collection profile\nThe NF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF or ADRF) shall invoke the Ndccf_ContextManagement_Update service operation to update a registration of data or analytics collection to DCCF. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles/{profileId}\" as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.3.2.3.2-1, step 1, to update the registration of data or analytics for an \"Individual DCCF Data Collection Profile\" resource identified by the {profileId}. The NdccfDataCollectionProfile data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.3.2.2.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles/{profileId}\" as Resource URI and NdccfDataCollectionProfile data structure as request body, the DCCF shall:\n-\tupdate the profile of the corresponding profileId; and\n-\tstore the profile.\nIf the DCCF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT request, the DCCF shall update an \"Individual DCCF Data Collection Profile\" resource, and shall respond with:\na)\tHTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a representation of the updated profile, as shown in figure 4.3.2.3.2-1, step 2a; or\nb)\tHTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.3.2.3.2-1, step 2b.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP PUT request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nIf the DCCF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the DCCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nFigure 4.3.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the DCCF to delete a registration of data collection profile.\nThe figure depicts a NF service consumer deregisters data collection profile, illustrating the process of data collection and deregistration in a network function virtualization (NFV) environment.\nFigure 4.3.2.4.2-1: NF service consumer deregisters data collection profile\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Ndccf_ContextManagement_Deregister service operation to delete a registration of data or analytics collection profile to the DCCF. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles/{profileId}\" as Resource URI representing an \"Individual DCCF Data Collection Profile\" resource, as shown in figure 4.3.2.4.2-1, step 1, where \"{profileId}\" is the identifier of the existing Data Collection Profile that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/ndccf-contextmanagement/<apiVersion>/data-collection-profiles/{profileId}\" as Resource URI, if the DCCF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the DCCF shall:\n-\tremove the corresponding registered profile;\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the DCCF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nIf the DCCF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the DCCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n",
