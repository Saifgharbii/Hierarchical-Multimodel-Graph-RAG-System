This study is proposed to investigate the support of such a capability in 5GS. This study can provide home network control and address issues but not limit to, for example, UPU/SoR COUNT wrap around, refresh of KAUSF\".\nIf AF is allowed to request the 5G core to perform primary re-authentication, then there may be multiple primary re-authentications because of multiple AFs being involved with the UE. Multiple primary authentications may also result in an energy drain at the UEs.\nAnd these multiple primary authentications obviously lead to signaling overhead and cause a refresh of the entire key hierarchy impacting both core and access security. The situation will be bad if the AUSF and the UDM handle the request for authentication every time, and it will be worse if more than one request is received in a very short period.\n",

The system is designed to detect and authenticate the presence of these protocols in advance, ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network. This is achieved through the use of a counter wraparound mechanism, which allows the system to detect the presence of the SoR and UPU protocols and perform re-authentication if necessary.\nFigure 5.1.2.1-1: detection of SoR/UPU Counter wraparound in advance and perform re-authentication\n1)\tThe UE is authenticated and registered at the 5GC.\n2)\tThe UDM decides to perform the UE parameter update procedure or SoR procedure. Therefore, the UDM invokes the Nausf_UPUProtection or Nausf_SoRProtection procedure. The AUSF tries to increment the Counterupu/CounterSoR and figures out that the Counterupu/CounterSoR is about to wrap around or will reach the max value at the next trigger. Therefore, AUSF shall provide an indication of \"Counterupu Reaching Max value\" or \"/CounterSoR Reaching Max value\" to UDM along with the successful result of the Nausf_UPUProtection or Nausf_SoRProtection procedure. This alerts the UDM that the current UPU/SoR procedure is OK to continue, but the next follow-up UPU procedure update will cause a wraparound failure. The UDM shall store the received indication.\n3)\tThe UDM completes the UPU/SoR procedure as defined in TS 33.501 [3].\n4)\tIf \"Counterupu Reaching Max value\" or \"CounterSoR Reaching Max value\" indication is received in step 2, the UDM sends a notification to the AMF with SUPI and the \"re-authentication required\" flag set to true.\nNOTE: UDM contacts AMF on Namf_communication service to trigger the re-registration required or re-authentication required with deregistration first. Therefore, UDM can use the same Namf_communication service for re-authentication without performing the deregistration.\n5) \tBased on the received indication, the AMF shall start the primary re-authentication procedure.\n6) \tAMF shall invoke Nausf_UEAuthetication_Authenticate Request with SUPI and SN-Name.\n7) \tThe AUSF sends the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request with SUPI and SN-Name to the UDM.\n8-10)\tare the same as defined in TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.3. After Key KAUSF is generated, the CounterUPU and CounterSoR shall be reset. Therefore, any further UPU/SoR trigger at the UDM will be successful.\nWhen UE moves from EPC to 5GC, the AMF performs Registration with UDM and invokes Nudm_UECM_Registration API. UDM should check if there is no authentication result stored in the UDM, then the UDM shall send a notification to the AMF with SUPI and the \"re-authentication required\" flag set to true as defined in clause 5.1.2.1. Step 4. It ensures KAUSF is available in AUSF and UE when a user moves from EPC to 5GC so that different services work smoothly, i.e., SoR, UPU, and/or a user accessing the AKMA AF.\nIf the AAnF wants to invoke the UE Re-authentication, the NF shall request the UDM to perform re-authentication.\nWhenever KAF has expired at the (internal or external) AF and the AF wants to refresh the KAF via 5GC, the AF request AAnF for UE re-authentication so that KAF can be refreshed. The AAnF maintains the \"wait time before initiating new re-authentication\". For example, suppose a configured value of \"wait time before initiating new re-authentication\" is 30 min then AAnF shall not invoke the UDM re-authentication service/API if primary (re) authentication is performed less than 30 min ago and returns an error to AF. If the interval is 30 minutes or more, then AAnF invokes the UDM service/API to start the primary re-authentication. Alternatively, \"wait time before initiating new re-authentication\" can be maintained at the UDM as well.\nThe figure depicts a network re-authentication process, where a user's identity is verified by other network functions (NFs) to ensure the user's identity is valid. This process is crucial for maintaining network security and preventing unauthorized access.\nFigure 5.1.2.3-1: Re-authentication invoked by other NFs\n1.\tThe AAnF wants to perform re-authentication. Therefore, NF shall send a request to UDM with a new flag for Re-authentication Required.\n2.\tThe UDM authorizes the request based on existing means (e.g. Oauth2.0).\n3.\tIf authorization is successful, the UDM checks whether the primary authentication for the UE to be initiated or request to be rejected, based on the operator policy. Operator policy includes the details of the \"waiting period before initiating new re-authentication\". If the check is passed, the UDM shall invoke the re-authentication procedure as defined in Steps 4 to 9 of clause 5.1.2.1.\n",

The UDM decides to run primary an authentication based on the request from the UDM or AUSF or the AAnF.

Having the UDM as a single point of control to trigger authentications allows the amount of home triggered authentications to be controlled, e.g. the UDM can reject request for a new authentication from the AKMA function if there has been a suitably fresh authentication.\nThe figure depicts a UDM-triggered authentications process in a network, illustrating the steps involved in authenticating users. The figure includes a user, a device, and a network interface card (NIC), all connected to a switch. The user is authenticated by the device, which then authenticates the user to the network interface card (NIC). The figure also shows the network interface card (NIC) authenticating the user to the switch, which is connected to the network. The figure is a visual representation of the authentication process, providing a clear and concise explanation of the steps involved.\nFigure 5.5.2-1: UDM triggered authentications\nThe home triggered authentication proceeds as follow:\nStep 0: The UE is currently registered to either a 3GPP or non-3GPP access.\nStep 1: An NF decides that a home triggered authentication is necessary and sends a request to the UDM including either the GPSI or SUPI of the UE (depending on what is available to the NF) to trigger an authentication for that UE.\nNOTE 1: Steps 1 and 4 are not needed in the case that the UDM unilaterally decides that a home triggered authentication is needed and in the overall solution if it is determined that no NF needs to be able to request a triggering of an authentication.\nNOTE 2: \tThe AKMA function could request a trigger of authentication to refresh the AKMA key. The AKMA function determines the need to request a trigger of the authentication based on its local policy, e.g. the AKMA key of a particular subscription has not been updated sufficiently recently.\nNOTE 3: \tWhether both GPSI and SUPI are needed as options to request the UDM to triggering an authentication will be determined based on the decision on whether and which NFs are allowed to make that request.\nStep 2: If the UDM agrees to the request from the NF or decides on its own that a home triggered authentication is needed, the UDM selects an AMF that the UE is registered to and sends a request to the AMF/SEAF including the SUPI to trigger an authentication for that UE.\nNOTE 4: \tThe UDM has sufficient information to trigger a primary authentication due to needing to refresh keys used to protect SoR/UPU traffic, mobility from LTE in the serving network or possible wrap-around of SoR/UPU counters (as it receives these values from AUSF). Hence these scenarios that are under discussion can be supported by this solution with no further changes.\nNOTE 5: \tIt is left up to implementation which AMF is selected if the UE is registered to more than one. It is also left to the UDM implementation whether to try the second AMF if the request to the first one fails.\nNOTE 6: \tThis solution is agnostic to the specific SBI service used by the UDM to trigger the AMF to perform an authentication, e.g. whether is it better to add a new service or modify an existing service.\nStep 3: If the AMF/SEAF agrees to run an authentication, then AMF/SEAF acknowledges the request from the UDM.\nStep 4: If the UDM triggered the authentication due to a request from an NF, then the UDM responds to the NF with an acknowledgement.\nNOTE 7: \tAnother possibility is to delay the responses to after a successful authentication but the UDM will get such an acknowledgement from the existing procedures.\nStep 5: The AMF/SEAF starts an authentication using existing procedures as described in clause 6.1.2 of TS 33.501 [3].\n",

The expiration time for the primary authentication related to the SUPI can be set in the UDM based on local policy. After a successful primary authentication, a successful registration may occur and multiple UE Parameter Update (UPU) procedure and/or Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure may happen.\n1.\tAt any point of time, the AUSF can determine to notify any of the following factors such as:\ni) \tif the SoR counter is about to wrap around; or\nii)\tif the UPU counter is about to wrap around.\n2a.\tThe AUSF sends to UDM a notification message which can include SUPI, cause value (as suitable to the condition met such as any of: SoR Counter wrap around indication / UPU Counter wrap around indication).\n2b.\tThe UDM on receiving any of SoR Counter wrap around indication, UPU Counter wrap around indication, checks if valid based on local policy. If a Counter wrap around indication is received related to SoR or UPU which is ongoing or required to be sent, the UDM/UDR can locally store the SoR or UPU data until a successful primary (re-authentication) is completed and (re-)initiate SoR/UPU accordingly.\n2c.\tThe UDM can send an acknowledgement indication in the notification response message. Further irrespective of the SoR/UPU wrap around conditions, based on the expiration time locally stored for the primary authentication of UE related to the SUPI, the UDM can trigger primary (re-)authentication with steps 7-8.\n3.\tThe UDM sends to the serving AMF/SEAF of the UE an authentication request with SUPI.\n4.\tThe AMF/SEAF initiates primary (re-)authentication as described in TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.2.\n(B) AKMA Key handling without signalling overhead (This part is applicable only for use-case related to AF key expiry and service outage issue):\nSetting AKMA Key expiry: The solution describes how an AKMA Key expiration and AF key expiration are handled in relation to the primary authentication to enable efficient AKMA related key handling with limited signalling. Figure 5.8.2-2 shows setting of AKMA Key expiry.\nThe figure depicts a flowchart for deriving the Key Authentication Key (KAKMA) and setting the expiry time after primary authentication in a network security system. The flowchart illustrates the steps involved in the process, including the derivation of the KAKMA, setting the expiry time, and the verification of the primary authentication.\nFigure 5.8.2-2: Deriving KAKMA and Setting expiry time after primary authentication\nThe steps shown in Figure 5.8.2-2 is described below.\n0.\tInitiation of authentication and authentication method selection is based on TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.2.\n1-3.\tBased on the selected authentication method, generate the authentication vector (AV) as in TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.3. The UDM/UDR based on operator policy set an expiry time related to the primary authentication and AUSF Key to be used by the AUSF to set the AKMA key lifetime. The UDM sends to AUSF, Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message which can include AV, SUPI, an expiry time (i.e., exp Time) indication, AKMA indication and Routing Indicator (i.e., if a subscriber has an AKMA subscription UDM includes AKMA indication and Routing Indicator according to TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.3). The AUSF performs authentication method specific message exchange (i.e., one or more message exchanges related to the authentication) with the UE as in TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.3. On successful primary authentication, the AUSF derives AUSF Key (i.e., KAUSF) and based on home network operator policy stores the KAUSF as in TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.3 along with the SUPI.\n4.\tIf the AUSF receives AKMA indication from UDM, then AUSF derives AKMA Anchor Key (i.e., KAKMA) and A-KID from the AUSF Key (i.e., KAUSF) as in TS 33.535 [5]. The AUSF sets the expiry time for the AKMA Key (i.e., KAKMA) based on the expiry time received from the UDM.\nNOTE 1: The need for AKMA Key expiry time is applicable only when this study conclusions takes into account the \"AF key expiry\" without UE impacts as one of the aspects to be addressed as part of KI#1 and KI#2. Setting of AKMA key expiry based on operator policy allows, the AAnF to set AF key expiry time same as AKMA key expiry. So, before an AF key expire, the home operator would have performed a home triggered primary authentication based on operator policy.\nThe UE can generate the AKMA Anchor Key (KAKMA) and the A-KID from the KAUSF before initiating communication with an AKMA Application Function as in TS 33.535 [5].\n5a.\tThe AUSF selects the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF) and sends the generated A-KID, KAKMA and AKMA Key expiry time to the AAnF together with the SUPI of the UE using the Naanf_AKMA_KeyRegistration Request service operation. The AAnF can store the latest information (such as latest A-KID, KAKMA and AKMA Key expiry time) sent by the AUSF.\nNOTE 2: When re-authentication runs, the AUSF generates a new A-KID, and a new KAKMA and sets the new AKMA Key expiry time and sends the new generated A-KID, new KAKMA and new AKMA Key expiry time to the AAnF. After receiving the new generated A-KID, KAKMA and new AKMA Key expiry time, the AAnF deletes the old A-KID, KAKMA, and AKMA Key expiry time and stores the new generated A-KID, KAKMA and new AKMA Key expiry time.\n5b.\tThe AAnF stores the received SUPI, A-KID, KAKMA and AKMA Key expiry time (i.e., KAKMA exp time).\n5c.\tThe AAnF sends the response to the AUSF using the Naanf_AKMA_AnchorKey_Register Response service operation as in TS 33.535 [5].\nSetting AF Key expiry:\nThe expiry time for the AF Key is set based on the expiration time of the AKMA Key as shown in Figure 5.8.2-3.\nThe steps shown in Figure 5.8.2-3 is described as follows:\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of AF (Automatic Frequency Adjustment) expiration handling and HN (Hybrid Network) triggered primary authentication in a wireless communication system. The figure shows the various components involved in the process, including the AF expiration timer, HN trigger, and the primary authentication mechanism. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the system's architecture, allowing for better understanding and analysis of the system's functionality.\nFigure 5.8.2-3: AF Expiration handling and HN triggered primary authentication\n1-2.\tThe pre-requisite and steps 1-2 are same as in TS 33.535[5] clause 6.2.1.\n3.\tDerive AF key as in TS 33.535 [5]. Then the AAnF sets the expiration time for the KAF considering the locally stored expiration time of the AKMA Key (Where the expiration time for the KAF can be same as the expiration time of the AKMA Key).\n4-5.\tSteps 4-5 are same as in TS 33.535 [5] clause 6.2.1. Following a successful AF key establishment, the UE can securely communicate with the AF and use the application. At a later point of time, following steps may be performed on AF key expiry.\n6a-b.\tIf the UE request the AF for access and if the KAF expires or is about to expire, then the AF request the AAnF for the AF key by sending Naanf_AKMA_ApplicationKey_Get request, which may include indication for key refresh.\nNOTE 3: \tAs the AF key expiration is bound to the expiration of the AKMA Key and in turn to the expiration of the AUSF Key, by the time AF key expires, the AUSF Key will also be expired and the AUSF would have triggered primary (re-) authentication and the primary (re-)authentication would be running meanwhile.\n6c.\tThe AAnF checks the locally available AKMA Key expiration time for the associated A-KID, if it is expired, then the AAnF can determine not to refresh the AF Key and determines to waits for the new AKMA key to be provided by the home network (i.e., AUSF);\n6d.\tThe AAnF sends to AF a Naanf_Response message, which can include a waiting time(r) if the AAnF finds that the AKMA Key available is expired for the A-KID. The waiting time(r) can be used by the AF to retry the key request procedure with AAnF. During this time, the already running primary (re-)authentication if succeed, results in a new AKMA key and new AF key establishment.\n7a-b.\tIf the AUSF key expires, the AUSF triggers primary (re-)authentication as described in (A) step 5-8 of this clause.\n",

To meet the requirements of both KI #1 and KI #2, the basic idea of this solution is to make HN trigger primary authentication for KAF refresh only when necessary.\nThe solution determines whether to perform primary (re)-authentication according to whether there are newly generated KAKMA, and corresponding A-KID for the UE. If the HN has already performed primary (re)-authentication for the UE just before the KAF of a certain AF expired and the primary (re)-authentication has already generated a new available KAKMA, then there is no need to perform primary (re)-authentication again, thereby mitigating multiple primary (re)-authentications; otherwise, the HN does need to trigger primary authentication to generate new KAKMA to refresh the expired KAF.\nThe solution makes the AF notify the AAnF rather than directly request UDM to perform primary (re)-authentication. Even if more than one AF key expiry notification is received in a very short period, the signaling overhead on UDM will be reduced due to the mediation of the AAnF.\n",

The scenario involves a primary authentication request (PRA) initiated by an AANF (Authentication and Access Network Function) request, which is a request for a K AF refresh. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the authentication process, including the initiation of the PRA, the request for the K AF refresh, and the subsequent authentication process.\nFigure 5.10.2-1: UDM initiated primary authentication based on AAnF request for KAF refresh scenario\nAn AF detects that the KAF of a UE is expiry or about to expire, and decides to refresh the KAF.\nNOTE 1: How AF detects the AF key expiry and when to send a notification to the AAnF is implementation specific.\n1.\tThe AF selects the AAnF according to TS 33.535 [5] clause 6.7 using the A-KID associated with the expired KAF. Then it sends a notification to the AAnF with the UE ID (if available), the A-KID associated with the expiry KAF, the AF identity (AF_ID), and an indication of \"application key lifetime is about to expire\".\nNOTE 2: If the AF is located outside the HPLMN of the UE, it shall discover the HPLMN of the UE based on the A-KID and sends the notification towards the AAnF via NEF service API. The NEF selects the AAnF according to TS 33.535 [5] clause 6.7, then forwards the notification to the AAnF.\n2.\tUpon receiving the application key expiry notification, the AAnF determines whether to request UDM to trigger primary (re)-authentication procedures or not according to the following process.\nIf the UE ID (e.g., SUPI/GPSI) is present in the received notification message:\nThe AAnF checks if there is a newly stored A-KID for the UE which is different from the received A-KID, if yes, the AAnF skips to step 9;\nIf the AAnF checks that the locally stored A-KID for the UE is the same as the received A-KID, it shall check whether to request the HN triggered primary authentication for the UE based on the operator policy (the operator policy may include the details of the \"waiting period before initiating new re-authentication\"); if the check is passed, the AAnF shall continue with step 4-10.\nIf the UE ID is not present in the received notification message, which corresponds to the case that anonymous user access to the AF as specified in TS 33.535 [5] clause 6.2.2, the AAnF retrieves in all of the stored A-KIDs to check if the received A-KID is present in the AAnF:\nIf the received A-KID is present in the AAnF, the AAnF shall check whether to request the HN triggered primary authentication for the UE based on the operator policy (the operator policy may include the details of the \"waiting period before initiating new re-authentication\"); if the check is passed, the AAnF shall recover the UE's SUPI according to the A-KID, then continue with step 4-10;\nIf the received A-KID is not present in the AAnF, the AAnF shall skip to step 10 with an error response.\nNOTE 3: \tWhen the UE ID is not present in the received notification message of the AAnF, not finding the received A-KID in the AAnF implies that the A-KID for the UE has been refreshed. However, the AAnF cannot be aware of what UE the AF is serving since the UE is using anonymous access. Therefore, the AAnF cannot derive the new KAF for the AF because the AAnF cannot identify the latest A-KID and KAKMA for the UE just by the received A-KID.\n3)\tThe AAnF request UDM to trigger a primary (re)-authentication for that UE with the UE's SUPI.\n4)\tEditor's Note: whether the AAnF can directly invoke the primary authentication service from UDM is FFS.\n5)\tUDM checks whether the primary re-authentication for the UE to be initiated or the request to be rejected, based on the operator policy.\n6)\tIf the UDM agrees to the request from the AAnF, the UDM selects an AMF that the UE is registered to and notifies the AMF including the SUPI to trigger an authentication for that UE.\n7)\tThe AMF starts the primary authentication procedure as per TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.3.\n8)\tThe UE, AUSF, and AAnF derive AKMA key after primary authentication as per TS 33.535 clause 6.1 step3~5.\n9)\tThe AAnF derives new KAF from the new KAKMA as specified in TS 33.535 [5] clause A.4.\n10)\tThe AAnF sends a notification response message to the AF with the new A-KID, the new KAF and the KAF expiration time, or sends an error response to the AF if UE ID is not present in the received notification message and the received A-KID is not found in the AAnF in step 3.\nNOTE 4: If the information in step 10 indicates an error response, the AF may choose to reject UE's access to the AF when the KAF of a UE is expiry based on local policy. Afterward, UE may trigger a new Application Session Establishment request with the latest A-KID to the AKMA AF. Using this latest A-KID, the UE and the AF can establish a new application session using existing procedures defined in TS 33.535 [5] clause 6.2.\nNOTE 5: If the AF is located outside the HPLMN of the UE, the AAnF shall send the notification response message to the AF via NEF service API.\n",

Therefore, there are two main architectural patterns which could be used for the application of HONTRA or equivalent procedure to solve a potential need for the 3 use cases. In the first pattern the UDM uses existing procedures to trigger primary authentication under UE registration while in the second pattern the UDM triggers a new procedure after the UE is already registered to the 5GC.\nThe procedure for UDM triggered primary authentication during UE Registration proposed in this solution is based on existing procedures already defined in TS 33.501 [3], TS 23.502 [2] and TS 29.503 [6].\nThe figure depicts a primary authentication process during UE registration in a 5G network. It shows a user device (UE) initiating a UDM (User Data Management) trigger, which is a key component of the authentication process. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the authentication process, including the user device initiating the UDM trigger, the network controller (NC) processing the trigger, and the authentication process being initiated. The figure also shows the network controller's response to the UDM trigger, which is a critical step in ensuring the security of the network.\nFigure 5.11.2.2-1: UDM triggered primary authentication during UE Registration\n0.\tThe Registration procedure as in TS 23.502 [2], clause 4.2.2.2.2, steps 1-13.\n1.\tDuring UE registration in AMF, the AMF triggers Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation to register the UE in the UDM.\n2.\tThe UDM checks the authentication status and decides based on a HN primary authentication configuration to request a new primary authentication for the UE. Refer to TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.4.2 for more details regarding when UDM potentially takes this decision. The UDM marks the UE as requiring primary authentication.\nNOTE: \tA HN primary authentication configuration is a group of configuration options for authentication decisions. These may be per-UE or PLMN-wide, the design is left to implementation and could indicate for example when a UE should be authenticated, the use case for re-authentication, etc. For this specific case the HN authentication configuration could indicate that the UDM should perform steps 2, 3, etc. if there is a registration request by the AMF (step 1) and the UDM cannot find any authentication result state i.e., it cannot find a pointer to the AUSF which holds the latest KAUSF.\n3.\tBased on the HN primary authentication configuration the UDM decides to reject the Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation with a REAUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED error as defined in TS 29.503 [6].\n4.\tThe AMF then initiates the primary authentication procedure as defined in TS 33.501 [3], clause 6.1.2. The primary authentication is executed according to TS 33.501 [3], clauses 6.1.3 and 6.1.4. The primary authentication is successful.\n5.\tUpon successful primary authentication, the UDM clears the mark that the UE requires authentication.\n6.\tThe AMF repeats the Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation to register the UE in the UDM.\n7.\tThe UDM checks the authentication status and now decides that the AMF registration can be accepted.\n8.\tThe UDM accepts the AMF Registration.\n9.\tThe Registration procedure as in TS 23.502 [2], clause 4.2.2.2.2, steps 14b-25.\nSee clause 5.11.2.4.1 for more details on how this procedure can be applied to cover the interworking use case.\nThe procedure for UDM triggered primary authentication after UE Registration proposed in this solution is depicted in the following figure.\nThe figure depicts a UDM triggered primary authentication process after UE registration, illustrating the steps involved in ensuring secure authentication for mobile users.\nFigure 5.11.2.3-1: UDM Triggered primary authentication after UE Registration\n1.\tThe UE is registered in the 5GC via an AMF. The AMF has registered the UE in UDM. The AMF potentially has authenticated the UE or has reused an authentication context from another AMF (or MME). The UDM keeps a time stamp of the latest UE authentication in 5GC (refer to TS 33.501 [3] clause 6.1.4).\n2.\tThe UDM decides that the UE needs to be authenticated according to the HN primary authentication configuration. It marks that the UE needs to be authenticated and takes the action to request a new primary authentication procedure for the UE towards the AMF. The reasons for the UDM deciding that the UE needs to be authenticated can be different:\na.\tThe UDM is required to initiate a SoR/UPU procedure for the UE, but it detects that the corresponding Counters have wrapped-up or are about to wrap-up. See clause 5.11.2.4.2 for more details on how this procedure can be applied to cover the SoR/UPU wrap-up use case.\nb.\tThe UDM enforces a Home Network primary authentication configuration to refresh primary authentication after a selected period of time and that time (based on the time stamp of latest authentication kept in UDM) has expired for the UE. See clause 5.11.2.4.3 for more details on how this procedure can be applied to cover the KAF refresh use case.\nNOTE 1: \tFor this specific case the HN authentication configuration could be (a) a time interval every which the UE should be re-authenticated, or (b) an option to re-authenticate the UE if SoR/UPU counters are about to wrap around, etc. The specific details of the HN authentication configuration are left for normative work.\n3.\tUnless the UE is already engaged in a primary authentication procedure already, UDM requests the AMF to trigger a primary authentication procedure for the UE by sending a re-authentication notification to the AMF.\nIf multiple AMFs are registered in UDM, the UDM selects and notifies one AMF first and if primary authentication fails, UDM potentially also notifies the other AMF based on local policies.\nThis solution proposes that the new service operation is modelled as a notification operation within the set of services offered by UDM; i.e. a Nudm service operation.\nNOTE1a: \tWhich is the most appropriate alternative to model the re-authentication notification is left for the normative phase.\n4.\t. Before acknowledging the Re-Authentication notification, the AMF first checks if the UE can be contacted to execute the requested primary authentication procedure. After receiving the notification from the UDM in Step 3 the AMF potentially marks the UE as requiring re-authentication and decides based on its own policy and potentially the received Home Network authentication configuration when to initiate primary authentication and when to contact the UE or wait for the UE to contact the AMF.\nNOTE 2: \tThe AMF could page the UE right away or wait for the UE to contact the AMF. The behaviour of the AMF is left for normative work since the behaviour could also be dependent on the requirements of the specific use case for example a specific use case may be tolerant to the re-authentication blocking to wait for the UE to contact the AMF.\n5.\tThe AMF replies to the Re-Authentication Notification either with a successful response including the status information (if the UE is reachable or not).\n6.\t If the UE is reachable, the AMF then initiates the primary authentication procedure as defined in TS 33.501 [3], clause 6.1.2. The primary authentication is executed according to TS 33.501 [3], clause 6.1.3 and 6.1.4. The primary authentication is successful.\nOtherwise, if the UE cannot be reached, the AMF marks the UE as requiring authentication, stores this information in the UE security context and:\n-\tUpon next UE contact in the same AMF, the AMF then triggers the primary authentication procedure after consulting the information stored in the UE security context if the UE requires re-authentication.\n-\tUpon UE registration in UDM via a different AMF, if the new AMF does not authenticate the UE prior to the AMF registration, the UDM then rejects the AMF registration with a Re-Authentication Required error as described in clause 5.11.2.2. If the new AMF is able to retrieve the UE security context from the old AMF, the security context includes an indication that the UE needs to be authenticated (this indication was based on the old AMF actions), or a specific event information. The new AMF acts on this information and initiates primary authentication. Otherwise, the new AMF registration to the UDM will trigger the UDM to act and initiate authentication as described in clause 5.11.2.2.\n7.\tAfter the primary authentication is successfully completed, the UDM clears the mark that UE requires primary authentication in the HN primary authentication configuration.\n8.\tThe UDM executes other procedures (e.g. SoR/UPU) depending on the reason that motivated the UDM triggered re-authentication procedure in step 2.\nThe UDM triggered primary authentication procedure during registration as described in clause 5.11.2.2 can be used by the Home Network to initiate primary authentication during the interworking use case.\nIt can be observed that interworking mobility from EPS to 5GS could result from a handover. However, a registration procedure is executed as the last steps of a handover procedure so the procedure in clause 5.11.2.2 is applicable for the handover case.\nThis solution makes use of existing proposed procedures in TS 33.501 [3], clause 6.1.4.2.\nNOTE: \tSolution #1 (clause 5.1.2.2) and Solution #3 proposes same solution for the interworking use case as proposed here too. The guidance in TS 33.501 [3], clause 6.1.4.2 is not normative. Since the AMF behaviour upon receiving an error response from the UDM is not clear, it needs to be clarified that the AMF will restart authentication and not reject the UE registration (as it proposed in the guidance on TS 33.501 [3], clause 6.1.4.2).\nThe UDM triggered primary authentication procedure after registration as described in clause 5.11.2.3 can be used by the Home Network to initiate primary authentication during the SoR/UPU wrap around use case.\nThe UDM can detect that the SoR/UPU Counters has wrapped-up or are about to wrap-up during the execution of the corresponding services in AUSF. The UDM receives the value of the Counters from AUSF so UDM can detect when the Counter are about to wrap up. Ultimately, the AUSF provides a Counter wrap up error to UDM when the counters wrap up. Based on the HN primary authentication configuration, the UDM can then request the AMF to trigger a primary authentication procedure for the UE.\nAfter the primary authentication is successfully completed, the UDM can trigger the SoR/UPU procedure if needed.\nIf the primary authentication cannot be initiated by the AMF after being requested by the UDM (e.g. in case the UE is not reachable at that time), the UDM is informed by the AMF in the result of the re-authentication notification. In this case, the UDM marks the UE as requiring re-authentication in the HN primary authentication configuration and suspends the SoR/UPU service for the UE until the UE is authenticated again.\nIf there is a need to address the KAF refresh use case, the UDM triggered primary authentication procedure after registration as described in clause 5.11.2.3 can be used to ensure that there is fresh KAUSF/ KAKMA key available in the Home Network for the KAF refresh use case. This could be achieved in several ways for example the UDM decides based on the HN primary authentication configuration whether to perform a primary authentication for KAF refresh or the UDM providing the HN primary authentication configuration to the AAnF; the AAnF can then decide to set the KAF expiration time based on the HN primary authentication configuration so that a primary authentication happens before KAF expiration.\nNOTE: \tThe need for KAF refresh based on HONTRA is not addressed in the present document.\n",

That means that the UDM triggers interaction with the serving network to request the execution of primary authentication.\n\n",

            "description": "As an evolution of LTE networks, the 5G system supports backward compatibility, providing seamless voice and data services continuity. According to TS 23.502 [2], the 5G core enables interworking between EPS and 5GS, allowing the UE to move between two systems. During interworking between 5GS and EPS, the MME and the AMF perform the handover procedure, which provides the IP address continuity and the security context mapping on inter-system mobility to UEs.\nAs per TS 33.501 [3], when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, the handover procedure is initiated by the source MME to provide the target AMF with the UE identity and UE's EPS security context. If the source MME has the UE NR security capabilities stored, it forwards the UE NR security capabilities as well to the target AMF.\nFor the UE moving to 5GS for the first time, the AMF derives a mapped KAMF' key from the received KASME, then derives the mapped 5G NAS keys (i.e., KNASenc and KNASint) and KgNB using the mapped KAMF' key. In this situation, the target AMF has no native 5G security context, it will use the mapped 5G security context constructed from the EPS security context to protect the subsequent messages, which does not include a KAUSF key. As specified in TS 33.501 [3], if the AMF has no native 5G security context available, when the UE performs the Registration Request following the handover procedure, the AMF via the SEAF should run a primary authentication depending on local operator policy.\n",

            "description": "The counters for SoR and UPU procedure are maintained by the AUSF as specified in TS 33.501 [3]. However, there is no mechanism to refresh the counters unless by running the primary authentication. When the counters are about to wrap around, there is currently no mechanism by which the home network can trigger primary authentication in order to refresh the KAUSF key and safely reset the counters in time. In roaming situations, the home network has no control on when to trigger such procedure unless by forcing a deregistration may cause a service disruption for the user.\nThe maximum value of the counters is 65 536 according to TS 29.509 [4], and the wrap around of the counter is a corner case due to the infrequent use of the UPU and SoR procedures. The probability is low for the case of a primary authentication not happening before 65 536 SoR/UPU messages are transmitted from the network to the UE.\n",

            "description": "In TS 33.535 [5], the KAF can only be refreshed by UA* protocol, there is no other method to refresh it. That's because if the UA* protocol does not support the KAF refresh, and KAKMA is unchanged, the same KAF will be generated again. If the KAKMA can be refreshed, then the issue is solved. However, the AKMA feature specified in TS 33.535 [5] does not support refresh of the KAKMA key. In fact, refresh of AKMA keys is not possible during the lifetime of the KAUSF key even when the life time of KAF has expired. By triggering the primary authentication from the home network, the AUSF will generate a new KAUSF and a new KAKMA.\n\n\n",
