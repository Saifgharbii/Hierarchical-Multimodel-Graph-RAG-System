                    "text_content": "The idle mode tasks can be subdivided into four processes:\n-\tPLMN selection;\n-\tCell selection and reselection;\n-\tLocation registration;\n-\tSupport for manual CSG selection.\nThe relationship between these processes is illustrated in Figure 4.1-1.\nThe figure depicts the overall Idle Mode process in a 5G network, illustrating the steps taken by the network to ensure efficient and reliable communication. The process includes the initial connection, data transmission, and subsequent idle state, all of which are crucial for maintaining network performance and minimizing latency.\nFigure 4.1-1: Overall Idle Mode process\nWhen a UE is switched on, a public land mobile network (PLMN) is selected by NAS. For the selected PLMN, associated RAT(s) may be set TS 23.122 [5]. The NAS shall provide a list of equivalent PLMNs, if available, that the AS shall use for cell selection and cell reselection.\nWith the cell selection, the UE searches for a suitable cell of the selected PLMN and chooses that cell to provide available services, further the UE shall tune to its control channel. This choosing is known as \"camping on the cell\".\nFor E-UTRA a cell may be associated with more than one CN type (EPC and/or 5GC) and hence the selected cell can be suitable for more than one CN type. The CN type(s) for which the selected cell is suitable are reported to NAS which selects a CN type to be used for camping and for the NAS registration procedure (see below). Note that CN type selection is only applicabe for UE supporting E-UTRA connected to 5GC.\nFor E-UTRA a cell may be associated with more than one tracking area. The UE reports all the broadcasted tracking area codes in the selected cell to NAS for registration procedure.\nThe UE shall, if necessary, then register its presence, by means of a NAS registration procedure, in the tracking area of the chosen cell and as outcome of a successful Location Registration the selected PLMN becomes the registered PLMN TS 23.122 [5].\nIf the UE finds a more suitable cell, according to the cell reselection criteria, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it. Similar to cell selection procedure, if the reselected cell is an E-UTRA cell and the UE supports E-UTRA connected to 5GC, the CN type(s) for which the cell is suitable are reported to NAS which selects one of them. If the new cell does not belong to at least one tracking area to which the UE is registered, location registration is performed. In RRC_INACTIVE state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, a RNA update procedure is performed.\nIf necessary, the UE shall search for higher priority PLMNs at regular time intervals as described in TS 22.011 [4] and search for a suitable cell if another PLMN has been selected by NAS.\nSearch of available CSGs may be triggered by NAS to support manual CSG selection.\nIf the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN, either a new PLMN is selected automatically (automatic mode), or an indication of which PLMNs are available is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made (manual mode).\nRegistration is not performed by UEs only capable of services that need no registration.\nThe UE may perform sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication or sidelink discovery or NR sidelink communication while in-coverage or out-of-coverage for sidelink, as specified in clause 11.\nThe purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fivefold:\na)\tIt enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN.\nb)\tWhen registered and if the UE wishes to establish an RRC connection, it can do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is camped.\nc)\tIf the PLMN receives a call for the registered UE, it knows (in most cases) the set of tracking areas (in RRC_IDLE state) or RNAs (in RRC_INACTIVE state) in which the UE is camped. It can then send a \"paging\" message for the UE on the control channels of all the cells in this set of tracking areas. The UE will then receive the paging message because it is tuned to the control channel of a cell in one of the registered tracking areas and the UE can respond on that control channel.\nd)\tIt enables the UE to receive ETWS and CMAS notifications.\ne)\tIt enables the UE to receive MBMS services.\nIf the UE is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on or if the location registration failed (except for LR rejected with cause #12, cause #14, cause #15 or cause #25, see TS 23.122 [5] and TS 24.301 [16]), it attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of the PLMN identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state.\nWhen NAS indicates that PSM starts, the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided by dedicated signalling and logged measurements) is kept, all running timers continue to run but the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks. If a timer expires while the UE is in PSM it is up to UE implementation whether it performs the corresponding action immediately or the latest when PSM ends. When NAS indicates that PSM ends, the UE shall perform all idle mode tasks.\nIf SystemInformationBlockType32 has been received and if the UE has determined that it is out of coverage using available satellite assistance information (e.g. ephemeris parameters and coverage parameters in current or previously received SystemInformationBlockType32, SystemInformationBlockType31, t-Service in SystemInformationBlockType3 or other parameters), the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided by dedicated signalling and logged measurements) is kept, but the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks related to NTN. It is up to UE implementation to handle running timers. The detection of out of coverage using satellite assistance information is up to UE implementation and once in NTN coverage the UE shall perform all idle mode tasks related to NTN. If SystemInformationBlockType32 includes carrierFreqList the UE may store and use this information for the cell selection process when UE resumes the idle mode tasks related to NTN once in NTN coverage.\n",

In the case of system information, an E-UTRAN frequency or inter-RAT frequency may be listed without providing a priority (i.e. the field cellReselectionPriority is absent for that frequency). If priorities are provided in dedicated signalling, the UE shall ignore all the priorities provided in system information. If UE is in camped on any cell state, UE shall only apply the priorities (i.e. cellReselectionPriority and/or cellReselectionSubPriority) provided by system information from current cell, and the UE preserves priorities provided by dedicated signalling, deprioritisationReq received in RRCConnectionReject and altFreqPriorities provided by dedicated signalling unless specified otherwise. When the UE in camped normally state, has only dedicated priorities other than for the current frequency, the UE shall consider the current frequency to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured values). While the UE is camped on a suitable CSG cell in normal coverage, the UE shall always consider the current frequency to be the highest priority frequency (i.e. higher than any of the network configured values), irrespective of any other priority value allocated to this frequency. When the HSDN capable UE is in High-mobility state, the UE shall always consider the HSDN cells to be the highest priority (i.e. higher than any other network configured priorities). When the HSDN capable UE is not in High-mobility state, the UE shall always consider HSDN cells to be the lowest priority (i.e. lower than network configured priorities). If the UE capable of sidelink communication is configured to perform sidelink communication and can only perform the sidelink communication while camping on a frequency, the UE may consider that frequency to be the highest priority. If the UE capable of V2X sidelink communication is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication and can only perform the V2X sidelink communication while camping on a frequency, the UE may consider that frequency to be the highest priority. If the UE capable of V2X sidelink communication is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication and can only use pre-configuration while not camping on a frequency, the UE may consider the frequency providing inter-carrier V2X sidelink configuration to be the highest priority. If the UE is configured to perform both V2X sidelink communication and NR sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing both V2X sidelink communication and NR sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.If the UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication and not perform NR sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority. If the UE is configured to perform NR sidelink communication and not perform V2X sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing NR sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority. If the UE capable of sidelink discovery is configured to perform Public Safety related sidelink discovery and can only perform the Public Safety related sidelink discovery while camping on a frequency, the UE may consider that frequency to be the highest priority.\nNOTE 1:\tThe prioritization among the frequencies which UE considers to be the highest priority frequency is left to UE implementation.\nNOTE 1a:\tThe frequency only providing the anchor frequency configuration should not be prioritized for V2X service during cell reselection as specified in TS 36.331[3].\nNOTE 1b:\tWhen UE is configured to perform NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication performs cell reselection, it may consider the frequencies providing the intra-carrier and inter-carrier configuration have equal priority in cell reselection.\nNOTE 1c:\tThe UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication or NR sidelink communication, if it has the capability and is authorized for the corresponding sidelink operation.\nNOTE 1d:\tWhen UE is configured to perform both NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication, but cannot find a frequency which can provide both NR sidelink communication configuration and V2X sidelink communication configuration, UE may consider the frequency providing either NR sidelink communication configuration or V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.\nIf the UE is capable either of MBMS Service Continuity or of SC-PTM reception and is receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service and can only receive this MBMS service while camping on a frequency on which it is provided, the UE may consider that frequency to be the highest priority during the MBMS session TS 36.300 [2] as long as the two following conditions are fulfilled:\n1) Either:\n-\tthe UE is capable of MBMS service continuity and the reselected cell is broadcasting SIB13; or\n-\tthe UE is capable of SC-PTM reception and the reselected cell is broadcasting SIB20;\n2) Either:\n-\tSIB15 of the serving cell indicates for that frequency one or more MBMS SAIs included and associated with that frequency in the MBMS User Service Description (USD) TS 26.346 [22] of this service; or\n-\tSIB15 is not broadcast in the serving cell and that frequency is included in the USD of this service.\nIf the UE is capable either of MBMS Service Continuity or of SC-PTM reception and is receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service provided on a downlink only MBMS frequency, on a frequency used by dedicated MBMS cells, on a frequency used by FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cells as defined in TS 36.300 [2], or on a frequency belonging to PLMN different from its registered PLMN, the UE may consider cell reselection candidate frequencies at which it can not receive the MBMS service to be of the lowest priority during the MBMS session TS 36.300 [2], as long as the above mentioned condition 1) is fulfilled for the cell on the MBMS frequency which the UE monitors or this cell broadcasts SIB1-MBMS and as long as the above mentioned condition 2) is fulfilled for the serving cell.\nNOTE 2:\tExample scenarios in which the previous down-prioritisation may be needed concerns the cases where camping is not possible, while the UE can only receive this MBMS frequency when camping on a subset of cell reselection candidate frequencies, e.g. the MBMS frequency is a downlink only carrier, the MBMS frequency is used by dedicated MBMS cells, the MBMS frequency is used by FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cells TS 36.300 [2], or the MBMS frequency belongs to a PLMN different from UE's registered PLMN.\nIf the UE is not capable of MBMS Service Continuity but has knowledge on which frequency an MBMS service of interest is provided, it may consider that frequency to be the highest priority during the MBMS session TS 36.300 [2] as long as the reselected cell is broadcasting SIB13.\nIf the UE is not capable of MBMS Service Continuity but has knowledge on which downlink only frequency, on which frequency used by dedicated MBMS cells, on which frequency used by FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cells as defined in TS 36.300 [2] or on which frequency belonging to PLMN different from its registered PLMN an MBMS service of interest is provided, it may consider cell reselection candidate frequencies at which it can not receive the MBMS service to be of the lowest priority during the MBMS session TS 36.300 [2] as long as the cell on the MBMS frequency which the UE monitors is broadcasting SIB13 or SIB1-MBMS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe UE considers that the MBMS session is ongoing using the session start and end times as provided by upper layers in the USD i.e. the UE does not verify if the session is indicated on MCCH.\nIn case UE receives RRCConnectionReject with deprioritisationReq, UE shall consider current carrier frequency and stored frequencies due to the previously received RRCConnectionReject with deprioritisationReq or all the frequencies of EUTRA to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured values) while T325 is running irrespective of camped RAT. The UE shall delete the stored deprioritisation request(s) when a PLMN selection is performed on request by NAS TS 23.122 [5].\nNOTE 4:\tConnecting to CDMA2000 does not imply PLMN selection.\nNOTE 5:\tUE should search for a higher priority layer for cell reselection as soon as possible after the change of priority. The minimum related performance requirements specified in TS 36.133 [10] are still applicable.\nThe UE shall delete priorities or altFreqPriorities provided by dedicated signalling when:\n-\tthe UE enters a different RRC state; or\n-\tthe optional validity time of dedicated priorities (T320) expires; or\n-\tthe optional validity time of altFreqPriorities (T323) expires; or\n-\ta PLMN selection is performed on request by NAS TS 23.122 [5].\nNOTE 6:\tEqual priorities between RATs are not supported.\nThe UE shall only perform cell reselection evaluation for E-UTRAN frequencies and inter-RAT frequencies that are given in system information and for which the UE has a priority provided.\nIn case the UE received RRCConnectionRelease with altFreqPriorities, for E-UTRAN frequencies, the UE shall apply the alternative cell reselection priorities broadcast via altCellReselectionPriority and altCellReselectionSubPriority in the system information instead of priorities broadcast via cellReselectionPriority and cellReselectionSubPriority. If the UE received RRCConnectionRelease with altFreqPriorities and the alternative cell reselection priorities are not broadcast via altCellReselectionPriority and altCellReselectionSubPriority in the system information, for E-UTRAN frequencies, the UE shall apply the cell reselection priority information broadcast in the system information via cellReselectionPriority and cellReselectionSubPriority. When altFreqPriorities is discarded or deleted, the UE shall apply the cell reselection priority information broadcast in the system information via cellReselectionPriority and cellReselectionSubPriority.\nThe UE shall not consider any exclude-listed cells as candidate for cell reselection.\nFor cell reselection to NR operating with shared spectrum channel access, the UE shall consider only the allow-listed cells, if configured in SIB24, as candidates for cell reselection.\nThe UE shall inherit the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time (i.e., T320 in E-UTRA and NR, T322 in UTRA and T3230 in GERAN), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection. The UE shall delete altFreqPriorities provided by dedicated signalling, if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.\nNOTE 7:\tThe network may assign dedicated cell reselection priorities for frequencies not configured by system information.\nWhile T360 is running, redistribution target is considered to be the highest priority (i.e. higher than any of the network configured values). UE shall continue to consider the serving frequency as the highest priority until completion of E-UTRAN Inter-frequency Redistribution procedure specified in 5.2.4.10 if triggered on T360 expiry/ stop.\nFor NB-IoT measurement rules for cell re-selection is defined in clause 5.2.4.2.a.\nWhen evaluating Srxlev and Squal of non-serving cells for reselection purposes, the UE shall use parameters provided by the serving cell.\nFollowing rules are used by the UE to limit needed measurements:\n-\tIf the measurements are performed using RSS as specified in [10] and the serving cell fulfils Srxlev > SIntraSearchP:\n-\tIf distanceThresh and referenceLocation are broadcast in SystemInformationBlockType31, and if the UE supports location-based measurement initiation and has obtained its location information:\n-\tIf referenceLocation is set to fixedCell, referenceLocation is used as serving cell reference location.

                    "text_content": "The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in idle mode in order to reduce power consumption. One Paging Occasion (PO) is a subframe where there may be P-RNTI transmitted on PDCCH or MPDCCH or, for NB-IoT on NPDCCH addressing the paging message. In P-RNTI transmitted on MPDCCH case, PO refers to the starting subframe of MPDCCH repetitions. In case of P-RNTI transmitted on NPDCCH, PO refers to the starting subframe of NPDCCH repetitions unless subframe determined by PO is not a valid NB-IoT downlink subframe then the first valid NB-IoT downlink subframe after PO is the starting subframe of the NPDCCH repetitions. The paging message is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.\nThe UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN paging. If the UE receives a CN initiated paging in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS.\nOne Paging Frame (PF) is one Radio Frame, which may contain one or multiple Paging Occasion(s). When DRX is used the UE needs only to monitor one PO per DRX cycle.\nOne Paging Narrowband (PNB) is one narrowband, on which the UE performs the paging message reception.\nPF, PO, and PNB are determined by following formulae:\nPF is given by following equation:\nSFN mod T= (T div N)*(UE_ID mod N)\nIndex i_s pointing to PO from subframe pattern defined in 7.2 will be derived from following calculation:\ni_s = floor(UE_ID/N) mod Ns\nIf P-RNTI is monitored on MPDCCH, the PNB is determined by the following equation:\nPNB = floor(UE_ID/(N*Ns)) mod Nn\nIf P-RNTI is monitored on NPDCCH and the UE supports paging on a non-anchor carrier, and if paging configuration for non-anchor carrier is provided in system information, then the paging carrier is determined by the paging carrier with smallest index n (0 ≤ n ≤ Nn-1) fulfilling the following equation:\nfloor(UE_ID/(N*Ns)) mod W < W(0) + W(1) + … + W(n)\nSystem Information DRX parameters stored in the UE shall be updated locally in the UE whenever the DRX parameter values are changed in SI. If the UE has no IMSI, for instance when making an emergency call without USIM, the UE shall use as default identity UE_ID = 0 in the PF, i_s, and PNB formulas above. If the UE has no 5G-S-TMSI, for instance when the UE has not yet registered onto the network, the UE shall use as default identity UE_ID = 0 in the PF and i_s formulas above.\nThe following Parameters are used for the calculation of the PF, i_s, PNB, wg, and the NB-IoT paging carrier:\n-\tT: DRX cycle of the UE.\nIn RRC_IDLE state:\n-\tExcept for NB-IoT: If a UE specific extended DRX value of 512 radio frames is configured by upper layers according to 7.3, T =512. Otherwise, T is determined by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value, if allocated by upper layers, and a default DRX value broadcast in system information. If UE specific DRX is not configured by upper layers, the default value is applied.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state, if extended DRX is not configured by upper layers as defined in 7.3:\n-\tT is determined by the shortest of the RAN paging cycle, if configured, the UE specific paging cycle, if allocated by upper layers, and the default paging cycle.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state if extended DRX is configured by upper layers according to 7.3:\n-\tIf a UE specific extended DRX value of 512 radio frames is configured, T is determined by the shortest of the RAN paging cycle, if configured, and 512 radio frames.\n-\tIf a UE specific extended DRX value other than 512 radio frames is configured:\n-\tDuring the PTW, T is determined by the shortest of the RAN paging cycle, if configured, the UE specific paging cycle, if allocated by upper layers, and the default paging cycle. Outside the PTW, T is determined by the RAN paging cycle, if configured.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state, if the UE supports inactiveStatePO-Determination and the network broadcasts ranPagingInIdlePO with value \"true\", the UE uses the T value applicable for RRC_IDLE state for the determination of i_s. Otherwise, the UE uses the T value applicable for RRC_INACTIVE state.\nIn RRC_INACTIVE state, a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage uses the T value applicable for RRC_IDLE state for the determination of PNB and i_s.\nFor NB-IoT: If UE specific DRX value is allocated by upper layers and minimum UE specific DRX value is broadcast in system information, T = min (default DRX value, max (UE specific DRX value, minimum UE specific DRX value broadcast in system information)).
