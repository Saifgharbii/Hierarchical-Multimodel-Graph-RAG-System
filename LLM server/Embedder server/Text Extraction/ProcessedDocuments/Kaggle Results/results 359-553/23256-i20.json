The UAV shall support UUAA during Registration and PDU session establishment procedure. The network shall support UUAA during PDU session establishment.\n-\tIn EPS: during the attach procedure and the corresponding PDN connection establishment. The network shall support UUAA during PDN connection establishment. The UAV shall support UUAA during PDN connection establishment procedure.\n-\tA UAV that is provisioned with a CAA-Level UAV ID shall provide the CAA-Level UAV ID in 5GS in both Registration and in PDU Session establishment. In EPC, a UAV that is provisioned with a CAA-Level UAV ID provides the CAA-Level UAV ID in PDN Connection establishment in SM-PCO. The CN determine whether UUAA is executed at 5GS registration or at PDU session/PDN Connection establishment, based on local policies.\n-\tThe UUAA is performed at PDU session establishment when the UAV requests user plane resources for UAV operation and the UAV provides its CAA Level ID during PDU session (PDN connection) establishment.\n-\tThe UAV flight authorization and UAV-UAVC pairing authorization is performed at PDU session/PDN connection establishment/modification procedures.\n-\tThe 3GPP system supports USS authorization of pairing between a UAV and a networked UAVC or a UAVC that connects to the UAV via Internet connectivity during either the establishment of the PDN connection/PDU session for C2 communication or a modification of a PDN connection/PDU session either dedicated to C2 communication or common to USS communication and C2 communication. Modifications of the pairing or re-authorization take place via modification of the established PDN connection/PDU session. During such procedures, the USS provides to the 3GPP system information (e.g. QoS requirement, data flow descriptors, etc.) that enable traffic between the UAV and the UAVC.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the USS is made aware of the UAVC is outside the scope of 3GPP in this Release.\n-\tFor EPC, the PDN connections used by UAV are served by SMF+PGW-C regardless of whether the UAV support 5G NAS or whether their subscription allows access to 5GC. The APN(s) used by the UAV for contacting USS or for C2 communication always resolves to a SMF+PWG-C.\nThe following architectural assumptions apply:\n-\tIt is assumed that the UAV trying to access UAS services using 3GPP connectivity is already registered with a USS and has been assigned a CAA-Level-UAV ID. The procedure for UAV registration and assignment of CAA-Level-UAV ID is out of scope of 3GPP. The USS assigns to the UAV a CAA-Level UAV ID, or is made aware of the assigned CAA-Level UAV ID.\n-\tA UAV is associated with an Aerial subscription in the UDM. The Aerial subscription contains aerial UE indication in the Access and Mobility Subscription data (to be used similarly to aerial UE indication defined in EPS), an aerial service indication in the Session Management Subscription data for each DNN dedicated for UAS services (C2 and UUAA-SM) which indicates that corresponding authentication/authorization has to be done using API based mechanism.\n-\tAn UAV is identified by USS using a CAA-level UAV ID, and identified by the 3GPP System using a 3GPP UAV ID assigned by the MNO:\n-\tIt is assumed that an aerial subscription associated to a UAV includes at least one GPSI to be used as 3GPP UAV ID.\n-\tA UAV is registered with the USS either before connecting with the 3GPP system or using plain internet connectivity via the 3GPP system. Before registering for UAS services with the 3GPP system, the UAV shall be provisioned with a CAA-Level UAV Identity.\n-\tIn roaming scenarios, it is assumed that access to USS is in the VPLMN, thus packet data connectivity for UAV-USS communication is in local breakout, and the UAS NF function is located in the VPLMN.\n-\tIn this Release, the UAV uses 3GPP access (i.e. LTE & NR) for 3GPP UAV related operations.\n-\tActivation of RAN aerial features for UAV accessing via E-UTRA reuses the existing mechanism defined in TS 36.300 [7].\nNOTE 2:\tIn this Release, an UAV is served by single USS for the duration of the connectivity between the USS and the UAV.\n-\tOne or more USS(s) may be present in a specific region and may manage UAVs over one or more 3GPP networks.\n-\tThe 3GPP Network subscription for the UAV is not assumed to contain any information about the USS.\n-\tThe USS address, if known to the UAV, is configured in the UAV via mechanisms outside the scope of 3GPP.\n-\tFor PC5, Release 15 (and later) version of the specification is the baseline.\nNOTE 3:\tIn this Release, UAV UE uses A2X capability to support the PC5 based DAA and BRID.\n\n",

How the association between a UAV and a USS is realized, is outside the scope of 3GPP and is not related to the UAV subscription with the mobile operator.\nIn order to enable the interaction between the 3GPP network and the USS serving a UAS, the 3GPP network needs to discover the correct USS serving a specific UAV. This is required either during 5GS registration (when the UUAA is performed during 5GS registration), or during PDU session/PDN connection establishment.\nIt is assumed that mechanisms for resolution of CAA Level UAV ID to the USS serving the corresponding UAV, defined outside 3GPP, and available to entities outside the 3GPP system (e.g. the TPAE), are used in the 3GPP system to discover the USS for the UAV.\nOptionally, the UAV may also provide to the 3GPP system, in addition to the CAA-level UAV ID, the USS address (USS IP address or USS FQDN) in order to discover the USS for the UAV.\nWhen the UAV provides the USS address (i.e. USS FQDN) separately from the CAA-Level UAV ID in UUAA-MM or UUAA-SM, the USS address (i.e. USS FQDN) shall be used to discover the USS.

No CAA-level UAV ID is assigned to and used by a UAVC.\nVarious formats of CAA-level UAV ID must be supported by the UAV to support various geo-specific regulations. At least Serial Number Identification, a CAA-Issued Registration Identifier (aka Session ID), and USS Issued UUID shall be supported.\nIn the case of Session ID, though the actual format of the CAA-Level UAV ID is defined outside 3GPP and is not decided by 3GPP, it is assumed that the CAA-Level UAV ID used for Remote Identification contains at least the following information:\n-\tan identity unique to the UAV, which may preferably have temporary validity: this identifies uniquely the UAV with the entity that allocates the CAA-level UAV ID.\nNOTE 1:\tWhether privacy or confidentiality requirements will apply to the unique UAV temporary identity depends on regulations in various regions.\n-\tCAA-level UAV ID Routing Information, used by an entity attempting to retrieve the UAV data (e.g. TPAE) to identify and address the appropriate UAS NF/NEF where to send the query.

When the UAV registers with the USS before registering to a 3GPP system for UAS services, the UAV operator provides information about the serving PLMN to the USS. In order to allocate a CAA-Level UAV ID, the USS interacts with a UAS NF if 3GPP Assisted CAA-Level UAV ID Assignment is desired. The 3GPP network selects a UAS NF to respond to the USS, and the UAS NF provides to the USS the CAA-Level Routing Information to enable a resolver of the CAA-level UAV ID to resolve to the UAS NF.\n-\tThe USS delegates to the UAS NF the role of \"resolver\" of the CAA-Level UAV ID and return to an entity (e.g. the TPAE) querying information about the UAV based on the CAA-Level UAV ID the UAV data that the UAS NF retrieves from the USS.\nEditor's note:\tThe details of mechanisms of exposure of UAS-NF to entities beyond USS outside the 3GPP system is FFS.\n-\tIt is assumed that the mapping between USS assigned CAA-level UAV ID and the associated 3GPP UAV ID is known by the UAS NF after the UAV is authorized by the USS via a successful UUAA.

The UUAA-MM procedure is triggered by the AMF. UUAA-MM is triggered during the UE Registration based on the local network policy, if the UE has an Aerial UE subscription with the 5GS and if the UE has provided the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV in the Registration Request, or when the USS that authenticated the UAV triggers a re-authentication.\nThe UE is authenticated and authorized by USS using a CAA-Level UAV ID and credentials associated to the CAA-Level UAV ID, different from the 3GPP subscription credentials (e.g. SUPI and credentials used for PLMN access). During UUAA-MM procedure, the AMF communicates with the USS via a UAS NF and forwards authentication messages transparently between the UE and UAS NF.\nUAS NF stores the UAV UEs UUAA context after successful UUAA procedure. The UUAA context may be stored in the UDSF or may be stored locally in the UAS NF depending on deployments. The UAS NF shall also create an implicit subscription for notification towards the AMF after the successful UUAA procedure. This notification is used by the UAS NF to trigger re-authentication, update authorization data or revoke authorization of the UAV, upon receipt of such request from the USS.\nThe figure depicts the UUAA (Universal User Association Architecture) in the context of the Registration procedure (UUAA-MM), which is a key component of the 5G network. The figure illustrates the UUAA architecture, including the role of the Registration Service (RS), the Registration Server (RS-R), and the Registration Client (RS-C). The figure also shows the UUAA-MM protocol, which is used to manage the registration process. The figure is a crucial visual aid for understanding the 5G network architecture and the role of the UUAA in the registration process.\nFigure 5.2.2.1-1: UUAA in the context of the Registration procedure (UUAA-MM)\n1.\tThe UE sends a Registration request message and, if configured with one, it shall provide a CAA-level UAV ID of the UAV and optionally a USS address when registering for UAS services.\n2.\tIf primary authentication is required (e.g. if this is an initial Registration), AMF invokes it as described in step 9 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3]. Subsequently AMF retrieves UE subscription data from UDM as described in step 14 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3] - (not shown in the figure).\n3.\tAMF shall determine whether UUAA-MM is required for the UAV. The AMF decides that UUAA is required if:\na)\tthe UE has a valid Aerial UE subscription information;\nb)\tUUAA is to be performed during Registration according to local operator policy;\nc)\tthere is no successful UUAA result from a previous UUAA-MM procedure;\nd)\tthe UE has provided a CAA-Level UAV ID.\nAMF shall not perform UUAA-MM for non-3GPP access and shall ensure that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial services in non-3GPP access by rejecting PDU session establishment requests for aerial services (identified by DNN/S-NSSAI).\n4.\tIf AMF determines in step 3 that a UUAA-MM is to be performed, AMF shall include a pending UUAA-MM indication in the Registration Accept message. The AMF stores in the UE context that a UUAA is pending. The UE shall wait for completion of the UUAA-MM procedure without attempting to register for UAS services or to establish user plane connectivity to USS or UAV-C.\nIf AMF determines that UUAA is not to be performed during this Registration procedure, UUAA may be triggered during PDU Session Establishment later on.\nIf UUAA is configured in the AMF to be performed during 5GS registration and the UE has provided a CAA-Level UAV ID in the registration request in step 1, but the UE does not have an aerial subscription in the UE subscription data retrieved from the UDM in step 2, then the AMF rejects the registration with an indication informing no aerial subscription. This information indicates to the UAV of the reason for the rejection for aerial services and ensures that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial service.\nIf UAS services become enabled or disabled (e.g. because the aerial subscription becomes a part of the UE subscription data retrieved from UDM as described in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3]) then AMF may trigger a UE Configuration Update procedure as described in clauses 4.5.1 and 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3] to notify the UE. The UE may initiate a mobility registration update procedure to get the UAS services after completion of the UE Configuration Update procedure.\nIf UUAA is configured in the AMF to be performed during 5GS registration, the UE did not provide a CAA-Level UAV ID in the registration request in step 1, but UE has aerial subscription in the UE subscription data retrieved from UDM in step 2, then the AMF accepts the registration and ensures that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial service by storing in the UE context that 'UUAA-MM has FAILED', and further rejecting PDU session establishment requests for aerial services (identified by DNN/S-NSSAI). At a later point in time, if the UE wants to use the aerial services by providing the CAA Level UAV ID later on via UUAA-MM procedure, then the UE shall first perform Mobility Registration Update as explained in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\n5.\tIf UE indicates its support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA) procedure in the UE MM Core Network Capability, and if the UE includes Requested S-NSSAI in Registration Request which is subject to NSSAA, however, the Requested S-NSSAI has not been successfully authenticated, the NSSAA procedure is executed as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\n6.\tIf required based on step 3 determination, and if the S-NSSAI that is associated with the UAS services is part of the Allowed NSSAI, UUAA-MM procedure (see clause 5.2.2.2) is executed at this step. Once the UUAA-MM procedure is successfully completed for the UAV, the AMF stores a successful UUAA result and updates the UE context indicating that UUAA is no longer pending and the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID if provided by the USS. The USS may provide a new CAA-Level UAV ID as the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID. The AMF shall trigger a UE Configuration Update procedure (see TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.4.2) to deliver the UUAA result, the UUAA Authorization Payload containing UAV configuration and the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID if received from the USS to the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UAV configuration is application layer information outside the scope of 3GPP.\nIf UUAA fails, based on local network policy, the AMF may decide to de-register the UE with an appropriate cause value in the De-Registration Request message, or keep the UE-registered with a failure UUAA result in UE context as described in step 7 of clause 5.2.2.2 and ensures that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial service based on the DNN/S-NSSAI value. If the UE is de-registered, the UE may re-attempt to re-register without including the CAA-level UAV ID.\nNOTE 2:\tThe security aspects for this procedure is defined in TS 33.256 [10].\nThe figure depicts a UUAA-MM procedure, which is a method used in the field of telecommunications to manage and optimize the performance of a network. The figure shows a flowchart with various steps, such as selecting the appropriate protocol, configuring the network parameters, and monitoring the network performance. The figure is important for understanding the steps involved in implementing the UUAA-MM procedure and ensuring that the network is running efficiently.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-1: UUAA-MM procedure\n1.\tFor a UE that requires UUAA or when triggered by re-authentication by USS, the AMF triggers a UUAA-MM procedure. If the UE does not have an Aerial subscription in the UE subscription data retrieved from the UDM, the AMF shall not trigger a UUAA-MM procedure.\n2.\tAMF to UAS NF/NEF: The AMF invokes Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize Request message. For initial authentication, this shall include the GPSI and the CAA-Level UAV ID and may include USS address (e.g. FQDN), UUAA Aviation Payload if it was provided by the UE. For re-authentication triggered by AMF, this may not include the CAA-Level UAV ID. UAS NF resolves the USS address based on CAA-Level UAV ID or uses the provided USS address, as described in clause 4.4.2. In addition, the AMF may also include the User Location Information (e.g. Cell ID). The UAS NF should store the serving AMF ID.\nThe AMF identifies the UAS NF/NEF based on local configuration or by NF discovery procedure using DNN/S-NSSAI and/or UE provided identity e.g. USS address.\nThe AMF also provides a Notification Endpoint to the UAS NF/NEF, so that UAS NF/NEF can include this Notification Endpoint together with UUAA updated parameters, as shown in clause 5.2.4. By providing the Notification Endpoint, the AMF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of re-authentication, update authorization data or revocation of UAV from UAS NF/NEF, if the UUAA result is successful in step 5.\nNOTE 1:\tThe security aspects for this procedure is defined in TS 33.256 [10].\n3.\tUAS NF/NEF to USS: Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize Request message, shall include the GPSI and CAA-Level UAV ID and optionally UAV location obtained from AMF in step 2 e.g. to support geo-caging functionality. UAS NF/NEF may translate the Cell ID received as UAV location from AMF in step 2 into a corresponding geographic area and/or may further obtain the UE location information using Location Service Procedures as defined in TS 23.273 [8].\nThe UAS NF/NEF also provides a Notification Endpoint to the USS, so that USS can include this Notification Endpoint together with UUAA updated parameters, as shown in clause 5.2.4. By providing the Notification Endpoint, the UAS NF/NEF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of re-authentication, update authorization data or revocation of UAV from USS, if the UUAA result is successful in step 5.\n4.\t[Conditional] Multiple round-trip messages as required by the authentication method used by USS. Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize Response messages from USS shall include GPSI and shall include a authentication message based on authentication method used that is forwarded transparently to UE over NAS MM transport messages. The authentication message in step4d may contain UUAA Aviation Payload required by the USS if it was not provided by the UE before.\n5.\tUSS to UAS NF/NEF: (final) Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize Response message, shall include: GPSI, a UUAA result (success/failure) for the UAV and the UAS NF, may include an authorized/new CAA-Level UAV ID for the UAV and a UUAA Authorization Payload to the UAV (e.g. security info to be used to secure communications with USS), and a final authentication message (e.g. indicating success or failure, and if the UUAA is for re-authentication, indicating whether the UAS service related network resource can be released in case of UUAA failure) based on authentication method used that is forwarded transparently to UE over NAS MM transport messages.\n6.\tUAS NF/NEF to AMF: (final) Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize Response message, forwards information received from USS in step 5. If UUAA for re-authentication failed and UAS NF/NEF received indication that the UAS service related network resource can be released in step 5, the UAS NF/NEF includes an indication that the PDU sessions associated with the \"DNN(s) subject to aerial services\" can be released.\n7a.\t[Conditional] UAS NF/NEF to AMF: If UUAA-MM succeeded and UAS NF/NEF has not subscribed to AMF for the Mobility Event Exposure before, UAS NF/NEF subscribes to AMF for the mobility event notification by sending Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe request with the mobility events as described in TS 23.502 [3], Table 5.2.2.3.1-1 with Event ID = Reachability Filter.\n7b.\t[Conditional] UAS NF/NEF to AMF: If UUAA-MM failed and UAS NF/NEF has subscribed to AMF for the Mobility Event Exposure earlier, UAS NF/NEF unsubscribes to AMF for the mobility event notification by sending Namf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request with Subscription Correlation ID.\n8a.\t[Conditional] AMF to UAS NF/NEF: The AMF acknowledges the subscription request from 7a by sending Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe response with Subscription Correlation ID.\n8b.\t[Conditional] AMF to UAS NF/NEF: The AMF acknowledges the un-subscription request from 7b by sending Namf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe response.\n9.\tAMF to UE: (final) NAS MM transport message forwarding authentication message from USS including authentication/authorization result (success/failure).\n10.\t[Conditional] if UUAA-MM succeeded, AMF triggers a UE Configuration Update procedure to deliver to the UAV authorization information from USS, as described in clause 5.2.2.1.\n11.\t[Conditional] If UUAA-MM fails during a Re-authentication and Re-authorization and there are PDU session(s) established using UAS services, and the USS has indicated that the network resources can be released, AMF may trigger these PDU Sessions release. AMF identifies the relevant PDU session(s) for UAS services based on the DNN/S-NSSAI value of the PDU session.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the UUAA-MM fails during a Re-authentication, and the USS has not indicated that the network resources can be released, the USS can initiate UUAA revocation as described in clause 5.2.7.\n[Conditional] if UUAA-MM fails, based on network policy the AMF may trigger Network-initiated Deregistration procedure described (as specified in clause 4.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]) and it shall include in the explicit De-Registration Request the appropriate rejection cause value.\nIf there is an AMF relocation for the UAV, the new serving AMF shall notify the UAS NF about the new AMF ID and the related CAA-level UAV ID using the existing AMF event notification service.\nAt any time after the initial registration, the USS (via UAS NF/NEF) or the AMF may initiate Re-authentication procedure for the UAV. For AMF initiated case the Re-authentication procedure shall start from step 2. USS initiated re-authentication procedure is described in clause 5.2.4.\nIf the UE is deregistered as per clause 4.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], then the AMF shall unsubscribe to UAS NF and then UAS NF/NEF may clear the UUAA-MM context and update USS.\n",

                            "text_content": "NOTE 1:\tThe security aspects for this procedure is defined in TS 33.256 [10].\nAn UAV uses PDU Sessions or PDN Connections in the UE for connectivity with the USS and for connectivity with a networked UAV-C.\nA networked UAV-C is a UE which uses existing procedures for establishing PDU Session or PDN Connection for communication with the USS/UTM, and the procedures described in this clause do not apply to a networked UAV-C.\nThis clause describes procedure that applies both for 5GS and EPS, where PDU Session refers to 5GS and PDN Connection refers to EPS.\nPDU Session(s)/PDN Connection(s) for UAS services shall only be established after a UAV has been authenticated and authorized by the USS. This may happen during UUAA-SM as described in this clause.\nA UAV may use either a common or separate PDU Session/PDN connection for connectivity with the USS and a UAV-C.\nWhen the UAV requests establishment of a PDU session/PDN connection, the PDU session/PDN Connection may require UUAA authorization of the UAV, subject to operator policy and regulatory requirements.\nIf the UAV uses the PDU session/PDN connection for C2 the PDU session is subject to C2 authorization as described in clause 5.2.5.\nThe PDU Session/PDN Connection is identified by the SMF/SMF+PGW-C as being for USS/C2 communication based on the aerial service indication set in the Session Management Subscription data for the DNN or DNN and S-NSSAI combination.\nTo subscribe to the PDU Session/PDN Connection Status Event, UAS NF/NEF determines the APN/DNN or DNN and S-NSSAI combination as below:\n-\tThe UAS NF/NEF may receive APN/DNN or DNN and S-NSSAI combination from the USS as specified in clause 4.15.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3];\n-\tThe UAS NF/NEF may map the AF-Identifier from the USS into APN/DNN or DNN and S-NSSAI combination based on local configuration as specified in clause 4.15.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3]; or\n-\tThe UAS NF/NEF may map the External Application Identifier from the USS into the APN/DNN or DNN and S-NSSAI combination based on local configuration.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the PDU session/PDN connection for C2 communication and the PDU session/PDN connection for USS communication are separate, different AF-Identifiers or External Application Identifiers can be used.\nDuring the establishment or modification procedure of the PDU Session/PDN connection for C2 communication, the USS shall provide the 3GPP system with following information for enabling basic C2 communication between UAV and UAV-C:\n-\tTraffic filters;\n-\tQoS requirements.\nThe USS can enable/disable C2 communication between UAV and UAV-C necessary for services used during the flight operation at any point in time as described in clause 5.2.9.\nUAS NF stores the UAV UEs UUAA context after successful UUAA-SM procedure. The UUAA context may be stored in the UDSF or may be stored locally in the UAS NF depending on deployments. The SMF shall subscribe for notifications from UAS NF which may be used to trigger re-authentication, update authorization data or revoke authorization of the UAV, upon receipt of such request from the USS.\nClause 5.2.3.2 defines the USS UAV Authorization/Authentication (UUAA) procedures at PDU Session Establishment in 5GS and clause 5.2.3.3 is for the PDN Connection Establishment in the Attach procedure for EPS using the interworking functionality.\nWhen the C2 authorization is revoked by the USS, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall release the PDU Session/PDN connection for C2 communication (in case separate PDU Sessions/PDN Connections are used), or disable C2 communication for the PDU Session/PDN connection (in case common PDU Session/PDN Connection is used), e.g. by removing the traffic filters for C2 communications and the QoS flow for C2 communication, and informs the UE with a PDU session modification/bearer modification request.\nWhen the UUAA is revoked by the USS, all UAV related PDU Session/PDN connections shall be released.\nThe USS UAV Authorization/Authentication (UUAA) is triggered by the SMF during the PDU Session Establishment, specified in TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.3.2.2 and additionally based on the SM subscription data obtained from UDM, and the Service Level Device Identity provided by the UE in the PDU Session establishment request.\nThe figure depicts a UUAA (User Unicast Association and Acknowledgement) session during PDU (Physical Data Unit) Session Establishment in a 5G network. The diagram illustrates the process of establishing a session between a UE (User Equipment) and a GSP (Gigabit Service Provider) using the PDU. The figure shows the UE's connection to the GSP, the GSP's connection to the network, and the network's connection to the GSP. The figure also includes the PDU session establishment process, including the establishment of the session key, the establishment of the session, and the establishment of the session's data.\nFigure 5.2.3.2 -1: UUAA during PDU Session Establishment\nThe procedure assumes that the UE/UAV has already registered on the AMF.\n0.\tSteps 1 - 5 as in TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.3.2.2.1-1.\nThe UAV includes the Service Level Device Identity (e.g. the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UVA) and may include the Authentication Server Address (i.e. the USS address) and optionally Authentication Data (i.e. the UUAA Aviation Payload) in the PDU Session Establishment request.\nThe SMF determines that it needs to invoke UAS NF/NEF service operation for UUAA Authentication/Authorization of the PDU session establishment request based on that the provided DNN/S-NSSAI combination is dedicated for aerial services (have aerial service indicator set) and that the Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level-UAV ID) is included in the request. If the provided APN/DNN is dedicated for aerial services but Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is not provided, the SMF shall reject the establishment of the PDU Session and steps 1 - 9 are not performed.\nThe SMF identifies the UAS NF/NEF based on local configuration or by NF discovery procedure using DNN/S-NSSAI and/or UE provided identity e.g. USS address.\n1.\tThe SMF invokes Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize service operation, including the Service Level Device Identity (that contains the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV), DNN, S-NSSAI, and may include the Authentication Server Address (i.e. the USS address) and the UUAA Aviation Payload if it was provided by the UE, GPSI, optionally UAV location, PEI if available, and the UE IP Address if available. The UAV location is the User Location Information provided by the AMF (e.g. Cell ID). The UAS NF/NEF selects a USS based on either the Service Level Device Identity (i.e. CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV) or the Authentication Server address (i.e. USS address) as described in clause 4.4.2.\nSMF also provides a Notification Endpoint to the UAS NF/NEF, so that UAS NF/NEF can include this Notification Endpoint together with UUAA updated parameters, as shown in clause 5.2.4. By providing the Notification Endpoint, the SMF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of re-authentication, update authorization data or revocation of UAV from UAS NF/NEF, if the UUAA result is successful in step 4.\n2.\tFrom UAS NF/NEF to USS: Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize service operation forwarding the authentication request received information from the SMF. UAS NF may translate the Cell ID received as part of UAV location in the Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request at step 1 into a corresponding geographic area and/or may further obtain the UE location information using Location Service Procedures as defined in TS 23.273 [8] and include them in the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize message towards the USS e.g. to support geo-caging functionality.\nUAS NF/NEF also provides a Notification Endpoint to the USS, so that USS can include this Notification Endpoint together with UUAA updated parameters, as shown in clause 5.2.4. By providing the Notification Endpoint, the UAS NF/NEF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of re-authentication, update authorization data or revocation of UAV from USS, if the UUAA result is successful in step 4.\n3.\t[Conditional] Multiple round-trip messages as required by the authentication method used by USS. This step is performed if the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response messages from USS in step 3a does not contain a UUAA result (SUCCESS/FAILURE). Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response messages from USS shall include GPSI and shall include an authentication message based on authentication method used that is forwarded transparently to UE over NAS MM transport messages. The authentication message in step3e may contain UUAA Aviation Payload required by the USS if it was not provided by the UE before.\n4.\tFrom USS to UAS NF/NEF: Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response.\nThe USS sends Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response to the UAS NF/NEF with the Authentication/Authorization result containing the UUAA result (SUCCESS/FAILURE) for the UAS NF and indication whether the UAS service related network resource can be released in the case of UUAA failure for re-authentication or re-authorization, optionally a Service Level Device Identity containing the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID, requested policy information and the UUAA Authorization Payload. The requested policy information from USS may contain a DN Authorization Profile Index and/or a DN authorized Session AMBR. The USS may include a new CAA-Level UAV ID as authorized CAA-Level UAV ID.\nNOTE 1:\tThe USS stores a mapping between CAA-Level UAV ID and the External Identifier (i.e. GPSI as defined in clause 4.5.3). The External Identifier (GPSI) and/or UAV IP Address can be used at a later point by the USS for accessing various services exposed by 3GPP network e.g. location information retrieval, monitoring event configuration, requesting dedicated policies for e.g. C2, etc.\n5.\tThe UAS NF/NEF confirms the successful Authentication/Authorization of the PDU Session. The UAS NF/NEF stores the UUAA result together with the GPSI. UAS NF/NEF forwards the Authentication/Authorization result, a Service Level Device Identity containing the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID and the Authorization Data (i.e. the UUAA Authorization Payload), if received from the USS, to the SMF.\n6.\t[Conditional] If the authentication/authorization is successful, the USS shall subscribe to the PDU Session Status Event as described in steps 1-5 in Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 of TS 23.502 [3]. This step can be executed in parallel to step 4. The UAS NF/NEF determines the DNN, S-NSSAI to subscribe to the PDU Session Status Event notification as specified in clause 5.2.3.1.\n7.\tThe PDU Session establishment continues with steps 7 to 21 in Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3] and completes. In the step 7b in Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1of TS 23.502 [3], if the SMF receives the DN Authorization Profile Index from the UAS NF/NEF, it sends the DN Authorization Profile Index to retrieve the PDU Session related policy information (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [9]) and the PCC rule(s) (described in clause 6.3 of TS 23.503 [9]) from the PCF. If the SMF receives the DN authorized Session AMBR in from the UAS NF/NEF, it sends the DN authorized Session AMBR within the Session AMBR to the PCF to retrieve the authorized Session AMBR (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [9]).\nThe SMF transfers the Authentication/Authorization result, the Service Level Device Identity containing the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID and the Authorization Data (i.e. the UUAA Authorization Payload) to the UAV if received from the UAS NF, as in steps 11, 12 and 13 in figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3].\nIf the authentication/ authorization result is a failure, the SMF rejects the PDU session establishment with a proper cause value.\n8.\t[Conditional] If the USS in step 6 subscribed to the PDU Session Status Event the SMF will, as described in steps 6-7 in Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 of TS 23.502 [3], detect when the PDU Session is established, and send the PDU Session Establishment event report to the UAS NF/NEF by means of Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, including GPSI and the UE IP Address. Then, the UAS-NF/NEF forwards the event message to the USS.\nIf UUAA-SM fails during a Re-authentication and Re-authorization and the USS has indicated that the network resources can be released, SMF may trigger PDU Session release for UAS services with a proper cause value.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the UUAA-SM fails during a Re-authentication, and the USS has not indicated that the network resources can be released, the USS can initiate UUAA revocation as described in clause 5.2.7.\nNOTE 3:\tIf C2 information reference is available from USS during the initial PDU Session Establishment procedure the SMF can interact with the PCF to set up a predefined PCC rule(s) profile for the C2 communication.\nIf the PDU session is released as per clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [3] then the SMF shall unsubscribe to UAS NF/NEF and then UAS NF/NEF may clear the UUAA-SM context and update USS.\nIn the figure 5.2.3.3-1 the execution of the UUAA is specified.\nThe figure depicts the establishment of a PDN connection during the attachment procedure in EPS, illustrating the various steps involved in the process.\nFigure 5.2.3.3-1: UUAA during PDN connection establishment at Attach procedure in EPS\n0.\tSteps 1 - 13 in TS 23.401 [6] figure 5.3.2.1-1 and steps 1 - 2 in TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.11.1.5.2-1 or clause 4.11.2.4.1 in TS 23.502 [3].\nUE sends Attach Request including the Service Level Device Identity (i.e. the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV), and may include the Authentication Server Address (i.e. the USS address) and optionally Authentication Data (i.e. the UUAA Aviation Payload), etc. in the PCO to the SMF+PGW-C.\nBased on that the Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is provided with the request, the SMF+PGW-C retrieves the Session Management Subscription Data from the UDM+HSS using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, and based on that the provided APN/DNN is dedicated for aerial services (have aerial service indicator set), it determines to invoke UAS NF/NEF service operation for UUAA Authentication/Authorization. If the provided APN/DNN is dedicated for aerial services but Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is not provided, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject the establishment of the PDU Session and steps 1 -9 are not performed.\nNOTE 1:\tThe definition of the PCO field is for stage 3 to specify.\n1.\tSMF+PGW-C configures an Access Control List (ACL) in UPF+PGW-U to stop any traffic over the default PDN Connection until the UUAA has been done and successful.\n2.\tSteps 14 - 22 in figure 5.3.2.1-1 of TS 23.401 [6] and steps 3 - 6 in figure 4.11.1.5.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3] or clause 4.11.2.4.1 of TS 23.502 [3].\nDuring the Attach procedure, at step 15 of Figure 5.3.2.1-1 in TS 23.401, the SMF+PGW-C includes, in PCO, an Indication to the UE that \"UpLink Data NOT ALLOWED\" on the PDN connection. The UE shall not send Uplink data to the network, until it receives an indication further from the network that \"UpLink Data ALLOWED\".\n3.\tUUAA is invoked as described in steps 1 and 2 of figure 5.2.3.2-1.\n4.\t[Conditional] Multiple round-trip messages as required by the authentication method used by USS. This step is performed if the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response messages from USS in step 4a does not contain a SUCCESS/FAILURE indication. The PCO including the authentication message from the USS is transferred to the UE by the SMF+PGW-C in Update Bearer Request and Downlink NAS Transport (steps 4b - 4d). The response from the UE is transferred to the SMF+PGW-C in an Uplink NAS Transport and Update Bearer Response (steps 4e - 4g).\n5.\tUUAA procedure continues as described in steps 4 & 5 of figure 5.2.3.2-1.\n6.\tIf the authentication/authorization is successful, the USS shall subscribe to the PDN Connection Status Event as described in steps 1-5 in figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 of TS 23.502 [3]. This step can be executed in parallel to step 5. The UAS NF/NEF determines the APN/DNN to subscribe to the PDN Connection Status Event notification as specified in clause 5.2.3.1.\n7.\tIf the UUAA is successful, the SMF+PGW-C contacts the PCF to update the PDN Connection. Then the SMF+PGW-C updates the Access Control List (ACL) and policies in the UPF+PGW-U to allow traffic over the default PDN Connection. If a DN Authorization Profile Index was received from the UAS NF/NEF SMF+PGW-C in previous step, the SMF+PGW C includes that when retrieving the ACL from the PCF. If the SMF receives the DN authorized Session AMBR in from the UAS NF/NEF, it sends the DN authorized Session AMBR within the Session AMBR to the PCF to retrieve the authorized Session AMBR (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [9]).\n8.\tThe SMF+PGW-C updates the UE by invoking the PDN GW initiated bearer modification without QoS update procedure (figure 5.4.3-1 of TS 23.401 [6]) initiated by sending an Update Bearer Request message to the SGW. The PCO includes an indication that \"UpLink Data ALLOWED\", the UUAA Aviation Payload i.e. the Authentication/Authorization result and the Authorization Data. The UE (for the UAV) confirms the update (see clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [6]).\n9.\tIf the USS in step 6 subscribed to the PDN Connection Status Event the SMF+PGW-C will, as described in steps 6-7 in Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 of TS 23.502 [3], detect when the PDN Connection is established and send the PDN Connection Establishment event report to the UAS NF/NEF by means of Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, including GPSI and the UE IP Address. Then, the UAS NF/NEF forwards the event message to the USS.\n",

Two sides of C2 communication, i.e. UAV and UAV-C, belong to the same UAS.\nA UAV shall be authorized by the USS to use a PDU Session/PDN connection for C2. Authorization for C2 includes the following:\n-\tUAV to UAV-C pairing authorization: Authorization for pairing with a networked UAV-C or a UAV-C that connects to the UAV via Internet connectivity, before the UAV and the UAV-C can exchange C2 communication. One UAV can be paired with only one UAV-C at the any time. One UAV-C may be paired with one or more UAVs at the same time.\n-\tFlight Authorization: Authorization for flight when UAV also provides Flight Authorization information.\nC2 authorization may be carried out:\n-\tDuring the UUAA procedure (if UUAA is carried out at PDU session/PDN connection establishment) as described in clause 5.2.3 when the UAV requests establishment of PDU Session/PDN connection for connectivity.\n-\tDuring PDU Session Modification/ UE requested bearer resource modification when the UAV requires to use an existing PDU session/PDN connection to exchange C2 communication related messages.\n-\tDuring a new PDU Session/PDN connection establishment, if the UAV requires to use a separate PDU Session/PDN connection for C2 communication.\nIf C2 authorization is requested during the UUAA-SM procedure the procedure described in clause 5.2.3.2 takes place with the following additions:\n-\tIn Step 0, the UE includes pairing information (if available) in a C2 Aviation Payload. which is forwarded further to the USS;\n-\tIn step 4, the USS performs C2 authorization taking into account the included pairing information, the Service Level Device Identity/CAA-Level UAV ID and 3GPP UAV ID/GPSI. The USS includes the resulting C2 Authorization result and optionally a C2 authorization payload in the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response returned to the UAS-NF/NEF and the UAS NF/NEF forwards to the UAV/UE in step 7.\n-\tThe USS shall:\n-\tin step 4 include a DN Authorization profile Index specifying a predefined set of PCC-rules in the PCF with initial restriction on the type of traffic allowed to pass on the PDU-session. For example, only traffic exchanged with the USS might be allowed to pass.\nOnce the authentication is complete, after step 4, the USS subscribes to PDU Session Status Events for the PDU session used for C2 communication, applicable for the GPSI received in step 2.\n-\twhen the USS in step 8 receives a PDU Session State Event Report indicating session start and including the PDU Session IP address the USS invokes the USS initiated pairing policy configuration procedure (see figure 5.2.5.4.1-1) with the received PDU Session IP address and authorized paired UAV-C IP-address as input to request corresponding traffic to be allowed on the PDU session in the UPF.\nC2 authorization is requested at PDU session Modification:\n-\tAfter UUAA-SM is performed and a common PDU session is used for connectivity to USS and C2 communication to a UAV-C (as configured in the UAV); or\n-\tIf the UE has already established a PDU session for C2 communication to a UAV-C.\nThe figure depicts a PDU Session modification for C2 communication, specifically for UAS services, with common PDU session for UAS services. The figure shows the PDU Session modification process, including the modification of the PDU Session ID, PDU Session ID, and the PDU Session ID.\nFigure 5.2.5.2.2-1: PDU Session modification for C2 communication (common PDU session for UAS services)\n1.\tThe UE establishes a PDU Session for USS communication as described in clause 5.2.3.\n2-3.\tWhen the UAV needs to establish C2 communication the UAV determines that an existing PDU session can be used and initiates a PDU Session Modification procedure. The UE shall include in the request a CAA-Level UAV ID and shall include a C2 Aviation Payload within a UAS container that includes C2 authorization information. The USS may also use its locally configured pairing information for UAV - UAV-C pairing authorization which takes precedence over UAV provided pairing information. The pairing information includes the CAA-level UAV ID of the requesting UE and also includes identification information of UAV-C to pair if available. The UAV may also include other information such as Flight Authorization information.\nNOTE:\tHow the pairing information is configured in the UAV is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.\n4.\tThe SMF determines that authorization is required based on that the DNN/S-NSSAI of the PDU session is dedicated for aerial services (have aerial service indicator set) and that the Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is included in the request and Then sends a Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request to the UAS-NF including the UAS container provided by the UAV in step 2 (including the C2 Aviation Payload), the CAA-Level UAV ID, GPSI, PDU Session IP address, and optionally the UAV location (e.g. Cell ID) provided by the AMF.\n5.\tThe UAS-NF forwards the received authorization request as a Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request to the USS.\n6.\tTriggered by step 5, the USS performs C2 authorization based on the received information and invokes, in order to forward the C2 authorization result to the UAV/UE, the UAV Re-authorization procedure (see figure 5.2.4.3-1) including GPSI, CAA-Level UAV-ID (potentially new) and included in the authorization message, the C2 Authorization Result and the C2 Authorization Payload (e.g. containing C2 pairing information and C2 security information).\n7.\tPDU Session Modification procedure forwards the C2 authorization result to the UAV/UE and completes as in figure 4.3.3.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3].\n8.\tThe USS invokes, with the received PDU Session IP address and the IP address of the authorized paired UAV-C as input, the USS initiated pairing policy configuration procedure (see figure 5.2.5.2.4-1) to request corresponding traffic to be allowed on the PDU session in the UPF.\nUnless a dedicated QoS is requested for the C2 flows, this procedure does not invoke any interaction with the UE, AMF or RAN.\nIf C2 authorization is requested during PDU session establishment to a PDU session used specifically for C2 communication to UAV-C the UAV requests C2 authorization as follows.\nThe figure depicts a PDU Session establishment for C2 communication, with separate PDU Sessions for UAS services. This setup allows for efficient communication between the C2 and UAS systems, ensuring reliable and secure communication.\nFigure 5.2.5.2.3-1: PDU Session establishment for C2 communication (separate PDU Sessions for UAS services)\n0.\tThe UAV has performed a successful UUAA with the USS (UUAA-SM or UUAA-MM) and the USS has for the corresponding GPSI subscribed for PDU Session Status Event from the NEF.\n1.\tWhen the UAV needs to establish C2 communication the UAV determines that a new dedicated PDU session is required for connectivity to UAV-C. The UE initiates PDU Session establishment procedure for a DNN/S-NSSAI dedicated for connectivity to UAV-C. In the PDU Session establishment request CAA-Level UAV ID and a C2 Aviation Payload to be used for C2 authorization shall be included and forwarded to the SMF. The pairing information includes the CAA-Level UAV IDs of the requesting UAV and identification information for the UAV-C to pair may be included in C2 Aviation Payload. The UAV may also include other information such as Flight Authorization information. The USS may also use its locally configured pairing information for UAV - UAV-C pairing authorization which then takes precedence over UAV provided pairing information.\n2.\tThe SMF determines that authorization is required based on that the requested DNN/S-NSSAI combination dedicated for aerial services (have aerial service indicator set), and that the Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is included in the request. The SMF then sends a Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request, which is used to request authorization to pair the UAV with UAV-C, to the UAS NF/NEF that includes the GPSI, CAA-Level UAV ID and C2 Aviation Payload and optionally the UAV location (e.g. Cell ID) if provided by the AMF and the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU session.\nIf the requested DNN/S-NSSAI is dedicated for aerial services but no Service Level Device ID (CAA-Level UAV ID) has been provided with the request, the SMF rejects the PDU session establishment with a cause indicating that USS authorization is required.\nThe SMF also provides a Notification Endpoint to the UAS NF/NEF. By providing the Notification Endpoint, the SMF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of re-authorization, update authorization data or revocation of C2 connectivity from UAS NF/NEF, if the C2 authorization result is successful in step 5.\n3.\tThe UAS NF/NEF checks that a valid UUAA is stored for the GPSI and forwards the received authorization request as a Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request to the USS. If not, the request is not forwarded to the USS and the PDU session is rejected.\nThe UAS NF/NEF also provides a Notification Endpoint to the USS. By providing the Notification Endpoint, the UAS NF/NEF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of re-authorization, update authorization data or revocation of C2 connectivity from USS, if the UUAA result is successful in step 5.\nNOTE:\tThe USS may trigger a UAV re-authentication/re-authorization in response to the query from the UAS NF/NEF.\n4.\tThe USS performs C2 authorization based on the received information and sends the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response to the UAS NF/NEF including the Service Level Device Identity (e.g. the CAA-Level UAV-ID) (potentially new), the C2 Authorization Result and the C2 Authorization Payload (e.g. C2 pairing information and C2 security information).\n5.\tThe UAS-NF/NEF forwards the information received from the USS in the Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response sent to the SMF.\n6.\tTo inform the UE about the C2 Authorization Result the SMF includes the authorization result and, optionally, a new CAA-Level UAV ID if received from the USS, in the PDU Session Accept sent to the UE and let the PDU session establishment procedure continue until finalized.\nIf a failed C2 Authorization Result is received from the USS, the SMF instead rejects the PDU establishment and include a reason code indicating not authorized.\n7.\t[Conditional] If the C2 authorization is successful the USS subscribes via the UAS-NF to a PDU Session Status event for the PDU session used for C2 including in the request the GPSI of the UAV. The UAS NF determines DNN, S-NSSAI corresponding to the PDU session used for C2 communication and uses this DNN, S-NSSAI to subscribe to SMF for PDU Session Status event. The SMF detects, as described in step 6-7 of figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 in TS 23.502 [3], when the PDU Session is established and send the PDU Session Status event report to the UAS NF/NEF by means of Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, including GPSI and UE IP Address. The UAS NF/NEF then forwards the event message to the USS.\n8.\t[Conditional] The USS stores the received UE IP address and invokes, with the received PDU Session IP address and the IP-address of the authorized paired UAV-C as input, the USS initiated pairing policy configuration procedure (see figure 5.2.5.2.4-1) to request corresponding traffic to be allowed on the PDU session by the UPF.\nUnless a dedicated QoS is requested for the C2 flows, this procedure does not invoke any interaction with the UE, AMF or RAN.\nIf C2 authorization is requested during the UUAA-SM procedure the procedure described in clause 5.2.3.3 takes place with the following additions:\n-\tIn step 0, the UE includes pairing information (if available) in a C2 Aviation Payload, which is forwarded further to the USS.\n-\tInitially in step 5, the USS performs C2 authorization taking into account the included pairing information, the Service Level Device Identity/CAA-Level UAV ID and 3GPP UAV ID/GPSI. The USS includes the resulting C2 Authorization result in the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response returned to the UAS-NF/NEF and UAS NF/NEF forwards to the UAV/UE in step 8.\n-\tThe USS shall:\n-\tin step 5 include a DN Authorization profile Index specifying a predefined set of PCC-rules in the PCF with initial restriction on the type of traffic allowed to pass on the PDN Connection. For example, only traffic exchanged with the USS might be allowed to pass.\nOnce the authentication is complete, after step 5, the USS subscribes to PDN Connectivity Status Events for the PDN Connection used for C2 communication, applicable for the GPSI received in step 2.\n-\twhen the USS in step 9 receives a PDN Connectivity Status Event Report indicating session start and including the PDN Connection IP address, the USS invokes the USS initiated pairing policy configuration procedure (see figure 5.2.5.4.2-1) with the received PDN Connection IP address and authorized paired UAV-C IP-address as input to request corresponding traffic to be allowed on the PDN Connection in the PGW-U.\nWhen the UAV requests to establish connectivity to an additional PDN over E-UTRAN for C2, the procedure described in clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [6] takes place with the following modifications:\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where a UE (User Equipment) is requesting PDN (Point-to-Point) connectivity for C2 (Command and Control) authorization. The figure illustrates the communication path between the UE and the C2 server, highlighting the need for PDN connectivity to ensure secure and efficient communication.\nFigure 5.2.5.3.1-1: UE requested PDN Connectivity for C2 authorization\n0.\tThe UAV has performed a successful UUAA with the USS (UUAA-SM) and the USS has for the corresponding GPSI subscribed for PDN Connectivity Status Event reports from the NEF.\n1.\tSteps 1 - 3 performed as in Figure 5.10.2-1 of TS 23.401 [6].\nWhen the UAV needs to establish C2 communication, the UAV determines that a new PDN Connection is required for connectivity to UAV-C. The UE initiates a UE Requested PDN Connectivity procedure for connectivity to UAV-C. In the PCO in the PDN Connectivity Request, the Service Level Device Identity (e.g. the CAA-Level UAV ID) and a C2 Aviation Payload to be used for C2 authorization shall be included and forwarded to the MME. The pairing information includes the Service Level Device Identity (e.g. CAA-Level UAV IDs) of the requesting UAV and identification information for the UAV-C to pair may be included in C2 Aviation Payload. The UAV may also include other information such as Flight Authorization information. The USS may also use its locally configured pairing information for UAV - UAV-C pairing authorization which then takes precedence over UAV provided pairing information.\nIf Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is provided with the request, the SMF+PGW-C retrieves (if not already available) the Session Management Subscription Data for the UE from the UDM+HSS using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation.\n2.\tThe SMF+PGW-C determines that authorization is required based on that the requested APN/DNN is dedicated for aerial services (have aerial service indicator set) and that the Service Level Device Identity (CAA-Level UAV ID) is included in the request. The SMF+PGW-C then sends a Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request, which is used to request authorization to pair the UAV with UAV-C, to the UAS NF/NEF that includes the GPSI, Service Level Device Identity (e.g. the CAA-Level UAV ID) and C2 Aviation Payload and optionally the UAV location (e.g. Cell ID) if provided by the MME and the APN/DNN of the PDN Connection.\nIf the SMF+PGW-C determines that the authorization procedure with the USS is required, but the UAV has not provided the Service Level Device Identity (e.g. the CAA-Level UAV ID), the SMF+PGW-C rejects the PDN Connectivity Request with a cause indicating that USS authorization is required.\n3.\tThe UAS NF/NEF checks that a valid UUAA is stored for the GPSI and forwards the received authorization request as a Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize request to the USS. If not, the request is not forwarded to the USS and the PDN connection is rejected.\n4.\tThe USS performs C2 authorization based on the received information and sends the Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response to the UAS NF/NEF including the Service Level Device Identity (e.g. the CAA-Level UAV-ID) (potentially new), the C2 Authorization Result and the C2 Authorization Payload (e.g. C2 pairing information and C2 security information).\n5.\tThe UAS NF/NEF forwards the information received from the USS in the Nnef_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize response sent to the SMF+PGW C.\n6.\tTo inform the UE about the C2 authorization result the SMF+PGW-C includes the C2 Authorization Result and optionally, the Authorization Payload (e.g. C2 pairing information and C2 security information) and a new Service Level Device Identity (e.g. CAA-Level UAV ID) if received from the USS, in the PCO in the PDN Connectivity Accept sent to the UE and let the PDN Connectivity Request procedure continue until finalized.\nIf a failed C2 authorization result is received from the USS, the SMF+PGW-C instead rejects the PDN Connectivity Request and includes a cause code indicating not authorized.\n7.\tIf the C2 authorization is successful the USS subscribes via the UAS NF/NEF to a PDN Connection Status Event report for the PDN Connection used for C2 including in the request the GPSI of the UAV. The UAS NF/NEF determines the APN/DNN and uses this APN/DNN to subscribe to SMF+PGW-C for PDN Connection Status Event. The SMF+PGW-C detects, as described in step 6-7 of figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 in TS 23.502 [3], when the PDN Connection is established and sends the PDN Connection Status Event report to the UAS NF/NEF by means of Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, including GPSI and UE IP Address. The UAS NF/NEF then forwards the event message to the USS.\n8.\tThe USS stores the received UE IP address and invokes, with the received PDN Connection IP address and the IP-address of the authorized paired UAV-C as input, the USS initiated C2 pairing policy configuration in EPS procedure (see figure 5.2.5.4.2-1) to request corresponding traffic to be allowed on the PDN Connection by the PGW-U.\nUnless a dedicated QoS is requested for the C2 flows, this procedure does not invoke any interaction with the UE, MME or RAN.\nC2 authorization is requested at UE requested bearer resource modification (see clause 5.4.5 of TS 23.401 [6]):\n-\tAfter UUAA-SM is performed and a common PDN Connection is used for connectivity to USS and C2 communication to a UAV-C (as configured in the UAV); or\n-\tIf the UE has already established a PDN Connection for C2 communication to a UAV-C.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an UE (User Equipment) has requested a bearer resource modification on an existing PDN (Point-to-Point Network) connection for C2 authorization. This modification is necessary to ensure the security and integrity of the network. The figure illustrates the process of modifying the bearer resource, which is a crucial aspect of network security.\nFigure 5.2.5.3.2-1: UE requested bearer resource modification of an existing PDN connection for C2 authorization\n0.\tThe UE establishes a PDN Connection for USS communication as described in clause 5.2.3.\n1.\tWhen the UAV needs to establish C2 communication, the UAV determines that an existing PDN Connection can be used and initiates a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure as Steps 1 - 3 in Figure 5.4.5-1 of TS 23.401 [6]. In the PCO in the request, the UE includes a Service Level Device Identity (e.g. CAA-Level UAV ID) and shall include a C2 Aviation Payload that includes C2 authorization information. The USS may also use its locally configured pairing information for UAV - UAV-C pairing authorization which takes precedence over UAV provided pairing information.

                            "text_content": "3GPP network supports the functionality of UAV Tracking via the service exposure support towards USS. The USS invokes 3GPP network service through a UAS-NF for UAV tracking. The UAS-NF acts as an NEF/SCEF and interacts with other network functions (e.g. GMLC and AMF/MME) to support UAV tracking. The USS shall use 3GPP UAV ID (e.g. GPSI) for identifying an individual target UAV. When USS/TPAE initiates UAV tracking via USA NF, it should include an indication of reliable UE location information required in the request. For further details on the architecture reference model, see clause 4.2.\nThree UAV tracking modes are supported:\n-\tUAV location reporting mode;\n-\tUAV presence monitoring mode; and\n-\tList of Aerial UEs in a geographic area..\nUSS/TPAE could at any time choose a UAV tracking mode and provide the corresponding request to UAS NF. The USS/TPAE logic on its choice of UAV Tracking Model is out of scope of 3GPP.\nThe 3GPP network may also provide the UAV location to the USS during the UUAA procedures, as described in clause 5.2.2 and clause 5.2.3.\nFor UAV location reporting mode, the USS/TPAE that wants to be reported on the UAV location subscribes to the UAS NF with the target 3GPP UAV ID. The USS/TPAE could indicate the required location accuracy, reliable UE location information required and whether it's for immediate reporting or deferred reporting (e.g. periodic reporting). With the request received from USS/TPAE, UAS NF identifies the related NF, i.e. GMLC and trigger existing procedures to retrieve the location report. Then UAS NF reports back the UAV's location together with the 3GPP UAV ID to the USS/TPAE.\nFor UAV presence monitoring mode, the USS/TPAE may subscribe for the event report of UAV moving in or out of the geographic area (e.g. longitude/latitude, zip code, etc). The request includes target 3GPP UAV ID, indication of reliable UE location information required and geographic area info.\nIf the requested geographic area info can be mapped to 3GPP defined area, such as a list of Tracking Areas or a list of cells as currently supported by 3GPP network as the Area Of Interest, UAS NF subscribes to AMF/MME for reporting the presence of the UAV in Area Of Interest using existing AMF/MME procedures, otherwise UAS NF subscribes to GMLC for configuring the presence monitoring. Upon receiving the report from AMF/MME or GMLC, the UAS NF notifies USS/TPAE for the UAV presence in the geographic area.\nThe USS may provide policies or rules to UAS NF based on the received event notification. If the traffic routing policies or rules were provided to UAS NF, when the location of UAV or the UAV presence in the monitoring area matches a policy, UAS NF based on the policy indicates SMF to take the appropriate network layer actions, e.g. revoke the connectivity between UAV and UAV controller. UAS NF considers those policies as active and ongoing instructions from USS without constant or repeated triggers/requests from USS. The traffic routing policy includes 3GPP UAV ID(s) (i.e. GPSI(s)) to identify the UAV(s) and the corresponding network layer actions e.g. revoke the resources of the related C2 communications.\nIn this mode, the USS/TPAE requests UAS NF for a list of the UAVs in the geographic area and served by the PLMN (i.e. no 3GPP UAV ID provided by the USS/TPAE). The request includes geographic area info, indication of reliable UE location information required and indication of one-time reporting by setting \"maximumNumberOfReports\" to 1. If the geographic area info can be mapped to 3GPP defined area such as a list of Tracking Areas or a list of cells, UAS NF triggers existing AMF/MME procedures to get the UE list within the TAI(s) or Cell Id(s). The UAS NF may include Aerial UE indication as an event filter in the request, that is used by the AMF/MME to separate out the UEs that are actual UAVs based UEs with aerial subscriptions. If the geographic area info cannot be mapped to 3GPP defined area such as a list of Tracking Areas or a list of cells, UAS NF provides a list of Tracking Areas which is larger than the geographic area to AMF/MME to retrieve the UE list within the list of Tracking Areas. Then UAS NF identifies UAVs from the UE list and obtains the location for each identified UAV via LCS procedure toward GMLC. The UAS NF compares the UAV location with the geographic area to identify the UAVs in the geographic area and provides feedback to USS/TPAE. For the UAV list received from the AMF/MME or the UAV list identified with GMLC provided location, the UAS NF performs the filtering by checking for each 3GPP UAV ID reported whether there is match for the corresponding UAV context. The UAS NF may also verify whether the requesting USS is authorized to obtain the location info of the UAV.\nIn the above UAV tracking modes, UAS NF may need to map the 3GPP UAV ID to 3GPP internal IDs and vice versa. The CAA Level UAV ID may be optionally provided by the UAS NF, if available, to the USS/TPAE during tracking and location reporting of UAV.\n",

It is applicable for a specific area, such as a stadium or arena where UAVs are used e.g. for filming an event. It is based on a ground-based entity, Area Airspace Manager (AAM), that is able to detect UAVs in the specific area and provide local steering policies to the individual UASs in order to avoid the UAVs crashing into each other or different structures etc. The policy may e.g. include allowed flying zones and positions allowed for the specific UAV. The policy may also apply to a specific outdoor area, e.g. an event, where specific measures to avoid collision between drones are established locally.\nNOTE 1:\tThe policies provided by the AAM is application specific steering/DAA policies that are out of scope of 3GPP. The same or different local policies can be provided to the UAVs in the arena. UAVs can, for example, be given different fly zones in the arena just like people have different seating in an arena.\nThe high-level principles of the network-assisted (ground based) DAA are:\n-\tThe arena/area has a ground-based entity Area Airspace Manager (AAM).

For example, in case of BRID different UAVs can use different methods, such as WLAN, Bluetooth or PC5 direct communication, for broadcasting the Remote ID and in case of NRID the AAM will, based on the geolocation of the UAV, retrieve the Remote ID from the USS at application layer. For the NRID case the AAM will typically have to be authorized by the UTM to be allowed to retrieve the Remote ID.\n-\tBased on the retrieved Remote ID, the AAM activates PC5 communication with each detected UAV by triggering establishment of an A2X PC5 unicast link based on procedures described in clause 6 using the UAV's Remote-ID as Application-Layer-ID (i.e. Target User Info) in the Direct Communication Request message.\nFor Direct Communication over PC5 the UAV and AAM shall comply with the authorization and provisioning principles described in clause 4.2.1.2.2 including the following considerations:\n-\tThe default destination Layer-2 ID to be used for initial signalling to establish a unicast connection for the A2X service.\n-\tParameters for Groupcast are not applicable.\nNOTE 5:\tUse of LTE PC5 for the unicast is not supported in this Release.\n-\tThe AAM uses PC5 unicast link to provide each UAV present in the arena/area with local DAA policies as user traffic.\n-\tA UAV that receives local collision avoidance related policies from the AAM over PC5 may forward the policies to its UAV-C so that the UAV-C can steer the UAV accordingly by use of C2 communication (e.g. over Uu, PC5, or other means) in order to enforce the local policies and avoid collisions.\nNOTE 6:\tWhether and how to forward the policies from UAV to its UAV-C and how UAV-C uses the policies is out of scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 7:\tA UAV-C that receives local collision avoidance policies from an AAM, can inform the AAM about its network address (e.g. IP address or URL) in order to enable direct AAM to UAV-C communication via Data Network.

Methods which may be used includes broadcast of Remote-ID via PC5, WiFi and Bluetooth and also Network Remote ID.\nHow this is done is out of the 3GPP scope.\n4.\tFor each detected UAV/UE the AAM establishes a PC5 direct communication link with the discovered UAV for AAM to UAS interaction by performing the Layer-2 link establishment procedure as described when Target User Info is included in clause 6.3.3.1 of TS 23.287 [11] (Fig 6.3.3.1-1 step 2, 3 4a, 5a and 6). The AAM application layer provides a service type indicating the A2X service \"Ground-based DAA for an area\" and the retrieved Remote-ID as target UE's Application Layer ID. As a result of this procedure a PC5 unicast direct communication link enabling bidirectional data exchange is set up between the application layer in the AAM and the UAV application layer of the UAV/UE having the specified Remote-ID.\n5.\tOptionally the UAV/UE may, when the PC5 unicast direct communication link between the AAM and the UAV/UE has been set up for NR, activate a corresponding bidirectional communication connection extending the link from the UAV to the UAV-C using the specific communication technology used for C2 communication (may e.g. be LR Wi-Fi or PC5). This enables packets received on the link (i.e. from the AAM) to be forwarded to the UAV-C and packets received from the UAV-C to be forwarded on the link (i.e. towards the AAM). Implementation aspects for this step are out of scope for 3GPP.\n6.\tUsing the PC5 unicast direct communication link the AAM and the UAV establishes a bidirectional communication channel for exchange of messages. Optionally this channel can be extended to involve the UAV-C using the bi-directional tunnel. The protocol and implementation aspects for this step are out of scope for 3GPP.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UAV-C and/or the UAV can use the communication channel to provide application specific information to the AAM, how and what information is out of 3GPP scope. Based on awareness of the current UAV traffic situation, local info and plans for the area/arena, the AAM determines locations and flight paths appropriate for the specific UAV such that collisions can be avoided and creates a corresponding application specific steering policy being out of scope of 3GPP.\n7.\tThe AAM provides the determined steering policy to the specific UAV using the activated communication channel. Optionally it can be forwarded to the UAV-C which can return corresponding C2 commands.

These two operation modes may be used by a UE independently of different A2X communications.\nA2X communications over PC5 reference point are supported by LTE and/or NR.\nA2X communications over Uu reference point are supported by NR connected to 5GC.\nA2X leverages both LTE PC5 as defined in TS 23.285 [12] and NR PC5. For LTE PC5 in EPS, the network scheduled operation mode defined in TS 23.285 [12] is not supported and the A2X uses only the UE autonomous resources selection mode.\nGroupcast mode for NR based PC5 is not supported.\nSubscription to A2X services based on the user's profile stored in the UDM is supported as described in clause 6.2.5.\nBoth UAV UEs that utilize Uu connectivity and that do not utilize Uu connectivity (i.e. either UAV UEs that are Uu capable and do not use Uu) are supported. A UAV without utilizing Uu capabilities may use A2X for C2 communication, BRID and DDAA and be configured via A2X1 over a transport outside the scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 1:\tUAV UEs without utilizing Uu capabilities are part of the 3GPP ecosystem since they use A2X1 for configuration by a A2X Application Server and implement PC5 connectivity specified by 3GPP.\nBoth UAVs with UICC and UAVs without UICC (i.e. with no subscription to an MNO) are supported. UAVs with no UICC can only perform A2X communications when authorized for \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\".\nNo specific authorization of the use of PC5 for A2X services (i.e. BRID, DDAA, Ground based DAA) is required by the USS. For UAVs without UICC, or UAVs with UICC that are out of coverage or are served by a PLMN where UUAA has not been performed, the use of PC5-based communications for A2X services is authorized only by A2XP via pre-configuration or A2X1.\nIn this version of the specification, UAV UEs may support A2X capability for A2X communication over PC5 reference point and/or A2X capability for A2X communication over Uu reference point.\nIn this Release, communication over PC5 between the UAV UEs served by different PLMNs is possible in NR when the UAV UEs use the same sidelink carrier.\nUAV UEs that use the UE autonomous resources selection based on pre-configuration for NR PC5 can communicate over NR PC5 independently of the serving PLMN. The UE shall support the procedures described in clause 5.1.2.2 of TS 23.287 [11], for both E-UTRA and NR, so that the UE can perform A2X communications over PC5 reference point when \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\". The UE, in order to perform these procedures, shall reliably locate itself in the corresponding Geographical Area. Otherwise, the UE is not authorized to transmit.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is out of scope of the present specification to define how the UE can locate itself in a specific Geographical Area. When the UE is in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can for example, use information derived from the serving PLMN. When the UE is not in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can use other techniques, e.g. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). User provided location is not a valid input.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that any security of A2X solution is addressed by SA WG3.\nNOTE 4:\tThe A2X application layer schemes developed in other SDOs are outside the scope of this specification.\n",

The architecture for the Inter-PLMN PC5 case is similar to the one defined in clauses 4.2.3 and 4.2.4.\nThe 5G System provides NEF services to enable communication between NFs in the PLMN and A2X Application Server. Figure 6.1.2.2-1 shows the high level view of AF-based service parameter provisioning for A2X communications. The A2X Application Server may provide A2X service parameters to the PLMN via NEF. The NEF stores the A2X service parameters in the UDR.\nThe figure depicts the 5G system architecture for AF-based service parameter provisioning for A2X communications, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The figure includes key elements such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, as well as the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.

PCF discovery and selection mechanism defined in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2] applies and the AMF may include the A2X capability indication in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request message as the optional input parameter. If provided, the NRF takes the information into account for discovering the PCF instance.\n-\tIf the AMF receives the PC5 capability for A2X in the Registration Request message from UE, the AMF further reports the PC5 capability for A2X to the selected PCF. The PCF may determine the A2X Policy/Parameter for specific PC5 RAT based on the received UE's PC5 capability for A2X.\nThe PCF may update the A2X Policy/parameters to the UE in following conditions:\n-\tUE Mobility, e.g. UE moves from one PLMN to another PLMN. This is achieved by using the procedure of UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF, as defined in clause 4.16.12.1 of TS 23.502 [3].\n-\tWhen there is a subscription change in the list of PLMNs where the UE is authorized to perform A2X communication over PC5 reference point. This is achieved by using UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF procedure as defined in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\n-\tWhen there is a change of service specific parameter as described in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3].\nIf the serving PLMN is removed from the list of PLMNs in the service authorization parameters, the service authorization is revoked in the UE.\nWhen the UE is roaming, the change of subscription resulting in updates of the service authorization parameters are transferred to the UE by H-PCF via V-PCF.\nThe UE may perform UE triggered Policy Provisioning procedure to the PCF, after Registration procedure has been completed, as specified in clause 6.3.2.3 when the UE determines the A2X Policy/Parameter is invalid (e.g. Policy/Parameter is outdated, missing or invalid).\nThe UE triggered Policy Provisioning procedure is initiated by the UE to request A2X Policy/Parameter from the PCF when UE determines the A2X Policy/Parameter is invalid in the following cases:\n-\tif the validity timer indicated in the A2X Policy/Parameter expires;\n-\tif there are no valid parameters, e.g. for the A2X service type a UE wants to use, for current area, or due to abnormal situation.\nThe figure depicts a UE triggered A2X Policy provisioning procedure, illustrating the steps involved in configuring an A2X policy for a UE. The figure includes a diagram of the network topology, with the UE at the center, and the A2X policy being triggered by the UE. The steps are shown in a sequential manner, with the UE initiating the process, followed by the network controller, and finally the A2X policy being activated.

The AMF stores this information for A2X operation. The PC5 Capability for A2X indicates whether the UE is capable of A2X communication over PC5 reference point and which specific PC5 RAT(s) it supports.\n-\tThe AMF obtains the A2X Subscription data as part of the user subscription data from UDM during UE Registration procedure using Nudm_SDM service as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\n-\tThe AMF determines whether the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point based on UE's PC5 Capability for A2X and the subscription data related to A2X service authorization information (i.e. \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT and UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT) received from UDM, and stores the A2X service authorization information as part of the UE context.\n-\tThe PCF provides the PC5 QoS parameters to AMF, and the AMF stores them in the UE context.\n-\tIf the UE is PC5 capable for A2X, and the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point based on the subscription data, then the AMF shall include the following information in the NGAP message sent to NG-RAN:\n-\ta \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT, indicating the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point.\n-\tUE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT, used by NG-RAN for the resource management of UE's PC5 transmission for A2X services in network scheduled mode.\n-\tthe PC5 QoS parameters used by the NG-RAN for the resource management of UE's PC5 transmission for A2X services in network scheduled mode.\n-\tIf the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point, then the AMF should not initiate the release of the signalling connection after the completion of the Registration procedure. The release of the NAS signalling relies on the decision of NG-RAN, as specified in TS 23.502 [3].\nThe Service Request procedure for UE in CM-IDLE state is performed as defined in TS 23.502 [3] with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE is PC5 capable for A2X, and the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point, then the AMF shall include a \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT in the NGAP message.\n-\tThe AMF includes the UE-PC5-AMBR for A2X per PC5 RAT in the NGAP message to the NG-RAN as part of the UE context and NG-RAN may use in resource management of UE's PC5 transmission for A2X services in network scheduled mode.\n-\tThe AMF sends the PC5 QoS parameters for A2X to NG-RAN via N2 signalling. The PC5 QoS parameters may be stored in the UE context after the registration procedure. If the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point but AMF does not have PC5 QoS parameters available, the AMF fetches the PC5 QoS parameters from the PCF.\nThe N2 based handover or the Inter-RAT to NG-RAN handover procedures for UE are performed as defined in TS 23.502 [3] with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE is PC5 capable for A2X, and the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point, then the target AMF shall send the \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT, UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT and PC5 QoS parameters to the target NG-RAN as follows:\n-\tFor the intra AMF handover, the \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT, UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT and PC5 QoS parameters are included in the NGAP Handover Request message.\n-\tFor the inter AMF handover or Inter-RAT handover to NG-RAN, the \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT, UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT and PC5 QoS parameters are included in the NGAP Handover Request message sent to the target NG-RAN.\nThe Xn based handover procedures for UE are performed as defined in TS 23.502 [3] with the following additions:\n-\tIf the \"A2X services authorized\" indication is included in the UE context (as described in TS 38.423 [16]), then the source NG-RAN shall include a \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT, UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT and PC5 QoS parameters in the XnAP Handover Request message to the target NG-RAN.\n-\tIf the UE is PC5 capable for A2X, and the UE is authorized to use A2X communication over PC5 reference point, then the AMF shall send the \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT, the UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT and PC5 QoS parameters to the target NG-RAN in the Path Switch Request Acknowledge message.\nThe procedure of Subscriber Data Update Notification to AMF is performed as defined in TS 23.502 [3] with the following additions:\n-\tThe Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation may contain the \"A2X services authorized\" indication per PC5 RAT and/or the UE-PC5-AMBR per PC5 RAT.\n-\tThe AMF updates the UE Context with the above new A2X subscription data.\n-\tWhen the AMF updates UE context stored at NG-RAN, the UE context contains the A2X subscription data.\nThe UE Policy Association Establishment procedure and UE Policy Association Modification procedure, as defined in TS 23.502 [3], is used to provide to the AMF PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN. When receiving Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create Request from the AMF which includes the PC5 capability for A2X or when receiving the updated subscription data from UDR, the PCF generates the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN corresponding to a UE.\nThe (V-)PCF provides the information to the AMF as follows:\n-\tIn the roaming case, the H-PCF includes the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create Response message or Npcf_UEPolicyControl UpdateNotify Request message sent to V-PCF in an N2 PC5 policy container, and V-PCF relays this N2 PC5 policy container as the N2 container in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message sent to AMF.\n-\tIn the non-roaming case, the PCF includes the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN in an N2 container in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message sent to AMF.\nWhen the AMF determines that the N2 PC5 policy container comes from (V-)PCF, the AMF stores such information as part of the UE context.\nIn the UE Configuration Update procedure triggered by UE Policy Association Establishment or UE Policy Association Modification:\n-\tThe AMF forwards the PC5 QoS parameters in the NGAP message to the NG-RAN if a N2 PC5 policy container is received in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message.\n-\tThe AMF forwards the PC5 QoS parameters in the NAS message to UE by using the UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy delivery procedure defined in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3] if a UE Policy Container is received in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the PC5 QoS parameters are provided to both NG-RAN and UE, both the N2 PC5 Policy Container and the UE Policy Container are included in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message.\nNOTE 2:\tNon-UE specific PC5 QoS parameters, e.g. default PC5 QoS parameters, can also be locally configured in NG-RAN. How such configuration is performed is out of scope of this specification.\n\n",
