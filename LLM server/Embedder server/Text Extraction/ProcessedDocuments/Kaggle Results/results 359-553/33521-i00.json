Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced document.\nshould\tindicates a recommendation to do something\nshould not\tindicates a recommendation not to do something\nmay\tindicates permission to do something\nneed not\tindicates permission not to do something\nThe construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.\ncan\tindicates that something is possible\ncannot\tindicates that something is impossible\nThe constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and \"need not\".\nwill\tindicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nwill not\tindicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nmight\tindicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nmight not\tindicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nIn addition:\nis\t(or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\nis not\t(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\nThe constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.\n",

Personal data of the UE's user are involved also. When NWDAF uses such personal data in analytics with other information together, such data correlation operation could bind more personal information with the user's identity. Thus, privacy information about that specific user could be revealed to the person who is allowed to operate data correlation for analytics but not allowed to know the privacy information as the result of data correlation. Therefore, applicable measures (e.g. data masking) shall be applied to mitigate such privacy violation risk.\nThreat References: TR 33.926 [ 4], clause 5.3.6.7, Personal Identification Information Violation\nTest Name: TC_DATA_MASKING\nPurpose:\nVerify that no privacy information of operators' users is revealed to the party who is not allowed to have.\nPre-Condition:\nThe vendor shall provide the documentation describing how to create an account for accessing the analytics results.\nPrivacy information list (should be specified based on local policy, regulation and others).\nExecution Steps:\n1.\tReview the documentation provided by the vendor describing how to create the account for accessing the analytics results provided by the NWDAF.\n2.\tThe tester creates the account, and retrieves the analytics results from the NWDAF using the account.\nExpected Results:\nThe tester can create the account, and the account does not reveal subscriber permanent identifier.\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot containing the results.\n",
