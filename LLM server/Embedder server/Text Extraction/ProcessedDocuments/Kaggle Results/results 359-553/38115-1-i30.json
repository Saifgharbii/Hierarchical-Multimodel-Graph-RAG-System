The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nThe spurious emission minimum requirements are provided in table 6.5.4.5.2-1 where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply for repeater type 1-C.

Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.5.4.5.2 -1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tFor unsynchronized operation, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor NR Band n28 repeater, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for repeater for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 5:\tFor NR Band n29 repeater, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for NR repeater for co-existence with UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band. ΔfOBUE is defined in clause 6.5.1.\nThe spurious emission minimum requirements for this requirement are:\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-2: Repeater spurious emissions minimum requirements for repeater for co-existence with PHS for DL\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR repeater operating in Band n50 and n75 within the 1432 – 1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and Band n76. The minimum requirements are specified in Table 6.5.4.5.2-3. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-3: Additional operating band unwanted emission minimum requirement for NR repeater operating in Band n50 and n75 within 1432 – 1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and n76\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to repeater operating in NR Band n50 and n75 within 1492-1517 MHz and in Band n74 within 1492-1518 MHz. The maximum level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies Ffilter with filter bandwidth according to Table 6.5.4.5.2-4, shall be defined according to the minimum requirements PEM,n50/n75,a nor PEM,n50/n75,b declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-4: Operating band n50, n74 and n75 declared emission above 1518 MHz\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band n13 and n14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-5: Repeater spurious emissions limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR repeater operating in Band n30. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-6: Additional NR repeater spurious emissions minimum requirements for Band n30\n\nThe following requirement may apply to repeater operating in Band n48 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-7: Additional repeater spurious emissions limits for Band n48\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nNOTE:\tThe regional requirement, included in [14], is defined in terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.\nThe following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-8: Repeater spurious emissions limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to Repeater for Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the Repeater downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the Repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-9: Additional repeater spurious emissions minimum requirements for Band n41 and n90\n\nThe following requirement may apply to repeater operating in 3.45-3.55 GHz in Band n77 in certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in table 6.5.4.2.3-11.\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-10: Additional repeater spurious emissions limits for Band n77\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to repeater operating in Band n54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.5.4.5.2-11 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,n54,a, PEM,n54,b, PEM,n54,c, PEM,n54,d, PEM,n54,e and PEM,n54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.5.4.5.2-11: Declared Band n54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419 are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the repeater unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the repeater antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT and repeater type 1-C receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT, or repeater type 1-C are co-located with repeater type 1-C.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with same class.\nThe minimum requirements are in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 for a repeater type 1-C. Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared repeater type 1-C class. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.5.4.5.3-1 shall apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.5.4.5.3-1: Repeater type 1-C spurious emissions minimum requirements for co-location with BS, IAB-Node or repeater-Node\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the frequency range extending ΔfOBUE immediately outside the transmit frequency range of a repeater type 1-C. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [15].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.5.4.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\n",

The ON state represents the signal being transmitted, while the OFF state represents the signal being received. The transient period is a measure of the time it takes for the signal to reach the receiver, which is an important factor in determining the quality of the signal.
