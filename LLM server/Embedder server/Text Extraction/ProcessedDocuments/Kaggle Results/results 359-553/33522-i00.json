Therefore, the general baseline requirements supported by all Network Functions (NF) utilizing Service-Based Interfaces (SBI) as defined in TS 33.117 [2] clause 4.2.2.2 shall also be applicable to the SCP network product class. This clause contains SCP-specific adaptations to the general SBI requirements and related test cases.\nThere are no SCP-specific additions to clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 33.117 [2].\nThe SCP is not a network function instance and does not provide any services to any consumer NF. It supports OAuth 2.0 based service access authorization for NF service access, but it does not verify access tokens as NF producers do. Therefore, the requirements and test cases in clause 4.2.2.2.3 of TS 33.117 [2] are not applicable to the SCP network product class.\n",
