The offset angle is within the range of 0 to 359,999… while the included angle is within the range from 0,000…1 to 360. This is to be able to describe a full circle, 0 to 360.\nThis shape-definition can also be used to describe a sector (inner radius equal to zero), a circle (included angle equal to 360) and other circular shaped areas. The confidence level with which the position of a target entity is included within the shape is also included.\nThe figure depicts an ellipsoid arc, which is a type of arc that is formed by a series of concentric ellipses. The arc is characterized by its elliptical shape and is commonly used in various applications such as navigation, astronomy, and engineering. The figure provides a visual representation of the ellipsoid arc, allowing for a better understanding of its shape and properties.\nFigure 3c: Description of an Ellipsoid Arc\n",
