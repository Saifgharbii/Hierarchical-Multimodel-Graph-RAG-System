If no such provision exists in the ME or the UICC or the provision does not authorize V2X communications over PC5 reference point, then the UE is not authorized to transmit.\n-\tThe UE provisioning shall support setting Geographical Areas.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is possible for a UE to use other radio resources for V2X service based on the Geographical Area instead of those operated by the serving NG-RAN cell, when provisioned in the UE, even if the UE's serving cell offers normal service and the SIBs for NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication defined in TS 38.331 [15] indicates that the service (V2X communication) is available. This is to cover the scenario when e.g. the radio resources used for V2X communications over PC5 reference point are not owned by the serving network of the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen cross-carrier operation is supported, according to TS 36.331 [14] or TS 38.331 [15], a UE can be instructed by its serving cell to perform V2X communication over a different carrier frequency. The UE is still considered as \"served by NR or E-UTRA\" in this case.\nNOTE 3:\tThe scenario that a cell is detected and the cell does not provide support for V2X communications over PC5 reference point when the UE attempts to use a carrier frequency configured for V2X communications over PC5 reference point, is considered a configuration error. Therefore, the UE does not transmit on that frequency to avoid interference to the network.\n-\tThe V2X communications over PC5 reference point is only specified for E-UTRA and NR.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is out of scope of the present specification to define how the UE can locate itself in a specific Geographical Area. When the UE is in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can for example, use information derived from the serving PLMN. When the UE is not in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can use other techniques, e.g. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). User provided location is not a valid input.\n",

V2X communication over PC5 reference point is supported when UE is \"served by NR or E-UTRA\" or when the UE is \"not served by NR or E-UTRA\".\nA UE is authorized to transmit and receive V2X messages when it has valid authorization and configuration as specified in clause 5.1.2.\nThe V2X communication over PC5 reference point has the following characteristics:\n-\tV2X communication over LTE based PC5 reference point is connectionless, i.e. broadcast mode at Access Stratum (AS) layer, and there is no signalling over PC5 for connection establishment.\n-\tV2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point supports broadcast mode, groupcast mode, and unicast mode at AS layer. If V2X application layer of the UE indicates the mode of communication to V2X layer, the V2X layer shall set the mode of communication based on the request of the V2X application layer; otherwise, the V2X layer sets the mode of communication based on the mapping information for a V2X service type defined in clause 5.1.2.1. The V2X layer indicates the mode of communication for the V2X service type to the AS layer. Signalling over control plane over PC5 reference point for unicast mode communication management is supported.\n-\tV2X services communication support between UEs over PC5 user plane.\n-\tBoth IP based and non-IP based V2X services communication are supported over PC5 reference point.\n-\tFor IP based V2X services communication, only IPv6 is used. IPv4 is not supported.\n-\tV2X messages are exchanged between UEs over PC5 user plane.\n-\tBoth IP based and non-IP based V2X messages are supported over PC5 reference point.\n-\tFor IP based V2X messages, only IPv6 is used. IPv4 is not supported.\nThe identifiers used in the V2X communication over PC5 reference point are described in clause 5.6.1. UE decides on the type of PC5 reference point and the Tx Profile for the transmission of a particular packet based on the configuration described in clause 5.1.2. When the LTE based PC5 reference point is selected, the QoS handling corresponding procedures are defined in TS 23.285 [8]. When NR based PC5 reference point is selected, the QoS handling and procedures are defined in clauses 5.4.1 and 6.3.\nIf the UE has an ongoing emergency session via IMS, the ongoing emergency session via IMS shall be prioritized over V2X communication over PC5 reference point.\nNOTE:\tThe emergency session via IMS setup is based on appropriate regional/national regulatory requirements and operator policies as defined in TS 23.501 [6].\nThe security for V2X communication over PC5 reference point is provided with mechanisms defined in TS 33.536 [26]. For broadcast and groupcast mode communication, security is supported in the V2X application layer schemes developed in other SDOs.\nThe pedestrian UEs may use the PC5 DRX mechanism to perform V2X communication over PC5 reference point with power efficiency as specified in clause 5.9.\nBroadcast mode of communication is supported over both LTE based PC5 reference point and NR based PC5 reference point. Therefore, when broadcast mode is selected for transmission over PC5 reference point, PC5 RAT selection needs to be performed based on configuration described in clause 5.1.2. Based on configuration described in clause 5.1.2 and the availability of the corresponding PC5 RAT(s) for the specific V2X service type, the V2X layer in the UE determines PC5 RAT(s) and passes the packet to the applicable PC5 AS (Access Stratum) layer(s) with the appropriate PC5 QoS parameters as defined in clause 5.4.1.1.1\nFor LTE based PC5 reference point, broadcast mode is the only supported communication mode, and the operation details are defined in TS 23.285 [8].\nFor NR based PC5 reference point, the broadcast mode also supports enhanced QoS handling as defined in clause 5.4.1.\nGroupcast mode communication is only supported over NR based PC5 reference point and applies to all types of groups, i.e. Application Layer connection-less group and Application Layer managed group.\nFor Application Layer managed group, the following applies:\n-\tIf the V2X application layer provides a group size and a member ID, the V2X layer passes them to the AS layer for groupcast control, as defined in TS 38.300 [11].\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that the V2X application layer provides accurate and up-to-date information on the group size and the member ID.\nQoS handling for groupcast mode communication is defined in clause 5.4.1.\nUnicast mode of communication is only supported over NR based PC5 reference point. Figure 5.2.1.4-1 illustrates an example of PC5 unicast links.\nThe figure depicts a network setup with PC5 Unicast Links, illustrating the various paths through which data can be transmitted. The diagram shows the path from the source to the destination, with each link represented by a different color and line type. The figure provides a visual representation of the network's structure and the different paths that data can take, helping to understand the network's architecture and how data is transmitted.\nFigure 5.2.1.4-1: Example of PC5 Unicast Links\nThe following principles apply when the V2X communication is carried over PC5 unicast link:\n-\tA PC5 unicast link between two UEs allows V2X communication between one or more pairs of peer V2X services in these UEs. All V2X services in the UE using the same PC5 unicast link use the same Application Layer ID.\nNOTE 1:\tAn Application Layer ID can change in time as described in clauses 5.6.1.1 and 6.3.3.2, due to privacy. This does not cause a re-establishment of a PC5 unicast link. The UE triggers a Link Identifier Update procedure as specified in clause 6.3.3.2.\n-\tOne PC5 unicast link supports one or more V2X service types) if these V2X service types are at least associated with the pair of peer Application Layer IDs for this PC5 unicast link. For example, as illustrated in Figure 5.2.1.4-1, UE A and UE B have two PC5 unicast links, one between peer Application Layer ID 1/UE A and Application Layer ID 2/UE B and one between peer Application Layer ID 3/UE A and Application Layer ID 4/UE B.\nNOTE 2:\tA source UE is not required to know whether different target Application Layer IDs over different PC5 unicast links belong to the same target UE.\n-\tA PC5 unicast link supports V2X communication using a single network layer protocol e.g. IP or non-IP.\n-\tA PC5 unicast link supports per-flow QoS model as specified in clause 5.4.1.\n-\tIf multiple V2X service types use a PC5 unicast link, one PC5 QoS Flow identified by PFI may be associated with more than one V2X service types.\nWhen the Application layer in the UE initiates data transfer for a V2X service type which requires unicast mode of communication over PC5 reference point:\n-\tthe UE shall reuse an existing PC5 unicast link if the pair of peer Application Layer IDs and the network layer protocol of this PC5 unicast link are identical to those required by the application layer in the UE for this V2X service, and modify the existing PC5 unicast link to add this V2X service type as specified in clause 6.3.3.4; otherwise\n-\tthe UE shall trigger the establishment of a new PC5 unicast link as specified in clause 6.3.3.1.\nAfter successful PC5 unicast link establishment, UE A and UE B use the same pair of Layer-2 IDs for subsequent PC5-S signalling message exchange and V2X service data transmission as specified in clause 5.6.1.4. The V2X layer of the transmitting UE indicates to the AS layer whether a transmission is for a PC5-S signalling message (i.e. Direct Communication Request/Accept, Link Identifier Update Request/Response/Ack, Disconnect Request/Response, Link Modification Request/Accept, Keep-alive/Ack) or V2X service data.\nFor every PC5 unicast link, a UE self-assigns a distinct PC5 Link Identifier that uniquely identifies the PC5 unicast link in the UE for the lifetime of the PC5 unicast link. Each PC5 unicast link is associated with a Unicast Link Profile which includes:\n-\tApplication Layer ID and Layer-2 ID of UE A; and\n-\tApplication Layer ID and Layer-2 ID of UE B; and\n-\tnetwork layer protocol used on the PC5 unicast link; and\n-\tthe information about PC5 QoS Flow(s). For each PC5 QoS Flow, the PC5 QoS Context and the PC5 QoS Rule(s) as defined in clause 5.4.1.1.3.\nFor privacy reason, the Application Layer IDs and Layer-2 IDs may change as described in clauses 5.6.1.1 and 6.3.3.2 during the lifetime of the PC5 unicast link and, if so, shall be updated in the Unicast Link Profile accordingly. The UE uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate the PC5 unicast link to V2X Application layer, therefore V2X Application layer identifies the corresponding PC5 unicast link even if there are more than one unicast link associated with one V2X service type (e.g. the UE establishes multiple unicast links with multiple UEs for a same V2X service type).\nThe Unicast Link Profile shall be updated accordingly after a Layer-2 link modification for an established PC5 unicast link as specified in clause 6.3.3.4 or Layer-2 link identifier update as specified in clause 6.3.3.2.\nUpon receiving an indication from the AS layer that the PC5-RRC connection was released due to RLF, the V2X layer in the UE locally releases the PC5 unicast link associated with this PC5-RRC connection. The AS layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate to the V2X layer the PC5 unicast link whose PC5-RRC connection was released.\nWhen the PC5 unicast link has been released as specified in clause 6.3.3.3, the V2X layer of each UE for the PC5 unicast link informs the AS layer that the PC5 unicast link has been released. The V2X layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate the released unicast link.\nFor unicast mode of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the following mechanism for IP address/prefix allocation may be used:\na)\tIPv6 Stateless Address auto configuration specified in RFC 4862 [21] for assignment of IPv6 prefix, with one of the two UEs acting as IPv6 default router.\nNOTE 1:\tWhich UE acts as an IPv6 default router is negotiated during secure layer-2 link establishment by exchanging the IP Address Configuration as described in clause 6.3.3.1.\nb)\tIPv6 link-local addresses as defined in RFC 4862 [21] are formed by UEs locally. The IPv6 link-local addresses are exchanged during the establishment of a secure layer-2 link over PC5 reference point as described in clause 6.3.3.1. The UEs shall disable duplicate address detection after the layer-2 link is established.\nFor broadcast and groupcast modes of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the following source IP address management applies:\n-\tThe UE configures a link local IPv6 address to be used as the source IP address, as defined in clause 4.5.3 of TS 23.303 [17]. The UE may use this IP address for V2X communication over PC5 reference point without sending Neighbour Solicitation and Neighbour Advertisement message for Duplicate Address Detection.\nNOTE 2:\tThe destination IP address management for broadcast and groupcast modes of V2X communication over PC5 reference point is left to UE implementation.\n",

For the V2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point, a PC5 QoS Flow is associated with a PC5 QoS Rule and the PC5 QoS parameters as defined in clause 5.4.2. A set of standardized PC5 5QIs (PQI) are defined in clause 5.4.4. The UE may be configured with a set of default PC5 QoS parameters to use for the V2X service types, as defined in clause 5.1.2.1. For NR based unicast, groupcast and broadcast mode communication over PC5, Per-flow QoS model for PC5 QoS management shall be applied. Figure 5.4.1.1.1-1 illustrates an example mapping of Per-flow QoS model for NR PC5. Details of PC5 QoS Rules and PFI related operations are described in clauses 5.4.1.1.2 and 5.4.1.1.3.\nThe figure depicts a flow-based Quality of Service (QoS) model for NR PC5, which is a key component of the NR PC5 protocol. The model is designed to ensure that the network operates efficiently and reliably, with a focus on minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. The figure includes various flow types, such as per-flow, flow-based, and flow-based-flow, each with its own set of QoS parameters. The model is based on the principles of flow-based QoS, which allows for more efficient use of network resources and better QoS for different types of flows.\nFigure 5.4.1.1.1-1: Per-Flow PC5 QoS Model for NR PC5\nThe following principles apply when the V2X communication is carried over PC5 reference point:\n-\tApplication layer may set the V2X Application Requirements for the V2X communication, using either TS 23.285 [8] defined PPPP and PPPR model or the PQI and Range model as described in clause 5.4.4. Depending on the type of PC5 reference point, i.e. LTE based or NR based, selected for the transmission, the UE may map the application layer provided V2X Application Requirements to the suitable QoS parameters to be passed to the lower layer. The mapping between the two QoS models is defined in clause 5.4.2. For V2X communication over NR based PC5, different V2X packets may require different QoS treatments. In that case, the V2X packets shall be sent from the V2X layer to the Access Stratum layer within PC5 QoS Flows identified by different PFIs.\n-\tWhen groupcast mode of V2X communication over NR based PC5 is used, a Range parameter is associated with the QoS parameters for the V2X communication. The Range may be provided by V2X application layer or use a default value mapped from the V2X service type based on configuration as defined in clause 5.1.2.1. The Range indicates the minimum distance that the QoS parameters need to be fulfilled. The Range parameter is passed to AS layer together with the QoS parameters for dynamic control.\n-\tNR based PC5 supports three communication modes, i.e. broadcast, groupcast, and unicast. The QoS handling of these different modes are described in clauses 5.4.1.2 to 5.4.1.4.\n-\tThe UE may handle traffic using broadcast, groupcast, and unicast mode communication by taking all their priorities, e.g. indicated by PQIs, into account as described in clause 5.4.3.3.\n-\tFor broadcast and groupcast modes of V2X communication over NR based PC5, standardized PQI values are applied by the UE, as there is no signalling over PC5 reference point for these cases.\n-\tWhen network scheduled operation mode is used, the UE-PC5-AMBR for NR based PC5 applies to all types of communication modes, and is used by NG-RAN for capping the UE's NR based PC5 transmission in the resources management. The UE-PC5-AMBR shall be set to the sum of the aggregate maximum bit rate of all types of communication (i.e. unicast, groupcast and broadcast modes) over PC5 reference point.\nThe following description applies to for both network scheduled operation mode and UE autonomous resources selection mode.\nWhen a service data packet or request from the V2X application layer is received, the UE determines if there is any existing PC5 QoS Flow matching the service data packet or request, i.e. based on the PC5 QoS Rules for the existing PC5 QoS Flow(s).\nIf there is no PC5 QoS Flow matching the service data packet or request, the UE derives PC5 QoS parameters defined in clause 5.4.2 as below:\n-\tIf the application layer provides the V2X Application Requirements for the V2X service type (e.g. priority requirement, reliability requirement, delay requirement, range requirement), the V2X layer determines the PC5 QoS parameters based on the V2X Application Requirements;\n-\tOtherwise, the V2X layer determines the PC5 QoS parameters based on the mapping of the V2X service type to PC5 QoS parameters defined in clause 5.1.2.1.\nNOTE 1:\tDetails of V2X Application Requirements for the V2X service type is up to implementation and out of scope of this specification.\nAfter deriving the PC5 QoS parameters, the UE performs the following:\n-\tIf there is no existing PC5 QoS Flow that fulfils the derived PC5 QoS parameters:\n-\tThe UE creates a new PC5 QoS Flow for the derived PC5 QoS parameters; and\n-\tThe UE then assigns a PFI and derives PC5 QoS Rule for this PC5 QoS Flow.\n-\tOtherwise, the UE updates the PC5 Packet Filter Set in the PC5 QoS Rule for such PC5 QoS Flow.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is expected that the application layer is capable of differentiating traffic from different V2X services that is transported within the same PC5 QoS Flow.\nFor V2X communication over NR PC5 reference point, the PC5 QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the same destination identified by Destination Layer-2 ID. User Plane traffic with the same PFI receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold). The PFI is unique within a same destination.\nFor each communication mode (e.g. broadcast, groupcast, unicast), the UE maintains the PC5 QoS Context and PC5 QoS Rule(s) for each PC5 QoS Flow identified by a PC5 QoS Flow Identifier (PFI) per destination identified by Destination Layer-2 ID.\nThe following information is maintained in the V2X layer of the UE:\n-\tA PC5 QoS Context includes the following information:\n-\tPFI;\n-\tPC5 QoS parameters (i.e. PQI and conditionally other parameters such as MFBR/GFBR, Range, etc.) as defined in clause 5.4.2; and\n-\tthe V2X service type(s).\n-\tOne or more PC5 QoS Rule(s). Each PC5 QoS Rule contains the following information:\n-\tPFI;\n-\ta PC5 Packet Filter Set as defined in clause 5.4.1.1.4; and\n-\ta precedence value. The precedence value determines the order in which the PC5 QoS Rules are evaluated. The PC5 QoS Rule with lower precedence value is evaluated before those with the higher precedence values.\nNOTE:\tHow to set the precedence value is up to UE implementation.\nWhen the UE assigns a new PFI for V2X service type, the UE stores it with the corresponding PC5 QoS Context and PC5 QoS Rule(s) for the destination. When the UE releases the PFI, the UE removes the corresponding PC5 QoS Context and PC5 QoS Rule(s) for the destination. For unicast, the Unicast Link Profile defined in clause 5.2.1.4 contains additional information mapped from PFI for unicast operation.\nThe V2X layer provides information for PC5 QoS operations per destination (e.g. identified by Destination Layer-2 ID) to AS layer for Per-flow QoS model operations as below:\n1)\tTo add a new PC5 QoS Flow or to modify any existing PC5 QoS Flow, the V2X layer provides the following information for the PC5 QoS Flow to AS layer.\n-\tthe PFI;\n-\tthe corresponding PC5 QoS parameters; and\n-\tsource/destination Layer-2 IDs for broadcast and groupcast mode communication, or the PC5 Link Identifier for unicast.\n2)\tTo remove any existing PC5 QoS Flow, the V2X layer provides the following information for the PC5 QoS Flow to AS layer.\n-\tthe PFI; and\n-\tsource/destination Layer-2 IDs for broadcast and groupcast mode communication, or the PC5 Link Identifier for unicast.\nIn addition, the V2X layer also provides the communication mode (e.g. broadcast, groupcast, unicast) and radio frequencies for the PC5 QoS Flow to the AS layer for the PC5 operation. The radio frequencies are determined based on the V2X service type associated with the PC5 QoS Flow based on the configuration as described in clause 5.1.2.1. For broadcast or groupcast, the V2X layer also provides the NR Tx Profiles as specified in clauses 6.3.1 and 6.3.2. The V2X layer ensures that V2X service types associated with different radio frequencies are classified into distinct PC5 QoS Flows.\nFigure 5.4.1.1.3-1 illustrated an example of the classification and marking of user plane traffic using the PC5 QoS Rules, and the mapping of PC5 QoS Flows to radio resources at access stratum layer.\nThe figure depicts a flow diagram illustrating the handling of PC5 QoS flows based on PC5 QoS Rules. It shows the flow of data from the source to the destination, with specific rules for priority and quality of service (QoS) being applied. The diagram highlights the importance of these rules in ensuring that the flow is prioritized and that the quality of service is maintained.\nFigure 5.4.1.1.3-1: Handling of PC5 QoS Flows based on PC5 QoS Rules\nAs illustrated in Figure 5.4.1.1.3-1, for a given pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs, there can be multiple radio bearers, each corresponding to a different PC5 QoS level. The AS layer can determine the mapping of multiple PC5 QoS Flows to the same radio bearer based on the information provided. For broadcast and groupcast mode communication, the L2 link goes to all UEs in proximity identified by the destination Layer-2 ID.\nPC5 Packet Filter Set supports two types of packet filters, i.e. the V2X IP Packet Filter Set and the V2X Packet Filter Set. A PC5 QoS Rule contains either the V2X IP Packet Filter Set or the V2X Packet Filter Set.\nThe V2X IP Packet Filter Set has the same format as the IP Packet Filter Set defined in clause 5.7.6.2 of TS 23.501 [6].\nThe V2X Packet Filter Set shall support Packet Filters based on at least any combination of:\n-\tV2X service type;\n-\tSource/Destination Layer-2 ID;\n-\tApplication Layer ID (e.g. Station ID).\nWhen PC5 broadcast is used for the transmission of V2X service data, the following principles are followed for both network scheduled operation mode and UE autonomous resources selection mode:\n-\tPC5 QoS parameters defined in clause 5.4.2 are applied.\n-\tThe V2X layer determines the PC5 QoS parameters based on the V2X Application Requirements (if available) or the mapping of the V2X service type to PC5 QoS parameters, as defined in clause 5.4.1.1.2.\n-\tThe V2X layer assigns a PC5 QoS Flow Identifier (PFI) and derives the PC5 QoS Rule for the PC5 QoS Flow, and associates the PC5 QoS parameters to the PFI.\n-\tThe V2X layer provides the PFI and the associated PC5 QoS parameters to AS layer for Per-flow QoS model operations.\n-\tThe V2X layer determines the PFI based on the PC5 QoS Rule for the V2X service data from the V2X application layer, and passes the V2X service data along with PFI to the AS layer for transmission.\nWhen the autonomous resources selection mode is used, following additional principle applies:\n-\tThe UE can use the PC5 QoS parameters for PC5 QoS handling.\nWhen the network scheduled operation mode for NR PC5 is used, the following additional principles apply:\n-\tThe UE provides PC5 QoS information (related to PC5 QoS parameters), Destination Layer-2 ID(s) and communication mode to the NG-RAN and NG-RAN may provide AS layer configurations and configure the mapping of PC5 QoS flow to radio bearer as defined in TS 38.331 [15] and TS 36.331 [14].\n-\tThe UE provides PC5 QoS information (related to PC5 QoS parameters) and Destination information (related to Destination Layer-2 ID(s)) to the NG-RAN for resource request as defined in TS 38.331 [15] and TS 36.331 [14].\n-\tThe NG-RAN authorizes the UE-provided PC5 QoS information based on PCF-provisioned PC5 QoS parameters as defined in clause 6.5.7.\n-\tThe NG-RAN uses UE-PC5-AMBR for capping the UE PC5 transmission in the resources management.\nThe QoS handling described in clause 5.4.1.2 is applied.\nThe QoS handling described in clause 5.4.1.2 is applied with the following additions:\n-\tThe PFI and PC5 QoS parameters are negotiated during the Layer-2 link establishment procedure, as described in clause 6.3.3.1, or during the Layer-2 link modification procedure, as described in clause 6.3.3.4.\nWhen the network scheduled operation mode for NR PC5 is used, following additional principle applies:\n-\tNG-RAN uses the PC5 LINK-AMBR for capping the UE PC5 unicast link transmission in the resources management.\n",

Source Layer-2 IDs are always self-assigned by the UE originating the corresponding layer-2 frames.\nThe selection of the source and destination Layer-2 ID(s) by a UE depends on the communication mode of V2X communication over PC5 reference point for this layer-2 link, as described in clauses 5.6.1.2, 5.6.1.3, and 5.6.1.4. The source Layer-2 IDs may differ between different communication modes.\nWhen IP-based V2X communication is supported for broadcast and groupcast modes of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the source IP address is allocated as described in clause 5.2.1.5.\nIf the UE has an active V2X application that requires privacy support in the current Geographical Area, as identified by configuration described in clause 5.1.2.1, in order to ensure that a source UE (e.g. vehicle) cannot be tracked or identified by any other UEs (e.g. vehicles) beyond a certain short time-period required by the application, the source Layer-2 ID shall be changed over time and shall be randomized. For IP-based V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the source IP address shall also be changed over time and shall be randomized. The change of the identifiers of a source UE must be synchronized across layers used for PC5, (e.g. when the Application Layer ID changes, the source Layer-2 ID and the source IP address need to be changed).\nFor broadcast mode of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the UE is configured with the destination Layer-2 ID(s) to be used for V2X services. The destination Layer-2 ID for a V2X communication is selected based on the configuration as described in clause 5.1.2.1.\nThe UE self-selects a source Layer-2 ID. The UE may use different source Layer-2 IDs for different types of PC5 reference points, i.e. LTE based PC5 and NR based PC5.\nFor groupcast mode of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the V2X application layer may provide group identifier information. When the group identifier information is provided by the V2X application layer, the UE converts the provided group identifier into a destination Layer-2 ID. When the group identifier information is not provided by the V2X application layer, the UE determines the destination Layer-2 ID based on configuration of the mapping between V2X service type and Layer-2 ID, as specified in clause 5.1.2.1.\nNOTE:\tThe mechanism for converting the V2X application layer provided group identifier to the destination Layer-2 ID is defined in Stage 3.\nThe UE self-selects a source Layer-2 ID.\nFor unicast mode of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the destination Layer-2 ID used depends on the communication peer. The Layer-2 ID of the communication peer, identified by the Application Layer ID, may be discovered during the establishment of the PC5 unicast link, or known to the UE via prior V2X communications, e.g. existing or prior unicast link to the same Application Layer ID, or obtained from application layer service announcements. The initial signalling for the establishment of the PC5 unicast link may use the known Layer-2 ID of the communication peer, or a default destination Layer-2 ID associated with the V2X service type configured for PC5 unicast link establishment, as specified in clause 5.1.2.1. During the PC5 unicast link establishment procedure, Layer-2 IDs are exchanged, and should be used for future communication between the two UEs, as specified in clause 6.3.3.1.\nThe Application Layer ID is associated with one or more V2X applications within the UE. If UE has more than one Application Layer IDs, each Application Layer ID of the same UE may be seen as different UE's Application Layer ID from the peer UE's perspective.\nThe UE maintains a mapping between the Application Layer IDs and the source Layer-2 IDs used for the PC5 unicast links, as the V2X application layer does not use the Layer-2 IDs. This allows the change of source Layer-2 ID without interrupting the V2X applications.\nWhen Application Layer IDs change, the source Layer-2 ID(s) of the PC5 unicast link(s) shall be changed if the link(s) was used for V2X communication with the changed Application Layer IDs.\nBased on privacy configuration as specified in clause 5.1.2.1, the update of the new identifiers of a source UE to the peer UE for the established unicast link may cause the peer UE to change its Layer-2 ID and optionally IP address/prefix if IP communication is used as defined in clause 6.3.3.2.\nA UE may establish multiple PC5 unicast links with a peer UE and use the same or different source Layer-2 IDs for these PC5 unicast links.\n",

                    "text_content": "For NR based unicast, groupcast and broadcast mode communication over PC5 reference point, PC5 DRX operations are supported to enable pedestrian UE power saving.\nThe V2X layer determines the respective V2X service types, and derives the corresponding PC5 QoS parameters based on either the mapping of V2X service types to PC5 QoS parameters, or the V2X Application Requirements for the V2X service type provided by the application layer. The V2X layer passes the PC5 QoS parameters and destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer as specified in clauses 6.3.1, 6.3.2 and 6.3.3. When the V2X layer derives new PC5 QoS parameters for a destination Layer-2 ID that has been provided to the AS layer, i.e. due to changes of V2X service types or V2X Application Requirements, the V2X layer provides the new PC5 QoS parameters for the destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer.\nNOTE 1:\tFor broadcast and groupcast, the AS layer needs PC5 QoS parameters as well to determine the PC5 DRX parameter values for reception operation over PC5 reference point. Therefore, the V2X layer determines the interested V2X service types and derives the PC5 QoS parameters based on its reception needs besides the transmission needs. How to derive the PC5 QoS parameters based on its reception needs (e.g. without establishing the PC5 QoS Flows) depends on UE implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tMore than one V2X service types can be related to the groupcast. In this case, the V2X application layer needs to provide all the V2X service types for the groupcast to the V2X layer.\nFor broadcast or groupcast, the V2X layer maintains a list of all V2X service types, i.e. activated V2X service types and/or V2X service types that the UE is interested for reception, for a given destination Layer-2 ID and determines the NR Tx Profile available to be mapped for the respective V2X service type based on the configuration described in clause 5.1.2.1. Whenever the list of the V2X service types for a given destination Layer-2 ID changes, the V2X layer updates the AS layer for the NR Tx Profiles information. The V2X layer determines whether and how to provide the NR Tx Profiles for the given destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer as below:\n-\tIf all the V2X service types have mapped NR Tx Profiles, the V2X layer provides all the mapped NR Tx Profiles to the AS layer for the given destination Layer-2 ID, e.g. when providing other information such as the destination Layer-2 ID, PC5 QoS parameters;\n-\tIf any of the V2X service types does not have mapped NR Tx Profile, the V2X layer does not provide any NR Tx Profile to the AS layer for the given destination Layer-2 ID, e.g. when providing other information such as the destination Layer-2 ID, PC5 QoS parameters.\nFor broadcast, the mapping from destination Layer-2 ID to NR Tx Profile is configured in the NG-RAN. The NG-RAN may derive the NR Tx Profile from the destination Layer-2 ID to perform the network scheduled operation mode, alignment of Uu DRX and PC5 DRX, etc.\nSupport for PC5 DRX operations in the AS layer is specified in TS 38.300 [11].\nWhen the PC5 DRX operation is needed, e.g. based on the NR Tx Profile in case of broadcast or groupcast, the AS layer determines the PC5 DRX parameter values for V2X communication over PC5 reference point, taking into account, e.g., PC5 QoS parameters and/or destination Layer-2 ID provided by the V2X layer.\nFor unicast, two UEs may negotiate the PC5 DRX configuration in the AS layer, and the PC5 DRX parameter values can be configured per pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs and per direction in the AS layer. For transmitting and receiving Direct Communication Request messages, a default PC5 DRX configuration is used when the PC5 DRX operation is needed, e.g. based on the NR Tx Profile as specified in clause 5.1.2.1.\nFor broadcast and groupcast when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\", the UE uses the provisioned PC5 DRX configuration for PC5 DRX operation as specified in clause 5.1.2.1.\n",

The PC5 unicast link related information includes Layer-2 ID information (i.e. source Layer-2 ID and destination Layer-2 ID) and the corresponding PC5 QoS parameters. This enables the AS layer to maintain the PC5 Link Identifier together with the PC5 unicast link related information.\n6.\tV2X service data is transmitted over the established unicast link as below:\nThe PC5 Link Identifier, and PFI are provided to the AS layer, together with the V2X service data.\nOptionally in addition, the Layer-2 ID information (i.e. source Layer-2 ID and destination Layer-2 ID) is provided to the AS layer.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to UE implementation to provide the Layer-2 ID information to the AS layer.\nUE-1 sends the V2X service data using the source Layer-2 ID (i.e. UE-1's Layer-2 ID for this unicast link) and the destination Layer-2 ID (i.e. the peer UE's Layer-2 ID for this unicast link).\nNOTE 5:\tPC5 unicast link is bi-directional, therefore the peer UE of UE-1 can send the V2X service data to UE-1 over the unicast link with UE-1.\nFigure 6.3.3.2-1 shows the link identifier update procedure for a unicast link. When privacy requirements is configured for a V2X service type associated with the unicast link, identifiers used for unicast mode of V2X communication over PC5 reference point (e.g. Application Layer ID, Source Layer-2 ID and IP address/prefix) shall be changed over time as specified in clauses 5.6.1.1 and 5.6.1.4. A UE may decide to change the identifiers for other reasons, e.g. application layer requirement. This procedure is used to update and exchange new identifiers between the source and the peer UEs for a unicast link before using the new identifiers, to prevent service interruptions. When there are privacy requirements as indicated above, this procedure is executed over a security protected unicast link.\nIf a UE has multiple unicast links using the same Application Layer IDs or Layer-2 IDs, the UE needs to perform the link identifier update procedure over each of the unicast link.\nThe figure depicts the update procedure for link identifiers in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps involved in updating the link identifier, including the process of updating the link identifier, updating the link identifier, and updating the link identifier.\nFigure 6.3.3.2-1: Link identifier update procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.3.3.1.\n1.\tUE-1 decides to change its identifier(s), e.g. due to the Application Layer ID change or upon expiry of a timer. UE-1 generates its new Layer-2 ID and sends a Link Identifier Update Request message to UE-2 using the old identifiers.\nThe Link Identifier Update Request message includes the new identifier(s) to use (including the new Layer-2 ID, Security Information, optionally the new Application Layer ID and optionally new IP address/prefix if IP communication is used). The new identifier(s) shall be cyphered to protect privacy if security is configured for the unicast link. After sending the Link Identifier Update Request message, if the UE-1 has data to send, UE-1 keeps sending data traffic to UE-2 with the old identifiers until UE-1 sends the Link Identifier Update Ack message to UE-2.\nNOTE 1:\tThe timer is running on per Source Layer-2 ID.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen one of the two UEs acts as IPv6 router as described in clause 5.2.1.5 and IP address/prefix also needs to be changed, corresponding address configuration procedure would be carried out after the Link Identifier update procedure.\n2.\tUpon reception of the Link Identifier Update Request message, UE-2 changes its identifier(s). UE-2 responds with a Link Identifier Update Response message which includes the new identifier(s) to use (including the new Layer-2 ID, Security Information, optionally the new Application Layer ID, and optionally a new IP address/prefix if IP communication is used). The new identifier(s) shall be cyphered to protect privacy if security is configured for the unicast link. The Link Identifier Update Response message is sent using the old identifiers. UE-2 continues to receive traffic with the old Layer-2 ID from UE-1 until UE-2 receives traffic with the new Layer-2 ID from UE-1. After sending the Link Identifier Update Response message, UE-2 keeps sending data traffic to UE-1 with the old identifiers, if UE-2 has data to send, until UE-2 receives the Link Identifier Update Ack message from UE-1.\n3.\tUpon reception of the Link Identifier Update Response message, UE-1 responds with a Link Identifier Update Ack message. The Link Identifier Update Ack message includes the new identifier(s) from UE-2, as received on the Link Identifier Update Response message. The Link Identifier Update Ack message is sent using the old identifiers. UE-1 continues to receive traffic with the old Layer-2 ID from UE-2 until UE-1 receives traffic with the new Layer-2 ID from UE-2.\n4.\tThe V2X layer of UE-1 passes the PC5 Link Identifier for the unicast link and the updated Layer-2 IDs (i.e. new Layer-2 ID for UE-1 for the source and new Layer-2 ID of UE-2 for the destination) down to the AS layer. This enables the AS layer to update the provided Layer-2 IDs for the unicast link.\nUE-1 starts using its new identifiers and UE-2's new identifiers for this unicast link.\n5.\tUpon reception of the Link Identifier Update Ack message, the V2X layer of UE-2 passes the PC5 Link Identifier for the unicast link and the updated Layer-2 IDs (i.e. new Layer-2 ID of UE-2 for the source and new Layer-2 ID for UE-1 for the destination) down to the AS layer. This enables the AS layer to update the provided Layer-2 IDs for the unicast link.\nUE-2 starts using its new identifiers and UE-1's new identifiers for this unicast link.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Security Information in the above messages also needs to be updated at the same time as the Layer-2 IDs. This is defined in TS 33.536 [26].\nFigure 6.3.3.3-1 shows the layer-2 link release procedure over PC5 reference point.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step guide for releasing a Layer-2 link in a network. It illustrates the process of releasing a link from the switch to the network, including the steps of configuring the link, initiating the release, and monitoring the release. The figure is crucial for network administrators to ensure the proper release of Layer-2 links to avoid network downtime and maintain network performance.\nFigure 6.3.3.3-1: Layer-2 link release procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.3.3.1.\n1.\tUE-1 sends a Disconnect Request message to UE-2 in order to release the layer-2 link and deletes all context data associated with the layer-2 link. The Disconnect Request message includes Security Information.\n2.\tUpon reception of the Disconnect Request message UE-2 may respond with a Disconnect Response message and deletes all context data associated with the layer-2 link. The Disconnect Response message includes Security Information.\nThe V2X layer of each UE informs the AS layer that the unicast link has been released. The V2X layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate the released unicast link. This enables the AS layer to delete the context related to the released unicast link.\nNOTE:\tThe Security Information in the above messages is defined in TS 33.536 [26].\nFigure 6.3.3.4-1 shows the layer-2 link modification procedure for a unicast link. This procedure is used to:\n-\tadd new PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link.\n-\tThis covers the case for adding new PC5 QoS Flow(s) to the exisiting V2X service(s) as well as the case for adding new PC5 QoS Flow(s) to new V2X service(s).\n-\tmodify existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link.\n-\tThis covers the case for modifying the PC5 QoS parameters for existing PC5 QoS Flow(s).\n-\tThis also covers the case for removing the associated V2X service(s) from existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) as well as the case for associating new V2X service(s) with existing PC5 QoS Flow(s).\n-\tremove existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step process for modifying a Layer-2 link in a 5G network. It illustrates the various steps involved in modifying the link, such as changing the routing table, modifying the IP address, and updating the MAC address. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the process, making it easy for network engineers to understand and follow.\nFigure 6.3.3.4-1: Layer-2 link modification procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.3.3.1.\n1.\tThe V2X application layer in UE-1 provides application information for PC5 unicast communication.

This enables the AS layer to update the context related to the modified unicast link.\nThe PC5 Signalling Protocol shall support keep-alive functionality that is used to detect if a particular PC5 unicast link is still valid. Either side of the PC5 unicast link can initiate the layer-2 link maintenance procedure (i.e. keep-alive procedure), based on for example triggers from the AS layer or internal timers. The UEs shall minimize the keep-alive signalling, e.g. cancel the procedure if data are successfully received over the PC5 unicast link.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step maintenance procedure for a Layer-2 link in a network. It illustrates the process of checking, repairing, and reconfiguring the link to ensure its optimal performance.

The system is designed to provide real-time feedback to the V2X application server, allowing it to make informed decisions about the allocation of resources and the prioritization of data transmission. This ensures that the V2X applications can operate efficiently and reliably, even in challenging conditions.\nFigure 6.4.1-1: Notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics to the V2X Application Server\n1.\tThe V2X Application Sever derives information on V2X service, location information (an area or path of interest), QoS requirements and reporting threshold(s). The location information can be in the form of geographic coordinates to reflect a list of waypoints.\nNOTE 1:\tStep 1 is outside 3GPP scope. The V2X Application Server can derive this, for example, based on information provided by the UE(s) or the V2X Application Server uses locally configured information.\n2.\tThe V2X Application Server subscribes to or requests notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics provided by NWDAF via NEF by invoking Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe service operation as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [20] or Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch service operation as defined in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.288 [20]. The parameters included in the request are described in clause 5.4.5.2.2.\nThe V2X Application Server may include multiple sets of parameters in order to provide different combinations of \"Location information\" and \"Analytics Target Period\" when requesting notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics.\nNOTE 2:\tThe V2X Application Server needs to set the \"Time when analytics information is needed\" parameter (see TS 23.288 [20]) appropriately, e.g. large enough, to perform the V2X application adjustment before the potential QoS change happens.\nNOTE 3:\tThe request made by the V2X Application Server does not have to be per UE. In order to make a request for multiple UEs, the V2X Application Server can perform mapping between individual UE path requests and subscription to notification per path/road segment. Whether a request is generated for a UE or multiple UEs, and how to set the parameters included in the request and triggers for such request are up to the V2X Application Server implementation and outside of the scope of 3GPP.\n3.\tWhen the NEF receives the request from the V2X Application Server, the NEF interacts with the NWDAF as described in the procedure in clause 6.9.4 of TS 23.288 [20]. The NEF shall map the QoS Characteristics attributes including Resource Type, PDB and PER received from the V2X Application Server to the most appropriate 5QI that is supported by the network if the V2X application server does not provide 5QI. If 5QI is provided by the V2X Application Server, NEF does not perform such mapping. The NEF may map other parameters included in the request from the V2X Application Server to information used by the 3GPP system.\n4.\tIf the NEF receives the response from the NWDAF, the NEF notifies the V2X Application Server with the analytics information on QoS Sustainability Analytics by invoking Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Notify service operation for a Subscribe-Notify model as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [20] or Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch service operation for a Request-Response model as defined in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.288 [20].\n5.\tV2X application adjustment may take place.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 5 is outside 3GPP scope. V2X application adjustment can take place at UE and/or V2X Application Server, e.g. adjust inter-vehicle gap, change video codec parameters, etc. For the case that the V2X Application Server uses the request for multiple UEs in step 2, the V2X Application Server can perform the V2X application adjustment for every UE corresponding to the request.\nFor a Subscribe-Notify model, when the V2X Application Sever wants to cancel subscription to analytics information, it invokes the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Unsubscribe service operation as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [20].\n",
