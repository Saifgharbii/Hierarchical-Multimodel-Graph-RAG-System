The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include:\n-\tthe SCS/AS Identifier;\n-\tthe Monitoring Type;\n-\tthe Notification Destination Address; and\n-\tthe identifier(s) of the targeted UE(s), i.e. one of External Identifier, MSISDN or External Group Identifier. The External Identifier or the MSISDN identifies the subscription of an individual UE and the External Group Identifier points to a group of UEs.\nand may include:\n-\tthe Maximum Number of Reports;\n-\tthe Monitoring Duration indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\";\n-\tthe Group Reporting Guard Time; and\n-\tadditional Monitoring Type(s), if the subscription request targets multiple event(s).\nIf the Subscription_modification feature is supported, the SCS/AS may send an HTTP PUT message in order to update an existing monitoring event subscription. The HTTP PUT request targets the resource \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" replacing all the properties in the existing configuration. The identifier(s) of the targeted UE(s) (i.e. \"msisdn\", \"externalId\" or \"externalGroupId\" attribute), the identifier of the MTC Provider (i.e. \"mtcProviderId\" attribute) and the supported features (i.e. \"supportedFeatures\" attribute) provided during the creation of the monitoring event subscription shall not be updated. Also, both the \"requestTestNotification\"and \"websockNotifConfig\" attributes shall not be updated, if previously provided.\nFor one-time monitoring type of requests, the SCS/AS shall include the Maximum Number of Reports with a value set to 1 and not include the Monitoring Duration in the HTTP request message sent to the SCEF.\nIf the Subscription_Patch feature is supported, the SCS/AS may send an HTTP PATCH request to request the modification of an existing \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource, with the request body including the modification instructions which may include any applicable attributes (e.g. \"notificationDestination\", \"monitorExpireTime\"), except the provided UE Identifier (e.g. \"msisdn\", \"externalId\" or \"externalGroupId\"), \"mtcProviderId\" and \"supportedFeatures\" attributes. Also, both the \"requestTestNotification\" and \"websockNotifConfig\" attributes shall not be modified, if previously provided.\nFor a group of UEs, if the Partial_group_modification feature is supported, the SCS/AS may send an HTTP PATCH request message in order to cancel or add certain UE(s) within an active group. The HTTP PATCH request targets the resource \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" updates with the corresponding \"excludedExternalIds\" and/or \"excludedMsisdns\" attributes in the existing configuration for partial group cancellation, and/or updates with the corresponding \"addedExternalIds\" and/or \"addedMsisdns\" attributes in the existing configuration for partial group addition.\nUpon reception of the HTTP POST, PUT or PATCH request message, if the SCS/AS is authorized to perform such request, the SCEF shall check whether the parameters (e.g. Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time, suggested number of downlink packets in the HTTP POST or PUT request message) in the HTTP request body are within the range defined by operator policies. If one or more of these parameters are not within the range, the SCEF shall either:\n-\treject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a status code set to \"403 Forbidden\" and may include in the response body the \"PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE\" application error within the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails data structure and indicate which parameters are out of the range within the \"invalidParams\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; or\n-\tmodify the parameters which are not within the range by selecting different values which are within the range.\nFor individual UE configuration requests, the SCEF shall also check whether the Idle Status Indication is included for the UE reachability event. If the Idle Status Indication is received in the request but not supported by the network, the SCEF may reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a status code set to \"403 Forbidden\" and may include in the response body the \"IDLE_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED\" error within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.\nIf the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription resource for a monitoring event, but without an indication of the support for the feature corresponding to the requested monitoring event, the SCEF shall reject the request by sending an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" HTTP error response including the \"EVENT_FEATURE_MISMATCH\" application error within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.\nIf the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription resource for a monitoring event that it does not support, the SCEF shall reject the request by sending an HTTP \"500 Internal Server Error\" HTTP error response including the \"EVENT_UNSUPPORTED\" application error within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.\nIf the \"enNB\" feature is supported:\n-\tif the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription resource for a monitoring event and determines that no more subscriptions are allowed for this client, the SCEF shall reject the request by sending an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"RESOURCES_EXCEEDED\" application error within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure; and\n-\tif the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription resource for a monitoring event and determines that a duplicate subscription already exists for this client, the SCEF shall reject the request by sending an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"DUPLICATE_REQUEST\" application error within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.\nAfter validation, the SCEF shall store the parameters and:\n-\tmay assign a SCEF Reference ID related to the created monitoring event subscription resource; and\n-\tbased on operator policies, shall:\n-\tmap the accuracy into permissible granularity for the location reporting event; and\n-\tmap the location area into a list of cells, eNodeB(s) and/or RAI(s)/TAI(s) and derive the corresponding MME(s)/SGSN(s), for number of UEs present in a geographic area event.\nIn order to delete a previously active configured monitoring event subscription at the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE request message to the SCEF targeting the \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource using the corresponding resource URI previously received in the response to the request that has created the monitoring events subscription resource. The SCEF shall then detemine the SCEF Reference ID related to the active monitoring subscription resource, and if the SCS/AS is authorized to perform such request, the SCEF shall delete the targeted resource.\nThe following monitoring events are applicable for the monitoring event configuration via HSS for an individual UE or a group of UEs:\n-\tLoss of connectivity;\n-\tUE reachability;\n-\tLocation Reporting;\n-\tChange of IMSI-IMEI(SV) Association;\n-\tRoaming Status;\n-\tCommunication Failure;\n-\tPDN connectivity status;\n-\tAvailability after DDN Failure; and\n-\tAPI support capability.\nOnly one-time reporting is supported if the \"reachabilityType\" attribute sets to \"SMS\" for the event \"UE reachability\" or if the \"locationType\" attribute sets to \"LAST_KNOWN_LOCATION\" for the event \"Location Reporting\" in the monitoring event request.\nUpon receipt of a configuration request from the SCS/AS for an individual UE, the SCEF shall interact with the HSS via S6t, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11].\nUpon receipt of a successful response from the HSS,\n-\tif it is a one-time monitoring request and the monitoring event report is received, the SCEF shall delete the associated configuration, send an HTTP response message to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code and including the received monitoring event report(s) (more than one report may be provided if the \"enNB\" is supported).\n-\totherwise, the SCEF shall,\n-\tfor an HTTP POST request, create a new \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the URI that contains the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"201 Created\" status code, containing the final suggested configuration parameter(s) (if modified), indication(s) of the discarded parameter(s) (if discarded), the monitoring event report(s) (more than one report may be provided if the \"enNB\" is supported), if received, and a location header field containing the URI of the created resource.\n-\tfor an HTTP PUT request, update the active \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code, containing the final suggested configuration parameter(s) (if modified), indication(s) of the discarded parameter(s) (if discarded) and the monitoring event report(s) (more than one report may be provided if the \"enNB\" is supported), if received, or a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n-\tfor an HTTP DELETE request, delete the active \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code, or a \"200 OK\" status code and including the monitoring event report(s) (more than one report may be provided if the \"enNB\" is supported), if received.\nIf the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF shall not create, update nor delete the concerned resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nUpon receipt of a request from the SCS/AS including an External Group Identifier, then the monitoring configuration is for a group of UEs. The SCEF shall interact with the HSS via S6t as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11].\nUpon receipt of a successful response from the HSS indicating that group processing is in progress and before beginning the processing of individual UEs, the SCEF shall,\n-\tfor an HTTP POST request, create a new \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, store the number of UEs received in the response message from the HSS within the resource and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with \"201 Created\" status code and a location header field containing the URI of the created resource, in order to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful group processing request.\n-\tfor an HTTP PUT request, update the active \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URL and send an HTTP response with \"200 OK\" status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful group processing request, or a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n-\tfor an HTTP DELETE request, delete the active \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with \"204 No Content\" status code.\nIf the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF shall not create, update nor delete the concerned resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nUpon receipt of the processing result of the individual UEs from the HSS, the SCEF shall behave as follows:\n-\tif no Group Reporting Guard Time is received, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS including a reference to the related monitoring subscription, a list of configuration failure result if received for the group members, and the \"monitoringEventReports\" attribute including a list of monitoring event reports if received for the group members;\n-\totherwise, the SCEF shall accumulate all of the configuration results and/or monitoring event reports received from the HSS for the group members until the Group Reporting Guard Time expires. Then the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS including a reference to the related monitoring subscription, and a list of configuration failure result if received for the group members, and the \"monitoringEventReports\" attribute including a list of monitoring event reports received before the Group Reporting Guard Time.\n-\tIf the Partial_group_modification feature is supported,\n-\tupon the cancellation of UE(s) within the active group identified by the \"excludedExternalIds\" and/or \"excludedMsisdns\" attributes is successful, the SCEF shall,\n-\tif the maximum number of reports applies to the monitoring event configuration of the cancelled UE(s), set the stored number of reports of the indicated UE(s) to the maximum number of reports;\n-\tstill consider the rest of UE(s) as applicable within the active group based monitoring subscription to the group based Monitoring Event Report identified by the External Group Identifier;\n-\tdetermine whether the reporting for the group based event subscription is completed or not. If completed, the SCEF shall delete the corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource with procedures as described in clause 4.4.2.3.\n-\tIf the cancellation of UE(s) within the active group is unsuccessful, the SCEF shall respond with proper error code indicating the error and should return the appropriate additional error information in the POST response body.\n-\tupon the addition of UE(s) within the active group identified by the \"addedExternalIds\" and/or \"addedMsisdns\" attributes is successful, the SCEF shall,\n-\tstill consider the existing of UE(s) as applicable within the active group based monitoring subscription to the group based Monitoring Event Report identified by the External Group Identifier;\n-\tsubsequently apply monitoring event subscription to the new group member UEs.\n-\tIf the addition of UE(s) within the active group is unsuccessful, the SCEF shall respond with proper error code indicating the error and should return the appropriate additional error information in the POST response body.\nThe SCS/AS shall send an HTTP response to acknowledge the SCEF about the handling result of the received HTTP POST request.\nThe monitoring event \"Number of UEs in a geographic area\" is applicable for the monitoring event configuration via MME/SGSN. Only one-time reporting is supported for this event with the value of Maximum Number of Reports indicated by \"maximumNumberOfReports\" set to 1.\nUpon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall\n-\tresolve the location area to the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s) by local configuration;\n-\tinteract with the HSS via the S6t interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11] if the External Group ID(s) is included; and\n-\tinteract with the SGSN(s)/MME(s) via the T6a/b inteface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.128 [12].\nNOTE:\tThe SCEF uses local configuration to resolve the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s) if the location area is not received.\nAfter collecting responses from the SGSN(s)/MME(s), if the SCEF does not receive any successful response from the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s), the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6; otherwise the SCEF should send a response with 200 OK status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS with one aggregated report in the requested area by including the total count of the number of UEs in the \"ueCount\" attribute and the External Identifier(s) (if available) or the MSISDN(s) (if available) associated with the External Group ID.\nNOTE:\tIt is possible that the number of UEs does not reflect the actual number of UEs in the designated area (e.g. some SGSN(s)/MME(s) do not respond successfully). The SCEF still provides the result to the SCS/AS if at least one SGSN/MME returns a successful response.\nThe following monitoring events: the location reporting event and communication failure event are applicable for the monitoring event configuration via PCRF for an individual UE.\nNOTE:\tIf monitoring event configuration via PCRF is used for a subscription resource, the Subscription_modification feature cannot be supported.\nOnly the location reporting event is applicabe for the monitoring event configuration via PCRF for a group of UEs.\nOnly one-time reporting is supported for the monitoring event configuration via PCRF.\nHTTP PUT is not supported for the monitoring event configuration via PCRF. If it is received, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT message with 403 Forbidden during monitoring and may indicate the \"OPERATION_PROHIBITED\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.\nUpon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for an individual UE, the SCEF shall:\n-\tinteract with the PCRF via the Rx inteface by using an existing AF session or establishing a new AF session as specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10];\nNOTE 1:\tThe SCEF can derive the service information over the Rx interface based on SCS/AS ID for communication failure event.\n-\tafter receiving the AAA message from the PCRF, create a resource which represents the monitoring event configuration addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier; and\n-\tsend a corresponding status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful processing of the request in the HTTP response message.\nThen the SCEF shall wait for the reporting from the PCRF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].\nNOTE 2:\tDifferent events can be reported in different messages according to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], e.g. STR/RAR for communication failure.\nDuring configuration resource deletion, the SCEF shall also terminate the AF session if it was established and used only for event monitoring.\nUpon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for a group of UEs, the SCEF shall:\n-\tinteract with all PCRFs in the same PLMN via Nta application of Nt interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.154 [9];\n-\tafter collecting ECA message from all PCRFs, create a resource which represents the monitoring event configuration addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier; and\n-\tsend a corresponding status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful processing of the request in the HTTP response message.\nThen the SCEF shall wait for the reporting from the PCRF(s) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.154 [9].\nUpon receipt of a Monitoring Event Report from the HSS or the MME/SGSN as defined in clause 5.6.3 or clause 5.6.8 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [2], from the PCRF as defined in clause 5.6.5 or from the IWK-SCEF as defined in clause 5.6.8 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [2], the SCEF shall determine the monitoring event subscription associated with the corresponding Monitoring Event Report.\nIf the monitoring event subscription refers to a Monitoring Event Configuration for a single UE or to a group-based Monitoring Event configuration, and no Group Reporting Guard Time was set, then the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message including a link to the SCEF-created subscription resource and the received Monitoring Event Report to the identified destination. If the monitoring event subscription refers to a group-based Monitoring Event Configuration and Group Reporting Guard Time was provided during the Monitoring Event configuration procedure, then the SCEF shall accumulate all of the received Monitoring Event reports for the group of UEs until the Group Reporting Guard Time expires or the monitoring duration indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\" is reached.\nUpon expiration of Group Reporting Guard Time or expiration of the monitoring duration, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the identified destination including a link to the SCEF-created subscription resource and the list of accumulated Monitoring Event Reports for each UE identified by either its External Identifier or MSISDN. The destination URL of the HTTP POST message is provided by the SCS/AS during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure.\nIf the monitoring event subscription refers to a one-time monitoring request or a continuous monitoring request, but the maximum number of reports is reached, the SCEF shall consider the reporting as completed, delete the corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource and send an HTTP POST message including the subscription identifier and a cancellation indication to the identified destination. The cancellation indication shall set to \"true\" indicating to cancel the configured monitoring subscription. The destination URL of the HTTP POST is provided by the SCS/AS during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure. In addition, the SCEF shall interact with the HSS to delete the event configuration if the latter was performed via the HSS whereas event reports were performed via the SGSN/MME. The SCEF determines that the reporting for a group is completed by comparing the total number of received reports with the number of UEs of the group (received from the HSS during event configuration for a group of UEs) multiplied by the maximum number of reports.\nIf the Partial_group_modification feature is supported and one or more MSISDN(s) or External Identifier(s) within the active group based monitor subscription have been cancelled or added, the existing UE(s) within the active group based monitoring subscription are still applicable to the group based Monitoring Event Report identified by the External Group Identifier, the added group member(s) shall be subsequently applied with the monitoring event subscription.\nWhen the monitoring duration indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\" is reached, the SCEF shall delete the related event subscription and event configuration locally. The SCS/AS shall no longer address the corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource.\nUpon receipt of an SCEF Reference ID for the event to be deleted from the HSS as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall determine the subscription identifier associated with the indicated active monitoring subscription. Then the SCEF shall delete the related resource \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\", send an HTTP POST message including the subscription identifier and a cancellation indication to the identified destination. The cancellation indication shall set to \"true\" indicating to cancel the configured monitoring subscription. The destination URL of the HTTP POST is provided by the SCS/AS during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure.\nIf the Partial_group_cancellation feature is supported, upon receipt of one or more MSISDN(s) or External Identifier(s) for the group member(s) to be cancelled within the active group based event subscription from the HSS as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall,\n-\tif the maximum number of reports applies to the monitoring event configuration, set the stored number of reports of the indicated UE(s) to the maximum number of reports;\n-\tinclude the MSISDN(s) or External Identifier(s) to be cancelled in the MonitoringNotification Request to the destination URL provided by the SCS/AS during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure; and\n-\tdetermine whether the reporting for the group based event subscription is completed or not. If completed, the SCEF shall delete the corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource with procedures as described in clause 4.4.2.3.\nNOTE:\tThe above procedure can be triggered from the HSS due to parameter overwritten by Network Parameter Configuration.\nFor \"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\" and \"UE_REACHABILITY\" events, if the \"Enhanced_param_config\" feature is supported and the SCEF receives the currently applied parameter configuration from the HSS, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS via an HTTP POST message including the parameter changes in the \"appliedParam\" attribute.\n",

When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location header, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this NIDD configuration.\nIf the SCS/AS includes a downlink non-IP data together with the NIDD configuration creation, the SCEF shall also create the corresponding \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" sub-resource(s) and send each of the sub- resource(s) within the \"self\" attribute in the \"niddDownlinkDataTransfers\" attribute together with the created resource \"Individual NIDD configuration\" which included in the Location header field in the HTTP POST response. When the SCS/AS receives the URI the \"self\" attribute in the \"niddDownlinkDataTransfers\" attribute, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this downlink data delivery transfer.\nAfter sending the HTTP response to NIDD configuration request, the SCEF shall perform the procedure for individual MT NIDD as described in clause 4.4.5.3.1.\nNOTE:\tAny further interaction with the SCS/AS for the piggybacked individual MT NIDD is performed by the notification of NIDD downlink data delivery status.\nFor a NIDD configuration modification, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF for the \"Individual NIDD configuration\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD configuration resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH request from the SCS/AS to update the parameters of the NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to update NIDD configuration. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall verify that the resource to be modified already exists as identified by the URI. If the NIDD configuration resource is found, the SCEF shall update the NIDD configuration as requested. Upon successful update of the requested NIDD configuration including the interaction with the HSS via S6t as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message indicating that the NIDD configuration resource was successfully updated, or with a 204 No Content success message if the NIDD configuration modification is successful updated with no content in the PATCH response message body.\nFor a NIDD configuration cancellation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual NIDD configuration\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD configuration resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to delete NIDD configuration. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall verify that the NIDD configuration resource identified by the URI already exists. If the configuration resource exists, the SCEF shall delete the requested configuration, and perform related NIDD procedure to EPC network elements if applicable. Upon successful deletion of requested NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message indicating that the NIDD configuration was successfully cancelled. As an alternative to the 200 OK success message, the SCEF may send a 204 No Content success message without any message content to the SCS/AS.\nWhen the NIDD Duration expires, the SCEF may remove the associated NIDD configuration resource and all individual downlink data delivery resources under such NIDD configuration.\nThe NIDD configuration procedure for a single UE as described in clause 4.4.5.2.1 shall be applicable for a group of UEs with the following differences:\n-\tThe External Group Identifier shall be included in the POST request instead of MSISDN or External Identifier.\n-\tAfter receiving the response message from the HSS, the SCEF shall store the list of UE identifiers (IMSI and External Identifier or MSISDN) which are associated with the External Group Identifier.\n-\tThe downlink non-IP data is not supported to be handled together with the NIDD configuration.\nIf the SCS/AS needs to perform a downlink non-IP data delivery for a single UE, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for the \"NIDD downlink data deliveries\" resource, identifying an existing NIDD configuration resource as parent resource. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN and non-IP data and may include PDN Connection Establishment Option, Reliable Data Service Configuration, Maximum Latency and Priority. The Reliable Data Service Configuration includes port numbers on UE and SCEF that are used to identify a specific application for data transfer between UE and SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data service acknowledgement is enabled or not.\nUpon receipt of a HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for a downlink data delivery for a single UE, the SCEF shall:\n-\tverify the NIDD configuration resource already exists based on the URI passed, if the configuration resource does not exist, the SCEF shall respond with a 404 Not Found response to reject the downlink data delivery, and\n-\tcheck whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD requests, if not authorized, the SCEF shall respond with a 401 Unauthorized response to reject the downlink data delivery, and\n-\tcheck whether the non-IP packet size is larger than the Maximum Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration. If the packet is oversized, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"DATA_TOO_LARGE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating received non-IP packet size is larger than \"maximumPacketSize\" of the NIDD configuration.\n-\tif the Rds_port_verification feature is supported, check whether the RDS port numbers are within the configured RDS port list. If the RDS port numbers are unknown in the SCEF, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"RDS_PORT_UNKNOWN\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.\nIf all above checks are successful, the SCEF shall determine the EPS Bearer Context based on the APN associated with the NIDD configuration and the User Identity. If the SCEF EPS bearer context is not found in the SCEF, depending on PDN Connection Establishment Option received in the POST request or from NIDD configuration, the SCEF may:\n-\treject the request with an error message to the SCS/AS;\n-\tsend a Device Trigger to the UE as described in clause 4.4.6 without buffering the non-IP data and respond the SCS/AS with a 500 Internal Server Error response and a cause value \"TRIGGERED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; or\n-\tbuffer the non-IP data and create the \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" sub-resource, then send a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS. The response message also includes an indication of whether the Device Trigger procedure (as described in clause 4.4.6) was performed by the SCEF. A Location header shall be included in the response message that provides the URI of the resource identifying this individual downlink data delivery. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this individual downlink data delivery for possible replacement or cancellation. The non-IP data shall be delivered when the non-IP PDN connection is established.\nIf the SCEF EPS bearer context is found in the SCEF, the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS has exceeded the quota or rate of data submission considering the number of existing buffered non-IP data and restriction in APN and serving PLMN rate control. If quota is reached, the SCEF shall respond the SCS/AS with a 403 Forbidden response and a cause value \"QUOTA_EXCEEDED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating the reason for the failure condition. If rate limit is reached, the SCEF shall respond the SCS/AS with a 429 Too Many Requests response.\nIf the check is passed, the SCEF shall continue the downlink non-IP data delivery procedure as the defined 3GPP TS 29.128 [12].\nIf the non-IP data delivery was successful, the SCEF shall send a 200 OK response to the HTTP POST request indicating the downlink non-IP data delivery is successful along with the acknowledge information; otherwise the SCEF may:\n-\tsend a 500 Internal Server Error response and a cause value indicating the reason for the delivery failure within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure, i.e.:\n1.\tif delivery was unsuccessful due to timeout, the cause value \"TIMEOUT\"; or\n2.\tif delivery to the next hop was unsuccessful with the cause value \"NEXT_HOP\"; or\n-\tif the MME/SGSN indicates UE is temporary not reachable, either:\n1.\tbuffer the non-IP data and create the \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" sub-resource, then send a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS. The response may include a Requested Re-Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to be reachable so that the SCEF re-transmits the buffered non-IP data; or\n2.\tsend a 500 Internal Server Error response without buffering the non-IP data, and include a cause value \"TEMPORARILY_NOT_REACHABLE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating the downlink non-IP data delivery is performedbut stopped since UE is temporarily unreachable. The response may include a Requested Re-Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to be reachable so that the SCS/AS may prepare any re-transmission.\nIf the MT_NIDD_modification_cancellation feature is supported and the SCS/AS decides to replace the pending downlink data delivery in the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the individual downlink data delivery resource. The External Identifier or MSISDN shall remain unchanged from previous values. Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether a pending non-IP data exists with the same URI (i.e. resource exists). If it is found, the SCEF shall replace it with the new non-IP data and continue waiting for any message from the MME/SGSN for the UE indicating either the non-IP PDN connection is being established or the UE is reachable (such message may be an MO NIDD); otherwise the SCEF shall respond with a 409 Conflict response with a cause value \"SENDING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating replacement failure. If the buffered data is already delivered, the SCEF shall respond with a 404 Not Found response and include a cause value \"ALREADY_DELIVERED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating replacement failure. If delivery was unsuccessful due to timeout, the SCEF shall respond with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value \"TIMEOUT\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure. If delivery to the next hop was unsuccessful, the SCEF shall respond with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value \"NEXT_HOP\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.\nIf the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.6.4 is supported and the SCS/AS decides to partially modify the pending downlink data delivery in the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF to the URI received in the response to the request that has created the concerned individual downlink data delivery resource. The request body shall contain the NiddDownlinkDataTransferPatch data structure including only the attributes that shall be updated. Upon reception of this HTTP PATCH request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether a pending non-IP data with the received URI exists (i.e. the resource exists). If it is found, the SCEF shall apply the requested modifications and continue waiting for any message from the MME/SGSN for the UE indicating either the non-IP PDN connection is being established or the UE is reachable (such message may be an MO NIDD); otherwise the SCEF shall respond with a \"409 Conflict\" status code including a cause value \"SENDING\" within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure to indicate modification failure. If the buffered data is already delivered, the SCEF shall respond with a \"404 Not Found\" status code including a cause value \"ALREADY_DELIVERED\" within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure to indicate modification failure. If delivery was unsuccessful due to timeout, the SCEF shall respond with a 500 Internal Server Error status code with a cause value \"TIMEOUT\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure. If delivery to the next hop was unsuccessful, the SCEF shall respond with a 500 Internal Server Error status code with a cause value \"NEXT_HOP\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.\nIf the MT_NIDD_modification_cancellation feature is supported and the SCS/AS decides to cancel the pending downlink data delivery in the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the individual downlink data delivery resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether a pending request exists with the same URI. If such non-IP data has not been delivered, the SCEF shall remove the individual downlink data delivery resource and respond with an HTTP 204 No Content response; otherwise the SCEF shall respond with a 404 Not Found response (i.e. data already delivered) with a cause value \"ALREADY_DELIVERED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure or 409 Conflict (i.e. data delivery ongoing) response with a cause value \"SENDING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure, and include a cause value indicating cancellation failure.\nIf a pending non-IP data is delivered by the SCEF (e.g. due to non-IP PDN connection establishment), and the SCEF gets the delivery result from the MME/SGSN, the SCEF shall remove the \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" sub-resource and send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS, identified by the notification destination URI received during the NIDD configuration, to notify the delivery result for the pending non-IP data. Upon receipt of the request, the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the notification with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.\nDuring MT NIDD delivery, if the UE indicates no support for RDS and the SCEF previously indicated RDS is enabled to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall stop sending the non-IP data and send MT NIDD delivery notification with \"FAILURE_RDS_DISABLED\" delivery status.\nIf the SCS/AS needs to perform a downlink non-IP data delivery to a group of UEs and if both the SCS/AS and the SCEF support GroupMesageDelivery feature as defined inclause 5.6.4, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF for the \"NIDD downlink data deliveries\" resource, identifying an existing NIDD configuration resource as parent resource. The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier and the non-IP data, and may include Reliable Data Service Configuration, PDN Connection Establishment Option and Maximum Latency.\nUpon receipt of such an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS requesting the group message delivery, the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD requests, whether the non-IP packet size is larger than the Maximum Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration and if the Rds_port_verification feature is supported whether the RDS port numbers are recognized. If any of those checks fails, the SCEF shall respond with a HTTP response with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition. If all checks are successful, the SCEF shall create an \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" resource and sends a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the HTTP POST request.\nThen for each authorized External Identifier associated to the External Group Identifier which is retrieved from the HSS during preceding NIDD configuration procedure (as specified in clause 4.4.5.2.2), the SCEF shall determine the EPS Bearer Context based on the APN associated with the NIDD configuration and the User Identity and continue the procedure as described for MT NIDD for a single UE in clause 4.4.5.3.1 without sending downlink data delivery status notification for any individual UE to the SCS/AS.\nAt the end of buffering (duration determined by the Maximum Latency or local policy) or after processing data delivery for all UEs in the group, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to SCS/AS to indicate the aggregated result of data delivery of each UE. The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include MSISDN or External Identifier, Retransmission Time (optional) and delivery result for each UE. Upon receipt of the request, the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.\nThe MT_NIDD_modification_cancellation feature is not supported for the group message delivery via NIDD. If a PUT or DELETE request is received for the \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" resource which was created for a group of UEs, the SCEF shall reject the message with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"OPERATION_PROHIBITED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.\nDuring MT NIDD delivery, if the UE indicates no support for RDS and the SCEF previously indicated RDS is enabled to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall stop sending the non-IP data for the indicated UE. In the aggregated MT NIDD delivery notification, the SCEF shall send \"FAILURE_RDS_DISABLED\" delivery status for each failed UE.\nWhen the SCEF receives the non-IP data from MME/SGSN (or IWK-SCEF) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.128 [12], and finds an SCEF EPS bearer context and the associated NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall determine the SCS/AS by the corresponding NIDD configuration, and send an HTTP POST request to the SCS/AS identified by the Notification Destination Address received in the NIDD configuration to notify the uplink non-IP data. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN, non-IP data, NIDD configuration identifier, Reliable Data Service Configuration (if available). The Reliable Data Service Configuration includes port numbers on UE and SCEF that are used to identify a specific application for data transfer between UE and SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data service acknowledgement is enabled or not.\nUpon receipt of the request, if the SCS/AS knows the NIDD configuration identified by the NIDD configuration identifier, the SCS/AS shall acknowledge a 200 OK or 204 No Content message to the SCEF.\nWhen the SCEF receives a NIDD Authorisation Update Request message from HSS to update a user's NIDD authorisation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall determine the SCS/AS with the corresponding NIDD Configuration, and send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS to notify it of the NIDD Authorisation Update. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN, NIDD configuration identifier and the NIDD configuration status.\nUpon receipt of the request, if the SCS/AS knows the corresponding NIDD configuration, then the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.\nIf the NIDD configuration is revoked by the HSS within the received NIDD Authorisation Update Request, the SCEF shall release the corresponding T6a/b PDN connection as specified in 3GPP TS 29.128 [12]. In this case, the SCEF shall reject any subsequent MT NIDD deliveries with a 403 Forbidden response. Or 404 Not Found is returned, if the SCEF locally removed the associated NIDD configuration resource when the configuration was revoked.\nIf the RDS capability is changed, e.g. when the T6a/b PDN connection is established, the UE indicates no support for RDS but the SCEF previously indicated RDS is supported to the SCS/AS in the NIDD configuration procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to notify the SCS/AS that the NIDD status is active and RDS capability indication. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.\nIf the Rds_port_verification feature is supported, before sending the MO NIDD to the SCS/AS as specified in clause 4.4.5.4, the SCEF shall check RDS port numbers (decoded from the uplink non-IP data according to 3GPP TS 24.250 [31]). If the RDS port numbers are not within the configured RDS port list, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with NIDD status set to \"RDS_PORT_UNKNOWN\" and the unknown RDS port numbers. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.\nAs part of the Port Management configuration, operations to reserve a combination of port numbers, release a combination of port numbers, query the list of port numbers that are reserved and notification of reservation of a port number may be performed, if the Rds_dynamic_port feature is supported.\nIndication of the supported serialization formats by the SCS/AS, query of the supported and configured serialization formats by the SCS/AS, and notification of the supported and configured serialization formats by the SCS/AS may be performed if the Rds_serialization_format feature is supported.\nIf the SCS/AS needs to reserve port numbers and associate them with an application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD configuration resource and the specific part of \"/rds-ports/{portId}\" as described in clause 5.6.3.9.2. The SCS/AS may use this operation to reserve port numbers on the UE and SCEF and associate them with an application. The SCS/AS may also use this operation to indicate the serialization formats that are supported by the SCS/AS on the port. Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS,\n-\tif the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\" and if the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource already exists in the same NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"PORT_NOT_FREE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; otherwise, the SCEF shall interact with the UE via the SGSN/MME to reserve the port and optionally configure the serialization format by using RDS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31] and return a 202 Accept response to the SCS/AS if successful response is received from the SGSN/MME. Then if the SCEF receives successful UE response, the SCEF shall create the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource and notify the SCS/AS with the reserved port and configured serialization format as specified in clause 4.4.5.6.2, the SCEF shall also mark the resource is created by the SCS/AS; otherwise, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS about the currently reserved ports as specified in clause 4.4.5.6.2.\n-\tif the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"true\" and if the requested SCEF port already exists in an NIDD configuration within the same APN, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"PORT_NOT_FREE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; otherwise, the SCEF shall create the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource and send an HTTP 201 Created response to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall also mark the resource is created by the SCS/AS and notify the UE by using RDS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31].\nIf the SCEF is not able to configure a serialization format for the port and if the Rds_serialization_format feature is supported, the SCEF shall respond with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value \"SERIALIZATION_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.\nIf the SCS/AS needs to release port numbers associated with an application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the \"individual ManagePort  Configuration\" resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS, if the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource does not exist in the same NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall respond with a 404 Not Found response with a cause value \"PORT_NOT_ASSOC_WITH_APP\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; otherwise if the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource was created by the SCS/AS and\n-\tif the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\", the SCEF shall interact with the UE via the SGSN/MME to release the port by using RDS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31] and return 202 Accept to the SCS/AS if successful response is received from the SGSN/MME. Then upon receipt of the UE response, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with the currently reserved ports as specified in clause 4.4.5.6.2.\n-\tif the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"true\", the SCEF shall delete the individual ManagePort Configuration resource and respond with an HTTP 204 No Content response to the SCS/AS. The SCEF shall also notify the UE by using RDS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31].\nIf the HTTP DELETE request is received for the \"Individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource which was created by the UE, the SCEF shall reject the message with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"OPERATION_PROHIBITED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.\nIf the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\" and the SCEF is not able to interact with the UE because:\n-\tPDN connection is not established, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value \"NO_PDN_CONNECTION\";\n-\tUE is not reachable, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value \"TEMPORARILY_NOT_REACHABLE\". The response may include a Requested Re-Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to be reachable so that the SCS/AS may prepare any re-configuration for the RDS port; or\n-\tthe interaction with the SGSN/MME is not successful, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error and a proper cause value indicating the reason for the delivery failure.\nIf the SCS/AS needs to read the port numbers and serialization formats that are associated with an application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP GET message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD configuration resource and the specific part of \"/rds-ports/{portId}\" as described in clause 5.6.3.9.2.\nIf the SCEF needs to send the information about reserved ports and their configuration to the SCS/AS (e.g. due to 3GPP network created or released \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource upon UE triggered RDS port management procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31]), the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS, using the URI received within the \"notificationDestination\" attribute in the NiddConfiguration resource. The body of the message is encoded in JSON format with the data structure defined in table 5.6.2.1.9-1. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the HTTP POST request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.\n",

The body of the HTTP POST message shall include the External Identifier or MSISDN, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and trigger payload.\nUpon receipt of the corresponding HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to send a trigger request and if the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission. The SCEF shall also resolve the External Identifier or MSISDN to IMSI and retrieve the \"Routing Information\" from HSS for the triggering delivery. If the authorisation check fails, or if the quota or rate of trigger submission was exceeded, or if there is no valid subscription information or if the \"Routing Information\" cannot be found, then the SCEF shall reject the request with an error message to the SCS/AS. Otherwise, the SCEF shall perform the device trigger procedure over Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 [24] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337 [25]. Upon completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall create a resource \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" which represents the triggering transaction, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created transaction identifier, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message, including the trigger and a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this device triggering transaction.\nIn order to replace an existing device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the device triggering transaction resource. The body of the HTTP PUT message shall include the DeviceTriggering data structure containing the requested updates. The properties \"msisdn\" or \"externalId\" shall remain unchanged from the previously provided value.\nIf the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.7.4 is supported, in order to partially modify an existing Individual Device Triggering Transaction resource, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF targeting the concerned \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the concerned Individual Device Triggering Transaction resource. The body of the HTTP PATCH message shall include the DeviceTriggeringPatch data structure containing the requested modifications.\nAfter receiving the corresponding HTTP PUT / HTTP PATCH message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to replace/modify an existing device trigger and if the SCS/AS has not exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission. If any of these checks fail, then the SCEF shall reject the message with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6. Otherwise, the SCEF shall replace the device triggering with the SMS-SC by performing the device trigger replace procedure over Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 [24] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337 [25]. Upon completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\"status code and include the result in the body of the HTTP response or a \"204 No Content\" status code to indicate a successful trigger replacement/modification; otherwise, the SCEF shall send a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nIn order to recall an existing device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the device triggering transaction resource.\nAfter receiving the corresponding HTTP DELETE message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to send a recall trigger request and if the SCS/AS has not exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission. The SCEF shall also check if the device triggering transaction resource referenced by the URI exists. If any of these checks fail, then the SCEF shall reject the message with an error. Otherwise, the SCEF shall recall the device triggering with the SMS-SC by performing the device trigger recall procedure over Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 [24] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337 [25]. Upon completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS to indicate trigger recall success or failure.\nWhen it receives the Message Delivery Report from the SMS/SC, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS to report the trigger delivery result.

                            "text_content": "This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a group of UEs. Two methods of Group Message Delivery via the T8 are specified:\n-\tGroup Message Delivery via MBMS which is intended to efficiently distribute the same content to the members of a group that are located in a particular geographical area when MBMS is used. This method further includes two varieties:\n-\tthe MB2 interface (see stage 2 in 3GPP TS 23.468 [55] and stage 3 in 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]) is used as southbound interface;\n-\tthe xMB interface (see stage 2 in 3GPP TS 26.348 [56] and stage 3 in 3GPP TS 29.116 [37]) is used as southbound interface.\n-\tGroup Message Delivery via unicast MT NIDD for UEs which are part of the same External Group Identifier.\nNOTE:\tGroup Message Delivery via MT NIDD is defined in clause 4.4.5.3.2.\nError handling for the procedures in the subsequent clauses shall be handled based on clause 5.2.6.\nThis procedure is used by an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a group of UEs via the T8 interface. The SCEF use the Group Message Delivery via MBMS to efficiently distribute the same content to the members of a group that are located in a particular geographical area when MBMS is used.\nThe procedure of Group message Delivery via MBMS and MB2 used as southbound interface is described in caluse 4.4.7.2.2 and the procedure of Group message Delivery via MBMS and xMB used as southbound interface is described in caluse 4.4.7.2.3.\nIf the SCS/AS acts as a GCS AS in the application level and if there is no assigned TMGI for an External Group Identifier, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP message to the SCEF to the resource \"TMGI Allocation\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier. The SCS/AS may also include the location information in the body.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to allocate a TMGI, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request TMGI allocation. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI allocation by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]. Upon successful allocation of a TMGI, the SCEF shall create the resource which represents the TMGI allocation, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS identity and TMGI, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message including the TMGI and the TMGI expiration time.\nIn order to renew the TMGI expiration time, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT or PATCH message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\". Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT or PATCH request from the SCS/AS to renew TMGI expiration time, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI expiration time renewal to the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]. Upon successful result, the SCEF shall update the resource and respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with 200 OK including the new TMGI expiration time or 204 No Content if the required TMGI expiration time renewal is successful with no content in the HTTP PUT or PATCH response message body.\nIf the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the allocation of TMGI or renewal of expiration time for the existing TMGI, the SCEF shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nUpon the TMGI expiration, the SCEF may delete the resource of the TMGI locally.\nUpon receipt of the notification of TMGI expiration by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36], the SCEF shall delete the resource if not yet deleted.\nIn order to deallocate the TMGI, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\". Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to deallocate the TMGI, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI deallocation by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]. Upon successful deallocation of a TMGI, the SCEF shall delete the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\" together with all sub-resouces \"GMD via MBMS by MB2\" if available,and shall respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with 204 No Content.\nIf the SCS/AS acts as a GCS AS in the application level and if the SCS/AS has an assigned TMGI for the External Group Identifier, in order to perform the group message delivery, the SCS/AS shall sends an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF to the resource \"GMD via MBMS by MB2\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier and notification destination URI identifying the recipient of notification within the \"notificationDestination\" attribute. The SCS/AS may also include the Group Message Payload, the location information and a Message Delivery Start Time in the body.\nThe SCS/AS may also send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF directly to the resource \"TMGI Allocation\" without previously requesting TMGI allocation as defined in clause 4.4.7.2.2. The SCEF shall create the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\" and perform the procedure as define in clause 4.4.7.2.2, and shall also create resource \"GMD via MBMS by MB2\" and perform the procedure as mentioned in this subcaluse for MBMS bearer creation.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to deliver the group message, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to send a group message request. It also checks to see if the Message Delivery Start Time does not start after the TMGI expiration. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Active MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in clause 5.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS. The SCEF shall include the location information based on the local configuration if the location information is not provided in the HTTP POST request message.\nUpon successful activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall create resource which represents \"Individual GMD via MBMS by MB2\", addressed by a URI that contains Transaction Id allocated by the SCEF and respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with a 201 Created status code, including a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource. When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location header, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this active MBMS bearer. If the Group Message Payload was not include in the HTTP POST above, the HTTP response sent from the SCEF shall also include the SCEF message delivery Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address and port number.\nIf the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not create the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nIf the Group Message Payload was included the HTTP POST above, the SCEF shall deliver to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468 [36] at Message Delivery Start Time.\nIf the Group Message Payload was not include in the HTTP POST above, the SCEF shall transfer the contents received from the SCS/AS to the BM-CS at or after the requested Group Message Start Time, but before the TMGI Expiration time. In this case, when the SCEF detects the group message delivery was triggered successful, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS.\nNOTE:\tIf Group Message Payload was included, then at Message Delivery Start Time, the SCEF delivers to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) to corresponding to MB2-U IP address and port number associated with respective TMGI.\nIf the SCS/AS determines that modification of previous accepted Group Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual GMD via MBMS by MB2\". The body of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include the Message Delivery Start Time. The SCS/AS may also include the External Group Identifier, the Group Message Payload and the location information in the body. The body of the HTTP PUT request message shall include the information as the information provided in the HTTP POST in clause 4.4.7.2.2.2.3. The body of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include the information defined in the data type of GMDViaMBMSByMb2Patch as defined in clause 5.8.2.1.1.6.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS to modify the previous group message delivery subscription, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to modify the submitted group message delivery. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Modify MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in clause 5.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS. The SCEF shall include the location information based on the local configuration if the location information is not provided in the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request message.\nUpon successful modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall update the resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message indicating that previous group message delivery subscription is successfully updated, or 204 No Content if the updates or replacement is successful with no content in the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT response message body.\nIf the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nIf the SCS/AS determines that deletion of previous accepted Group Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE request message to the SCEF.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the previous group message delivery, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to delete an existing group message delivery subscription. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Delete MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in clause 5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS.\nUpon successful deletion of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 204 No Content message indicating that submitted group message delivery is successfully deleted.\nIf the SCS/AS acts as a content provider in the application level and if there is no assigned Service ID for an External Group Identifier, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF to the resource \"xMB Services\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to create a service, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request service creation. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate service creation by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37]. Upon successful service creation, the SCEF shall create the resource which represents the service creation, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS identity and Service Id, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message which may include the service announcement information.\nIf the SCEF receives the response with an error status code from the BM-SC for the service creation, the SCEF shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nIn order to delete the service, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual xMB Service\". Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the service, the SCEF shall initiate service deletion by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37]. Upon successful deletion of a service, the SCEF shall delete the resource \"Individual xMB Service\" together with all sub-resouces \"GMD via MBMS by xMB\" if available, and shall respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with 204 No Content.\nIf the SCS/AS acts as a content provider in the application level, the SCS/AS may sends an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF to the resource \"GMD via MBMS by xMB\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier and notification destination URI identifying the recipient of notification within the \"notificationDestination\" attribute. The SCS/AS may also include the Group Message Payload, the location information, a Message Delivery Start Time and Message Delivery Stop Time in the body.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to deliver the group message, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to send a group message request. It also checks to see if the Message Delivery Start Time doesn't start after the Message Delivery Stop Time. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Create Session procedure as defined in clause 4.4.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37] and the Update Session procedure as defined in clause 4.4.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a Content Provider, Session Start is set accordiong to the Message Delivery Start Time and the Session Stop is set according to the Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCEF shall include the location information based on the local configuration if the location information is not provided and include the session type set to \"Files\" in the HTTP POST request message.\nUpon successful activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall create resource which represents \"Individual GMD via MBMS by xMB \", addressed by a URI that contains Transaction Id allocated by the SCEF and respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with a 201 Created status code, including a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource. When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location header, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this active MBMS bearer. If the Group Message Payload was not included in the HTTP POST above, the HTTP response sent from the SCEF shall also include the SCEF message delivery Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address and port number.\nIf the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not create the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.\nIf the Group Message Payload was included the HTTP POST above, the SCEF shall deliver to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468 [36] at Message Delivery Start Time.\nIf the Group Message Payload was not included in the HTTP POST above, the SCEF shall transfer the contents received from the SCS/AS to the BM-CS at or after the requested Message Delivery Start Time, but before the Message Delivery Stop Time. In this case, when the SCEF detects the group message delivery was triggered successful, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS.\nIf the SCS/AS determines that modification of previous accepted Group Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual GMD via MBMS by xMB \". The body of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include the Message Delivery Start Time and Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCS/AS may also include the External Group Identifier, the Group Message Payload and the location information in the body.

The SCEF uses the reporting procedures based on the network status information from one or more RCAF(s). These procedures can also be used by the SCS/AS to indicate the removal of a previously subscribed reporting request.\nIn order to create a new subscription to request for notifications on network status, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF on the \"Network Status Reporting Subscriptions\" resource. The body of the HTTP POST request shall include a Notification destination address and Location area information, and may include the time duration and threshold(s).\nUpon receiving the HTTP POST request message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check:\n-\tif the SCS/AS is authorized to perform the request. If not, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with an HTTP \"401 Unauthorized\" status code.\n-\tif the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota of submitting requests.

The SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created including Location header field containing the URI for the created transaction resource \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" and the sub-resource(s) \"Individual Application PFD Management\" corresponding to each external application identifier within the \"self\" attribute in the \"PfdData\" data type, the SCEF shall also include PFD report(s) with a list of external Application Identifier(s) and result(s) in the body of the HTTP response if some application(s) are not provisioned successfully (i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the request are already present in existing transactions)).\nIn order to update the PFDs for an existing individual transaction, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to URI of the resource \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" including one or more set of PFDs for external Application Identifier(s). After receiving the HTTP PUT message, the SCEF shall make the change and send the change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code. The SCEF shall create or update the corresponding sub-resource(s) \"Individual Application PFD Management\" each represents a successfully provisioned external application identifier, and also include PFD report(s) with a list of external Application Identifier(s) and result(s) in the body of the HTTP response if some application(s) are not provisioned successfully (i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the request are already present in existing transactions)).\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the PUT for \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" is received in the SCEF, SCEF can use partial update or full update towards the PFDF.\nIf the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.11.4 is supported, in order to partially modify an existing PFD Management Transaction, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH request message to the SCEF on the \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has created the concerned PFD Management Transaction resource. The request body shall contain the PfdManagementPatch data structure including only the attributes that shall be updated. After receiving the HTTP PATCH request, the SCEF shall apply the requested modifications and interact with the concerned PFDF to add/update/remove PFD(s) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response of the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code. The SCEF shall then create or update the corresponding \"Individual Application PFD Management\" sub-resource(s), with each represents a successfully provisioned external application identifier. If some application(s) are not provisioned successfully (i.e. the PFDF returns a failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the request are already present in existing transactions)), the SCEF shall also include PFD report(s) containing a list of external Application Identifier(s) and result(s) in the body of the HTTP response.\nIn order to remove the PFDs for an existing individual transaction, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the URI of the resource \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\". After receiving such request, the SCEF shall delete the \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" resource and its \"Individual Application PFD Management\" sub-resouce(s), and shall interact with the PFDF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.\nFor the POST message to the resource \"PFD Management Transactions\" or the PUT message to the resource \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\", if the provisioning of all application(s) fails (i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning), the SCEF shall respond with 500 Internal Server Error status code, and include the attribute \"pfdReports\" with the corresponding failure reason as specified in table 5.11.2.2.3-1 and the external Application Identifier(s) for which the provisioning has failed.\nIn order to update the PFDs for an existing external Application Identifier, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the resource \"Individual Application PFD Management\" to update the full set of PFDs of an existing resource. After receiving the HTTP PUT message, the SCEF shall make the change and send the change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the PUT for \"Individual Application PFD Management\" is received in the SCEF, SCEF can use partial update or full update towards the PFDF.\nIn order to update the PFDs for an existing external Application Identifier, the SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PATCH message to URI of the resource \"Individual Application PFD Management\" to partially update PFDs. After receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF shall make the change and send the change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.\nIn order to remove the PFDs for an existing individual application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the resource \"Individual Application PFD Management\". After receiving such request, the SCEF shall delete the resource and interact with the PFDF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.\nFor the PUT/PATCH message to the resource \"Individual Application PFD Management\", if the provisioning of the application fails (i.e. the PFDF returns failure or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning), the SCEF shall reject the request with a corresponding status code, and include the attribute \"pfdReports\" with the corresponding failure code as specified in table 5.11.2.2.3-1 and the external Application Identifier for which the provisioning has failed.\nIf the SCEF receives PFD management notification including the PFD failure report from the PFDF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]) and if the feature PfdMgmtNotification is supported, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with an HTTP POST message, identified by the notification destination URI received during the PFD provisioning, to notify the failure result for the PFD management by including the PfdReport data type in the body of the message. Within the PfdReport data type, the SCEF shall include the impacted application id(s) within the \"externalAppIds\" attribute, the \"failureCode\" attribute set to \"PARTIAL_FAILURE\". In addition, if the SCEF receives the location area(s) of PCEF/TDF(s) which are unable to enforce the PFD(s) from the PFDF, the SCEF shall include the location area(s) within the \"locationArea\" attribute of the PFD report(s). After receiving the HTTP POST message, the SCS/AS shall send a HTTP response with \"204 No Content\" status code.\nNOTE 3:\tHow the SCS/AS reacts to the failed PFD provisioning is left to implementation.\nNOTE 4:\tThe SCEF maps the 3GPP network area(s) to the geographic area(s) or civic address(es) if the 3GPP network area(s) is not allowed to be exposed to the 3rd party according to the operator policy.\n",

In addition, data types that are defined in OpenAPI Specification [27] can also be referenced from data structures defined in the subsequent clauses.\nNOTE:\tAs a convention, data types in the present specification are written with an upper-case letter in the beginning. Parameters are written with a lower-case letter in the beginning. As an exception, data types that are also defined in OpenAPI Specification [27] can use a lower-case case letter in the beginning for consistency.\nTable 5.2.1.1-1 lists these common data types.\nTable 5.2.1.1-1: Common Data Types applicable to several T8 APIs\n\nThis type represents a sponsor information. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.1-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2.1-1: Definition of the SponsorInformation data type\n\nThis type represents a usage threshold. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.2-1.\nOnly one of DownlinkVolume, UplinkVolume and TotalVolume shall be provided. If the server supports both duration and volume, then the first threshold that has been reached will apply.\nTable 5.2.1.2.2-1: Definition of the UsageThreshold data type\n\nThis type represents a start time and a stop time of a time window. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.3-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2.3-1: Definition of the TimeWindow data type\n\nThis type represents a successful acknowledgement for a notification.\nTable 5.2.1.2.4-1: Definition of the Acknowledgement data type\n\nThis type represents the parameters which shall be notify the SCS/AS for bearer level event(s).\nTable 5.2.1.2.5-1: Definition of the NotificationData data type\n\nThis type represents an event report. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.6-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2.6-1: Definition of the EventReport data type\n\nThis type represents an accumulated usage. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.7-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2.7-1: Definition of the AccumulatedUsage data type\n\nThis type represents flow information. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.8-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2.8-1: Definition of the FlowInfo data type\n\nNOTE: \tThe \"tosTC\" attribute can be included when another packet filter attribute is needed to differentiate between packet flows. For example, packet flows encapsulated and encrypted by a tunnelling protocol can be differentiated by the ToS/TC value of the outer header if appropriately set by the application. To use ToS/TC for service data flow detection, network configuration by the operator (and additionally by the 3rd party Service Provider when the transport network is not fully within the operator control) needs to ensure there is no ToS/TC re-marking applied along the path from the application to the PSA UPF and the specific ToS/TC values are managed properly to avoid potential collision with other usage (e.g., paging policy differentiation).\nThis type represents a notification that can be sent to test whether a chosen notification mechanism works. It shall be supported if the feature \"Notification_test_event\", as defined for APIs that use notifications, is supported.\nTable 5.2.1.2.9-1: Definition of the TestNotification data type\n\nThis type represents configuration for the delivery of notifications over Websockets. It shall be supported if the feature \"Notification_websocket\", as defined for APIs that use notifications, is supported.\nTable 5.2.1.2.10-1: Definition of the WebsockNotifConfig data type\n\nThis data type represents the user location area which is sent from the SCS/AS to the SCEF.\nTable 5.2.1.2.11-1: Definition of the LocationArea data Type\n\nTable 5.2.1.2.12-1: Definition of the ProblemDetails data type\n\nTable 5.2.1.2.13-1: Definition of the InvalidParam data type\n\nTable 5.2.1.2.14-1: Definition of the PlmnId data type\n\nThis type represents one configuration processing result for the group members.\nTable 5.2.1.2.15-1: Definition of the ConfigResult data type\n\nThis type represents a usage threshold which is defined in clause 5.2.1.2.2 but defined with \"nullable: true\" property so it can be removed in \"JSON Merge Patch\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [39]. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.16-1.\nOnly one of \"downlinkVolume\", \"uplinkVolume\" and \"totalVolume\" shall be provided. Duration and volume are also removable in \"JSON Merge Patch\". If the server supports both duration and volume, then the first threshold that has been reached will apply.\nTable 5.2.1.2.16-1: Definition of the UsageThresholdRm data type\n\nThis data type represents the user location area which is sent from the AF to the NEF.\nTable 5.2.1.2.17-1: Definition of the LocationArea5G data Type\n\nThis type represents Ethernet flow information. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.2.1.2.18-1.\nTable 5.2.1.2.18-1: Definition of the EthFlowInfo data type\n\nThis clause defines simple data types and enumerations that are referenced from data structures.\nThe reused datatypes defined in OpenAPI Specification [27] listed in table 5.2.1.3.2-1 and the simple data types defined in table 5.2.1.3.2-2 apply to several T8 APIs.\nTable 5.2.1.3.2-1: Reused OpenAPI data types\n\nTable 5.2.1.3.2-2: Simple data types applicable to several APIs\n\nThe enumeration Event represents event reported by the SCEF.\nTable 5.2.1.3.3-1: Enumeration Event\n\nThe enumeration ResultReason represents a failure result reason.\nTable 5.2.1.3.4-1: Enumeration ResultReason\n\nThe structured data types shall represent an object (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]). The structured data types shall contain attributes that are simple data types, structured data types, arrays (see below), maps (see below) or enumerations.\nAn array (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) shall represent a list of values without keys and with significance in the order of sequence. All values shall be of the same type.\nA map shall represent an object (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) with a list of key-value pairs (with no significance in the order of sequence), where all keys are of type string and shall be unique identifiers assigned by the application rather than by the schema, and where all values shall be of the same type.\nNOTE 1:\tMaps are supported by the OpenAPI specification [27] as described at https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/dictionaries/. Maps can enable a faster lookup of elements identified by some key in huge data structures compared to arrays that contain the key within the elements. Maps can also be used instead of arrays to modify individual elements when modification instructions of the PATCH method are compliant to IETF RFC 7396 [39].\nEach structured data type shall be specified in a separate clause as illustrated in table 5.2.1.4-1.\nTable 5.2.1.4-1: Definition of type <Data type>\nAttribute name: Name of attributes that belong to the specified data type.\nData type: Data type of the attribute. If the data type is indicated as \"<type>\", the attribute shall be of data type <type>. If the data type is indicated as \"array(<type>)\", the attribute shall be an array (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) that contains elements of data type <type>. If the data type is indicated as \"map (<type>)\", the attribute shall be an object (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) encoding a map (see OpenAPI specification [27]) that contains as values elements of data type <type>. <type> can either be \"integer\", \"number\", \"string\" or \"boolean\" (as defined in the OpenAPI specification [27]), or a data type defined in a 3GPP specification.\nCardinality: Defines the allowed number of occurrence of data type <type>. A cardinality of \"M..N\", is only allowed for data types \"array(<type>)\" and \"map(<type>)\" and indicates the number of elements within the array or map; the values M and N can either be the characters \"M\" and \"N\", respectively, or integer numbers with M being greater than or equal 0, and N being greater than 1 and M, For data type \"<type>\", the cardinality shall be set to \"0..1\" or \"1\". A lower boundary of \"0\" for the cardinality also indicates that the attribute is optional. A lower boundary of \"0\" for the cardinality indicates that the attribute is optional.\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"0..N\" implies the array or map type of the attribute may be optional. If the attribute is present, the minimum number of elements is described in openAPI file.\nDescription: Describes the meaning and use of the attribute and may contain normative statements.\n",

It is recommended to design each resource following one of the archetypes provided in the Annex C of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49].\nAll API URIs of T8 APIs shall be:\n{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>\n\"apiRoot\" is configured by means outside the scope of the present document. \"apiName\" and \"apiVersion\" shall be set dependent on the API, as defined in the corresponding clauses below. All resource URIs in the clauses below are defined relative to the above root API URI.\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"apiVersion\" will only be increased if the new API version contains not backward compatible changes. Otherwise, the supported feature mechanism defined in clause 5.2.7 can instead be used to negotiate extensions.\nNOTE 2:\tA different root structure can be used when the Resource URI is preconfigured in the SCS/AS.\nThe root structure may be followed by \"apiSpecificSuffixes\" that are dependent on the API and are defined separately for each API as resource URI where they apply:\n{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificSuffixes>\nThe naming conventions defined in clause 5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49] shall apply.\nThe URI of a custom operation which is associated with a resource shall have the following structure:\n{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificSuffixes>/<custOpName>\nCustom operations can also be associated with the service instead of a resource. The URI of a custom operation which is not associated with a resource shall have the following structure:\n{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<custOpName>\nIn the above URI structures, \"apiRoot\", \"apiName\", \"apiVersion\" and \"apiSpecificSuffixes\" are as defined in clause 5.2.4.1 and \"custOpName\" represents the name of the custom operation as defined in clause 5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49].\nThe purpose of the callback URI is to enable an HTTP client (the SCS/AS or SCEF) to provide the URI to be used by an HTTP server (the SCEF or SCS/AS) to send notifications or callback requests.\nThe callback URI shall be in the form of an absolute URI as defined in clause 4.3 of IETF RFC 3986 [7], including an authority, and excluding any query component, any fragment component and any userinfo subcomponent.\nTherefore, a callback URI consists of the following components, specified with ABNF syntax (see IETF RFC 5234 [69]):\nURI = scheme \":\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] / path\nWhere 'host' is either an FQDN or an IP address and the 'path' is a path to an HTTP client (the SCS/AS or SCEF) resource.\n",

An SCEF and SCS/AS may support the delivery of Notification using Websocket (IETF RFC 6455 [32]) as described in clause 5.2.5.4.\nIf a delivery of notifications is required for an API, the SCS/AS shall provide a notification destination URI, which designates to the SCEF where the SCEF shall send the HTTP Notifications. This URI is provided within an attribute (e.g. \"notificationDestination\", \"notifUri\", \"notificationUri\") defined in the data types that are passed in a request to create a resource that represents a subscription to notifications, unless it is specified for that API that a preconfigured destination address is used.\nThe SCS/AS may provide the same notification destination URI for several subscriptions, and the SCEF should then use the same HTTP connection to deliver related notifications.\nThe SCEF shall take the role of the HTTP client on the HTTP connection for the delivery of Notifications. Clause 5.2.2 shall also apply for this HTTP connection with the exception that an SCEF (rather than an SCS/AS) desiring to use HTTP/2 shall use the HTTP upgrade mechanism to negotiate applicable HTTP version.\nIf the optional \"Notification_test_event\" feature is supported, the SCS/AS may test whether notifications can be received by subscribing to the notification of a test event by providing a \"requestTestNotification\" attribute set to \"true\" in the HTTP request to create or update a subscription for notifications. In any other HTTP request or response, this attribute shall retain the value that was provided upon subscription resource creation.\nUpon receiving the \"requestTestNotification\" attribute as part of a subscription creation or update request, the SCEF shall send immediately after establishing the notification delivery mechanism a test notification containing a body formatted according to the \"TestNotification\" data type as defined in clause 5.2.1.2.12. If the SCS/AS does not receive the test notification within a configured time, the SCS/AS knows that the notification delivery with the selected method is not possible and may take corrective actions.\nThe procedures in the present clause only apply if SCS/AS and SCEF support the \"Notification_websocket\" feature. If the feature \"Notification_websocket\" is supported, then the feature \"Notification_test_event\" shall also be supported.\nIf a delivery of notifications is required for an API and the SCS/AS does not know from previous interactions with the SCEF whether delivery of notifications over a separate HTTP connection works, the SCS/AS should initially request the SCEF to try to establish a separate HTTP connection for notification delivery according to clause 5.2.5.2 by providing a URI to the SCEF designating where to send HTTP Notifications, and shall also subscribe to the notification of a test event as in clause 5.2.5.3.\nIf the SCS/AS does not receive the requested notification of the test event during a configured period after the subscription, the SCS/AS may configure the subscription to request the SCEF to provide a URI for an HTTP connection to upgrade to Websocket, setting the \"requestWebsocketUri\" attribute to \"true\" as specified in clause 5.2.1.2.13. The SCS/AS may also request the SCEF to provide a URI in a new subscription creation request, and should in this case terminate the original subscription.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the SCS/AS has requested the delivery of notifications to a separate entity, it needs to be informed by that separate entity about the receipt of the test notification. That communication between the separate entity and the SCS/AS is out of scope of the present document.\nWhen the SCEF receives a subscription creation or update request to use Websockets to deliver notifications (i.e. with the \"requestWebsocketUri\" attribute set to \"true\"), it shall assign a Websocket URI where to receive a Websocket connection establishment and provide this URI in the \"websocketUri\" attribute in the response, as defined in clause 5.1.2.1.13. Once such Websocket URI has been assigned for a particular subscription resource, subsequent update requests to this resource that ask for the assignment of a new Websocket URI for that subscription shall be rejected by the SCEF.\nUpon the reception of the Websocket URI from the SCEF in the \"websocketUri\" attribute, as specified in clause 5.2.1.2.13-1, in the subscription creation or subscription update response, the SCS/AS or a separate entity that is intended to receive the notification shall establish an HTTP connection towards that URI and shall upgrade that connection to the Websocket protocol (IETF RFC 6455 [32]) using the HTTP upgrade mechanism defined in IETF RFC 9110 [17].\nNOTE 2:\tFor delivery of Notifications to a separate entity, the SCS/AS needs to provide the Websocket URI to that separate entity. That communication between the SCS/AS and the separate entity is out of scope of the present document.\nThe following framing of the request and response shall be used when delivering a notification or acknowledging its delivery through Websockets.\nNOTE 3: The framing is aligned as much as possible with HTTP delivery in order to simplify implementations.\nTo deliver a notification towards the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall embed the following structure in a separate Websocket data frame with 0x2 (Binary) opcode in the following order:\n1)\tThe string \"3GPP-WS-Notif-Seq:\", followed by a blank, followed by a four-byte sequence number, encoded as decimal number in ASCII, followed by CRLF\n2)\tThe following HTTP headers in any order, with the syntax and semantics as defined in IETF RFC 9110 [17]: Content-Type (mandatory), Content-Encoding (optional), Content-Length (mandatory). Every HTTP header line shall be ended by CRLF.\n3)\tCRLF to end the headers section.\n4)\tThe content of the notification, as defined in the individual APIs.\nNOTE 4:\tThe content is the same as the one that would be used if delivering the notification as defined in clause 5.2.5.3.\nTo acknowledge the reception of a notification message towards the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall embed the following structure in a separate Websocket data frame with 0x2 (Binary) opcode in the following order:\n1)\tThe string \"3GPP-WS-Notif-Seq:\", followed by a blank, followed by the four-byte sequence number of the notification to be confirmed, encoded as decimal number in ASCII, followed by CRLF.\n2)\tThe HTTP status code (e.g. 204) and status message (e.g. No Content) as defined for HTTP delivery of the notification in the individual APIs, separated by a single blank character, and ended by CRLF.\n3)\tConditionally, as defined in IETF RFC 9110 [17], the following HTTP headers in any order: Content-Type, Content-Encoding, and Content-Length. Every HTTP header line shall be ended by CRLF.\n4) CRLF to end the headers section.\n5)\tThe content of the response, if applicable based on the status code and the HTTP headers, as defined in IETF RFC 9110 [17].\nNOTE 5:\tThe status code, the status message and the content (if applicable), are the same as if delivering the notification as defined in clause 5.2.5.3.\nUse of CRLF is defined in IETF RFC 9110 [17].\nThe SCEF need not wait for the confirmation of each notification before delivering the next notification. The SCEF shall determine whether a notification has been delivered successfully by correlating the sent notification with the received acknowledgement by checking the sequence numbers of both for equality. The SCEF may re-send a notification, using the same sequence number, if it has not received an acknowledgement with a matching sequence number after a configurable time-out. The SCS/AS shall consider notifications with the same sequence number that arrive within a configurable time interval as duplicates.\nThe SCS/AS should send periodic Websocket \"PING\" frames to keep the connection alive.\nNOTE 6: the TCP layer will handle a possible fragmentation and reassembly of large messages.\nThe security related clause 6 shall also apply for the HTTP connection that is upgraded to Websocket.\n",

In addition, 3GPP specifications may contain Open API specification file with common data types.\nFor the purpose of referencing (see clause 5.2.9.6), it is assumed that each Open API specification file contained in a 3GPP specification is stored as separate physical, that all Open API specification files are stored in the same directory on the local server, and that the files are named according to the conventions in clause 5.2.9.6.\nThe following guidelines shall be used when documenting OpenAPI files:\n-\tOpenAPI specifications shall be documented using YAML format (see YAML 1.2 [41]). For specific restrictions on the usage of YAML in OpenAPI, see OpenAPI Specification [27].\n-\tThe style used for the specification shall be \"PL\" (Programming Language).\n-\tThe different scopes in the YAML data structures representing collections (objects, arrays…) shall use an indentation of two white spaces.\n-\tComments may be added by following the standard YAML syntax (\"#\").\n-\tTabs shall not be used in OpenAPI specification files (e.g. within description fields).\n-\t\"Unbreakable\" spaces (UTF-8 'NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+00A0)) shall not be used in OpenAPI specification files (e.g. within description fields). Only \"normal\" spaces (UTF-8 'SPACE' (U+0020)) shall be allowed.\n-\tTrailing spaces (i.e. white spaces at the end of a line) should not be used in OpenAPI specification files.\nThe OpenAPI file shall contain a definition in the components/schemas section defining a schema with the name of the structured data type as key.\nThe schema shall contain:\n-\t\"type: object\";\n-\t\"description: <description>\", where <description> is the description of the data type in the table defining the structured data type. The \"description\" attribute should be provided for all data types, specially if they are frequently reused from the same or other OpenAPI specification files; the \"description\" attribute shall always be provided for data types defined as maps, with a clear indication of the values (strings) used as key of the map;\n-\tif any attributes in the structured data type are marked as mandatory via a minimum cardinality greater than \"0\", a \"required\" keyword listing those attributes; and\n-\ta \"properties\" keyword containing for each attribute in the structured data type an entry with the attribute name as key and:\n1.\tif the data type is \"<type>\":\na.\tif the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\", \"integer\", or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as value (\"type: <data type>\"); or\nb.\totherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type <data type> of the attribute, i.e. \"$ref: '#/components/schemas/<data type>'\" if that data type schema is contained in the same OpenAPI file and \"$ref: '<filename>#/components/schemas/<data type>'\" if that data type schema is contained in file <filename> in the same directory on the same server;\n2.\tif the data type is \"array(<type>)\":\na.\ta type definition \"type: array\";\nb.\tan \"items:\" definition containing:\ni).\tif the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\", \"integer\", or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as value (\"type: <data type>\"); or\nii).\totherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type <data type> of the attribute, i.e. \"$ref: '#/components/schemas/<data type>'\" if that data type schema is contained in the same OpenAPI file and \"$ref: '<filename>#/components/schemas/<data type>'\" if that data type schema is contained in file <filename> in the same directory on the same server;\nc.\tif the cardinality contained an integer value <m> as lower boundary, \"minItems: <m>\"; and\nd.\tif the cardinality contained an integer value <n> as upper boundary, \"maxItems: <n>\";\n3.\tif the data type is \"map(<type>)\":\na.\ta type definition \"type: object\";\nb.\tan \"additionalProperties:\" definition containing:\ni).\tif the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\", \"integer\", or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as value (\"type: <data type>\"); or\nii).\totherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type <data type> of the attribute, i.e. \"$ref: '#/components/schemas/<data type>'\" if that data type schema is contained in the same OpenAPI file and \"$ref: '<filename>#/components/schemas/<data type>'\" if that data type schema is contained in file <filename> in the same directory on the same server;\nc.\tif the cardinality contained an integer value <m> as lower boundary, \"min Properties: <m>\"; and\nd.\tif the cardinality contained an integer value <n> as upper boundary, \"max Properties: <n>\"; and\n4.\t\"description: <description>\", where <description> is the description of the attribute in the table defining the structured data type; the \"description\" attribute shall always be provided for attributes defined as maps, with a clear indication of the values (strings) used as key of the map.\nNOTE 1:\tAn omission of the \"minProperties\", and \"maxProperties\" keywords indicates that no lower or upper boundaries respectively, for the number of properties in an object are defined. An omission of the \"minItems\", and \"maxItems\" keywords indicates that no lower or upper boundaries, respectively, for the number of items in an array are defined.\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"0..N\" implies the array or map type of the attribute may be optional. If the attribute is present, the minimum number of elements is described in openAPI file.\nExample:\nTable 5.2.9.3-1: Definition of type ExampleStructuredType\n\nThe data structure in table 5.2.9.3-1 is described in an OpenAPI file as follows:\ncomponents:\nschemas:\nExampleStructuredType:\ntype: object\ndescription: ExampleStructuredType data type description\nrequired:\n- exSimple\n- exMapElements\nproperties:\nexSimple:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/ExSimple'\nexArrayElements:\ntype: array\nitems:\ntype: string\nminItems: 1\nmaxItems: 10\ndescription: exArrayElements attribute description\nexMapElements:\ntype: object\nadditionalProperties:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/ExStructure'\nminProperties: 1\ndescription: exMapElements attribute description, indicating the values of the map key\n\nNOTE 3:\tObject schema definitions should not have property names in the \"required\" attribute for which a corresponding property definition does not exist.\nThe Open API specification file of an API shall contain an \"info\" field with the title and version as defined in clause 4.3 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49].\nAs defined in clause 5.2.4, the base URI of an API consists of {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>. It shall be encoded in the corresponding Open API specification file as \"servers\" field with {apiRoot} as variable.\nExample:\nservers:\n- url: '{apiRoot}/3gpp-yyyy/v1'\nvariables:\napiRoot:\ndefault: https://demohost.com\ndescription: apiRoot as defined in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.122.\nFor the purpose of referencing, it shall be assumed that each Open API specification file contained in a 3GPP specification is stored as separate physical file, that all Open API specification files are stored in the same directory on the local server, and that the files are named according to the following convention: The file name shall consist of (in the order below):\n-\tthe 3GPP specification number in the format \"Tsxxyyy\";\n-\tan \"_\" character;\n-\tif the OpenAPI specification file contains an API definition, the API name as defined for corresponding base URL parts (see clause 4.4) of that API.\n-\tif the OpenAPI specification file contains a definition of CommonData, the string \"CommonData\"; and\n-\tthe string \".yaml\".\nExamples:\nReference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined in the same file\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/Xxx'\nReference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined as Common Data in 3GPP TS 29.122:\n$ref: 'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/schemas/Xxx'\nReference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined within API \"Nxxx_Yyy\" in 3GPP TS ab.cde:\n$ref: 'Tsabcde_Nxxx_Yyy.yaml#/components/schemas/Xxx'\nIf an API contains notifications as described in clause 5.2.5, it should be described as \"callback\" in Open API specification files.\nExample:\npaths:\n/subscriptions:\npost:\nrequestBody:\nrequired: true\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\ntype: object\nproperties:\ncallbackUrl: # Callback URL\ntype: string\nformat: uri\nresponses:\n'201':\ndescription: Success\ncallbacks:\nmyNotification: # arbitrary name\n'{$request.body#/callbackUrl}': # refers The callback URL in the POST\npost:\nrequestBody: # Contents of the callback message\nrequired: true\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/NotificationBody'\nresponses: # Expected responses to the callback message\n'200':\ndescription: xxx\nAs described in clause 5.2.2.2, the bodies of HTTP PATCH requests either use a \"JSON Merge Patch\" encoding as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [39], or a \"JSON Patch\" encoding as defined in IETF RFC 6902 [67].\nIt is possible to allow both encodings in an OpenAPI Specification [27] offering both schemas as alternative contents.\nIn the OpenAPI file, the content field key of the Request Body Object shall contain \"application/merge-patch+json\". The content field value is a Media Type Object identifying the applicable patch body Schema Object. The patch body Schema Object may contain structured data types derived from the data types used in the schema to describe a complete representation of the resource in such a manner that attributes that are allowed to be modified are listed in the \"properties\" validation keyword.\nNOTE 1:\tA derived structured data type is beneficial if the data types used to describe a complete representation of the resource contains mandatory attributes, if attributes are allowed to be removed by the PATCH operation, or if a checking by the OpenAPI tooling that only allowed modifications are done via the \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword is desired. It also provides a clear description in the OpenAPI file to developers which modifications need to be supported.\nAs an alternative, the data types used in the schema to describe a complete representation of the resource may be used if any attributes that are allowed to be removed are marked as \"nullable: true\" in that schema.\nAny attributes that are allowed to be removed shall be marked as \"nullable: true\" in the patch body Schema Object.\nThe \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword may be set.\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword enables the OpenAPI tooling to check that only allowed modifications are done. Extensions of the object in future releases are still possible under the assumption that the supported features mechanism is used to negotiate the usage of any new attribute prior to the PATCH invocation. If new optional attributes are expected to be introduced without corresponding supported feature or if PATCH can be used as first operation in an API, the usage of the \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword is not appropriate.\nIn the OpenAPI file, the content field key of the Request Body Object shall contain \"application/json-patch+json\". The content field value is a Media Type Object identifying the applicable patch body. It may contain a mutually exclusive list (using the \"oneOf\" keyword) of all allowed modifications as <path, op, value> tuples, where \"path\" is a string containing a JSON Pointer value referring to a JSON object that is allowed to be modified, \"op\" is an enumeration of allowed JSON PATCH operations on the JSON object identified by \"path\" and \"value\" representing the schema/type of the value that will be updated or added at the JSON object identified by \"path\". In addition, an open alternative containing an object with no properties may be added using the \"anyOf\" keyword.\nNOTE 1:\tA mutually exclusive list provides a clear description in the OpenAPI specification file to developers which modifications need to be supported. This is of particular interest if only a limited number of modifications need to be supported. If no open alternative is included, the OpenAPI tooling will also check that only allowed modifications are done.\nNOTE 2:\tThe open alternative allows for extensions of the PATCH in scenarios where new optional attributes are expected to be introduced without corresponding supported feature or if PATCH can be used as first operation in an API.\nAs described in clause 5.2.6, T8 APIs use valid HTTP response codes as error codes in HTTP responses and may include a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure specified in clause 5.2.1.2.12 or an application-specific data structure.\nClause 5.2.6 specifies HTTP status code per HTTP method. OpenAPI files should include at least the status codes in that table.\nFor the purpose of referencing, HTTP error responses with \"ProblemDetails\" data structure are specified as part of the CommonData OpenAPI file in Annex A.2.\nExample:\nIn the example below, the 400, and 500 and default error response descriptions are referenced.\n\nPaths:\n/users:\nget:\nresponses:\n'200':\ncontent:\napplication/json\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/ExampleGetBody'\n'400':\n$ref: 'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/responses/400'\n'500':\n$ref: 'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/responses/500'\ndefault:\n$ref: 'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/responses/default'\n\nThe following definitions provided in Annex A.2 are used in that example:\ncomponents:\nresponses:\n'400':\ndescription: Bad request\ncontent:\napplication/problem+json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\n'500':\ndescription: Internal Server Error\ncontent:\napplication/problem+json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails'\ndefault:\ndescription: Generic Error\nFor enumerations, the OpenAPI file shall contain a definition in the components/schemas section defining a schema with the name of the enumeration as key.\nThe naming conventions defined in clause 5.1.4 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49] shall apply.\nThe schema:\n-\tshall contain the \"anyOf\" keyword listing as alternatives:\n1.\tthe \"type: string\" keyword and the \"enum\" keyword with a list of all defined values for the enumeration; and\n2.\tthe \"type: string\" keyword and the \"description\" keyword with a description stating that the string is only provided for extensibility and is not used to encode contents defined in the present version of the specification, and\n-\tshould contain a description field, containing the overall meaning and purpose of the enumeration; additionally, this field may contain a list of the defined values of the enumeration together with explanations of those values.\nNOTE:\tThe \"enum\" keyword restricts the permissible values of the string to the enumerated ones. This can lead to extensibility problems when new values need to be introduced.\nExample:\nExampleEnumeration represents xxx, and it is used to indicate yyy or zzz; it complies with the provisions defined in table 5.2.9.10-1.\nTable 5.2.9.10-1: Enumeration ExampleEnumeration\n\nThe data structure in table 5.2.9.10-1 is described in an OpenAPI file as follows:\ncomponents:\nschemas:\nExampleEnumeration:\nanyOf:\n- type: string\nenum:\n- ONE\n- TWO\n- type: string\ndescription: >\nThis string provides forward-compatibility with future\nextensions to the enumeration and is not used to encode\ncontent defined in the present version of this API.\ndescription: |\nExampleEnumeration represents xxx, and it is used to indicate yyy or zzz;\nit complies with the provisions defined in table 5.2.9.10-1 of 3GPP TS ab.cde.\nPossible values are:\n- ONE: Value ONE description\n- TWO: Value TWO description\nEach OpenAPI specification should include \"readOnly: true\" for those attributes that are only provided by the SCEF in the HTTP response message to prevent the SCS/AS from provisioning those attributes which is not expected, if the write and read operations (e.g. POST request and response) share the same data type which contains those attributes.\nExample:\nNiddStatus:\nanyOf:\n- type: string\nenum:\n- ACTIVE\n- TERMINATED_UE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\n- TERMINATED\n- type: string\ndescription: >\nThis string provides forward-compatibility with future\nextensions to the enumeration but is not used to encode\ncontent defined in the present version of this API.\nDescription: >\nPossible values are\n- ACTIVE: The NIDD configuration is active.\n- TERMINATED_UE_NOT_AUTHORIZED: The NIDD configuration was terminated because the UE´s authorisation was revoked.\n- TERMINATED: The NIDD configuration was terminated.\nreadOnly: true\nEach OpenAPI specification shall provide in an \"externalDoc\" field the reference to the 3GPP TS describing the API, as illustrated below.\nExample:\nexternalDocs\ndescription: 3GPP TS 29.122 V15.1.0 T8 reference point for Northbound APIs\nurl: http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/29_series/29.122/\n\nService operations defined in an OpenAPI specification file should be assigned an Operation ID.\nEXAMPLE:\nget:\noperationId: ReadInfo\nsummary: Read Information.\ntags:\n- Information (Document)\nparameters:\n- name: infoType\nin: path\ndescription: Requested information Type\nrequired: true\nschema:\ntype: string\n(…)\n\nIn an OpenAPI specification, all HTTP operations belonging to the same resource should include a \"tags\" field containing a same value, briefly describing that resource (e.g. using the name of the resource and its archetype). This results in all operations being grouped by the User Interface of OpenAPI tools, which helps with readability of the API documentation.\nEXAMPLE:\nopenapi: 3.0.0\n(...)\npaths:\n/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}:\nget:\nsummary: Retrieve an existing Individual subscription resource.\noperationId: GetIndSubsc\ntags:\n- Individual Subscription (Document)\n\n(...)\n\nput:\nsummary: Request the update of an existing Individual Subscription resource.\noperationId: UpdateIndSubsc\ntags:\n- Individual Subscription (Document)\n\n(...)\n\npatch:\nsummary: Request the modification of an existing Individual Subscription resource.\noperationId: ModifyIndSubsc\ntags:\n- Individual Subscription (Document)\n\n(...)\n\n",

This pattern applies to querying resources of \"collection\" or \"store\" archetype.\nA vendor-specific query parameter shall be encoded as follows:\n-\tThe query parameter name shall start with \"vend-spec\" followed by the actual name of the query parameter, i.e. \"vend-spec-<query parameter name>\".\n-\tThe query parameter value shall be encoded as a JSON object containing two attributes as defined in Table 5.2.13.2-1, wherein:\n-\tthe \"target\" attribute is a JSON pointer (as per RFC 6901 [70]) towards the targeted attribute in the targeted resource representation; and\n-\tthe \"value\" attribute contains the actual value of the query parameter that is to be used for filtering and shall hence be encoded in the same way as the attribute in the resource representation that it targets.\nTable 5.2.13.2-1: Vendor-specific query parameter value content definition\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\tAssuming that vendor-specific query parameters are supported for the MonitoringEvent API, if an authorized service consumer wants to retrieve the representations of the \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resources that contain a specific value (e.g. 6) for the \"maximumNumberOfReports\" attribute, then it can send a GET request using the following vendor-specific query parameter:\nGET {apiRoot}/3gpp-monitoring-event/v1/{scsAsId}/subscriptions?vend-spec-max-reports={\"target\": \"/maximumNumberOfReports\", value: \"6\"}\nEXAMPLE 2:\tAssuming that  vendor-specific query parameters are supported for the MonitoringEvent API, if within the  representations of the “Individual Monitoring Event Subscription” resources, a vendor-specific extension to the data model is provided by an AF via the \"vendorSpecific-010415\" attribute as specified in clause 5.2.13.1 and contains additional/alternative target location accuracy values within the \"addAccuracy\" attribute, and an authorized service consumer wants to retrieve the representations of those \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resources that contain a specific value for the \"addAccuracy\" attribute, then it can send a GET request using the following vendor-specific query parameter:\nGET {apiRoot}/3gpp-monitoring-event/v1/{scsAsId}/subscriptions?vend-spec-accuracy={\"target\": \"/vendorSpecific-010415/addAccuracy\", value: \"CELL_OR_TA\"}\n",

It is the SCEF responsibility to check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to use an API based on the \"token\". Once the SCEF verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether the NEF identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If those checks are passed, the AF has full authority to access any resource or operation for the invoked API.\nNOTE 2:\tThe security requirement in the current clause does not apply for the MsisdnLessMoSms API since it is the SCEF initiated interaction with the SCS/AS. How the security scheme works for the MsisdnLessMoSms API is left to configuration.\nNOTE 3:\tFor aforementioned security methods, the SCEF needs to apply admission control according to access control policies after performing the authorization checks.\n",
