Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and Operating band unwanted emissions. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink operating band plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.\nFor a BS supporting multi-carrier and/or CA, the unwanted emissions requirements apply to channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier larger than or equal to 5 MHz.\nThere is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.\n",

In addition, for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.\nFor BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are not applicable.\nFor a BS supporting E-UTRA with guard band NB-IoT operation, the Operating band unwanted emissions requirements apply to E-UTRA carrier with channel bandwidth larger than or equal to 5 MHz.\nThe unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [5].\nFor a multicarrier E-UTRA BS or BS configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified operating band.\nFor Wide Area BS, the requirements of either subclause 6.6.3.5.1 (Category A limits) or subclause 6.6.3.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.\nFor Local Area BS, the requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2A shall apply (Category A and B).\nFor Home BS, the requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2B shall apply (Category A and B).\nFor Medium Range BS, the requirements in subclause 6.6.3.5.2C shall apply (Category A and B).\nThe application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in subclause 6.6.4.5.\nFor Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options for the limits that may be applied regionally. Either the limits in subclause 6.6.3.5.2.1 or subclause 6.6.3.5.2.2 shall be applied.\nThe requirements of subclauses 6.6.3.5.1 and 6.6.3.5.2 apply to Wide Area BS that supports E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in band and/or guard band). The requirements for Wide Area BS that supports standalone NB-IoT are in subclause 6.6.3.5.2E.\nThe requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2A apply to Local Area BS that supports E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in band and/or guard band). The requirements for Local Area BS that supports standalone NB-IoT are in subclause 6.6.3.5.2F.\nThe requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2B apply to Home BS that supports E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in band and/or guard band). The requirements for Home BS that supports standalone NB-IoT are in subclause 6.6.3.5.2G.\nThe requirements of subclauses 6.6.3.5.2C apply to Medium Range BS that supports E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in band and/or guard band). The requirements for Medium Range BS that supports standalone NB-IoT are in subclause 6.6.3.5.2H.\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.6.3.\nThis test measures the emissions of the BS, close to the assigned channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.\nTest environment: \t\t\tnormal; see Annex D.2.\nRF channels to be tested for single carrier: \tB, M and T; see subclause 4.7.\nBase Station RF Bandwidth position to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA: \tBRFBW, MRFBW and TRFBW in single-band operation, see subclause 4.7.1; BRFBW_T’RFBW and B’RFBW_TRFBW in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.7.1.\n1)\tConnect the signal analyzer to the base station antenna connector as shown in Annex I.1.1.\nAs a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\n2)\tDetection mode: True RMS.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2-1.\n1)\tFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the BS transmission at manufacturer’s declared rated output power. Channel set-up shall be according to E-TM 1.1.\nFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation, set the base station to transmit according to E-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.10 and 4.11.\nFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT in-band operation, start transmission according to [E-TM1.1] with the NB-IoT PRB constructed according to N-TM at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT guard-band operation, start transmission according to E-TM1.1 with the NB-IoT PRB constructed according to N-TM at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a NB-IoT BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start transmission according to N-TM at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a NB-IoT BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier in contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, start transmission according to N-TM on all carriers configured using in the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.10 and 4.11.\nFor a E-UTRA and NB-IoT standalone BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier in contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, start transmission according to E-TM1.1 on all E-UTRA carriers and N-TM on all NB-IoT carriers configured using in the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.10 and 4.11.\n2)\tStep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified measurement bandwidth. For BS operating in multiple bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF Bandwidth or sub block edge.\n3)\tFor E-UTRA, repeat the test with the channel set-up according to E-TM 1.2\nIn addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:\n4)\tFor multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in case of single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.\nThe measurement results in step 2 of 6.6.3.4.2 shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables below, where:\n-\tf is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink operating band.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with Wgap < 20 MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The test requirement for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Tables 6.6.3.5.1-1 to 6.6.3.5.3-3 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in other supported operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest frequency offset (fmax), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted. And, no cumulative limit is applied in the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted.\nIn addition inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, measurement results shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub block is specified in Tables 6.6.3.5.1-1 to 6.6.3.5.3-3 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 44, 71, 72, 73, 85, 87, 88, 106 emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.5.1-1 to 6.6.3.5.1-3.\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-1: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands <1GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-2: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 3 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands <1GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-3: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands <1GHz) for Category A\n\nFor E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 48, 50, 54, 65, 66, 69, 70, 74, 75 emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.5.1-4, 6.6.3.5.1-5 and 6.6.3.5.1-6:\nFor E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 22, 42, 43, 52, emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.5.1-4a, 6.6.3.5.1-5a and 6.6.3.5.1-6a:\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-4: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth (1GHz < E-UTRA bands ≤ 3GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-4a: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands >3GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-5: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 3 MHz channel bandwidth (1GHz < E-UTRA bands ≤ 3GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-5a: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 3 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands >3GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-6: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth (1GHz < E-UTRA bands ≤ 3GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.3.5.1-6a: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands >3GHz) for Category A\n\nFor Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options for the limits that may be applied regionally.

This is measured at the base station antenna connector.\nThe transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, this exclusion applies for each supported operating band.

For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is higher than 12.75 GHz.\nThe requirements shall apply to BS that supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation or NB-IoT standalone operation.\nThe requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier, multi-carrier and/or CA) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.\nUnless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.6.4.\nThis test measures conducted spurious emission from the E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS transmitter antenna connector, while the transmitter is in operation.\nTest environment: \t\t\tnormal; see Annex D.2.\nRF channels to be tested for single carrier: \tB, M and T; see subclause 4.7.\nBase Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA: \tBRFBW, MRFBW and TRFBW in single-band operation, see subclause 4.7.1; BRFBW_T’RFBW and B’RFBW_TRFBW in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.7.1.\n1)\tConnect the BS antenna connector to a measurement receiver according to Annex I.1.1 using an attenuator or a directional coupler if necessary\n2)\tMeasurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the conditions in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.6.4.\n3)\tDetection mode: True RMS.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2-1.\n4)\tConfigure the BS with transmitter(s) active.\n1)\tFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the BS to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1 at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation, set the base station to transmit according to E-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.10 and 4.11.\nFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT in-band operation, start transmission according to [E-TM1.1] with the NB-IoT PRB constructed according to N-TM at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a E-UTRA BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT guard-band operation, start transmission according to E-TM1.1 with the NB-IoT PRB constructed according to N-TM at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a NB-IoT BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start transmission according to N-TM at manufacturer’s declared rated output power.\nFor a NB-IoT BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier in contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, start transmission according to N-TM on all carriers configured using in the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.10 and 4.11.\nFor a E-UTRA and NB-IoT standalone BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier in contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, start transmission according to E-TM1.1 on all E-UTRA carriers and N-TM on all NB-IoT carriers configured using in the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.10 and 4.11.\n2)\tMeasure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the specified value.\nIn addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:\n3)\tFor multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in case of single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.\nThe measurement result in step 2 of 6.6.4.4.2 shall not exceed the maximum level specified in Table 6.6.4.5.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.5.6-1 if applicable for the BS under test.\nNOTE: \tIf a Test Requirement in this clause differs from the corresponding Minimum Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex   G.\nAs mandatory requirement, either subclause 6.6.4.5.1 (Category A limits) or subclause 6.6.4.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.

It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table 6.6.4.5.3-1.\nTable 6.6.4.5.3-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of the BS receiver\n\n6.6.4.5.4.1\tVoid\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS operating band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in Clause 4.3.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nAdditional co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.4-1-1a may apply for some regions.\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-1a: BS Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with systems operating in Band 46\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.4.5.4-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 5:\tFor E-UTRA Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 6: \tFor E-UTRA Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.5.4-1a for a Home BS where requirements for co-existence with a Home BS type listed in the first column apply.\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-1a: Home BS Spurious emissions limits for co-existence with Home BS operating in other frequency bands\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the coexistence requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.4-1a do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the Home BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.4.5.4-1a assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor E-UTRA Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 5: \tFor E-UTRA Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and 10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1).\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-2: E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with PHS\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Bands 13, 14 and 103 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS transmitter operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS transmitter operating band. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-3: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-4: Void\nThe following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band 26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-5: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 41 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-6: Additional E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 41\n\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 30 in certain regions.

The regional requirements may be in the form of conducted power, power spectral density, EIRP and other types of limits. In case of regulatory limits based on EIRP, assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H of TS 36.104 [2].\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 48 and Band 49 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-8: Additional E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 48 and Band 49\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to BS operating in Band 54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.4.5.4-9 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,B54,a, PEM,B54,b, PEM,B54,c, PEM,B54,d, PEM,B54,e and PEM,B54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.4.5.4-9: Declared Band 54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with an E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 for a Wide Area BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.4.5.5-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for Wide Area BS co-located with another BS\n\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.5.5-2 for a Local Area BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.5-2 apply for each supported operating band.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.5-3 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.5.5-3 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.4.5.5-3: BS Spurious emissions limits for Medium range BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 to Table 6.6.4.5.5-3 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [11].\nNOTE 2:\tTables 6.6.4.5.5-1 to 6.6.4.5.5-3 assume that two operating bands, where the corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.3-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\n",

The required throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.\nA test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports it.\nFor a BS supporting FDD multiple channel bandwidths but not supporting FDD UL carrier aggregation, only the tests for the lowest and the highest FDD channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable. For a BS supporting TDD multiple channel bandwidths but not supporting TDD UL carrier aggregation, only the tests for the lowest and the highest TDD channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.For a BS supporting FDD UL carrier aggregation, only the FDD CC combination with largest aggregated bandwidth is used for the test. If there is more than one combination the FDD CC combination with the largest number of component carriers is used for the test. For this CC combination the tests using full PRB allocation FRC are conducted on per CC basis and measured by the required SNR levels corresponding to the bandwidths used on the different CCs.\nFor a BS supporting TDD UL carrier aggregation, only the TDD CC combination with largest aggregated bandwidth is used for the test.

For this CC combination the tests using full PRB allocation FRC are conducted on per CC basis and measured by the required SNR levels corresponding to the bandwidths used on the different CCs.\nFor a BS supporting carrier aggregation the tests with single PRB FRC are conducted on any single component carrier only.\nThe requirements defined based on FRC in Annex A.17 apply to the BS supporting PUSCH with 256QAM.\nThe requirements defined based on FRC in Annex A.18 apply to the BS supporting PUSCH transmission in UpPTS. The requirements defined based on FRC in Annex A.19 apply to the BS supporting both PUSCH transmission in UpPTS and PUSCH with 256QAM.\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.1.1.\nThe test shall verify the receiver’s ability to achieve throughput under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment:\tNormal, see subclause D.2.\nRF channels to be tested:\tM; see subclause 4.7.\n1)\tConnect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.2.\n1)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in Table 8.2.1.4.2-1.\nTable 8.2.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input\n\n2)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameters in Table 8.2.1.4.2-2. For reference channels using 1 resource block the resource block in the middle of the channel bandwidth shall be used. In case the number of resource blocks in the channel bandwidth are even the one in the middle with lower number is to be used for testing.

The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less at PUSCH power settings presented in table 8.2.3.5-1.\nThe probability of detection of ACK on PUSCH is defined as conditional probability of detection of the ACK when the ACK is transmitted on PUSCH allocated RE.\nThe probability of false detection of the ACK on PUSCH is defined as a conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when data only is sent on PUSCH allocated RE, where HARQ-ACK can be allocated (i.e. by puncturing data). Pseudo-random data shall be used as an input for PUSCH coding and modulation purposes.\nThese tests shall be performed on one of RE’s, where HARQ-ACK information was multiplexed on PUSCH.\nIn the test for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH data is punctured by HARQ-ACK information in both slots within a subframe on symbols as specified in 36.212 [13] subclause 5.2.2.8.

The signal is transmitted over a 5G network, with the base station (gNB) and user equipment (UE) being the key components. The figure highlights the importance of PUSCH demodulation in ensuring reliable communication, as it is used to decode the test signal and maintain the integrity of the communication.\nFigure 8.2.3.4.2-1: Test signal pattern for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH demodulation tests\nThe fraction of falsely detected ACKs measured according to subclause 8.2.3.4.2 shall be less than 1% and the fraction of correctly detected ACKs shall be larger than 99% for the SNR listed in table 8.2.3.5-1.\nTable 8.2.3.5-1: Test requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH\n\nNOTE:\tIf the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.

The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.\nPfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only noise.\nPd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 1.04us. For ETU70, and EPA1 a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 2.08us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path (i.e. average of the delay of all paths having the same highest gain = 310ns for ETU) in the power delay profile.\nThe test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1 and the test preambles for high speed mode restriced set type A are listed in A.6-2.

The high speed mode test restricted set type A (Table 8.4.1.5-2) and high speed mode restricted set type B (table 8.4.2.1-5) are applicable to high speed BS supporting high speed mode restricted set A and restricted set type B respectively.

This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed preambles.\nThe figure depicts a PRACH preamble test pattern, which is a key component of a 5G network's radio interface. The pattern is used to test the functionality of the radio interface and ensure that it is functioning correctly. The figure shows the different components of the PRACH preamble, including the start symbol, stop symbol, and the carrier frequency. The presence of the carrier frequency is crucial for the proper functioning of the radio interface in a 5G network.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern\nThe timing offset base value is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs.  The timing offset scheme is presented in Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.\n\nThe figure depicts a timing offset scheme used in 4G and 5G networks, illustrating the timing offset between the transmitter and receiver. The scheme is crucial for ensuring accurate synchronization and reducing latency.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme\nPfa shall not exceed 0.1%.

The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 3.646 us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path in the power delay profile.\nThe performance requirements for TDD are optional and only valid for base stations supporting TDD.\nThe parameters of NPRACH test preambles are listed in Table 8.5.3.1-1.\nTable 8.5.3.1-1 NPRACH Test Parameters\n\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 36104 [2] subclause 8.5.3.1.1 and 8.5.3.2.1.\nThe test shall verify the receiver’s ability to detect NPRACH preamble under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment:\tNormal, see subclause D.2.\nRF channels to be tested:\tM; see subclause 4.7.\n1)\tConnect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.2.\n1)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth.\nTable 8.5.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input\n\n2)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.\n3)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in Annex B.\n4)\tAdjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to Table 8.5.3.5-1.\n5)\tAdjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in Table 8.5.3.5-1 is achieved at the BS input during the NPRACH preambles.\n6) \tThe test signal generator sends a preamble with repetitions and the receiver tries to detect the preamble.

Unite by RMS.\n,\nThe result, , is compared against the limit.\nThe Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.\nThe Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.\nThe test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).\nNote that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened Test Requirements as defined in this Annex.\nFor example, a Test System having 0.9 dB uncertainty for test 6.2 Base Station maximum output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in clause 4.1.2) would subtract 0.2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0.7 dB defined in this Annex. This new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be applied to the Minimum Requirement using the formula defined in Table G.2-1 to give a new range of 2.5 dB of the manufacturer's rated output power.\nUsing this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance of 0 dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test tolerance of -0.2 dB.\nUnless otherwise stated, the Test Tolerances in this annex apply to the Test System for testing BS that supports E-UTRA or  E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation or NB-IoT standalone operation.\n",
