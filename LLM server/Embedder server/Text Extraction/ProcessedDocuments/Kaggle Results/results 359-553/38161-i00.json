The characteristics of the Hand Phantom and Head Phantom are specified in Clause B.2.\nTalk mode is used to simulate user cases where the DUT is placed into a hand phantom, which is holding the DUT against the SAM head phantom, presenting a realistic voice call operation of the DUT. The DUT should be set as primary mechanical mode for talk mode scenario, which is declared by manufacturer if the UE support multiple mechanical modes. Same as Browsing mode, the DUT for talk mode shall also be mounted in a suitable hand phantom:\n-\tWide Grip Hand for UE with Width >72mm and ≤92mm\n-\tPDA Grip Hand for UE with Width ≥56mm and ≤72mm\nNote: the width is the UE width under primary mechanical mode for talk mode scenario.\nIn this section, the procedure provides the guideline on how to place the DUT+hand against the head phantom. The detailed DUT positioning into hand phantom for talk mode is defined in Clause B.3.1.\nFor talk mode, the DUT is attached to the head phantom in “cheek” position. The DUT performance is measured on both left and right side of the head. Three points as shown in Figure B.3.2.1-1 define the reference plane: centre of the right ear piece (RE), centre of the left ear piece (LE) and centre of mouth (M).\nDefinition of the ‘Cheek’ position:\n1.\tAlign the ear piece of the phone (see Figure B.3.2.1-1) at the line RE-LE. Then, position the DUT beside the phantom so that the vertical line (see Figure B.3.2.1-3) is parallel to the reference plane in Figure B.3.2.1-2 and is aligned with the line M-RE on the reference plane (see Figure B.3.2.1-3).\n2.\tPosition the DUT so that the ear piece of the DUT touches the ear piece of the phantom head on the line RE-LE. Tilt the DUT chassis towards the cheek of the phantom having the vertical line aligned with the reference plane until any point on the front side of the DUT is in contact with the cheek or until the contact with the ear is lost.\nNOTE:\tA holder fixture made of e.g. plastic may be used to position the handset against the phantom.\nThe figure B.3.2.1-1 depicts a reference plane on a head phantom, providing a front view of the reference plane. This reference plane is crucial for the analysis of the head phantom, as it allows for the visualization of the head's anatomy and the positioning of the reference points. The figure is essential for understanding the head's anatomy and the positioning of the reference points, which are critical for the analysis of the head phantom.\nFigure B.3.2.1-1: Reference plane on head phantom, front view\nThe figure B.3.2.1-2 depicts a reference plane on a head phantom, providing a side view of the reference plane. This reference plane is crucial for the head phantom, as it allows for the accurate measurement of the head's shape and position. The side view of the reference plane provides a more comprehensive view of the head's anatomy, enabling better understanding of the head's shape and position.\nFigure B.3.2.1-2: Reference plane on head phantom, side view\nThe figure depicts reference lines at a mobile handset, illustrating the various communication paths that can be used to establish a connection. These lines are crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient communication, as they help to avoid interference and ensure a smooth transmission of data.\nFigure B.3.2.1-3: Reference lines at a mobile handset.\nIn addition, 6°tilt angle from the cheek is being used instead of having direct contact between the cheek and DUT. A mask may be used to help configuration of cheek + 6° tilt angle. The mask is a 32 mm wide conformal strip, created by sweeping the surface of the head phantom through a 6º rotation about the ear. Direct DUT contact against the mask thus establishes the required 6º spacing away from the cheek, regardless of DUT form factor. The material for the head phantom mask spacer shall have dielectric constant of less than 1.3 and a loss tangent of less than 0.003. Material additions can be used to help fixing of the mask spacer onto the head phantom.\nIn summary, for head + hand phantom, keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in clause B.3.1, while place the DUT and the hand phantom against the head phantom in such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt angle as described above.\n",
