In most cases, emergency responders use private radio systems to aid in the logistics of providing critically needed restoration services. However, certain government and emergency management officials and other authorised users have to rely on public network services when the communication capability of the serving network may be impaired, for example due to congestion or partial network infrastructure outages, perhaps due to a direct or indirect result of the emergency situation.\nMultimedia Priority Service, supported by the 3GPP system set of services and features, is one element creating the ability to deliver calls or complete sessions of a high priority nature from mobile to mobile networks, mobile to fixed networks, and fixed to mobile networks.\n",

            "description": "MPS is applicable in EPS and 5GS systems.\nMPS provides priority treatment to increase the probability of an authorized Service User’s Voice, Video, and Data communication session being successful. Some form of priority treatment is applied to the MPS invocation and session establishment, and continues to be applied until the MPS session is released. The priority treatment may be applied before the invocation if a greater probability of success in receiving, recognizing, and processing the invocation is needed.\nMPS allows qualified and authorized users to obtain priority access to the next available radio channel on a priority basis before other PLMN users, during situations when PLMN congestion is blocking session establishment attempts. In addition, MPS supports priority sessions on an \"end-to-end\" priority basis.\nMPS is intended to be utilised for Voice, Video, and Data bearer services, including the Data Transport Service, in the Packet-switched (PS) domain and the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). It also involves priority transitioning of MPS service (e.g., Voice) to the CS domain when the network does not support the requested service in the PS domain. MPS Voice, Video and Data sessions are based on providing priority treatment to the corresponding commercial services offered to the public.\nMPS is also intended to be utilized for IoT communications through machine interactions that may not directly involve a human Service User.\nMPS includes network functions that fall into the following broad categories:\nService Invocation: The process to recognize and identify a request for an MPS session. AN MPS Service Provider network recognizes an MPS invocation based on the presence of an MPS-unique identifier entered by the originating Service User in the service request received by the network from the UE, or based on the subscription profile of the originating UE, or as a regional/operator option the subscription profile of the terminating UE.\nNOTE:\tThe option related to “subscription profile of the terminating UE” may not involve end-to-end priority because this option is based on providing priority only in the terminating network based on the terminating UE subscription profile.\nAuthorization: The process to verify that a Service User is authorized for MPS. This includes capabilities to verify authorization to receive priority treatment in the radio access network and to access the MPS application service (MPS Voice, Video, and Data).\nEnd-to-End Priority Treatment: The process of providing priority treatment in all parts of the path, from one endpoint to the other endpoint(s). End-to-end priority treatment includes priority treatment by all MPS capable networks involved in the MPS session path, the origination network and the termination network as well as any transit networks in between.\nInvocation-to-Release Priority Treatment: The process of providing priority treatment to all phases of a session, from invocation until release, including all steps in between.\nThe combination of End-to-End Priority Treatment and Invocation-to-Release Priority Treatment includes both pre- and post-authorization treatment and includes the following aspects:\n1)\tPriority processing of the Service User’s MPS invocation,\n2)\tAdmission control and allocation of network resources (including bearer resources) in origination, termination, and transit networks, including handovers,\n3)\tTransport of signaling and media packets,\n4)\tPriority processing within EPS, 5GS and CN, and\n5)\tProcessing of the Service Users release of an MPS service session.\nNetwork Interconnection and Protocol Interworking: A Service User’s MPS invocation and session establishment will involve transport and processing, and the end-to-end signaling and media path may traverse multiple MPS Service Provider networks. These end-to-end cases include, but are not limited to:\n1)\tVoice, video, and data services over EPS or 5GS, including signaling for call/session establishment and media;\n2)\tEPS/5GS interworking with the CS domain, including a) calls originated in the CS domain and terminated in EPS/5GS, and b) calls from EPS/5GS to the CS domain;\n3)\tCS Fallback from EPS, for one or both ends of call, with maintenance of existing PS domain MPS services, either in EPS or in a legacy system, e.g., the GPRS Core; and\n4)\tAccess to MPS data and video services not under IMS control.\n",
