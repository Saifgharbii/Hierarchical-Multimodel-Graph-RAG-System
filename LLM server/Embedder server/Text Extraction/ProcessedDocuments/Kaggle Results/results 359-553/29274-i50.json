The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the TEID value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID value shall be assigned in a non-predictable manner for PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b interfaces (see 3GPP TS 33.250 [85]). The TEID values are exchanged between tunnel endpoints using GTP-C or S1-MME or Iu-PS messages. The GTPv2 entity communicates to the peer GTPv2 entity the TEID value at which it expects to receive all subsequent control plane messages related to that GTP tunnel via the:\n-\t\"Sender F-TEID for Control Plane\" IE,\n-\t\"PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based Control Plane interface\" IE,\n-\t\"MSC Server Sv TEID for Control Plane\" IE,\n-\t\"S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane\" IE, or\n-\t\"MME/SGSN Sv TEID for Control Plane\" IE.\nThe criteria defining when the same or different GTP tunnels shall be used between the two nodes differs between the control and the user plane, and also between interfaces.\nFor the control plane, for each end-point of a GTP-C tunnel:\n-\tThe TEID-C shall be unique per PDN-Connection on GTP based S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to all bearers associated to the PDN-Connection. A TEID-C on the S2a/S2b/S5/S8 interface shall be released after all its associated EPS bearers are deleted.\n-\tThere shall be only one pair of TEID-Cs per UE on each of the S3, S10, S16 and N26 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S3/S10/S16/N26 interface shall be released after its associated UE context is removed or the UE is detached. For the S3 interface, when ISR is active for the UE, during I-RAT handover between the ISR associated nodes, the existing S3 TEID-C may be re-used or new S3 TEID-C may be allocated. During this scenario, if the node decides to allocate new S3 TEID-C, it shall release its own old S3 TEID-C.\n-\tThere shall be only one pair of TEID-C per UE over the S11 and the S4 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S11/S4 interface shall be released after all its associated EPS bearers are deleted.\n-\tThere shall be only one pair of TEID-C per MBMS Bearer Service (i.e. per TMGI and MBMS Flow Identifier, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is provided; or per TMGI, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is not provided) over the Sm and Sn interfaces respectively. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages related to the same MBMS Bearer Service. A TEID-C on the Sm/Sn interface shall be released after the MBMS Bearer Session is stopped.\nFor GTP-U, a TEID-U is used according to 3GPP TS 29.281 [13].\nNOTE:\tGTP-U is based on GTP version 1 (GTPv1).\n",

The stack includes various layers such as the GTPv2 protocol, the GTPv2 transport layer, and the GTPv2 session layer. The figure illustrates the flow of data between the GTPv2 protocol and the GTPv2 transport layer, as well as the session layer, which is responsible for managing the session between the GTPv2 protocol and the GTPv2 transport layer. The figure also shows the GTPv2 transport layer, which is responsible for transporting the GTPv2 protocol data between the GTPv2 protocol and the GTPv2 transport layer. The figure is important for understanding the architecture of 5G networks and the role of the GTPv2 protocol in their operation.\nFigure 4.2.0-1: GTPv2 stack\nThe GTPv2 headers are specified in the respective clauses of this specification.\nThe source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports used for each GTP-C message depend on the role that the message plays in a message exchange. A message can be an Initial message, or a Triggered message, or a Triggered Reply message to Triggered message. An Initial message is sent to a peer GTP entity with a sequence number chosen by the sending entity (see clause 7.6). A Triggered message is sent in response to an Initial message. Triggered Reply message may be sent in response to a Triggered message. See clause 7.6 for the sequence number usage.\nTypically, a Request message is an Initial message, but a Request message may be a Triggered messages in certain procedures where they are triggered by an Initial Command message. See clause 4.2.5 for classification of the Initial messages and their possible Triggered messages, as well as cases where there are Triggered Reply messages to the Triggered messages.\nPiggybacking is an optional feature, which is described in Annex F of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]. If the feature is supported, then the piggybacking of the initial messages on triggered response messages for EUTRAN Initial Attach, a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN (see clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) and UE-requested PDN Connectivity procedures shall be implemented as per requirements in clauses 4.2.0 and  5.5.1 of this specification  .When piggybacking is used, a common IP header and a common UDP header shall be used for the triggered response message and the piggybacked initial message as depicted in Figure 4.2.0-2. Immediately following the triggered response message is the piggybacked initial message, following which no additional information shall be present. The clause 5.5 specifies the usage of piggybacking-specific fields in the GTP-C header.\n\nFigure 4.2.0-2: Packet Format for the Piggybacking of messages\n",

An IPv4/IPv6 capable SGW and PGW may advertize an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6 address in the F-TEID of the above IEs.\nUpon a change of MME, SGSN or SGW, the new MME, SGSN or SGW may switch to a different IP address type (e.g. IPv6 address) in the IP header if a different IP address type was advertized by the SGW or PGW earlier. A Modify Bearer Request shall only include in the Sender F-TEID the same IP address type as the destination address used in the IP header.\nNOTE 1:\tAdvertizing a single IP address type in a Create Session Request or a Modify Bearer Request ensures that both GTP-C peers know without ambiguity the IP address type to be used in subsequent control plane Initial messages in the reverse direction related to that GTP-C tunnel, and it avoids intempestive IP address switching during the establishment of the GTP-C tunnel or during an established communication between two GTP-C peers.\nNOTE 2:\tIP switching between IPv4 and IPv6 can occur upon a change of MME/SGSN or SGW in deployments with MME/SGSNs or SGWs with different IPv6 capabilities.\nEXAMPLE 1:\tIf an MME gets IPv4 addresses from the DNS for the SGW, the MME only includes an IPv4 address in the Sender F-TEID IE of the Create Session Request. In the response, the SGW advertises an IPv4 address and optionally an IPv6 address, and the SGW uses IPv4 addressing in subsequent control plane Initial messages it sends to the MME related to that GTP-C tunnel.\nEXAMPLE 2:\tAs a continuation of EXAMPLE 1, upon a subsequent change of MMEs, assuming the source MME only supports IPv4 and the target MME supports IPv4 and IPv6, the target MME can switch to IPv6 addressing by sending a Modify Bearer Request to the SGW using the SGW S11 IPv6 address in the IP header and including a Sender F-TEID with an MME S11 IPv6 address only.\nDuring the network triggered service restoration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]), if an MME/S4-SGSN sends a Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication message to the SGW, then the destination address for this message shall be the SGW IP address signalled via the Sender F-TEID for Control Plane IE in the Downlink Data Notification message (if present in the message), otherwise the source IP address of the Downlink Data Notification message received earlier.\nThe IP Source Address of a GTPv2 Initial message shall be an IP address of the source GTPv2 entity from which the Initial message is originating.\nThe IP Destination Address of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered Reply message shall be copied from the IP Source Address of the message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of the SGSN pool scenario.\nThe IP Source Address of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered Reply message shall be copied from the IP destination address of the message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of SGSN pool scenario and handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed.\nIn the SGSN pool scenario, if the Identification Request, the Context Request or the Suspend Notification messages have been forwarded by another SGSN in the pool, the IP Source address for the Identification Response, the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowledge messages shall be locally allocated by the sending GTP entity. The IP Destination Address for the Identification Response, the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowlegde messages shall be determined in the following way.

As a response to the Create Bearer Request message, if the Create Bearer Response has the \"P\" flag set to \"1\", then a single Modify Bearer Request (as part of EUTRAN initial attach, a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN (see clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) or UE-requested PDN connectivity procedure) shall be present as the piggybacked message. A Create Bearer Response with \"P\" flag set to \"1\" shall not be sent unless a Create Session Response with \"P\" flag set to \"1\" has been received for the same procedure. Apart from Create Session Response and Create Bearer Response messages, all the EPC specific messages shall have the \"P\" flag set to \"0\".\n-\tBit 4 represents a \"T\" flag, which indicates if TEID field is present in the GTP-C header or not. If the \"T\" flag is set to 0, then the TEID field shall not be present in the GTP-C header. If the \"T\" flag is set to 1, then the TEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in octets 5 to 8. Apart from the Echo Request, Echo Response and Version Not Supported Indication messages, in all EPC specific messages the value of the \"T\" flag shall be set to \"1\".\n-\tBit 3  represents a \"MP\" flag. If the \"MP\" flag is set to \"1\", then bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall indicate the message priority.\n-\tBit 2 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the receiving entity shall ignore it.\n-\tBit 1 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the receiving entity shall ignore it.\nThe usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified below.\n-\tOctet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the unique value for each type of control plane message. Message type values are specified in Table 6.1-1 \"Message types for GTPv2\".\n-\tOctets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall indicate the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the GTP-C header (the first 4 octets). The TEID (if present) and the Sequence Number shall be included in the length count. The format of the Length field of information elements is specified in clause 8.2 \"Information Element Format\".\n-\tA piggybacked initial message and the preceding triggered response message present in the common IP/UDP packet shall have their own length and sequence number in their respective GTP-C headers. The overall length of the IP/UDP packet shall indicate the total length of the two GTP-C messages.\n-\tFor EPC specific interfaces, T=1, and therefore octets 5 to 8 represent the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) field. This field shall unambiguously identify a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP-C entity. The Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is set by the sending entity in the GTP header of all control plane messages to the TEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity (see clause 4.1). If a peer's TEID is not available the TEID field shall be present in a GTPv2-C header, but its value shall be set to \"0\", as specified in clause 5.5.2 \"Conditions for sending TEID=0 in GTPv2-C header\".\nNOTE:\tThe TEID in the GTP header of a Triggered (or Triggered Reply) message is set to the TEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity regardless of whether the source IP address of the Initial (or Triggered) message and the IP Destination Address provided by the receiving entity for subsequent control plane Initial messages (see clause 4.2.2.1) are the same or not.\n-\tOctets 9 to 11 represent GTP Sequence Number field.\n-\tBits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall indicate the relative priority of the GTP-C message, if the \"MP\" flag is set to 1 in Octet 1. It shall be encoded as the binary value of the Message Priority and it may take any value between 0 and 15, where 0 corresponds to the highest priority and 15 the lowest priority.\n\nIf the \"MP\" flag is set to \"0\" in Octet 1, bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall be set to \"0\" by the sending entity and ignored by the receiving entity.\n-\tBits 4 to 1 of octet 12 are spare bits. The sending entity shall set them to \"0\" and the receiving entity shall ignore them.\n",

A response including a \"Mandatory IE missing\" cause, shall include the type of the missing IE.\n-\tConditional means:\n-\tthat the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are met;\n-\tthe receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the corresponding message type description, based on the parameter combination in the message and/or on the state of the receiving node, to infer if a conditional IE shall be expected. Only if a receiver has sufficient information the following applies. A conditional IE, which is absolutely necessary for the receiving entity to complete the procedure, is missing, then the receiver shall abort the procedure.\n-\tConditional-Optional means:\n-\tthat the IE shall be included by the up-to-date sending entity, if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the protocol and therefore is not up-to-date, obviously cannot send such new IE.\n-\tthe receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message. If the receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE, then the IE's absence shall not trigger any of the error handling procedures. The handling of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be treated as Optional IEs as specified in clause 7.7 \"Error Handling\".\n-\tOptional means:\n-\tthat the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE may be included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an erroneous optional IE is specified in clause 7.7 \"Error Handling\".\nFor conditional IEs, the clause describing the GTP-PDU explicitly defines the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or optional for that particular GTP-PDU. These conditions shall be defined so that the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is critical for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other protocol specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.\nFor grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the rules:\n-\tThe grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the Mandatory grouped IE for the given message.\n-\tThe grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver.\n-\tThe grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver.\n-\tThe grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.\nIn all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in clause 7.7 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.\nOnly the Cause information element at message level shall be included in the response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not accepted regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional information elements defined for a given response message.\nThe following are exceptions:\n-\tOptionally, the Protocol Configuration Options, Recovery, User Location Information (ULI), Load Control Information, Overload Control Information, Bearer Context and Local Distinguished Name (LDN) information elements may be included.\n-\tFor the rejection response of a Forward Relocation Request, the Forward Relocation Response message may also include an F-Cause IE as specified in clause 7.3.2.\n-\tFor the rejection response of a SRVCC PS to CS Request, the SRVCC PS to CS Response message may also include an SRVCC Cause IE as specified in clause 5.2.3 in 3GPP TS 29.280 [15].\n-\tA Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge (with or) without an indication of success may also include a DL low priority traffic Throttling IE and the IMSI IE.\n-\tThe PGW Back-Off Time IE may also be returned when rejecting a Create Session Request with the cause \"APN Congestion\".\n-\tChange Notification Response message may also include the IMSI and MEI information elements.\n-\tFailure Indication type messages do not have \"Accept\" types of Cause values, i.e. all used values indicate the rejection, therefore for Failure Indication type of triggered messages, other information elements, other than the Cause IE, shall also be included according to the conditions of presence specified in the respective message, if they are available.\n-\tThe Context Response message (sent by an SGSN or MME) should also include the IMSI IE if the Cause IE contains the value \"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\", except if the UE is emergency or RLOS attached and the UE is UICCless.\n-\tThe Create Bearer Response message, the Update Bearer Response message and the Delete Bearer Response message shall include the RAN/NAS Cause IE according to the conditions specified in clauses 7.2.4, 7.2.16 and 7.2.10.2.\n-\tThe UE Registration Query Response message shall include IMSI to allow the SGSN to correlate the response message with the corresponding request.\nIf the Cause information element at Grouped IE level contains a value that indicates that the Grouped IE is not handled correctly, e.g. \"Context Not Found\" at Bearer Context IE level, the other information elements in this Grouped IE, other than the Cause IE, may not be included.\n",

Before creating the new session, the SGW should delete:\n-\tthe existing PDN connection context locally, if the Create Session Request is received with the TEID set to zero in the header, or if it is received with a TEID not set to zero in the header and it collides with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;\n-\tthe existing dedicated bearer context locally, if the Create Session Request collides with an existing dedicated bearer context and the message is received with a TEID not set to zero in the header.\nIn the former case, if the PGW S5/S8 IP address for control plane received in the new Create Session Request is different from the PGW S5/S8 IP address for control plane of the existing PDN connection, the SGW should also delete the existing PDN connection in the corresponding PGW by sending a Delete Session Request message.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SGW can send the Create Session Request and Delete Session Request over S5/S8 asynchronously, e.g. the SGW can send the Delete Session Request and then the Create Session Request without having to wait for the Delete Session Response. It does not matter if the PGW happens to receive the Delete Session Request after the Create Session Request since the PGW assigns a different S5/S8 F-TEID for control plane to the new PDN connection.\nIn some network deployment, e.g. when 5G Network Slice is deployed and the combined PGW-C/SMFs are connected to the UDM, the PGW may select another PGW supporting the network slice for which the UE has subscription and then forward the Create Session Request to that PGW. When forwarding the Create Session Request message, the PGW shall forward the Create Session Request message as received from the SGW but with the following modifications:\n-\tthe destination IP address of the message shall be set to the selected PGW IP address;\n-\tthe CSRMFI flag shall be set to \"1\";\n-\tthe source IP address and UDP port of the message shall be set to the IP address and port of the forwarding PGW.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Create Session Response message is sent back to the forwarding PGW that forwards it to the SGW. It is assumed that GTPv2/UDP/IP connectivity between the source PGW/SMF and the target PGW/SMF which are in different slices is allowed in such network deployment; otherwise, if there is no GTPv2/UDP/IP connectivity between the source PGW/SMF and the target PGW/SMF, or if the source PGW/SMF does not support forwarding the request to the target PGW/SMF, the source PGW/SMF can proceed as specified in clause 7.2.2.\nIf the new Create Session Request received by the PGW collides with an existing PDN connection context (the existing PDN connection context is identified with the triplet [IMSI, EPS Bearer ID, Interface type], where applicable Interface type here is S2a TWAN GTP-C interface or S2b ePDG GTP-C interface or S5/S8 SGW GTP-C interface, and where IMSI shall be replaced by TAC and SNR part of ME Identity for emergency or RLOS attached UE without UICC or authenticated IMSI), this Create Session Request shall be treated as a request for a new session. Before creating the new session, the PGW should delete:\n-\tthe existing PDN connection context, if the Create Session Request collides with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;\n-\tthe existing dedicated bearer context, if the Create Session Request collides with a dedicated bearer of an existing PDN connection context.\nThe PGW shall allocate a new PGW S5/S8 F-TEID for control plane to the new PDN connection, i.e. not the same F-TEID value as the one which was assigned to the existing PDN connection.\nNOTE 3:\tWith GTP based S2a and S2b, the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for specific UE over S2a between the TWAN and PGW and over S2b between an ePDG and PGW are independent of the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for the same UE over S5/S8 and may overlap in value (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [45] clause 4.6.2).\nNOTE 4:\tOnly the TAC and SNR part of the ME Identity is used to identify an emergency or RLOS attached UE without UICC or authenticated IMSI.\nTable -1: Information Elements in a Create Session Request\n\nTable -2: Bearer Context to be created within Create Session Request\n\nTable -3: Bearer Context to be removed within Create Session Request\n\nTable -4: Overload Control Information within Create Session Request\n\nTable 7.2.1-5: Remote UE Context Connected within Create Session Request\n\n",

MME detected that the ISR associated S4-SGSN has restarted and UE performs a TAU procedure;\n-\ton the S4 interface by the S4-SGSN to the SGW, if the S4-SGSN detected that the ISR associated MME has restarted and UE performs a RAU procedure.\nThis message can be used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers in the SGW and in the PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [43] clauses 6.2.2.1 and 6.3.2.1, 3GPP TS 23.272 [21] clauses 6.3, 6.5 and 7.4). A Modify Bearer Request used as an implicit resume can contain zero or more IE(s), depending on the conditions of presence of the IEs specified in table 7.2.7-1. The PGW should not consider a Modify Bearer Request with zero IE as an error.\nThe Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases from the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User CSG Information or/and UE Time Zone which occured during a previous RAU procedure without SGSN change but which has not been reported yet to the SGW/PGW, or to indicate to the PGW that the UE is available for signalling if the PDN connection is delay tolerant and if there is pending network initiated PDN connection signalling:\n-\tduring a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U tunnel;\n-\twhen the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC frame serving as a paging response from a UE in GERAN with an existing S4-U tunnel.\nThe Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases from the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of User Location Information which occured during a previous RAU procedure without SGSN change but which has not been reported yet to the SGW/PGW, if the S4-SGSN is configured to defer the reporting of ULI change until a RAB/user plane is established:\n-\tduring a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U tunnel;\n-\twhen the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC frame serving as a paging response for a UE in GERAN with an existing S4-U tunnel.\nNOTE 1:\tthe S4-SGSN can alternatively send a Change Notification Request message in the above cases, if no other information which requires the sending of a Modify Bearer Request, needs to be reported to the PGW.\nThe Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent by the MME to the SGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User Location Information, User CSG Information, UE Time Zone or/and RAT Type, when user data is transported in NAS signalling, for a UE with an existing S11-U tunnel.\nWhen requesting the PGW to pause or unpause charging for a PDN connection, the SGW shall wait for the PGW acknowledgement (i.e. Modify Bearer Response) before sending a new pause or unpause request.\nNOTE 2:\tthis ensures that the PGW always act per the most recent SGW request in particular in scenarios where the SGW would need to request the PGW to pause and unpause charging in a row (or vice-versa) and the Modify Bearer Request messages would arrive out of order at the PGW.\nUpon receipt of a request from the PGW/PCRF/OCS in a message other than Create Bearer Request and Update Bearer Request to report changes of UE presence in new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s), the MME/S4-SGSN shall immediately send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change Notification Request message to report to the PGW whether the UE is inside or outside the new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s) or whether the Presence Reporting Area(s) is inactive.\nThe MME/S4-SGSN shall also send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change Notification Request message to report any subsequent change of UE presence in the Presence Reporting Area, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].\nIf the Modify Bearer Request message is sent from the old MME/SGSN as part of Tracking/Routeing Area Update procedure with SGW change and data forwarding as specified in clause 5.3.3.1A of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], the old MME/SGSN shall only include the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE.\nNOTE 3:\tSince the UE has left the old MME/SGSN, some information related to the UE, e.g. ULI, UE Time Zone, CSG, RAT Type in the old MME/SGSN are not valid any more.\nUpon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Presence Reporting Area Information from the MME/S4-SGSN, the SGW shall send a Modify Bearer Request message on the S5/S8 interface if any of the following condition is met:\n-\tISR is not active;\n-\tISR is active, and the RAT Type has changed since last reported or the CPRAI flag has been set to 1.\nThe MME shall increment the \"MO Exception data counter\" by one each time the MME has received the RRC cause \"MO Exception data\". The MME may defer sending a Modify Bearer Request message to report a non-zero value for the MO Exception Data Counter based on local configuration.\nUpon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Secondary RAT Usage Data Report from the MME, the SGW shall send a Modify Bearer Request message on the S5/S8 interface if the IRPGW flag is set to 1 in the Secondary RAT Usage Data Report IE.\nTable -1: Information Elements in a Modify Bearer Request\n\nTable -2: Bearer Context to be modified within Modify Bearer Request\n\nTable -3: Bearer Context to be removed within Modify Bearer Request\n\nTable 7.2.7-4: Overload Control Information within Modify Bearer Request\n\n",

A source AMF knows whether the target MME pool supports SGi Non-IP or Ethernet PDN connections either by using DNS procedures enhanced for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in clause 5.9 and 5.13 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32]. The target MME/SGSN may forward the Forward Relocation Request to another MME/SGSN in the target MME/SGSN pool which is more suitable to serve the UE, based on the information received in the Forward Relocation Request message, e.g. required CIoT EPS optimisation(s) applicable to the given UE's attachment.\nNOTE 1:\tThe source MME/SGSN/AMF does not need to know each individual CIoT feature the target MME/SGSN pool or target AMF (5GS) supports. The source MME/SGSN/AMF can behave as if the target MME/SGSN/AMF pool supports all CIoT features when the target MME/SGSN pool is known to support CIoT; the source MME/SGSN/AMF determines then which bearer contexts were successfully transferred as specified in sunclause 7.3.2.\nNOTE 2:\tAmong the CIoT optimization features, only the support of SCEF Non-IP PDN connection and the support of SGi Non-IP PDN connection are applicable to a SGSN.\nNOTE 3:\t5GS supports Attach without PDU session. 5GS can also support Unstructured and Ethernet PDU session types, which are assimilated to \"SGi Non-IP PDN connections\" over N26.\nForward Relocation procedure across S10 interface (when KASME is taken into use) shall be performed according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of Security Procedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].\nWhen the source MME/SGSN supports one or more of the CIoT optimization features as specified in clause 8.125, the source MME/SGSN shall transfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN connections or for PDN connections to a SCEF only if the target serving node is known to support SGi Non-IP PDN connections or SCEF Non-IP PDN connections respectively, as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.1 and 5.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]. Likewise, a source AMF shall transfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN connections only if the target MME is known to support SGi Non-IP PDN connections. The source MME/SGSN/AMF shall not proceed with the Forward Relocation Request procedure if the UE does not have any EPS bearer context(s) for SGi IP or Non-IP PDN connections that can be transferred to the target serving node, i.e. under the following conditions:\n-\tIf the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN with only the PDN connection(s) of PDN type \"non-IP\" through the SGW and the PGW, with or without SCEF PDN connections, and the target serving node is known to not support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection (as specified in clause 4.3.17.8.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and in clause 5.3.13.8 of 3GPP TS 23 060 [35]); or\n-\tIf the UE is attached to the source AMF (5GS) with only PDU session(s) of type \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\", and the target MME is known to not support SGi Non-IP and Ethernet PDN Connection.\nThe source MME shall transfer the EPS bearer context(s) for the Ethernet PDN connection only if the target serving node is known to support the Ethernet PDN connection, as specified in clause 5.3.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]. The source MME shall not proceed with the Forward Relocation Request procedure if the UE does not have any EPS bearer context(s) that can be transferred to the target serving node, i.e. under the following conditions:\n-\tIf the UE is attached to the source MME with only the PDN connection(s) of PDN type \"Ethernet\" through the SGW and the PGW, and the target serving node is known to not support the Ethernet PDN connection.\nTable 7.3.1-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs in the message.\nTable 7.3.1-1: Information Elements in a Forward Relocation Request\nThe PDN Connection grouped IE shall be coded as depicted in Table 7.3.1-2.\nTable 7.3.1-2: MME/SGSN/AMF UE EPS PDN Connections within Forward Relocation Request\n\nThe Bearer Context grouped IE shall be coded as depicted in Table 7.3.1-3.\nTable 7.3.1-3: Bearer Context within MME/SGSN/AMF UE EPS PDN Connections within Forward Relocation Request\n\nTable 7.3.1-4: Remote UE Context Connected within MME/SGSN UE EPS PDN Connections within Forward Relocation Request\n\nTable 7.3.1-5: MME UE SCEF PDN Connections within Forward Relocation Request\n\nTable 7.3.1-6: Subscribed V2X Information within Forward Relocation Request\n\nTable 7.3.1-7: PC5 QoS Parameters within Forward Relocation Request\n\nTable 7.3.1-8: PGW Change Info with Forward Relocation Request\n\n",

                    "text_content": "Retransmission requirements in the current clause do not apply to the Initial messages that do not have Triggered messages.\nReliable delivery in GTPv2 messages is accomplished by retransmission of these messages. A message shall be retransmitted if and only if a reply is expected for that message and the reply has not yet been received. There may be limits placed on the total number of retransmissions to avoid network overload.\nInitial messages and their Triggered messages, as well as Triggered messages and their Triggered Reply messages are matched based on the Sequence Number and the IP address and port rules in clause 4.2 \"Protocol stack\". Therefore, an Initial message and its Triggered message, as well as a Triggered message and its Triggered Reply message shall have exactly the same Sequence Number value. A retransmitted GTPv2 message (an Initial or a Triggered) has the exact same GTPv2 message content, including the GTP header, UDP ports, source and destination IP addresses as the originally transmitted GTPv2 message.\nFor each triplet of local IP address, local UDP port and remote peer's IP address a GTP entity maintains a sending queue with signalling messages to be sent to that peer. The message at the front of the queue shall be sent with a Sequence Number, and if the message has an expected reply, it shall be held in a list until a reply is received or until the GTP entity has ceased retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique for each outstanding Initial message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint. A node running GTP may have several outstanding messages waiting for replies.  Not counting retransmissions, a single GTP message with an expected reply shall be answered with a single GTP reply, regardless whether it is per UE, per APN, or per bearer\nA piggybacked initial message (such as a Create Bearer Request message or Modify Bearer Request message) shall contain a Sequence Number that is assigned by sending GTP entity and the message shall be held in a list until a response is received. The response message to a piggybacked initial message may arrive without piggybacking (e.g., Create Bearer Response at PGW).\nThe Sequence Number in the GTP header of the triggered response message shall be copied from the respective request message.\nIf a request message (e.g., Create Session Request) triggers piggybacking (i.e., Create Bearer Request piggybacked on Create Session Response), re-transmission of the request message shall also trigger piggybacking.  A Sequence Number used for a Command message shall have the most significant bit set to 1. A Sequence Number in a message, which was triggered by a Command message, as well as respective Triggered Reply message shall have the same Sequence Number as the Command message (i.e. shall also have the most significant bit set to 1). This setting of the most significant bit of the Sequence Number is done to avoid potential clashes between the Sequence Number selected for a Command message, and the Sequence Number selected by a GTPv2 peer for a Request message, which was not triggered by a Command message.\nA Sequence Number used for a Request message, which was not triggered by a Command message shall have the most significant bit set to 0.\nA timer, denoted T3-RESPONSE, shall be started when a signalling message (for which a reply is expected) is sent. A signalling message or the triggered message has probably been lost if a reply has not been received before the T3-RESPONSE timer expires.\nOnce the T3-RESPONSE timer expires, the message corresponding to the T3-RESPONSE timer is then retransmitted if the total number of retry attempts is less than N3-REQUESTS times. The expiry of the timer for piggybacked request messages shall result in re-transmission of the original IP/UDP packet containing both the triggered response message and the piggybacked initial message. T3-RESPONSE timer and N3-REQUESTS counter setting is implementation dependent. That is, the timers and counters may be configurable per procedure. Multileg communications (e.g. Create Session Requests and Responses) however require longer timer values and possibly a higher number of retransmission attempts compared to single leg communication.\nAll received GTPv2 messages with an expected reply shall be replied to and all reply messages associated with a certain message shall always include the same information. Duplicated reply messages shall be discarded by the receiver unless the reply needs a reply. A received reply message without a matching outstanding message that is waiting for a reply should be discarded.\nIf a GTPv2 node is not successful with the transfer of a non-Echo signalling message, e.g. a Create Bearer Request message, it shall inform the upper layer of the unsuccessful transfer so that the controlling upper entity may take the necessary measures.\nNOTE:\tAt failure of sending a GTPv2 message after retransmissions, some information included in the message may be lost, e.g. Secondary RAT data usage report.\n",

Therefore, octets \"a(n+1) to a(n+4)\" will not be present.\n-\tIf n = 6, a = 1 and the Cause IE will be 10 octets long.\nFor PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW/MAG shall do the mapping between GTPv2 Cause IE and respective PMIPv6 IE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.275 [26].\nThe following bits within Octet 6 indicate:\n-\tBits 8 to 4: Spare, for future use and set to zero\n-\tBit 1 – CS (Cause Source): If this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the corresponding error cause is originated by the remote node (i.e., the MME/SGSN to a PGW, or the PGW to an MME/SGSN). This bit is set to 0 to denote that the corresponding error cause is originated by the node sending the message.\nThe CS should be set to 1 by the SGW when the SGW relay a response message with cause value from the MME/SGSN to the PGW or from the PGW to the MME/SGSN. For PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW shall set the CS bit to 1 when the SGW/MAG relay a response message with the cause value from the PGW/LMA to the MME/SGSN.\n-\tBit 2 – BCE (Bearer Context IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in the Bearer Context IE. This bit shall be discarded if the cause value is one of Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.\n-\tBit 3 – PCE (PDN Connection IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in the PDN Connection IE. This bit shall be discarded if the cause value is one of Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.\nThe Cause value shall be included in a response message. In a response message, the Cause value indicates the acceptance or the rejection of the corresponding request message. The Cause value indicates the explicit reason for the rejection.\nIf the rejection is due to a mandatory IE or a verifiable conditional IE is faulty or missing, the offending IE shall be included within an additional field \"a(n+1) to a(n+4)\". Only Type and Instance fields of the offending IE that caused the rejection have a meaning. The length in the Octet 8-9 and spare bits in the Octet 10 shall be set to \"0\". In this case, the value of \"n\" shall be \"6\". Otherwise, the value of \"n\" is equal to \"2\".\nThe Cause may also be included in the request message. In a request message, the Cause value indicates the reason for the request.\n\"Request accepted\" is returned when the GTPv2 entity has accepted a control plane request.\n\"Context Not Found\" is used in the response message by a GTP entity when it receives a message for which it does not have context, e.g. TEID-C or EBI is not known. When \"Context Not Found\" is received at Bearer Context IE level, it means the bearer context is unknown in the peer. When \"Context Not Found\" is received at message level together with a known TEID-C in the GTPv2-C header in the response message, this indicates some bearer contexts are not known in the peer; the sender of the request message should further determine, based on the bearer context(s) included in the request message, that:\n-\tif the default bearer is unknown, this means the PDN connection is not known in the peer;\n-\tif one or more dedicated bearers are unknown, this means only those dedicated bearer contexts are not known in the peer.\n\"Context Not Found\" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response message during the non-3GPP to 3GPP access handover procedures, if the request corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not exist in the PGW.\n\"Context Not Found\" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response message during the 3GPP to non-3GPP access handover procedures, if the request corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not exist in the PGW.\n\"Service not supported\" is used by the GTP entity when it receives a message, which corresponds to a feature or a service which is not supported by the node.\n\"Service denied\" is used when the requested service cannot be granted.\n\"System failure\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate a generic error condition.\n\"No resources available\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate the temporary unavailability of the resource(s) to process the received request.\n\"Semantic error in the TFT operation\", \"Syntactic error in the TFT operation\", \"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\", \"Syntactic errors in packet filters(s)\", \"UE context without TFT already activated\", \"Semantic error in the TAD operation\" and \"Syntactic error in the TAD operation\" are indications of error cases involving TFT(s)/TAD(s) as specified in clause 7.7.11 in this specification.\n\"Missing or unknown APN\" is used by the PGW when it does not support the Access Point Name, received in Create Session Request message.\n\"Relocation failure\" is used by the target MME/S4-SGSN to indicate the source MME/S4-SGSN that the relocation has failed.\n\"Relocation failure due to NAS message redirection\" is used by the new MME/S4-SGSN to indicate to the old MME/S4-SGSN that the TAU/RAU procedure is not successful due to NAS message redirection as described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], or used by the initial AMF to indicate to the old MME that the context transfer procedure is not successful due to NAS message redirection as described in clause 4.11.1.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [83].\n\"Denied in RAT\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the requested service is not accepted in the RAT.\n\"Preferred PDN type not supported\" is used by the PGW to indicate that the PDN type received in the Create Session Request message is not supported by the PGW for the PDN corresponding to the received Access Point Name.\n\"Protocol type not supported\" is used by the SGW to indicate that the S5/S8 protocol type requested by the MME/S4-SGSN is not supported by it.\n\"UE not responding\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate that the UE is not responding to the request initiated by the network, e.g. Paging.\n\"UE refuses\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the UE, without specifying further detail, rejected the request from the network.\n\"Unable to page UE\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate its inability to page the UE, temporarily.\n\"User authentication failed\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the request is rejected due to a failure in the authentication/security procedure, or because the required user authentication cannot be performed (when the UE does not support secondary DN authentication and authorization over EPC but such a procedure is mandatory due to local policies in a combined PGW-C/SMF), or is used by a combined PGW-C/SMF for an UUAA-SM during PDN connection establishment procedure as described in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [90] or in authorization for C2 procedure as described in clause 5.2.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [90].\n\"APN access denied – no subscription\" is used to indicate that the PGW has denied the user access to an APN because a subscription is required, but the subscriber does not have the necessary subscription.\n\"Remote peer not responding\" is used by the SGW for the messages spanning through two interfaces.  This cause value is returned by the SGW to the MME/S4-SGSN or PGW in a response message where no response message is received from the PGW or MME/S4-SGSN.\n\"Collision with network initiated request\" is used by the PGW to indicate that the UE-initiated bearer resource allocation/modification request is rejected since the PGW has requested a bearer resource allocation/modification for the same service using a network-initiated procedure.\n\"Unable to page UE due to Suspension\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate that the UE has not been paged because the bearers of the UE are in a suspended state.\n\"APN Restriction type Incompatible with currently active PDN connection\" is used by the PGW to indicate that the newly requested PDN connection has APN restriction value that is not compatible with the currently active PDN connection(s)'s APN restriction value(s).\n\"Invalid peer\" is used by the SGW to indicate that currently the UE is being managed by the different node (e.g. MME/S4-SGSN) than the node (e.g. S4-SGSN/MME) which has sent the Delete Session Request message.\n\"Invalid Reply from remote peer\" is used by the SGW for the messages spanning through two interfaces. This cause value is returned by the SGW to the MME/SGSN or PGW in a reply message where the corresponding reply message on S5/S8 or S11/S4 from the PGW or MME/SGSN is not decoded as valid.\n\"Temporarily rejected due to handover/TAU/RAU procedure in progress\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN for the bearer related procedure initiated by the PGW. When the handover/TAU/RAU with/without SGW change and/or MME/S4-SGSN change is in progress, the MME/S4-SGSN may receive Create / Update / Delete Bearer request message for the bearer creation, modification or deletion initiated by the PGW. If the handover/TAU/RAU procedure results in the SGW and/or MME/S4-SGSN change, then the bearer related procedure cannot be handled temporarily by the MME/S4-SGSN till the handover/TAU/RAU procedure is completed. In that case the MME/S4-SGSN shall reject the bearer related procedure with this rejection cause. This cause is also used to indicate that the Downlink Data Notification message is rejected temporarily due to the mobility procedures with MME or SGSN change in progress as specified in clause 5.3.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].\nThe usage of \"Fallback to GTPv1\" is specified in clause 7.10 \"Fallback to GTPv1 mechanism\".\nIn the PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure for the default bearer, the PGW may include the Cause IE in the Delete Bearer Request with values \"RAT changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP\", \"Reactivation requested\" or \"Reactivation disallowed to APN\".\n\"APN Congestion\" is used by the PGW and it indicates that the PGW has detected congestion for the requested APN and performs overload control for that APN which does not allow the PDN connection to be established.\n\"GTP-C Entity Congestion\" is used to indicate that the GTP-C entity has detected node level congestion and performs overload control at the node level, which does not allow the request to be processed.\n\"UE already re-attached\" is used by MME/S4-SGSN for the network triggered service restoration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]. The MME/S4-SGSN may send the Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge or Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication with this cause as part of the network triggered service restoration procedure.\n\"PDP connection inactivity timer expires\" is used by the PGW in Delete Bearer Request(s) to indicate that all the bearer(s) for the emergency PDN connection are deleted upon the inactivity timer expiry as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [48].\n\"Network failure\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session Request to indicate that the message is sent due to a network problem.\n\"QoS parameter mismatch\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session Request to indicate that the PDN connection can not be established due to a QoS parameter mismatch.\n\"MME/SGSN refuses due to VPLMN policy\" is used by the MME/SGSN in the VPLMN to indicate to the PGW in the Create Bearer Response or Update Bearer Response that it does not allow the establishment or modification of the bearer due to VPLMN operator's policy.\nThe listed cause values for rejection response message descriptions in clause 7 are not meant to be exhaustive lists. Therefore a GTPv2 node shall use the most appropriate matching rejection response cause value that is listed in Table 8.4-1.\nIf a Bearer Resource Command message is related to an established PDN connection for LIPA or for SIPTO at the local network, the LGW shall reject the Bearer Resource Command with the cause value of \"Bearer handling not supported\".\n\"Multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed\" is used by SGW for reply message to the MME/S4-SGSN when PMIP-based S5/S8 is used. If either SGW or PGW does not support the multiple PDN connections to the same APN function, the SGW shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure with this rejection cause when receiving Create Session Request for additional PDN connectivity to the given APN from the same UE.\nAs specified in clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value \"New PDN type due to network preference\" indicates that the UE has requested PDN type IPv4v6 and only IPv4 or IPv6 address is allowed for the PDN based on PGW operator policy.\nAs specified in clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value \"New PDN type due to single address bearer only\" indicates that the MS has requested PDN type IPv4v6 and both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual Address Bearer Flag of the Indication IE is set to 0 or the Indication IE is absent, or only single IP version addressing is possible in the PDN.\n\"PGW not responding\" is used by the SGW in PGW Restart Notification to indicate that the peer PGW has failed and not restarted as specified in clause 7.9.5.\n\"UE context without TFT already activated\" is used by the PGW in the Bearer Resource Failure Indication message to indicate that the PGW has received the Bearer Resource Command message without TAD IE in the secondary PDP Context Activation procedure.\n\"Target access restricted for the subscriber\" is used by the MME/SGSN in the Context Response message to indicate that the target access is prohibited for the subscriber, based on the subscription profile.\n\"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Identification Response and Context Response message if the P-TMSI Signature stored in the old SGSN or MME does not match the value sent by the UE via the new SGSN or MME.\n\"Late Overlapping Request\" is used by the PGW in the Create Session Response to indicate that the incoming request collides with an existing session which has a more recent time stamp than the time stamp of the new request, as specified in clause 13.2.\n\"Timed Out Request\" is used by the SGW and PGW in the Create Session Response to indicate that the incoming request is known to have already timed out at the originating entity, as specified in clause 13.3.\n\"UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving\" is used by the MME/SGSN in the Create/Update Bearer Response message to reject the corresponding network initiated procedures for a Delay Tolerant PDN connection and also request the PGW to hold the network initiated procedure until it receives the subsequent Modify Bearer Request message with the UASI flag indicating that the UE is available for end to end signalling.\n\"UE not authorised by OCS or external AAA Server\" is used by the PGW in the Create Session Response to reject the corresponding UE initiated procedures when the OCS or an external AAA Server on SGi did not authorise it and the support of the Cause Code was indicated by the SGSN/MME within the Create Session Request.\nIf a Create Session Request message requests the addition of an access to a PDN connection, and NBIFOM is not supported by the MME/SGSN, SGW or TWAN, the PGW should reject the request with the cause value of \"Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed\". This cause is also used by the PGW in the Delete Bearer Request message to initiate the removal of 3GPP access from the PDN connection due to detection of the MME/SGSN or SGW not supporting NBIFOM at the inter-PLMN mobility procedure.\n\"Request rejected due to UE capability\" is used by the MME in the Create Bearer Response to reject the request to add an EPS bearer that would exceed the UE capability (e.g. a NB-IoT UE can only support up to 2 EPS bearers). This cause value does not prevent the PGW from sending Create Bearer Request later.\n\"S1-U Path Failure\" is used by the SGW in the Create Session Response, or in the Modify Bearer Response message, or in the Modify Access Bearer Response message to report an S1-U path failure. The SGW may include this cause code in a Downlink Data Notification message and/or a Delete Bearer Request message to report the S1-U path failure. See clause 20.3 in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].\n\"EPS to 5GS Mobility\" is used by the PGW, and it indicates that PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure is due to EPS to 5GS mobility procedures.\n\"5GC not allowed\" is used by the source MME in the Context Response message sent to the target AMF during an EPS to 5GS idle mode mobility procedure, to indicate that the UE is not allowed for 5GC, based on the subscription profile.\n\"PGW mismatch with network slice subscribed by the UE\" is used by the PGW in the Create Session Response message during an EPS to 5GS mobility procedure, to indicate that the PGW is not serving the network slice subscribed by the UE for the APN/DNN.\n\"Rejection due to paging restriction\" is used by the MME to indicate that the UE has not been paged because the MME holds stored Paging Restriction information for the UE that restricts the Downlink Data from causing paging as specified in clause 4.3.33.6 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] or the UE has rejected the page as specified in clause 4.3.33.4 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].\nTable 8.4-1: Cause values\n\nThe mapping at the MME/S4-SGSN between GTP cause values received over the S11/S4 interface and the NAS cause values sent to the UE is specified in Annex C.\n",

Spare bits in GTPv1 in MM Context IE there are set to 1s.\nSecurity Mode indicates the type of security keys (GSM/UMTS/EPS) and Authentication Vectors (quadruplets /quintuplets/triplets) that are passed to the new MME/SGSN/AMF.\nThe DRX parameter coding is specified in clause 10.5.5.6 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]. If DRXI (DRX Indicator), bit 4 of octet 5, is set to \"1\", then the DRX parameter field is present, otherwise its octets are not present. During 5GS to EPS mobility procedure, the source AMF shall not send 5G DRX parameter to the target MME; and during EPS to 5GS mobility procedure, the target AMF shall discard the DRX parameter if received.  The encoding of 5G DRX as specified in clause 9.11.3.2A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [87] is different from the one as specified in clause 10.5.5.6 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [5].\nUplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR (Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate) is coded as Unsigned32 integer values in kbps (1000 bps) for all non-GBR bearers according to the subscription of the user. The uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR requires converting values in bits per second to kilobits per second when it is received from the HSS.

The IOV_updates counter is encoded as an integer with a length of 1 octet. The use of the IOV_updates counter is specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 [78]. If IOVI (IOV_updates Indicator), bit 5 of octet 6, is set to \"1\", then the IOV_updates counter parameter field shall be present, otherwise it shall not be present.\nThe Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.\nFigure 8.38-2: UMTS Key, Used Cipher and Quintuplets\nAs depicted in Figure 8.38-3, the GSM Key, Used Cipher and Authentication Quintuplets that are unused in the old SGSN shall be transmitted to the new SGSN when the UMTS subscriber is attached to a GSM BSS in the old system, in case the user has a ME no capable of UMTS AKA. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets '16 to h' are absent).\nThe Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.\nFigure 8.38-3: GSM Key, Used Cipher and Quintuplets\nAs depicted in Figure 8.38-4, the UMTS Key, KSI and unused Authentication Quintuplets in the old SGSN may be transmitted to the new SGSN/MME when the UMTS subscriber is attached to UTRAN/GERAN in the old system, but it is not allowed to send quintuplets to an MME in a different serving network domain (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.6). The MME may forward the UMTS Key, KSI and unused Authentication Quintuplets which were previously stored back to the same SGSN, for further details, refer to 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets '40 to h' are absent).\nIf the UGIPAI (Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm Indicator), bit 3 of octet 6, is set to 1, then bits 1 to 3 of octet 7 shall contain the Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm field, otherwise these bits shall be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.\nThe GUPII (GPRS User Plane Integrity Indicator), bit 4 of octet 6, shall be set to 1 if the subscriber profile indicated that user plane integrity protection is required and set to 0 otherwise.\nNOTE 3:\tThe encoding of the bits is not identical with GTPv1 as the spare bits are encoded differently.\nThe source S4-SGSN shall include the IOV_updates counter if it is supported and available. The IOV_updates counter is encoded as an integer with a length of 1 octet. The use of the IOV_updates counter is specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 [78]. If IOVI (IOV_updates Indicator), bit 5 of octet 6, is set to \"1\", then the IOV_updates counter parameter field shall be present, otherwise it shall not be present.\nThe Extended Access Restriction Data is to store the extra access restriction data received from the HSS (other than ECNA, NBNA, HNNA, ENA, INA, GANA, GENA and UNA). If Length of Extended Access Restriction Data is zero, then the field of Extended Access Restriction Data shall not be present. The Extended Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as Secondary RAT Not Allowed). The presence of the Extended Access Restriction Data for the case in UMTS Key as depicted in Figure 8.38-4 is optional.\nNOTE 4:\tIn Figure 8.38-4, including the Extended Access Restriction Data allows optimized selection of SGW in case of handover from GSM/UTRAN to E-UTRAN.\nThe Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.\nFigure 8.38-4: UMTS Key and Quintuplets\nAs depicted in Figure 8.38-5, the current EPS Security Context, a non-current EPS Security Context (if available), and unused Authentication Quadruplets in the old MME may be transmitted to the new MME/AMF. If the new MME/AMF is not in the same serving network domain, then only the current EPS Security Context may be transmitted. The mapping of an EPS security context to a 5G security context in the new AMF is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [86]. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may be included. The field 'Number of Quadruplets' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets '46 to g' are absent). Authentication Quintuplets shall not be transmitted to the new MME/AMF (i.e. octets 'g+1 to h' shall be absent) even if the old MME has the Authentication Quintuplets for this UE. The field 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'. The reasons for not sending Quintuplets are specified in3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.6.\nThe current EPS Security Context may be transmitted by the old AMF to the new MME, where the mapping of a 5G security context to an EPS security context is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [86]. The field 'Number of Quadruplets' and 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'. The AMF shall not transmit un-used authentication vectors to an MME and shall discard any un-used authentication vectors received from an MME, regardless of whether the MME and AMF pertain to the same or different serving network domains.\nThe Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are specified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.\nThe value of the NAS Downlink Count shall be set to the value that shall be used to send the next NAS message.\nThe value of the NAS Uplink Count shall be set to the largest NAS Uplink Count that was in a successfully integrity verified NAS message.\nIn Figure 8.38-5, the fields for the Old EPS Security Context (i.e. octets from s to s+64) may be present only in S10 Forward Relocation Request message according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of Security Procedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. The octets for Old EPS Security Context shall be present if the OSCI (Old Security Context Indicator), bit 1 of octet 6) is set to \"1\"; otherwise they shall not be present.\nIf NHI_old (Next Hop Indicator for old EPS Security Context), bit 8 of octet s, is set to \"1\", then the parameters old NH (Next Hop) and old NCC (Next Hop Chaining Count) shall be present; otherwise the octets for old NH parameter shall not be present and the value of old NCC parameter shall be ignored by the receiver. .\nMultiple APN Rate Control Statuses (including the number of packets still allowed in the given time unit, the number of additional exception reports still allowed in the given time unit and the termination time of the current APN Rate Control validity period) may be included by the MME.\nThe MM context shall contain the APN Rate Control Status(s) for PDN connection which are released and currentlty not re-established. Once a PDN connection is re-established, the related APN Rate Control Status shall be deleted.\nThe UAMBRI shall be set to \"0\" by the old AMF, and then the Uplink/downlink Used UE AMBR parameter field are not present.The SAMBRI shall be set to \"1\" by the old AMF, if the AMF has the Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR received from the MME, or the Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR in 5G.\nThe RLOS indication flag (bit 7 of octet s) shall be set to 1 if the UE is RLOS attached.\nFigure 8.38-5: EPS Security Context and Quadruplets\nIf NHI (Next Hop Indicator), bit 5 of octet 5, is set to \"1\", then the optional parameters NH (Next Hop) and NCC (Next Hop Chaining Count) are both present, otherwise their octets are not present.\nThe UE Radio Capability for Paging information is specified in the clause 9.2.1.98 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [10]. If Length of UE Radio Capability for Paging information is zero, then the UE Radio Capability for Paging information shall not be present. The old MME shall, when available, include UE Radio Capability for Paging information to the new MME in the Context Response or Forward Relocation Request message as specified in the clause 5.11.4 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. If the RAT type is indicated by the new MME in the Context Request message, then the old MME shall include the UE Radio Capability for Paging for the corresponding RAT type, if available.\nThe Extended Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as Secondary RAT Not Allowed), USSRNA (Unlicensed Spectrum in the form of LAA or LWA/LWIP as Secondary RAT Not Allowed), NRNA (NR in 5GS Not Allowed), NRUSRNA (New Radio Unlicensed as Secondary RAT Not Allowed), and of NRUNA (NR-U in 5GS Not Allowed).\nNOTE 5:\tAs specified in clause 4.11.1.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [83], NRSRNA can be provided via N26 during handover from 5GC to EPC in order to allow the MME to make appropriate handling, e.g. SGW selection based on access restriction, or whether or not to allocate resources for secondary RAT during inter RAT handover.\nThe UE additional security capability coding is specified in clause 9.9.3.53 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23]. If Length of UE additional security capability is zero, then the field UE additional security capability in octets \"(v+2) to x\" shall not be present.\nThe UE NR security capability coding is specified in clause 9.11.3.54 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [87]. If Length of UE NR security capability is zero, then the field UE NR security capability in octets \"(x+2) to y\" shall not be present.\nThe Core Network Restrictions coding is specified in clause 7.2.230 of 3GPP TS 29.272 [70]. If Length of Core Network Restrictions is zero, then the field of Core Network Restrictions in octets \"(l+2) to (l+5)\" shall not be present.\nThe UE Radio Capability ID is specified in the clause 9.9.3.60 of 3GPP TS24.301 [23]. If Length of UE Radio Capability ID is zero, then the UE Radio Capability ID shall not be present. When supporting the RACS feature, the old MME shall include the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID if available, otherwise it shall include the Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, to the new MME as specified in the clause 5.11.3a of 3GPP TS 23.401 [4].\nNOTE 6:\tIf the MME supports RACS and the MME detects that the selected PLMN during a service request procedure is different from the currently registered PLMN for the UE, the MME stores the UE Radio Capability ID of the newly selected PLMN in the MM context as described in clause 5.11.3a of 3GPP TS 23.401 [4], and provides this UE Radio Capability ID to the target MME during any subsequent inter-MME mobility.\nThe EPS NAS Security Context Type (ENSCT) shall be encoded in bits 1 and 2 of octet 'a'.  ENSCT indicates the type of the Key Set Identifier, see Table 8.38-6. For EPS NAS Security Context usage see e.g. clause 6.4 in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. Bits 3 to 8 of octet 'a' are spare and shall be set to '0' by the sender and ignored by the receiver.\nAs depicted in Figure 8.38-6, the old MME will derive CK' and IK' from KASME and transmit the CK' and IK' to the new SGSN. Authentication Quintuplets, if available, shall be transmitted to the SGSN if, and only if the MME received them from this SGSN earlier, according to 3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.5. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets 'g+1 to h' are absent). An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may be included. The field 'Number of Quadruplets' shall be set to the value '0' if no Authentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets '40 to g' are absent). A key KASME shall never be transmitted to an SGSN according to 3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.4.\nThe Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are specified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.\nThe old SGSN/MME may deliver both Authentication Quadruplets and Authentication Quintuplets it holds to the peer combo node to optimize the procedure.\nNOTE 7:\t3GPP TS 33.401 [12] states that \"EPS authentication data shall not be forwarded from an MME towards an SGSN\". The statement above assumes that the old MME can determine by local configuration that the peer node is a combo SGSN/MME (as opposed to a single SGSN).\n\nFigure 8.38-6: UMTS Key, Quadruplets and Quintuplets\nFigure 8.38-7: Authentication Triplet\nFigure 8.38-8: Authentication Quintuplet\nFigure 8.38-9: Authentication Quadruplet\n\nFigure 8.38-10: APN Rate Control Status\nFor the encoding of APN field see clause 8.6.\nOctets (k+13) to (k+20) (APN Rate Control Status validity Time) are coded as the time in seconds relative to 00:00:00 on 1 January 1900 (calculated as continuous time without leap seconds and traceable to a common time reference) where binary encoding of the integer part is in the 32 most significant bits and binary encoding of the fraction part in the 32 least significant bits.

The FQ-CSID is used on S5, S8, S2a, S2b and S11 interfaces.\nThe size of CSID is two octets. The FQ-CSID is coded as follows:\nFigure 8.62-1: FQ-CSID\nWhere Node-ID Type values are:\n0\tindicates that Node-ID is a global unicast IPv4 address and p = 9.\n1\tindicates that Node-ID is a global unicast IPv6 address and p = 21.\n2\tindicates that Node-ID is a 4 octets long field with a 32 bit value stored in network order, and p= 9. The coding of the field is specified below:\n-\tMost significant 20 bits are the binary encoded value of (MCC * 1000 + MNC).\n-\tLeast significant 12 bits is a 12 bit integer assigned by an operator to an MME, SGW, TWAN, ePDG or PGW. Other values of Node-ID Type are reserved.\nValues of Number of CSID other than 1 are only employed in the Delete PDN Connection Set Request.\nThe node that creates the FQ-CSID, (i.e. MME for MME FQ-CSID, SGW for SGW FQ-CSID, TWAN for TWAN FQ-CSID, ePDG for ePDG FQ-CSID and PGW for PGW FQ-CSID), is responsible for making sure the Node-ID is globally unique and the CSID value is unique within that node.\nWhen a FQ-CSID is stored by a receiving node, it is stored on a PDN basis even for messages impacting only one bearer (i.e. Create Bearer Request). See 3GPP TS 23.007 [17] for further details on the CSID and what specific requirements are placed on the PGW, TWAN, ePDG, SGW and MME.\n",

In normal conditions, requests sent by a GTP-C entity can be processed by the receiving GTP-C entity which can send back a message indicating the result of the request (success/failure).\nOverload situations in a GTP-C entity occur when the number of incoming requests exceeds the maximum request throughput supported by the receiving GTP-C entity, e.g. when the internal available resources of the GTP-C entity, such as processing power or memory, are not sufficient to serve the number of incoming requests. As a consequence of the overload situation, the receiving GTP-C entity cannot successfully process the exceeding proportion of requests. These requests can be either simply dropped or extremely delayed in the processing. At best, the GTP-C entity may have enough internal resources to send back to the request initiator a message indicating that the requests cannot be successfully processed. Whatever the behaviour of the overloaded GTP-C entities, the rate of successfully processed requests and consequently the overall performances of the network decrease.\nNOTE:\tGTP-C overload control does not target to address transport network congestion. It assumes a transport network that is still capable to exchange signalling traffic.\nGiven the nature of GTP-C protocol in how it relies on retransmissions of unacknowledged requests (GTP-C is carried over UDP transport), when a GTP-C entity experiences overload (or severe overload) the number of unacknowledged GTP-C messages compounds exponentially and can lead to a node congestion or even collapse. An overload or failure of a node can lead to an increase of the load on the other nodes in the network and, in the worst case, turn into a complete network issue via a snowball effect.\nThe impact of GTP-C overload to services can be such as:\n-\tloss of PDN connectivity (IMS, Internet …) and associated services;\n-\tloss of ability to setup and release radio and core network bearers necessary to support services e.g. GBR bearers for VoLTE or dedicated bearers for Voice over WLAN;\n-\tloss of ability to report to the PGW/PCRF user's information changes, e.g. location information for emergency services and lawful intercept, changes in RAT or QoS;\n-\tand billing errors and a loss of revenue.\n",

The load information reflects the operating status of the resources of the GTP-C entity.\n-\toverload control enables a GTP-C entity becoming or being overloaded to gracefully reduce its incoming signalling load by instructing its GTP-C peers to reduce sending traffic according to its available signalling capacity to successfully process the traffic. A GTP-C entity is in overload when it operates over its signalling capacity which results in diminished performance (including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).\nLoad control allows for better balancing of the session load, so as to attempt to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action). Overload control aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the traffic source as possible generally when an overload has occurred (reactive action), so to avoid spreading the problem inside the network and to avoid using resources of intermediate nodes in the network for signalling that would anyhow be discarded by the overloaded node.\nLoad control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the GTP-C entity reports a high load.\nLoad control and overload control may be supported and activated independently in the network.\n",

It helps to achieve an evenly load balanced network at APN granularity by the use of the dynamic load information provided within the Load Control Information with the APN scope. Only a PGW may advertise APN level load information.\nAPN level load control is an optional feature that may be supported when the following pre-condition is applicable.\nPre-Condition:\nIn the given network, when the ratio of the configured APN resource to the overall capacity of the PGW is not the same across all the PGWs in the network.\nNOTE:\tIn other cases, e.g. when all the resources of the PGW are available for all the APNs served by that PGW, the node level load information is exactly the same as APN level load information, for each of its APNs, and hence performing node load control is sufficient.\nIf APN load control is supported and activated at the PGW, the PGW should advertise the APN load information. If the APN level load control feature is supported at the node performing the PGW selection, i.e. an MME, S4-SGSN, ePDG, TWAN, the node shall utilize this information when selecting the PGW.\nFollowing are the justifications to support the APN level load control in the network when the pre-condition specified in 12.2.3.1 is applicable:\n1)\tTo achieve load balancing at the APN level granularity: The PGW may be configured to handle more than one APN in the network. In such a case, the PGW may be additionally configured to allocate different resources for each of the configured APNs, e.g. the PGW may be configured to handle \"X\" number of sessions for the \"consumer\" APN and to handle \"Y\" number of session for the \"corporate\" APN. The ratio of this limit, i.e. \"X\" and \"Y\", to the PGW's capacity may not be the same across all the PGWs in the network. In this case, the load information with node level granularity is not sufficient and could result in a network where one PGW has more sessions for the \"consumer\" APN while another PGW has more sessions for the \"corporate\" APN. Thus, an evenly load balanced network at APN level load granularity cannot be realized.\n2)\tTo ensure effective overload control in the network: If the distribution of sessions at APN level is uneven, then there is a higher risk of overload of some PGWs, as compared to other PGWs, e.g. the PGW handling more sessions for \"consumer\" APN may have to handle more messages, (e.g. generated due to mobility events resulting from a change of ULI, RAT type, Serving GW, etc.) as compared to the PGW handling more sessions for the \"stationary-machine\" APN. Hence, the PGW handling \"consumer\" APN sessions may be at higher risk of overload, as compared to the other PGWs in the network, and hence, this situation may result in poor overload control of the network.\n3)\tTo ensure an efficient node selection algorithm: Based on the node level load information, the source node, (e.g. the MME) may end-up selecting the PGW for a new session for the given APN. However, the selected PGW may reject the new session request, if it is running at 100% load capacity for the given APN, or the new session request may be throttled by the source node based on the overload information of the APN for the given PGW. Thus the new session request may be denied, (i.e. rejected by the selected PGW or throttled by the source node based on PGW's APN level overload information) while the other PGW may have the capacity to handle the same. Thus, the lack of APN level load information may result in inefficient node selection algorithm by the source node.\nTo allow for an effective APN load control, at least the following information (in addition to the other applicable information for load control as defined in clause 12.2.5.1.2) is required to be advertised by the PGW, as part of the APN level load information:\nAPN: The APN for which the PGW wants to advertise the load information.\nAPN-Load-Metric: It indicates the current resource utilization for a particular APN, as a percentage, compared to the total resources reserved for that APN at the target PGW. Its computation is implementation dependent and it has same characteristics as \"Load-Metric\", as described in clause 12.2.5.1.2.2, when applied at the APN level.\nAPN-relative-capacity: It indicates the total resources configured for a given APN, compared to the total resources of the target PGW, as a percentage. It is a static parameter and does not change unless the resources configured for the APN change. Using APN-relative-capacity and the DNS weight-factor of the given PGW, the source node can judge the PGW's APN related resources as compared other PGWs in the network, i.e. the PGW's APN-weight-factor can be calculated by multiplying the APN-relative-capacity and DNS-weight-factor of the PGW (PGW's-APN-weight-factor = PGW's-APN-relative-capacity X DNS-weight-factor).\nFor the following example configuration:\nPGW1-APN1-relative-capacity = 50%; PGW2-APN1- relative-capacity = 20%; PGW3-APN1- relative-capacity = 10%\nPGW1-weight-factor = 20; PGW2-weight-factor = 20; PGW3-weight-factor = 60;\nThe APN level weight-factor for each of the PGWs can be calculated as below:\nPGW1-APN1-weight-factor = 50% X 20 = 10.\nPGW2-APN1-weight-factor = 20% X 20 = 4.\nPGW3-APN1-weight-factor = 10% X 60 = 6.\nThus, based on the APN-weight-factor it can be concluded that the PGW1 has highest APN1 related resources reserved, as compared to the other PGWs in the network. Hence the source node should use this information to favour PGW1 over other PGWs for APN1 related new session requests.\n",

All the instances of the LCI IE provided by a given GTP-C entity in a message shall contain the same Load-Control-Sequence-Number. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the load control information is changed (see clause 12.2.5.1.2.1).\nThe receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer with the newly received load control information (via one or multiple instances) from the same peer node if the new load control information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the Load Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored 'X' instances of the load control information for a peer node, it overwrites those 'X' instances with the new set of 'Y' instances received in a message from the same peer node, where X, Y are any integer number.\nThe receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for node selection. When more than one instance of the LCI IE is received, the receiver shall consider the parameters included in each instance independently, when using this information for node selection.\nThe parameters are further defined in clauses 12.2.5.1.2 and 12.2.5.1.3.\nLoad control information may be extended with new parameters in future versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized as:\n-\tNon-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the load control information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.\n-\tCritical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the load control information containing one or more of these parameters.\nThe sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter in any instance of the LCI IE towards a receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters. The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration; (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in future).\nEach instance of the LCI IE shall be associated to the node identity (FQDN or IP address of the GW node received from the HSS or the DNS) of the serving SGW or PGW, i.e. the identity determined during the SGW or PGW selection.\nNOTE:\tThe Node type is derived based on the instance number of the LCI IE.\n12.2.5.1.2.1\tLoad Control Sequence Number\nThe Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be used to differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances by the same GTP-C entity. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be supported (if load control is supported) and shall always be present in the LCI IE.\nThe GTP-C entity generating  this information shall increment the Load Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the Load Control Information IE. The Load Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The node may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the generation of the Load Control Information to populate the Load Control Sequence Number.\nWhen multiple instances of the LCI IE are provided in a message by a given GTP-C node, each of them shall contain the same Load Control Sequence Number value.\nThis parameter shall be used by the receiver of the Load Control Information IE to properly collate out-of-order load control information, e.g. due to GTP-C retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the LCI IE to determine whether the newly received load control information has changed compared to load control information previously received from the same node earlier.\nNOTE:\tThe GTP-C sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-order load control information as e.g. load control information may be sent in both GTP-C requests and responses, using independent GTP-C sequence numbering.\nIf the receiving entity has already received and stored load control information from the peer GTP-C entity, the receiving entity shall update its load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number received in the new load control information is higher than the stored value of the Load Control Sequence Number associated with the peer GTP-C entity. However due to roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or restart of the node, the Load Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer GTP-C entity, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) a Load Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the previous value.\n12.2.5.1.2.2\tLoad Metric\nThe Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as: the used capacity of the node based on activated bearers in relationship to maximum number of bearers the node can handle, the load that these active bearers produce in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in relationship to the total memory/CPU available, etc.).\nThe Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100 means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).\nThe Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.\nConsidering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node selection algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender should refrain from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2), in the Load Metric which does not result in useful improvement in node selection logic at the receiver. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising the new Load Control Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.\nNOTE:\tThe range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender to collect its own load information at every increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Load Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own load information is collected.\n12.2.5.1.2.3\tList-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity\nThe List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity parameter contains a list of the tuple (APN, Relative Capacity) and this indicates one or more APNs for which the Load Control Information is applicable. The \"APN\" contains the name of the APN and the Relative Capacity indicates the resources configured for a given APN, compared to the total resources configured at the target PGW, as a percentage.\nWhen present in the LCI IE, the scope of the load information shall be the list of indicated APNs for the PGW that sends the load control information. In that case, the \"Load Metric\" shall be interpreted as an \"APN-Load-Metric\" and shall indicate the current resource utilization for the indicated APNs, as a percentage, as compared to the total resources configured for the indicated APNs at the target PGW.\nIts computation is implementation dependent and it has the same characteristics as \"Load Metric\". Only one instance of the List-Of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE may be included within one Load Control Information instance.\nNOTE 1:\tThe maximum number of tuples (APN, Relative Capacity) in the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE is set to 10. More than 10 occurrences of (APN, Relative Capacity), within one single instance of the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE is treated as protocol error by the receiver.\nIf the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE has not been included, the scope of the Load Control Information shall be the entire PGW node (unless restricted by other parameters in the LCI IE).\nThis parameter may be supported (if load control is supported) and shall be supported when APN level load control is supported.\nThe receiver shall handle this parameter, when it is received, if it supports APN level load control. The receiver shall ignore a Load Control Information instance applicable for an APN, if it does not support APN level load control.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PGW encodes the APN level load information and node level load information using different instance numbers in the message, so that the receiver will ignore the APN level load information, if it does not support the APN level load control feature.\nThe maximum number of APNs, for which the PGW may advertise the Load Control Information, shall be limited to 10, i.e. the maximum number of occurrences of the tuple (APN, Relative Capacity) within and across various instances of the LCI IE shall be limited to 10, for a given PGW. Hence, if the PGW supports more than 10 APNs, it shall advertise the load control information for at most 10 of the most important APNs. In future, if needed, this limit may be increased to allow the PGW to advertise the load information for more APNs. In that case, the receiver not supporting the higher limit shall handle the first 10 APNs and shall ignore the load information for the remaining APNs.\nNOTE 3:\tThe limit of the number of APN's takes into account various aspects such as: the processing and storage requirements at the overloaded node and the receiver, the number of important APNs for which load control advertisement will be necessary and interoperability between the nodes.\nWhen including load control information for some APN(s), the PGW shall also provide node level load control information by providing one instance of the Load Control Information without the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity parameter.\nA node selecting a PGW for a given APN shall apply the APN level load information, if available for that APN. If this parameter is not received for a given APN but it has been received for other APN(s) from the same PGW, then for this given APN, the node performing PGW selection shall calculate the load metric, as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [32], for the target PGW.\nIf the PLMN supports the Load Control feature (see clause 12.2.6), the support, inclusion and handling of the parameters, within Load Control Information, is summarized in table 12.2.5.1.3-1.\nTable 12.2.5.1.3-1: Parameters of the Load Control Information\n\nHow often the sender includes the load control information is implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load control information is propagated to the target receivers within an acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information (i.e. effective load balancing) is achieved. The sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as follows:\n-\tthe sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;\n-\tthe sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;\n-\tthe sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.\nThe sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control Information only in a subset of the applicable GTP-C messages.\nThe receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in any of the GTP-C messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception, shall be able act upon the received load control information.\nA GTP-C entity may signal one or multiple instances of the LCI IE, with each providing load control information for a different scope. In order to limit the processing of the message on the receiver side and the size of the message on transport level, the number of load control information instances shall be limited:\n-\tat message level: there shall be at most one instance of node level LCI IE per node (i.e. per SGW or PGW) and at most 10 APN level instances.\n-\tat node level: the maximum number of instances of LCI IE which may be provided across multiple messages by a given node shall be the same as the maximum number of instances of LCI IE at message level.\n",

The high level principles are summarized below:\na)\tOverload control is an optional feature;\nb)\ta GTP-C entity may signal its overload to its GTP-C peers by including Overload Control Information in GTP-C signalling which provides guidance to the receiving GTP-C entity to decide actions which lead to signalling traffic mitigation towards the sender of the information;\nc)\tthe Overload Control Information may provide the overload information of a GTP-C entity, e.g. a PGW, or a specific APN(s) associated with the GTP-C entity;\nd)\tan MME/S4-SGSN may signal an overload to the PGW, via the SGW. An SGW may signal an overload to the MME/S4-SGSN and to the PGW. A PGW may signal an overload to the MME/S4-SGSN, via the SGW.

All the instances of the OCI IE provided by a given GTP-C entity in a message shall contain the same Overload Control Sequence Number. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the overload control information is modified (see clause 12.3.5.1.2.1).\nWhen including overload control information for some APN(s), the PGW should not provide any node level Overload Control Information unless the node level information is also applicable.\nThe receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a peer with the newly received overload control information (received via one or multiple instances of OCI IE) from the same GTP-C peer entity, if the new information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored 'X' instances of the OCI IE for a peer GTP-C entity, it shall overwrite those 'X' instances with the new set of 'Y' instances received in a message from the same GTP-C peer entity, where X, Y are any integer numbers.\nThe receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload mitigation action. When more than one instance of the OCI IE is included, the receiver shall consider the parameters included in each instance independently, while applying the overload mitigation action.\nThe parameters are further described in clauses 12.3.5.1.2 and 12.3.5.1.3.\nOverload control information may be extended with new parameters in future versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized as:\n-\tNon-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the Overload Control Information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameters.\n-\tCritical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the Overload Control Information containing one or more of these parameters.\nThe sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameter(s) within any instance of Overload Control Information, without having the knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter(s) in any instance of Overload Control Information towards a receiver, if the corresponding receiver is known to support these parameter(s). The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration; this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in the future.\nEach instance of the OCI shall be associated by default to the GTP-C entity corresponding to the peer node's IP address of the PDN connection, over which the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the \"Sender F-TEID for control plane\" IE, the \"PGW S5/S8/ S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based Control Plane interface\" IE or within the \"MME/S4-SGSN Identifier\" IE.\nAlternatively, the GW (i.e. SGW and PGW) nodes may send Overload Control Information which is associated with the GW node's identity, i.e. the FQDN or IP address of the GW node received from the HSS (for a PGW) or the DNS (for an SGW or PGW), the identity determined during the GW selection. In that case, the GW node shall provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE included in the message belongs to the GW node's identity.\n12.3.5.1.2.1\tOverload Control Sequence Number\nThe GTP-C protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same contents as the original message (see clause 7.6). Due to GTP-C retransmissions, the overload control information received by a GTP-C entity at a given time may be less recent than the overload control information already received from the same GTP-C entity. The Overload Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the overload control information received from an overloaded GTP-C entity. The Overload Control Sequence Number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence number shall be used to differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two different instants, by the same GTP-C entity.\nThe Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the Overload Control Information IE.\nThe GTP-C entity generating this information shall increment the Overload Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The GTP-C entity may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the generation of the overload control information, to populate the Overload Control Sequence Number.\nWhen multiple instances of the OCI IE are provided in the same message by a given GTP-C entity, each of the Overload Control Sequence Numbers shall have the same value.\nThis parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly collate out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to GTP-C retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine whether the newly received overload control information has changed compared to the overload control information previously received from the same GTP-C entity. If the newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information from the same GTP-C peer, then the receiver may simply discard the newly received overload control information whilst continuing to apply the overload abatement procedures, as per the previous value.\nNOTE 1:\tThe timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see 12.3.5.1.2.2) is not restarted if the newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information. If the overload condition persists and the overloaded GTP-C entity needs to extend the duration during which the overload information applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload control information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number (even if the parameters within the overload control information have not changed).\nNOTE 2:\tThe GTP-C Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-order overload information as e.g. overload control information may be sent in both GTP-C requests and responses, using independent GTP-C sequence numbering.\nIf the receiving GTP-C entity already received and stored overload control information, which is still valid, from the overloaded GTP-C entity, the receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information is larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated with the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload Control Sequence Number or restart of the GTP-C entity, the Overload Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer GTP-C entity, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) an Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the previous value.\n12.3.5.1.2.2\tPeriod of Validity\nThe Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the overload condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid (unless overridden by subsequent new overload control information).\nAn overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE is received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is received from the same GTP-C entity (at which point the newly received overload control information shall prevail). The timer corresponding to the period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is received. When this timer expires, the last received overload control information shall be considered outdated and obsolete, i.e. any associated overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.\nThe Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload control).\nThe Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:\n-\tit avoids the need for the overloaded GTP-C entity to include the Overload Control Information IE in every GTP-C messages it signals to its GTP-C peers when the overload state does not change; thus it minimizes the processing required at the overloaded GTP-C entity and its GTP-C peers upon sending/receiving GTP-C signalling;\n-\tit allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the GTP-C peers having received an overload indication from the overloaded GTP-C entity, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these GTP-C entities for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes the need for the overloaded GTP-C entity to remember the list of GTP-C entities to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction metric and to which it would subsequently need to signal when the overload condition ceases, if the Period of Validity parameter was not defined.\n12.3.5.1.2.3\tOverload Reduction Metric\nThe Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender of the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An Overload Reduction Metric of \"0\" always indicates that the GTP-C entity is not in overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be applied) for the indicated scope.\nConsidering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload Control Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated Overload Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every small variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload Reduction Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating the overload situation. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction Metric Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.\nNOTE:\tThe range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender to collect its own overload information at every increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload Reduction Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific criteria, such as the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the current load/overload situation and so on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own overload control information is collected.\nThe computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an implementation choice at the sending GTP-C entity.\nThe Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.\nThe inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occuring, unless the Overload Reduction Metric is set to 0, which signals that the overload condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a message does not mean that the overload has abated.\n12.3.5.1.2.4\tList of APNs\nThe List of APNs IE indicates one or more APNs for which the Overload Control Information is applicable. When present in the OCI IE, the scope of the overload control information shall be the list of the indicated APNs for the PGW that sends the overload control information. At most one instance of the List of APNs IE shall be included within one Overload Control Information instance.\nNOTE 1:\tThe maximum number of APNs in the List of APNs is set to 10. More than 10 occurrences of APN within one single instance of the List of APNs IE is treated as a protocol error by the receiver.\nIf the List of APNs IE has not been included, the scope of the Overload Control Information shall be the entire GTP-C entity (unless restricted by other parameters in the Overload Control Information IE).\nThe List of APNs parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload control). The List of APNs may be present or absent in the Overload Control Information IE (depending on the scope of the reported overload control information).\nNOTE 2:\tThe instance number of both the node-level and APN-level overload control information is \"0\" and the instance number is therefore not used to indicate if the scope of the overload control information is on PGW node level or APN level.\nThis parameter may be provided by the PGW only and it shall be used by the MME/S4-SGSN and the TWAN/ePDG only.\nThe maximum number of APNs, for which the PGW may advertise the Overload Control Information, shall be limited to 10, i.e. the maximum number of occurrences of APNs within and across various instances of the Overload Control Information IE shall be limited to 10 for a given PGW. Hence, if the PGW supports more than 10 APNs, it shall advertise the overload control for at most 10 of the most important APNs. In future, if needed, this limit may be increased to allow the PGW to advertise the overload information for more APNs. In that case, the receiver that does not support the higher limit shall only handle the first 10 APNs and ignore the overload information for the remaining APNs to enable future compatibility.\nNOTE 3:\tConsidering various aspects such as: the processing and storage requirements at the overloaded GTP-C entity and the receiver, the number of important APNs for which overload control advertisement could be necessary, interoperability between the nodes of various vendors, etc. it was decided to define a limit on maximum number of APNs for advertising the overload control information. It was decided to fix this limit to 10 whilst also ensuring that the mechanism exists to extend this limit in future releases, if required.\nIf the PLMN supports the Overload Control feature (see clause 12.3.11), the support, inclusion and handling of the parameters, within overload control information, is summarized in table 12.3.5.1.3-1.\nTable 12.3.5.1.3-1: Parameters of the Overload Control Information\n\nHow often or when the sender includes the overload control information is implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload control information is propagated to the target receivers with an acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the effective overload control protection) is achieved. The following are some of the potential approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI IE:\n-\tthe sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to the given receiver;\n-\tthe sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards the receiver;\n-\tthe sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.\nThe sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a subset of the applicable GTP-C messages.\nThe receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information received in any of the GTP-C messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such reception, shall be able act upon the received information.\nA GTP-C entity may signal one or multiple instances of the OCI IE, each instance providing overload control information for a different scope. The receiver shall handle all these instances, from each of the peer GTP-C entities, by processing, storing and acting upon the same foroverload control. In order to limit the processing of the message on the receiver side and the size of the message, the number of overload control information instances shall be limited:\n-\tat message level: there shall be at most one instance of node-level Overload Control Information IE per node and at most 10 APN-level instances.\n-\tat node level: the maximum number of instances of the OCI IE which may be provided across multiple messages by a given node shall be the same as the maximum number of instances of the OCI IE at message level.\n",

                            "text_content": "As part of the overload mitigation, a GTP-C entity shall reduce the total number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload Control Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the messages in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is called message throttling.\nMessage throttling shall only apply to initial messages. Triggered request or response messages should not be throttled since that would result in the retransmission of the corresponding request message by the sender.\nBefore piggybacking the initial message over a response message, the initial message should be subject to the message throttling in the similar manner as any other non-piggybacked initial message. If the node decides to throttle this initial message then the response message should be sent without any piggyback message.\nA GTP-C entity supporting GTP-C overload control shall support and use the \"Loss\" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.\nAn overloaded GTP-C entity shall ask its peers to reduce the number of requests they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control Information including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage, within the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\", as specified in clause 12.3.5.1.2.1.\nThe recipients of the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\" shall reduce the number of requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an alternate destination if possible (e.g. the Create Session Request message may be redirected to an alternate SGW/PGW), or by failing the request and treating it as if it was rejected by the destination GTP-C entity.\nFor example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would have otherwise been sent to this GTP-C entity.\nThe overloaded GTP-C entity should periodically adjust the requested traffic reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is currently in use, the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level) and the desired system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the rate of the current overall received traffic.\nAnnex D.3.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation of the \"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.\nNOTE 1:\tThis algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic towards the overloaded GTP-C entity will be less than the past traffic but it ensures that the total traffic sent towards the overloaded GTP-C entity is less than what would have been sent without any throttling in place. If after requesting a certain reduction in traffic, the overloaded GTP-C entity receives more traffic than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the worsening rather than an improvement in the overload level, then the overloaded GTP-C entity can request for more reduction in traffic. Thus, by periodically adjusting the requested traffic reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that it receives, approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.\nNOTE 2:\tSince the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput towards the overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the source nodes (depending upon the events generated towards these source nodes by other entities in the network), as a potential increase of traffic from some source nodes can possibly be compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from other source nodes.\nWhen performing message throttling:\n-\tGTP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in 3GPP TS 22.153 [62]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these GTP requests shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic reduction, and the priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling due to GTP overload control up to the point where the requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic;\nNOTE 1:\tFor non-3GPP access, eMPS traffic is determined based on the MPS subscription from the UE USIM as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [63] clause 7.2.2.1 and clause 7.4.1.1 or the MPS subscription for the UE from the HSS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.273 [68] clause 5.1.2.1.2 and clause 7.1.2.1.2.\n-\tfor other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are considered as low priority are considered for throttling before the other messages. The relative priority of the messages may be derived from the relative priority of the procedure for which the message is being sent (as specified in clause 12.3.9.3.2) or may be derived from the session parameters (as specified in clause 12.3.9.3.3).\nNOTE 2:\tA random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages without any special consideration, could result in an overall poor congestion mitigation mechanism and bad user experience.\nAn overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part of the self-protection mechanism (see clause 12.3.10.2.3).\nMessage prioritization may be performed based on the relative priority of the procedure for which the message is being sent. Procedures are grouped into various categories and each of these categories is assigned a priority. Additionally, within a given category of procedures, messages may be further prioritized based on session parameters such as: APN, QCI, ARP and/or LAPI (as described in clause 12.3.9.3.3).\nSubsequently, messages with a high priority shall be given lower preference to throttle and messages with low priority shall be given higher preference to throttle.\nThe grouping of the procedures is not performed based on an individual GTP-C entity but whilst considering all the procedures in general. A GTP-C entity should consider the procedures applicable to it and apply prioritized message throttling based on the category of the procedure, as described below. The categories are listed in decreasing order of priority with category 1 having the highest priority. For each category a non-exhaustive list of messages is provided. Any existing or newly defined message in future should be considered based on the category (as specified below) of the procedure for which the message is sent.\n1.\tUE session mobility within and across 3GPP or non-3GPP access: Procedures involving active or idle mode UE mobility, such that GTP-C signalling is involved, shall be classified under this category. Some examples are X2/S1 based handover with/without an SGW change, TAU/RAU with a change of MME/SGSN with/without an SGW change, 3GPP access to trusted non-3GPP access handover, etc. Throttling of these messages, during the procedures related to UE session mobility, would result in the failure of the corresponding procedures. This could result potentially in the loss of the PDN connection and/or the interruption of the services. Hence, the messages, as identified below, when sent during the procedures belonging to this category, shall be considered with the highest priority and hence, shall be given the lowest preference to throttle.\n-\tCreate Session Request,\n-\tCreate Session Request with \"handover\" indication bit set,\n-\tModify Bearer Request,\n-\tModify Bearer Request with \"handover\" indication bit set,\n-\tModify Access Bearer Request.\n2.\tRelease of PDN connection or bearer resources: Procedures resulting in the deactivation of an existing PDN connection, the deactivation of bearer(s) or of data forwarding tunnel of an UE leads to freeing up of the resources at the overloaded node and hence, can potentially ease the overload situation, since the freed up resources can be used for serving the remaining of the UEs. Thus, the messages belonging to this category resulting in the deactivation of PDN connection or bearer(s) or data forwarding tunnel(s), as identified below, shall be treated with the next lower level of priority and hence shall be given the corresponding preference whilst throttling:\n-\tDelete Session Request,\n-\tDelete Bearer Request,\n-\tDelete Bearer Command,\n-\tDelete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request.\n3.\tMiscellaneous session management procedures: This category shall consist of the session management procedures, except PDN connection creation and bearer creation/modification procedures. Some examples are location reporting, when it is not combined with other mobility procedures, Service request and S1 release procedure. These procedures do not severely impact the on-going service of the UE. Hence, the messages, as identified below, when sent during the procedures identified under this category, shall be treated with the next lower level of priority and hence, shall be given the corresponding preference whilst throttling:\n-\tRelease Access Bearer Request,\n-\tModify Bearer Request,\n-\tChange Notification,\n-\tSuspend Notification,\n-\tResume Notification.\n4.\tRequest for new PDN Connection or bearer resources: Procedures requesting the creation of PDN connection, creation or modification of bearer(s) or creation of data forwarding tunnel shall be classified in this category. Throttling of the messages belonging to this category would result in denial of new services while continuing with the existing services. However, this is the natural outcome of an overload condition, i.e. the overloaded node, due to lack of resources, is not able to provision new services while the trying to maintain the existing services and hence, the messages, as identified below, when sent during the procedures belonging to this category, shall be considered with the lowest level of priority and hence shall be given highest preference to throttle:\n-\tCreate Session Request during PDN connection request,\n-\tCreate Bearer Request,\n-\tUpdate Bearer Request,\n-\tBearer Resource Command,\n-\tModify Bearer Command,\n-\tCreate Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request.\nMessage prioritization may be performed based on the session parameters, such as: APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator (LAPI). The procedures and messages associated with the higher priority sessions shall be given lesser preference whilst throttling, as compared to the procedures and messages associated with the lower priority sessions. Within each group of sessions, the messages may be further prioritized based on the category of the procedure for which the message is being sent (as described in clause 12.3.9.3.2).\nNOTE:\tThis type of prioritization scheme ensures a good handling of all the messages and procedures related to higher priority sessions but can lead to throttle messages related to a critical procedure, e.g. UE mobility, for lower priority sessions over messages related to less critical procedures, e.g. location reporting, for a higher priority session.\nMessage prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when handling incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the relative GTP-C message priority signalled in the GTP-C header (see clauses 5.4 and 5.5).\nA GTP-C entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority in GTP-C signalling within the PLMN and/or across the PLMN boundaries, based on operator policy and roaming agreements. The following requirements shall apply if being used.\nA sending GTP-C entity shall determine the relative message priority to signal in the message according to the principles specified in clause 12.3.9.3.1. If the message affects multiple bearers (e.g. Modify Bearer Request), the relative message priority should be determined considering the highest priority ARP among all the bearers.\nA GTP-C entity should set the same message priority in a Triggered message or Triggered Reply message as received in the corresponding Initial message or Triggered message respectively.\nThe message priority values sent on intra-network interfaces may differ from the values sent on inter-network interfaces. When messages cross PLMN boundaries, the Message Priority in the GTP-C header may be stripped or modified in these messages.\nNOTE :\tThis is to take into account that the priority definitions can vary between PLMNs and avoid messages from a foreign PLMN to gain unwarranted preferential treatment.\nFor incoming GTP-C messages that do not have a message priority in the GTP-C header, the receiving GTP-C entity:\n-\tshall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is an Initial message;\n-\tshould apply the message priority sent in the Initial message or Triggered message, if the incoming message is a Triggered or Triggered Reply message (respectively).\nThis feature should be supported homogenously across the nodes in the network, otherwise an overloaded node will process initial messages received from the non-supporting nodes according to the default priority while initial messages received from supporting nodes will be processed according to the message priority signalled in the GTP-C message.\n",

This is called \"enforcement of overload control\" and it involves throttling of the messages targeted for the overloaded peer.\nA source GTP-C entity should avoid any mechanism resulting in over throttling of the messages. Enforcement of the overload control whilst ensuring that good throughput (i.e. measured in terms of the rate of total number of messages the overloaded GTP-C entity can successfully process) of the network remains consistent to that when no overload control is applied, should be one of the prime objective of the source GTP-C entity.\nNOTE:\tOver throttling of messages would negatively affect end user services and cause potential additional signalling in the network e.g. if the corresponding procedure is retried at a later time.\nEnforcement of overload control requires extra logic and extra processing at the source GTP-C entity. This is an overhead since the source GTP-C entity has to spend its resources in an activity other than processing of the messages. Hence, the implementation as well as the processing complexity of the enforcement of the overload control, should not result in a significantly poorer efficiency of the source GTP-C entity.\nA source GTP-C entity enforcing the overload control cannot ensure that the overloaded peer will not receive more messages than what it can handle during the overload condition, e.g. the \"loss\" algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic reaches perfectly that requested by the overloaded GTP-C entity. Hence, the overloaded target GTP-C entity shall protect itself from the risk of meltdown even in a network where all the sending GTP-C entities support the overload control mechanism. As a part of this self-protection, the overloaded target GTP-C entity may reject the messages which it cannot handle during an overloaded state. A GTP-C entity which decides to not process an incoming request message due to overload should still send a reject response message, if possible, indicating the temporary unavailability of the resources; otherwise the request message may be dropped.\nNOTE:\tWithout a response message, the source GTP-C entity cannot determine whether the request did not reach the target GTP-C entity due to a network error or whether the target GTP-C entity was in overload and not able to process the request and send a response message. This will cause the source GTP-C entity to retransmit the request message and hence will increase further the overload at the target node.\nThe GTP-C entity may apply message prioritization as described in clause 12.3.9.3 when selecting the incoming request messages to be throttled.\nWhile rejecting the message due to overload, the GTP-C entity shall set the cause to \"GTP-C Entity Congestion\" or \"APN congestion\" (for node level or APN level overload respectively) and may include the Overload Control Information in the rejection response as specified in clauses 12.3.5.1.1 and 12.3.11.\nA source GTP-C entity shall enforce overload control for traffic destined to a GTP-C entity in direct contact based on the overload reduction metric received from that peer, e.g. the MME applies the overload control for the messages targeted for the SGW based on the overload information of the SGW.\nFor messages destined to a remote GTP-C entity (i.e. a GTP-C entity not in direct contact but reached via an intermediate GTP-C entity), the source GTP-C entity shall enforce the overload control based on the overload information of the target of the message, as well as the overload information of the intermediate GTP-C entity, e.g. the MME applies the overload control for messages targeted for the PGW based on the overload information of the SGW and PGW.\nFor the received messages, the intermediate GTP-C entity shall not further enforce any overload control and hence, shall not reject any message towards the source GTP-C entity.\nAnnex D.4.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation.\nNOTE 1:\tThis approach ensures the overload protection of the Target as well as Intermediate GTP-C entities.\nNOTE 2:\tThe source GTP-C entity may be connected to the same Target GTP-C entity via multiple different Intermediate GTP-C entities.

            "description": "Handover/Relocation related generic transparent containers are defined in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] (\"Source to Target Transparent Container\" IE and \"Target to Source Transparent Container\" IE) to carry UTRAN, E-UTRAN or GERAN specific information via CN interfaces in a RAT-agnostic way.\nThe encoding of these handover/relocation related generic transparent containers is different in RANAP and S1-AP. See 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] Annex C. The difference is that the \"Source to Target Transparent Container\" IE and \"Target to Source Transparent Container\" IE are ASN.1 encoded over RANAP as \"IE-ID||criticality||OT-LI||octets\" (i.e. one length field only for the open type field) and over S1AP as \"IE-ID||criticality||OT-LI||OCT-LI||octets\" (i.e. with 2 length fields, one for the open type field (\"OT-LI\"), one for the octet string encoding (\"OCT-LI\")), while \"octets\" contain the actual RAT specific handover/relocation information.\nThis gives the following chain of encodings (represented in the notation introduced in the Notes above) end-to-end.\nLTE to LTE\n\nThe figure depicts the encoding of generic transparent containers in LTE, illustrating the process of converting data into a format that can be transmitted over the airwaves. The figure shows the various steps involved in the encoding process, including the use of different types of containers, the encoding algorithm, and the transmission of the encoded data. This figure is crucial for understanding the encoding process in LTE and its impact on data transmission efficiency.\nFigure B.2-1: LTE to LTE - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers\nIn the case of LTE-LTE handover, the \"octets\" contain the \"Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container\" (defined as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE in 3GPP TS 36.413[10]).\nThe source MME, after decoding the HO REQUIRED message of S1AP, passes transparently the \"sequence\" to the target MME.\nThe target MME encodes similarly at target side with the same definitions: it feeds the received \"sequence\" into the S1AP ASN.1 encoder in order to encode the HO REQUEST message towards the target eNB. The \"sequence\" is then extracted from the S1AP ASN.1 of eNB and given to application part of eNB.\n\nLTE to 3G\n\nThe figure depicts the encoding of generic transparent containers in the LTE to 3G transition, illustrating the process of converting the data into a format that can be transmitted over the airwaves. The figure shows the use of transparent containers, which are used to encapsulate the data and ensure that it is transmitted without any loss of information. The encoding process is crucial for ensuring the quality of the transmitted data and for meeting the requirements of the 3G standard.\nFigure B.2-2: LTE to 3G - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers\nAt source side, the same encoding is done but for LTE to 3G handover, this time the \"octets\" on the line is the \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\" (encoded according to the target system RANAP i.e. as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33]).\nAgain the source MME passes transparently the \"sequence\" to the target MME i.e. the \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\".\nAt the target side, the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message was not upgraded: the \"sequence\" received from the Gn or S3 interface (\"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\") is not encoded as an OCTET STRING as on S1, but directly represent the \"Source To Target Transparent Container\" within the RANAP:RELOCATION REQUEST message, which in case of inter-RAT handover to 3G represent the \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\", transported on the Iu interface as the \"IE\" part of the \"IE container\". There is no additional length field added as on the S1 interface (\"OCT-LI\").\nThe target side remains therefore fully backwards compatible with UMTS release 7.\n3G to LTE\n\nFigure B.2-3 illustrates the encoding of generic transparent containers in the transition from 3G to LTE. The figure shows the process of converting the data into a format that can be transmitted over the airwaves, with the use of transparent containers. This is an essential step in the evolution of mobile communication systems, enabling the efficient transmission of data over long distances.\nFigure B.2-3: 3G to LTE - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers\nThe RELOCATION REQUIRED message was upgraded from release 8 onwards renaming the previously contained \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\" to \"Source to Target Transparent Container\", being able to transport also a \"Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container\".\nDespite being defined as an octet string, in order to not impact the R7 SGSN, the octet string was specified as \"to be replaced\" by either the UTRAN or E-UTRAN specific container. This fact is explained e.g. within the NOTE in the ASN.1 of 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] ], as shown in this excerpt:\nSource-ToTarget-TransparentContainer ::= OCTET STRING\n-- This IE is a transparent container, the IE shall be encoded not as an OCTET STRING but according to the type specifications of the target system.\n-- Note: In the current version of this specification, this IE may either carry the Source RNC to\n-- Target RNC Transparent Container or the Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container IE as\n-- defined in [49]\n\nBy so doing, the Release 7 source SGSN receives only one length field (the \"OT-LI\") instead of two (the \"OT-LI and the \"OCT-LI\") as if it would receive an \"Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container\" from a Release 7 RNC, ensuring fully Release 7 backwards compatibility as requested by 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] Annex D. This is illustrated in Figure B.1-3 above.\nAs explained above, this Release 7 backwards compatibility constraint only applies to RANAP to cope with Release 7 SGSN nodes and does NOT apply to LTE. This is why the note is NOT present in the ASN.1 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] for LTE i.e. the S1AP octet string does not need \"to be replaced\".\nThen \"sequence\" is passed transparently to the target MME. The target MME encodes the \"sequence\" within an OCTET STRING resulting in two length fields as expected by target eNB ASN.1 S1AP decoder.\n",

For example, the source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for each message which is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10% throttling, messages with a random number 10 or less are throttled and hence this achieves approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic. The actual traffic reduction might vary slightly from the requested percentage, albeit by an insignificant amount.\nThe algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of dropping the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in traffic conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For example, in the 50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority messages, 20% reduction to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high priority messages need to be applied in order to achieve the effective reduction in traffic by 10% towards the overloaded node.\n",
