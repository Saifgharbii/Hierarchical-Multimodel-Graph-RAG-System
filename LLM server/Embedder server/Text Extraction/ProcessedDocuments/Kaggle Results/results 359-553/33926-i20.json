                    "text_content": "A 3GPP generic network product class defines a set of functions that are implemented on that product, which includes, but not limited to minimum set of common 3GPP functions for that product covered in 3GPP specifications, other functions not covered by 3GPP specifications, as well as interfaces to access that product. A generic network product also includes hardware, software, and OS components that the product is implemented on. The current document describes the threats and the critical assets in the course of developing 3GPP security assurance specifications for a particular network product class.\nApplicability of the GNP security assurance specification to products: Assume a telecom equipment vendor wants to sell a product to an operator, and the latter is interested in following the Security Assurance Methodology as described in TR 33.916[2], then, before evaluation according to TR 33.916[2] in a testing laboratory can start, it first needs to be determined which security assurance specifications written by 3GPP apply to the given product.\nEach 3GPP Network Product, is basically a device composed of hardware (e.g. chip, processors, RAM, network cards), software (e.g. operating system, drivers, applications, services, protocols), and interfaces (e.g. console interfaces and O&M interfaces) that allow the 3GPP network product to be managed and configured locally and/or remotely A GNP is a 3GPP network product.\nGNP Security Assurance Specification (GNP SCAS): The GNP SCAS provides a description of the security requirements (which are including test cases) pertaining to that generic network product class.\nNeed for a GNP network product model: This minimum set of functions listed in clause 4.2 is exclusively meant as a membership criterion for the GNP Class. It is not meant to restrict the functionality of a GNP, or the scope of the present document in any way. On the contrary, it is clear that GNPs will contain many more functions than those from the minimum set listed in clause 4.2, and the GNP will contain requirements relating to functions not contained in this minimum set. Some of these functions, beyond the minimum set, can be found from various 3GPP specifications, but by far not all these functions. This implies that there is a need to describe the functions that cannot be found from 3GPP specifications in some other way before the GNP can be written so that the GNP can make reference to this description. This description is the GNP model, cf. clause 4.3.\nEXAMPLE 1: \t3GPP specifications do not describe a local management interface, but the GNP will have to take it into account, so a local management interface needs to be part of an GNP model.\nEXAMPLE 2: \tThe GNP sometimes says e.g.: \"Authentication events on the local management interface shall be logged.\" This implies the presence of a logging function. The logging function is not part of the defining minimum set of functions from clause 4.2. If a product implements this minimum set, but no logging function, then this just means that the product is a GNP, but will fail the evaluation against the GNP SCAS.\nThe GNP model is further used in clauses 5 and 6 in various ways, e.g. the critical assets can point to parts of the GNP model, threats and requirements can refer to interfaces shown in the GNP model, etc.\n",

This common set is defined to be the list of functions contained in pertinent 3GPP specifications, such as clause 4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], Release 8 [3].\nNOTE: \tThe reason why the definition of the common set of functions refers to a particular Release 8 version of TS 23.401 [3], contrary to what is customary in 3GPP when referencing other 3GPP specifications, is that a Security Assurance Specification is to avoid having a moving target when defining a network product class. Nevertheless, the set of functions in clause 4.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401, Release 8 [3] is expected to be stable, as only FASMO corrections are allowed to Release 8. Furthermore, this set is believed to be minimal, i.e. implemented by all network products, which may not be true for the corresponding set of functions from later releases of TS 23.401 [3]. For the description of these functions compliance with TS 23.401 Release 8 [3] later version is allowed as, obviously, a generic network product should still remain a member of the GNP class when it implements a FASMO correction to Release 8.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Threat analysis is an important step in the SCAS methodology in order to justify a proposed requirement and ensuring that no relevant requirements have been forgotten.\nIn particular, to ensure this latter point, the threat analysis needs to be free of gaps and overlapping, and it needs to be ensured that all relevant threats are covered by a requirement.\nTo resolve the overlapping, it is suggested to first look at the action used to exploit the threat being considered. For example if passwords are stored locally in the GNP (e.g. in a database or file system) in an insecure way (e.g. clear text, unsalted hashes), an attacker can retrieve these passwords (e.g. can retrieve the file containing them and can retrieved them by means of brute forcing if  unsalted hashes are used) and later use them. So the threat related to this scenario is Information Disclosure.\nTo achieve this goal, the identified threats are grouped into the seven categories, one covering threats relating to 3GPP-defined interfaces and the other six ones corresponding to the categories proposed by STRIDE [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee823878(v=cs.20).aspx] and reported below:\n-\tSpoofing identity. An example of identity spoofing is illegally accessing and then using another user's authentication information, such as username and password.\n-\tTampering with data. Data tampering involves the malicious modification of data. Examples include unauthorized changes made to persistent data, such as that held in a database, and the alteration of data as it flows between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet.\n-\tRepudiation. Repudiation threats are associated with users who deny performing an action without other parties having any way to prove otherwise. For example, a user performs an illegal operation in a system that lacks the ability to trace the prohibited operations. Non-repudiation refers to the ability of a system to counter repudiation threats. For example, a user who purchases an item might have to sign for the item upon receipt. The vendor can then use the signed receipt as evidence that the user did receive the package.\n-\tInformation disclosure. Information disclosure threats involve the exposure of information to individuals who are not supposed to have access to it. For example, the ability of users to read a file that they were not granted access to, or the ability of an intruder to read data in transit between two computers.\n-\tDenial of service. Denial of service (DoS) attacks deny service to valid users-for example, by making a Web server temporarily unavailable or unusable. You need to protect against certain types of DoS threats simply to improve system availability and reliability.\n-\tElevation of privilege. In this type of threat, an unprivileged user gains privileged access and thereby has sufficient access to compromise or destroy the entire system. Elevation of privilege threats include those situations in which an attacker has effectively penetrated all system defenses and become part of the trusted system itself, a dangerous situation indeed.\nAll the reported threats follow the below template:\n-\tThreat Name: i.e. The name of the threat\n-\tThreat Category: i.e. of the six STRIDE categories\n-\tThreat Description: i.e. description of how the threat can be exploited and eventually the impacts/consequences of its exploitation\n-\tThreatened Asset: e.g. which asset is affected by the threat\n",

So, an attacker can eavesdrop network traffic, for example, on the management/maintenance interfaces to retrieve credentials which can be used to spoof user identity. Eavesdropping can be performed, e.g. by means of MITM attacks.

Leakage of these user's identities can lead to loss of privacy, e.g. tracing of a user. Protection of user's identities is also a requirement from regulators.\n-\tThreatened Asset: Mobility Management data (e.g. user identities).\n-\tThreat Name: Insecure Default Configuration\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: An attacker could exploit an insecure default GNP configuration and access to sensitive information/data available on the GNP.\nFor example a default GNP can use NULL integrity not only for unauthenticated emergency calls. This can compromise the integrity of RRC signalling and make possible Man in the Middle attacks in the AS domain and interception, for example, of user communications.\nThreatened Asset: GNP configuration data and mobility management data.\n-\tThreat name: File/Directory Read Permissions Misuse\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure, elevation of privilege, DoS, tampering\n-\tThreat Description: File and directory read permissions which are far too liberal can allow access to the contained data by illegitimate users (e.g. password files with too liberal file permissions can be accessed by unauthorized users).\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2, except hardware assets\n-\tThreat name: Insecure Network Services\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: The GNP can expose insecure/vulnerable services/open ports which can be exploited by an attacker to gain sensitive information/data. For example the GNP can be configured to return sensitive information using telnet on a custom port without any authentication mechanism  being configured.\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2, except hardware assets\n-\tThreat name: Unnecessary Services\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: The GNP can expose unnecessary services which can be exploited (even if not vulnerable) by an attacker to gain sensitive information/data.\nThe term unnecessary used in this threat refers to three cases:\n-\tNetwork service not strictly related to GNP operation (e.g. Splunk Service)\n-\tNetwork service available on unexpected interfaces (e.g. SSH enabled on the interface interconnecting GNP and Remote Management)\n-\tService that does not enable a network service but that runs on the GNP and  is not necessary by GNP normal operation (e.g. fprint service available in the default fedora distribution or Xinetd services).\nThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2, except hardware assets\n-\tThreat name: Log Disclosure\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: When operational activities are recorded by GNP, these operation records are called system logs. There are other logs, e.g. operation log, security log. These logs can contain sensitive information/data (e.g. system data, user data, CDR, or also debugging information) which can be accessed by an attacker to gather information about the system and to perform other attacks towards users or the system itself.\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2, except hardware assets\nThreat name: Unnecessary Applications\nThreat Category: Information Disclosure\nThreat Description: There are applications (i.e. features and functionalities) in the GNP which can be related to personal privacy (e.g. LCS application). Even if an operator does not deploy these features and functionalities, they can be available in the system as part of a software distribution. Consequently there might be the risk that an attacker enables these applications without  authorization (e.g. despite of what is included in the license issued by the vendor). For example, the attacker may enable a feature such as LCS and get the location information of a user.\nThreatened Asset: personal privacy related features, functions and applications, e.g. LCS.\n-\tThreat name: Eavesdropping\n-\tThreat Category: Information Disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: An attacker can eavesdrop network traffic, for example, on the management/maintenance interfaces. This may be possible if weak cryptographic protocols or non-industry standard cryptographic algorithms are used or if the communication protocols are implemented incorrectly. Eavesdropping can be performed, for example, by means of MITM attacks, Arp Poisoning, ICMP Redirect and so on.\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2\n-\tThreat name: Security threat caused by lack of GNP traffic isolation\n-\tThreat Category: Information disclosure\n-\tThreat Description: The attack towards signalling traffic can also impact the management traffic and vice versa when these traffics are not isolated. For example, an attacker wants to obtain important information related to signalling, he can intercept and capture signalling traffic on GNP's interface. The important information related management may also be intercepted and captured if the management traffics and signalling traffics are not isolated and use the same physical interface. So the security threats for signalling traffic can impact management traffic and result in unauthorized access on GNP. In the same way, an attacker who attacks GNP's management traffics can obtain important information related signalling,  resulting in tampering and privacy leakage of signalling.\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical data transferred via the GNP as listed in clause 5.2\n\n",

The resources on the GNP (e.g. processing resources or radio resources) can be exhausted and the GNP becomes unable to process other, valid NAS signalling requests.\n-\tThreatened Asset: GNP resources (e.g. system processing capacity (e.g. CPU, memory), network links, radio links and so on).\n-\tThreat Name: Implementation Flaw.\n-\tThreat Category: DoS.\n-\tThreat Description: An attacker can exploit an implementation flaw in one of the protocols supported by a GNP or in one application available on the GNP and cause a DoS.\n-\tThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2, except hardware assets.\n-\tThreat name: Insecure Network Services.\n-\tThreat Category: DoS.\n-\tThreat Description: The GNP can expose insecure/vulnerable services/open ports which can be exploited by an attacker to crash the GNP.\n-\tThreatened Asset: GNP services.\nThreat name: Human Error\nThreat Category: Denial of service\nThreat Description: The general threat of human error in operation and maintenance. This can include network-, network element-, and firewall configuration-settings. It can also include the risk of user accounts being forgotten during change or deletion, or other slips in their handlings. Causes can be maintenance workload, fatigue, inexperience, etc., and may arise irrespective of applied policy. This threat, for network operation, is hard to categorize within the STRIDE approach, but with Denial of service being one important threat category.\nThreatened Asset: all critical assets of GNP as listed in clause 5.2, except hardware assets.\n",

An attacker can for example try to leverage a bug in the running program and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n. \tThreatened Asset: Over-Privileged Processes/Services.\n-\tThreat Name: Folder Write Permission Abuse\n-\tThreat Category: Elevation of Privilege\n-\tThreat Description: weaknesses in folder permissions can lead to elevation of privilege. A root user by mistake can accidentally execute malicious files placed into a directory by attackers which have sufficient write permissions. The same applies for other directories where users other than root have write permission. Any account that has folder permission on a directory has equivalent access to the executable file within that directory. These permissions allow a non-administrator to replace directories containing executable files with new directories containing new executable files or simply to delete directories and the executable files they contain.\n-\tThreatened Asset: System folders with weak write permission.\n-\tThreat Name: Root-Owned File Write Permission Abuse.\n-\tThreat Category: Elevation of Privilege.\n-\tThreat Description. Failure to protect root-owned executables files from write access by non-administrators exposes them to the possibility of being compromised. For example, this means that non-administrator users can replace or alter the file's contents and that unknown or malicious injected code can then be executed inadvertently by root.\n-\tThreatened Asset: Root-Owned Files with weak write permission.\n-\tThreat name: High-privileged files.\n-\tThreat Category: Elevation of Privilege, DoS, tampering.\n-\tThreat Description: If files can be run with higher privileges that what the owner normally has, i.e. with temporarily elevated rights, it can be dangerous to system.\n-\tThreatened Asset: High privileged files.\n-\tThreat name: Insecure Network Services.\n-\tThreat Category: Elevation of Privilege.\n-\tThreat Description: The GNP can expose insecure/vulnerable services/open ports which can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access, for example using telnet on a custom port without any authentication mechanism configured.\n-\tThreatened Asset: Insecure network services/ports.\n-\tThreat name: Unnecessary Network Services\n-\tThreat category: Elevation of Privilege, Denial of Service\n-\tThreat Description: The GNP can expose unnecessary services/open ports which can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access thus leading to elevation of privilege.

Further, these parsers may include resources external to the received JSON object itself, such as files from the NF’s filesystem or other resources loaded externally.

It should be noted that encoding from the NAS to the NGAP protocol in this case is not a one-to-one copy of the UE 5G security capabilities but must consider the specifics of the NGAP protocol.  Specifically, four bits are available to the encoder at the NAS layer for NIA0, NIA1, NIA2, NIA3, while only three bits are available at the NGAP layer for these four algorithms.

Then, weaker security algorithms may be selected, which will make the system easily attacked. Tampering the SPI will cause the negotiated SA cannot be indexed. As a result, the following security association fails to be established, leading to Denial of Service attack. The port number is generally used to identify different applications. Tampering the Port_P number by the attacker will cause messages to be sent to the UE or P-CSCF through the tampered port.

After receiving the request to revoke the slice-specific authorization for a slice for a UE from an AAA-S, if NSSAAF does not check whether the AAA-S is legitimate in the sense that it had performed the NSSAA for the slice for the UE, a malicious AAA-S may masquerade as the legitimate AAA-S to invoke the slice-specific authorization for the slice for the UE.
