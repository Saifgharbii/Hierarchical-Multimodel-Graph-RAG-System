It will thus describe the general scheme providing an overview of the entire scheme and explaining how to create and apply the Security Assurance Specifications (SCASs). It will detail the different evaluation tasks (vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management process assessment, Security Compliance Testing, Basic Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis) and the different actors involved. Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis is outside the scope of the present release of SECAM. The present document will help all involved parties to have a clear understanding of the overall process and the covered threats.\nThe concrete security requirements will be part of the Security Assurance Specifications (SCASs) for each network product class and not part of this overall process document. Some of the tasks described in the SECAM scheme are meant to be performed by 3GPP, while other tasks are meant to be performed by the SECAM Accreditation Body. This accreditation body has been agreed to be the GSMA. 3GPP maintains the overall responsibility for the SECAM scheme and creates the SCASs. The SECAM Accreditation Body is tasked to develop requirements on vendor network product development, the network product lifecycle management process, and SECAM-accreditation for vendors and test laboratories, and describe these requirements in separate documents that will complement the present document. The SECAM Accreditation Body defines its own scheme that covers all these tasks.\n",

This entity is the GSMA.\nAssurance: confidence that a network product meets its specific security objectives.\nNOTE 2:\tAssurance is usually verified by performing an evaluation.\nAssurance level: evaluation effort in terms of scope, depth and rigor. For higher assurance level, more information with more details is typically required, and this information will be analysed more rigorously.\nNOTE 3: \tThe \"3GPP Assurance Levels\" have nothing to do with \"Evaluated Assurance Levels\" used in Common Criteria.\nBasic Vulnerability Testing (BVT): The process of running security tools against a network product. \nBVT is defined by the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) security testing tools on the external interfaces of the network product.\nNOTE 4:\tDetails on these tools can be found in clause 7.2.4.\nCertification: confirmation by an independent Certification Authority (CA) that the evaluation has been properly carried out.\nNOTE 5:\tCertification of network products is out of scope for SECAM. However, SECAM does not preclude certification activities for network products which would e.g. complement the Self-declaration step.\nEnhanced Vulnerability Testing (EVA): Evaluation process step described in Clause 7.2.5. This activity takes the output of the earlier Security Compliance Testing (SCT) and Basic Vulnerability Testing (BVT) into account.\nNOTE 6:\tEnhanced Vulnerability Analysis is outside the scope of the present release of SECAM.\nEvaluation report: the output document delivered by the test laboratory for its evaluation task, in which the test procedures, the test results and other related information may be included. For three specific evaluation tasks defined in SECAM (SCT, BVT, EVA), the according output document is SCT report, BVT report, EVA report respectively.\nTest laboratory: enityt that evaluates the network product and produces an evaluation report. The vendor, the operator, GSMA, NVIOT, 3GPP, GCF or some other party, could take the test laboratory role.\nHardening: contributes to the security baseline of a network product, achieved for example by configurations, settings, and protocol restrictions, to decrease the attack surface for a network product. The difference in hardening is one aspect that influences the security baseline of a network product.\nNetwork Product: A network product is the instantiation of one or more network product class(es).\nNetwork Product Class: A network product class, in the context of SECAM, is the class of products that all implements a common set of 3GPP defined functionalities.\nNetwork Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS): the name given to the scheme that will provide an administrative framework for implementation of SECAM for security evaluation of 3GPP compliant network equipment.\nNOTE 7:\tNESAS is a GSMA term but is not used in this document.\nSECAM evaluation: A SECAM evaluation comprises of the Vendor Network Product Development process evaluation, the product lifecycle management process evaluation and the Network Product evaluation.\nSecurity Assurance Specification (SCAS): The SCAS for a given network product class provides a description of the security requirements (which are including test cases) pertaining to that network product class.\nSecurity baseline: The security baseline of an evaluated network product is a set of security requirements and environmental assumptions defining its capacity to resist a given attack potential.\nSecurity Compliance Testing (SCT): Evaluation process step used to describe activities for checking the compliance of a network product with applicable Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS).\nSelf-declaration: Self-declaration is a declaration of the claims made on the network product by the vendor. \nIt means that a vendor provides a self-declaration of its network product based on the evaluation report required by SECAM to the operator without any review of a certification authority of these reports before.\nSelf-evaluation: Self-evaluation is an assessment of the network product by the vendor. It means that the vendor has an accredited evaluation lab in its organization that performs the evaluation of the network product. The evaluation lab assesses the network product against defined criteria and produces an evaluation report according to a formalized and standardized procedure.\nThird-party evaluation: Third-party-evaluation is an assessment of the network product by an independent third-party. It means that a third-party has an accredited evaluation lab that performs the evaluation of the network product. \nThe evaluation lab assesses the network product against defined criteria and produces an evaluation report according to a formalized and standardized procedure. Third-party evaluation is similar to self-evaluation. The only difference is that the party performing the evaluation is different from the vendor.\nVulnerability: An exploitable issue in a network product rendering it unable to withstand attacks. Vulnerabilities create the risk of successful attacks.\nVulnerability Assessment (VA): The process of assessing the output of SCT or BVT activities to classify the found issues by severity in order to identify those which are relevant vulnerabilities.\n",

Accreditation by an external party demonstrates that the actor has the capabilities, skills, and competence to perform their respective tasks.\nThe SECAM Accreditation Body – currently only the GSM Association (GSMA) – covers accreditation and its governance and maintenance and by that complements this 3GPP activity.

                    "text_content": "A 3GPP Network Product can have vulnerabilities which, if exploited, can damage the MNO and/or end-users. In order to understand the potential attack vectors which could be used, the first thing to do is to identify the targets of the analysis. Each 3GPP Network Product, is basically a device composed of hardware (e.g. chip, processors, RAM, network cards), software (e.g. operating system, drivers, applications, services, protocols), and interfaces (e.g. console interfaces and O&M interfaces) that allow the 3GPP network product to be managed and configured locally and/or remotely. All these features can expose the 3GPP network product to several potential security attacks. If the network product is securely implemented, managed and configured then some of these attacks can be prevented. The above mentioned security attacks can exploit different 3GPP network product features/ capabilities.\nThe Security Assurance Specification (SCAS) for a given network product class provides a description of the security requirements and associated test cases pertaining to that network product class. It is assumed that the latest version of the 3GPP Security Assurance documents available at the beginning of a particular instance of an evaluation will be used for 3GPP Security Assurance whatever the 3GPP Release compliance of the other 3GPP functions of the product is. Evaluations performed in the past remain valid, however, even when a new version of the 3GPP Security Assurance documents is published.\nAs pre-requisite for writing a  SCAS, 3GPP defines a complete list of features/capabilities considered to be part of the Network Product Class.\nIn order to achieve the security assured by a SCAS, the network operator needs to ensure that deployment fulfils the environmental assumptions given in the SCAS. The overall process therefore contains the following steps:\n1) 3GPP writes SCAS, which may contain environmental assumptions\n2) Accredited security test laboratories (vendors or third party) evaluate network product according to SCAS, but only the single product in a vendor-documented configuration for SECAM testing, without any considerations on the system or network or environment in a specific deployment. Here SECAM stops.\n3) when the evaluated network product is being deployed, the operator goes back to the environmental assumptions from the SCAS and tests whether they are fulfilled. This validation of environmental assumptions can only be performed during deployment and is needed for security, but is not part of SECAM, because SECAM is about product-testing.\nNOTE 1:\tSome security requirements might be specific to 3GPP features that only exist from a specific 3GPP Release onwards for a given 3GPP Network Product class. The 3GPP SCAS will give clear indication from which Release onwards the test should be applied. The way to give this indication (by grouping Rel-12 specific tests in an annex or by giving indication in the test case as described in clause 5.2.2.1) is outside of the scope of this Technical Report.\nNOTE 2: \tFor features that are standardized in 3GPP specifications, maximum advantage should be taken of existing threat analyses that are available from 3GPP Technical Reports (e.g. TR 33.821 for EPS [4]) or other publications.\n",

The SECAM Accreditation Body's role also includes the handling of the dispute resolution process. GSMA takes this role and will provide a clear delineation between SECAM work in 3GPP and in GSMA.\nEven if it describes the complete process, including evaluation by accredited actors under SECAM Accreditation Body control and Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS) writing, SECAM does not preclude 3GPP SCAS security requirements and tests cases being used directly by mutual consent between vendors and operators without the accreditation process in place if it so desires. This ensures that the 3GPP SECAM work is not held up by delays in deliverables under the responsibility of external bodies, or by conflicting requirements in different countries (e.g. relating to accreditation).\nThe presence of a SECAM Accreditation Body as defined above is highly desirable in order to ensure a wide recognition of evaluation results and to have a working dispute resolution process available.

If there are any regulatory requirements on security assurance of the network product, they will for the purpose of this process model be considered being included in the acceptance requirements of the operator.\nWhen a vendor is ready to provide security assurance w.r.t. a given network product, the vendor obtains one or more Security Assurance Specifications (SCASs) that the network product is aiming to fulfil. Choice of which SCASs to select may depend on operator and/or regulatory input. Then the product is evaluated against the Security Assurance Specification(s). The evaluation results in an evaluation report.\nOnce the operator received the evaluation report, the operator then decides if the results are sufficient according to its internal policies and whether to accept the security assurance level of the network product or not. The operator's acceptance decision may depend on external forces such as regulatory requirements.\nThe SECAM defined Security assurance process is depicted in Figure 4.5-1, illustrating the steps taken to ensure the security of a communication system.

However it is expected that different product class are confronted by different attacker models, and have consequently to undergo different levels of rigour or depth of evaluation.\nSECAM consequently considers only one assurance level per network product class.\n",

On a high level, the process of writing SCAS documents for a given network product class follows these steps:\n-\tDescribe and model the network product class \nThe network product class is described and modelled to a sufficiently detailed level so as to ensure that the security requirements can clearly describe what data and functions are intended to be protected and which functionalities are required. This modelling will be used as an input document for the following Security Problem Definition.\n-\tDefine the security problem \nBy identifying which assets in the model of the network product class require protection and how these assets can be exploited by an attacker. The security problem definition also contains the security objectives of the network product class under analysis (i.e. which assets require what type of protection), and defines an attacker potential the network product class is supposed to resist. This step also contains the threat analysis employed to understand how an attacker performing the identified potential attacks may misuse the identified assets of the network product class. This provides a concrete security problem that is to be solved, which allows the selection of security requirements that are necessary and sufficient to solve the identified security problem. This material will be contained in a 3GPP Technical Report of the 900-series.\n-\tIdentify the security requirements and test cases\nSecurity requirements are derived from the security problem definition. The fulfilment of these requirements ensures that the security objectives can be reached. Catalogues of security requirements and security requirement categories that have been used by operators in practice will be used as a starting point to help 3GPP in writing complete requirements. \nThese requirements can and will be modified and adapted as seen necessary by 3GPP.\nIn addition, if requirements, or terminology used to specify the requirements, are not clear or consistent there is an increased risk of different understanding of the requirements and this may unnecessarily result in heavy use of the dispute resolution process. For example if a requirement applies on the \"management traffic\", a clear definition on what the \"management traffic\" consist of would be needed. This could be in particular a difficulty for tests that consist of verifying whether a requirement is fulfilled by examining documentation and making a decision on whether the designed mechanism or used process fulfils the requirement; such tests are a judgment call and can be called differently by different parties.\nThe consistency of the requirements format is ensured by the template for a security requirement described in clause 5.2.3.3.\nFor each security requirement 3GPP will define a test case.\n-\tVerify the Security Requirements\nOnce the security requirements have been identified it is verified that the security objectives are met by these security requirements, and that every security requirement contributes to defending an identified security objective. If any mismatch is found (e.g. security objective not covered with the existing security requirements or security requirements which do not resolve any security objectives), the list of security requirements is updated accordingly by removing or adding security requirements.\n",

In particular, threat analyses related to the security requirements in 3GPP TSs to be re-used in SCAS, see clause 5.2.3.2, need not be repeated in SCAS. These were however written before e.g. current SCAS type of work objectives came to light.\nNOTE 2:\tFor features that are (to some degree) proprietary and, hence, not (fully) standardized, a way of describing them in a general way needs to be found as, by their nature, no common understanding is generally available to the public. Without a general description of a feature, it may be difficult to perform a threat and risk analysis on it.\nNOTE 3\tTo ensure consistency across threats and security objectives the following set of guidelines should be applied when analysing proposed threat and security objectives.\n-\tThreat descriptions should avoid including security objectives or requirements or countermeasure implementation details.\n-\tCheck if there is an existing threat in a 3GPP TR of the 900-series before attempting to create a new one. For example a variant of an existing threat could be created.\n-\tAttempt to map the threat to one of the existing threat categories before creating a new threat category.\n-\tDetails in the threat description should indicate if the threat is a high level threat (refers to several attack components) or a detailed threat (refers to a specific attack component).\n-\tAttempt to map the threat to one of the existing security objectives before creating a new security objective.\n-\tAll requirements should map to one or more threats.\n-\tAll requirements should map to one or more security objectives.\n-\tIt should be clear from the text in the requirement description field that the requirement is a detailed specific requirement (which has its own test case(s)) or is a high level requirement (e.g. conformance to industry best practices) which has multiple test cases.\n-\tA new threat, threat category, or security objective should be included only after 3GPP determined that sufficient rationale was provided.\nThere are many threat and risks analysis or modelling frameworks available for IT equipment and computers networks. None of them provided a perfect fit for the needs of SECAM whose ultimate goal is to be capable to derive concrete and testable security requirements to reduce the level of exposure of telecom equipment.\nThis process is likely to be iterative and there will be some trade-off in terms of time. It is not a goal to be absolutely complete in the threats assessment. What ultimately matters in the threat analysis phase is that 3GPP determines that the achieved level of details is good enough to be able to easily derive testable security requirements to cover the risks in a reasonable amount of time.\nThe structure for a threat description is provided here to indicate the information needed for having a clear security problem definition. This can help to facilitate the identification of the security requirements. Hereafter a possible structure for the threats, risks and security objectives which are part of the SPD is reported. This structure will be related to the threat modelling framework used for the analysis and consequently this proposal could be changed accordingly:\n-\tThreat Name: each threat is assigned a unique name. The name preferably indicates the topics covered by the threat.\n-\tThreat Reference: a unique short form is assigned to each threat as a primary means for referencing the threat. The convention adopted is: <threat category> - <progressive number> where the convention adopted for the \"threat category\" can be the first two letters of the category to which the threat belongs or similar.-\n-\tThreat Category: a reference to the category to which the threat belong based on the classification (threat methodology) that will be adopted.\n-\tThreatened Asset: an indication of the network product assets that are object of the threat.\n-\tThreat Description: the adverse actions that can be performed by a threat agent on an asset. These actions influence one or more properties of the asset from which that asset derives its value. Examples of threat agents are hackers, users, computer processes, and accidents. Threat agents, and their level, may be further described by aspects such as expertise, resources, opportunity and motivation. To provide a basis for requirements that are on roughly the same level, 3GPP chooses a level of threat agents that the system should be able to withstand (although the levels may be hard to quantify or measure). Protection mechanisms or requirements then are not selected if a threat can be instantiated only by a threat agent of higher level. This is in line with the single assurance level and single security baseline per network product class of clause 4.\n-\tThreat relevance: the threat relevance (Mitigate, Accept, and Transfer).\nFurther details are given in 33.926 [6].\n",

These countermeasures will take the form of either:\n-\tsecurity requirements on the network product with associated test cases; or\n-\toperational environment security assumptions for a given product class.\nThe Security Requirements clauses within the the pertinent 3GPP TS contain the security requirements identified according to the threats (see figure 5.2.3.1-1).\nThe figure depicts a process for deriving security requirements in a SCAS document, illustrating the steps involved in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. The figure includes a flowchart with various stages, such as data collection, analysis, and decision-making, which are crucial for the development of a secure SCAS document.\nFigure 5.2.3.1-1: Process for deriving security requirements in a SCAS document\nThe security requirements will include security functional requirements as well as hardening requirements and basic vulnerability testing requirements. The security functional requirements are ensuring the existence of security functionalities in the network products in order to achieve security objectives (e.g. 3GPP functional requirements). The hardening requirements are either ensuring the absence of unneeded or insecure functionality, or impose a restriction on a function forcing it to behave in a more secure way. The basic vulnerability testing requirements specify the areas to be subjected to basic vulnerability testing.\nThe purpose of hardening is to reduce the attack surface and security vulnerability of the network product and to ensure that security functions of the network product cannot be bypassed. SECAM will specify hardening requirements that should be part of the evaluation. Those requirements are only intended to reduce the attack surface rather than directly related to a security function. All security requirements, those related to a specific security function as well as those related to the reduction of the attack surface and basic vulnerability testing requirements, will be treated on the same footing and the text of clause 5.2.3.3 applies to all \"types\" of requirements. Their evaluation will be based on the tests cases of the SCAS. In any case, hardening requirements imply that they are implemented before evaluation through test cases. Hardening requirements should be formulated generic enough, or in different variants, to be applicable for a variety of anticipated operating systems and applications. Hardening is needed to let network products achieve the given security baseline and assurance level, alongside with other security requirements.\nHardening can be the removal of services, protocols, ports, etc. in order to reduce known security vulnerabilities and minimize the risk in an existing but unneeded functionality. An example of hardening is to remove unnecessary services of general purpose software used in a specific context. It can also be a physical action like removing unneeded USB ports. An example of such a requirement is provided at the end of clause 5.2.3.3.\nSECAM security requirements represent the common agreement of operators and vendors on what has to be implemented for a given network product class to achieve the required security baseline. All those requirements (including operator's initialization and configuration requirements which have been channelled through the relevant SECAM standardization processes) have to be taken into account from the beginning of the development and design phase of the network product as well as in subsequent updates of the network product. This will ensure that network products will be developed in a way that:\na)\tMaximizes their likelihood to pass SECAM evaluation.\nb)\tThey operate correctly and securely when deployed in operator's networks.\nc)\tAvoids costly patching cycle to ensure a) and b).\nSecurity requirements can be specified in different levels of detail, with a tradeoff between precision of the requirement and its general applicability.\nDetail Level 1:\tSecurity requirements of general system-independent nature: What needs to be secured?\nExample: data storage in general\nDetail Level 2:\tSecurity requirements that are system-specific but still product-independent: What needs to be secured, for this system type?\nExample: data storage in databases\nDetail Level 3:\tProduct-specific security requirements: How does this specific product need to be secured?\nExample: data storage in an Oracle database Vx.y\nIn order to ensure consistency between all requirements in a SCAS, every requirement of detail level 2 or 3 should be derived from a generic level 1 requirement or security objective.\nIn general, requirements on detail level 3 should be avoided in a SCAS because that would limit direct applicability of a SCAS for some network products.\nIn figure 5.2.3.1-1, 3GPP specifications represent an input for both SPD and security requirements definition, where the latter includes test case definition. The reason for this assumption is that 3GPP security specifications (e.g. TS 33.401 [2]) already contain several security objectives and related security functional requirements which 3GPP identified when designing UMTS and LTE. When looking at such type of security functional requirements, they can be grouped into three categories:\n1)\tSecurity functional requirements related to protocols and behaviours necessary for secure interoperability between nodes from different vendors that require a certain positive behaviour of a 3GPP function. \nFor example, the security functional requirement \" the MME sends to the USIM via ME the random challenge  and an authentication token AUTN for network authentication from the selected authentication vector. \" retrieved from TS 33.401 [2], belongs to this category.\n2)\tSecurity functional requirements related to protocols and behaviours necessary for secure interoperability between nodes from different vendors that require that a 3GPP function does not perform a certain action. \nFor example, the security functional requirement \" Access to E-UTRAN with a 2G SIM or a SIM application on a UICC shall not be granted \" retrieved from TS 33.401 [2] belongs to this category.\n3)\tSecurity functional requirements not related to protocols or behaviours necessary for secure interoperability between nodes from different vendors, but rather dealing with security features which are supported by the network products and consequently strictly related to their implementation. \nFor example, the security functional requirements specified in clause 5.3 of TS 33.401 [2] for eNBs and in annex I of TS 33.102 [5] for RNCs in exposed locations belong to this category.\nThe security functional requirements in the first group are already covered by the interoperability and conformance testing and SECAM documents do not repeat these requirements or add tests for them.\nThe security functional requirements in the second category may not be covered by the interoperability and conformance testing. In this case a SCAS document may contain a reference to these requirements with the related test cases which verify that the network products adhere to the security functional requirements. As an example, security functional requirements for the MME in the second category are collected in TS 33.116.\nThe security functional requirements in the third category are within the scope of SECAM and they will be taken into account by the security requirements for the compliance testing. However, for some network product classes, e.g. the MME, there are no requirements in the third category.\nA security compliance requirement in a SCAS that references a 3GPP TS refers to the corresponding TS security functional requirement and also contains a test description how to verify the correct implementation of the described security functional requirements.\nSECAM does not provide stand-alone security assurance requirements. Instead, SECAM provides a test case for every security requirement.\nA SECAM Catalogue of General Security Assurance Requirements and associated test cases is provided because several network product classes will share very similar if not identical security requirements for some aspects. This catalogue therefore allows to maximize the reuse of already written requirements. This approach matches the requirement that a SCAS will have to be developed in a modular fashion such that an individual module is generic enough to be applied to more than one network product class. This approach can help to prevent from writing the same security requirements from scratch several times in different network product class SCAS (see clause 4 of the present document).\nIt is important to underline that the 3GPP catalogue is constructed while working on SCASs for specific network product classes, and the intention is not to first create the catalogue in an abstract way and then write the first SCAS based on it. No requirements is included in the catalogue before it has been found useful for a specific network product class. This prevents the catalogue from accumulating \"good-to-have\" requirements that are never used by specific network product classes. Consequently, the way to build the proposed catalogue is an iterative process that counts the following steps:\n1)\tStart the normative phase for a specific Network Product Class (e.g. MME).\n2)\tSelect from the identified sources the proper security requirements that meet the needs of the security objectives and adapt them to SECAM.\n3)\tAdd this adapted requirements in the SECAM catalogue in order to reuse if possible during the normative phase of other Network Product Classes.\n4)\tStart the normative phase of another Network Product Class (e.g. eNB) and refer to the security requirements already available in the SECAM catalogue if possible otherwise select the new ones from the agreed sources and update the Catalogue.\nSecurity requirements are expected to follow a template similar to the one described hereafter:\nTemplate for a Security Requirement Description\nStatements of security requirements are intended to be clear, concise and unambiguous. In particular, each security requirement includes:\n-\tRequirement name: each security requirement is assigned a unique name. The name indicates the topics covered by the requirement:\n-\tRequirement reference: a unique short form of the security requirement is provided as a primary means for referencing the class. The convention adopted is: < requirement class reference> - <the first two letter of requirement name> or similar convention.\n-\tRequirement Description: a detailed description for the security requirements identified by 3GPP to reduce/counteract the risks outlined by the threat analysis.\n-\tSecurity Objective references: a list of the short identifiers assigned to the Security Objectives achieved through fulfilling this requirement.\n-\tTest case: a description of the test case that defines how the requirement is tested, the expected skills and tools to be used to produce the test outputs.\nNOTE 1:\tThe level of abstraction that should be chosen for test cases should allow implementation specific solution as long as they comply with the SCAS intention. This level of details is likely to be variable depending on the test. This work is to be done during the normative phase.\nNOTE 2:\tTests can consist of different types of activities. It could for example consist in reviewing documentation provided by the vendor for a given security requirement but also be of a more technical nature that will imply interaction and stimulation of the network product with a protocol testing tool for example. The concrete test activities will be defined in the normative phase.\n\nExample of an \"hardening type\" security requirement:\nHardening requirements can also help to make the software/hardware of a network product more robust against un-authorized remote or physical access and can be tested as shown in the following example:\n-\tRequirement name: Unauthenticated services binding:\n-\tRequirement reference: HARDENING_BINDING.1.1.\n-\tRequirement Description: No unauthenticated services shall be bound to physically accessible ports of the network product. Unauthenticated service running on the network product and bound to physically accessible ports, even if not security related, can be used by an attacker to gain connectivity on the network product. The attacker could then try to escalate their privileges to further compromise the network product. No unauthenticated service shall be bound to physically accessible ports.\n-\tSecurity Objective references or more general level requirement: SO-1, SO-2, SO-3.\n-\tTest case:\n-\tReview the documentation provided by the vendor describing the physically accessible ports and the services bound to them.\n-\tDocument in the report the services listening on each physically accessible port and the type of credential required for access.\n-\tConnect to all documented services and check that authentication is required.\n-\tConnect on each physically accessible port and run an appropriate scan to detect listening services on all relevant OSI layers and check whether non documented services are listening and accessible.\nor where remote scanning results are not meaningful like e.g. in case of UDP, use appropriate in-host tools to verify that only documented services are listening and accessible on the physically accessible port.\nApplicability of a hardening requirement may depend on the OS or application running on the network product. E.g. in case the hardening requires removal of all non-public-key based authentication:\n-\tVendor A has implemented this by running the COTS component OpenSSH. Hardening for this authentication function includes e.g. disabling password based login.\n-\tVendor B implements this by a proprietary protocol with public and private keys, i.e. a non-COTS component. Hardening for this authentication function includes e.g. ensuring that password based authentication is not implemented or disabled.\nWhat ultimately matters for the SECAM evaluation (compliance and vulnerability) is that the network products fulfil the security requirement (functional and hardening) and pass the related test cases, not what method was applied by the vendor to do so.\nNOTE 3: \tTo fulfil the test cases, implementation and documentation of functional requirements may also include implementation and documentation of some of the hardening requirements.\nRequirements are to be testable. That is, they are to be specific enough so that a test can be written that effectively decides whether the requirement is fulfilled or not.\nSome general guidelines for writing test cases are:\nThe test case should describe what the aim of the test is and what it is trying to demonstrate. It is not necessary to describe in details what needs to be done and what equipment is to be used. It should be left up to the lab to determine what are suitable tools and methods but it should also be specified what is suitable on high-level in order to ensure that the lab is using the right type of tools.\nThe test case is to match the requirement and is not allowed to extend the requirement. It is allowed that a test case may test only a subset of what is covered by the requirement as exhaustive testing may be impossible in certain cases.\nDuplications should be avoided, e.g. it should be allowed to refer from one test case to (a part of) another test case already covering (part of) the requirement or to state in one test case that another test case should be run successfully before.\nIt should be possible to execute a test case efficiently and automation is to be preferred over manual work.\nTest cases should be applicable to all elements in one or more network product classes and not assume implementation-specific details, e.g. on operating systems, that are not present in the requirement. But examples for specific environments, e.g. specific operating systems, are allowed.\nThe network product as defined in the present TR shall be the object on which test cases are executed. This means, in particular, that no assumptions on installing additional software, e.g. a network sniffer, on the network product are to be made.\nIn general, configuration changes (e.g. creating additional accounts) are to be avoided unless they are needed for the purpose of the test. But when modification of the network product is a necessary precondition for testing the requirement (e.g. when the requirement asks for configurability of the product such as in a password policy) configuration changes are allowed.\nTests are verifiable. That is, after the test is executed there cannot be any doubt whether the test passed or failed. If there is doubt, it is a matter of opinion whether the test passed or failed which may result in unnecessary disputes. One of the purposes of the tests in SECAM is to remove opinion based verdicts of test outcome.\nThe detail level of a test case corresponds to the detail level of its associated requirement (see clause 5.2.3.1.1). In order to be repeatable, every test case performed with a network product needs to be described on detail level 3, i.e. specific for every individual network product. This means that the test laboratory needs to define and document test cases on detail level 3 for the security requirements on detail level 1 and 2 in the SCAS. This documentation needs to be included in the evaluation report.\nTests are repeatable when based on this documentation of test cases on detail level 3. That is, given this documentation, the network product and the corresponding SCAS, a third party should be able to repeat the tests and verify whether the network product passes or fails the test.\nFor a test to be verifiable, it needs to clearly specify the starting state of the system, pre-requisites for the tester, what actions are taken by the tester, and what the expected results are. The actions taken by the tester are sufficiently detailed to enable someone else to repeat the test. The expected outcome are sufficiently detailed to unambiguously determine whether the test passed or failed.\nThere is no need to deeply formalize how the tests are written in SECAM, but the three identified pieces of information need to be present, and they need to be clear and unambiguous:\n-\tThe initial state of the network product and pre-requisites for the tester.\n-\tThe steps taken to perform the test.\n-\tThe expected results of a successful test.\nSpecifying the tests clearly also helps in formulating clear requirements.\nThe SCAS applies to a network product class. In particular, the security requirements in the SCAS apply to the network product class. It is therefore important that the tests that verify whether a security requirement is met by a network product or not are mapped to the specific network product. More precisely, the expected results of the test show that the network product is acting as expected. The expected results cannot describe behavior of other network entities or personnel in the environment of the network product.\nTable 5.2.3.4.4-1 describes the template to be used while writing the test cases identified for each security requirement.\nTable 5.2.3.4.4-1 Test case template\n\n",

The vendor will define their own processes and describe them in written format. During an audit, the processes will be evaluated and their application on development activities in practice will be verified. An accreditation will be awarded, if the requirements are met.\nLifecycle management consists of establishing discipline and control in the updates of network product during its development and maintenance. Lifecycle management controls are important during normal improvement of network product as well as for vulnerability/security flaw remediation (documentation used to track vulnerability/security flaw, remediation procedure with relation to corrective actions for each identified  vulnerability/security flaw…). \nThe vendor accreditation for network product development and network product life cycle management processes will provide assurance for these aspects in SECAM.\nThe Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management processes assessment covers a vendor's engineering processes and does not necessarily apply only to a single network product. This means that the results of one assessment may apply to more than one network product. Vendors can submit their generic network product development and network product lifecycle management processes or a subset of them for auditing and accreditation. Generic network product development and network product lifecycle management processes are usually used during development of all or some products of the same vendor. As different network product development and network product lifecycle management processes could be utilized within the organization of one vendor, e.g. due to mergers or acquisitions, vendors could obtain and hold accreditation for different generic network product development and network product lifecycle management processes.\nOnce the vendor obtains accreditation and as long as the accreditation has not expired, vendors are allowed to produce development process compliance declarations for the \"network product development and network product lifecycle management processes compliance validation\" task on their own.\nAt the beginning of a SECAM evaluation of a product, the Vendor will have to provide a development process compliance declaration to the compliance tester containing a rationale showing that the generic accredited process was effectively applied in the network product development and network product lifecycle management of the network product under evaluation.\nRequirements and accreditation procedures for vendor development lifecycle process and product lifecycle maintenance process accreditation are specified in [9].\nNOTE 1: \tThe requirements on the process and acceptable evidences as well as the procedure to obtain an accreditation for these requirements is under the responsibility of the SECAM Accreditation Body which takes into account the cost/complexity/assurance trade-off. \nIt is avoided that vendors need to obtain a large number of accreditations for their network product development and network product lifecycle management process. The number of requirements is relatively small (an order of magnitude of ten) to keep evaluation cost reasonable and focus on critical controls. As much as possible from existing standards is reused.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Vendor is expected to employ Industry related good working practices, e.g. aligned to the relevant parts of the ISO/IEC 27000 series. Although these areas will not be formally audited by the SECAM Accreditation Body, it is unlikely a vendor would be able to provide satisfactory evidence for meeting the SECAM requirements without having such policies and working practices in place.\n",

The evaluator confirms at least that the SCAS being instantiated for a given 3GPP network product and the network product for evaluation are consistent.\n7.2.2.2.1.1\tOverview\nA given network product from a vendor might be packaged in different ways for each commercial transaction to address the tailored request from operators.\nSECAM evaluations are conducted for a particular packaging of the network product. One objective in SECAM is to ensure maximum reusability of evaluation results of the evaluation of a particular package while still providing a clear and comprehensive description of the boundaries of what was evaluated. In practice to maximize the reuse, the vendor is likely to have the most commonly sold package of its network product evaluated.\nA clear definition of the boundaries of what was evaluated ensures this reusability but also prevents a false perception of what was security tested as additional components are facing well-defined interfaces.\nConsequently, in the scope of evaluation of the SCAS instantiation document, the vendor provides a clear description of the network product that will be tested, i.e. a description of the version of the network product in the scope of SCAS.\nIn particular, the network product description does not contain security requirements or functions, but a logical and physical perimeter for the evaluation. In particular the definition of the network product describes its content in terms of high level description of the components and external interfaces. This description of the network product provides:\n-\tAll components mandated by network product class definition in SCAS and  implemented by the network product.\n-\tAll external communication interfaces of the network product. Details (including protocols, ports, services and purpose) for each of the external communication interfaces of the network product that allow communications between functions inside and outside the network product.\nFinally, whether a component is part or not of the network product as well as the granularity of the definition of a component is disambiguated by the test cases of the SCAS. For example an SCAS may include the following requirement:\n\"Requirement: The product shall include a security audit function, accessible only by a user having the role admin X, logged through SSH on the server.\nTest case:\n-\tthe tester shall connect as the admin user through SSH and verify that he can access the audit\n-\tthe tester shall verify that a user without admin rights cannot access the audit using the same connection\n-\tthe tester shall verify that no other means exist to access the audit except a SSH session\".\nIn this case it is clear what, from where to test and how to test (physical port of the network product where the SSH server is listening).\nNOTE 1:\tSECAM provides no provision to assess whether the evaluation results for a different package of the network product than the one that was evaluated are still valid. However as the boundaries of what was evaluated are made clear by the scope of evaluation clause in the SCAS instantiation, the operator can make their security acceptance decision with a clear understanding of what was evaluated for this new package.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Basic Vulnerability Testing will be conducted on the external communication interfaces of the network product.\n\n7.2.2.2.1.2\tAdapting the SCAS instantiation to special circumstances\nA network product may need to adapt the SCAS instantiation to its own circumstances.\nE.g. this could happen when the network product only partially implements a network product class, for which a SCAS exists. In such cases where there is no fully fitting SCAS for a SECAM evaluation the derivation in the instantiated SCAS might need some special adaptation. The possibility for adaptation is also useful to avoid that SCAS creation and Network Product Class scoping get too complex and have to cover a multitude of parallel versions with very small differences.\nA SCAS instantiation might also need to be adapted when a gap is discovered in an existing SCAS, e.g. due to a newly published vulnerability, and the network product evaluation cannot wait until 3GPP has closed this gap.\n7.2.2.2.1.3\tExclusion of components\nThe SCAS instantiation does not exclude a component from testing on the grounds that it was already evaluated under another scheme, different from SECAM, unless this SCAS allows it explicitly to refer to the certificate obtained under this different scheme for a given set of tests.\nNo component can be excluded from evaluation on the grounds that it was not developed by vendor itself and that it is an outsourced or a 3rd party component.\nThe SCAS instantiation will provide:\n-\tA concrete mapping of the SCAS \"theoretical\" assets to \"real\" assets on the network product.\n-\tA concrete mapping of the SCAS security requirements to the high-level components supporting these functions.\nThe evaluator confirms at least that:\n-\tall assets from SCAS are present in the SCAS instantiation,\nEXAMPLE 1:\tThe SCAS instantiation does not decide, against the SCAS, that some assets need no protection because of physical deployment site protection.\n-\tif SCAS instantiation introduces new assets they are considered assets to be protected in a manner consistent with SCAS,\nEXAMPLE 2:\tIf the SCAS instantiation uses two admin roles instead of a single one in the generic SCAS, both have their credentials protected consistently.\n-\tthe SCAS instantiation does not waive threats identified in the SCAS.\nEXAMPLE 3:\tThe SCAS instantiation does not claim that a threat from the SCAS is not applicable under the assumption that more organizational control is performed during administrators' recruitment.\nOperational guidance documents are part of the documentation created by the vendor and are part of the SCAS instantiation documentation (see clause 7.2.2 for details on SCAS instantiation evaluation). This documentation contains the information on how to initialize, configure and operate the network product so that SECAM security requirements are met. To achieve security, it is necessary to align the network product and the content of the \"operational guidance documents\".\nE.g. this documentation could be a user manual indicating to the administrator:\n-\tBy default, the network product is provisioned with root password \"XXXX\"\n-\tThe network product will NOT be able to operate as long as this password in not changed using procedure Y\n-\tThe minimum password length is 12 characters for secure operation, at least 12 characters password SHALL be chosen\nThese documents will be used by:\n- \tvendor or operator staff during initial setup of the network product.\n- \tvendor or operator staff during operation of the network product.\n- \tvendor or operator staff during maintenance or upgrade of the network product.\n- \tevaluators during SECAM compliance and vulnerability evaluations to install a representative test bed.\nSECAM tested configuration should reflect the setting that an administrator would choose based on these documents. To install a representative test bed, the evaluators will follow this documentation. During evaluation of a network product, no security-related initialization, configuration or operation activities other than those contained in the \"operational guidance documents\" will be followed; those in the documents will be followed in full.\nNOTE 1: \tAs part of SCAS instantiation documents the evaluators will evaluate these \"Operational Guidance documents\" and verify that these documents do not make unrealistic assumptions on the environment that waive a security requirement or a threat from SECAM and would make the test bed not representative.\nNOTE 2: \tIn the scope of SCEAM it is implicitly mandatory for the vendor to consider the security requirements defined in SECAM for creating the operational guidance documents. If relevant initialization, configuration and operation instructions were missing from the operational guidance documents then the network product will inevitably fail the test cases for the respective security requirements.\nInformation needed to execute the required tests for the Security Compliance Testing:\nThe compliance tester assesses whether the SCAS instantiation contains enough information to:\n-\texecute the test cases;\n-\tdetermine whether the tests completely and accurately cover the SCAS.\nIn cases where the SCAS instantiation does not include enough information, the compliance tester can ask the vendor to modify/complete the SCAS instantiation.\nInformation needed to execute the required tests for the Basic Vulnerability Testing:\nThe basic vulnerability tester assesses whether the SCAS instantiation contains enough information to:\n-\tdetermine the tools to be used in the Basic Vulnerability Testing;\n-\texecute the test cases;\n-\tdetermine whether all open ports are explicitly documented;\n-\tdetermine the scope of vulnerability scanning to reflect the SCAS requirements.\nIn cases where the SCAS instantiation does not include enough information, the BVT tester could ask the vendor to modify/complete the SCAS instantiation.\nThe usage and update of this set of documents during a SECAM evaluation is described in figure 7.2.2.3-1 below.\nThe figure depicts an overview of the SCAS instantiation documents evolution during a SECAM evaluation, illustrating the evolution of the SCAS (Security Configuration and Assessment) process. The document outlines the steps and criteria used to assess the security of SCAS instantiation documents, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and validation.\nFigure 7.2.2.3-1: Overview of the SCAS instantiation documents evolution\n during a SECAM evaluation\nStep1 is the initial production by the vendor of the required documentation and its update if required by step 2. It is outside of the scope of SECAM to describe this task.\nStep 2 is the SCAS instantiation evaluation to check whether an SCAS instantiation written by a vendor is a correct instantiation of the SCAS of the network product class and whether it is a good basis for evaluating the network product.\nStep 3 is about performing the SCT and BVT testing tasks as described in the present document. which will use this instantiation documentation as input. The evaluation does not start (neither SCT nor BVT) as long as steps 1 and 2 are not completed.\nFurther documentation is produced during step 3 . During step 3 for example, the SCT and BVT testers will describe the concrete test bed used for testing as well as \"instantiated test cases\" (i.e. the description of the concrete test case on the network product corresponding to the generic SCAS test case). At the end of step 3, the SCAS instantiation documentation as well as the SCT and BVT documentation is an output document provided to the operator. These documents are described in clauses 7.2.3 and 7.2.4.\nAfter step 3, the SCAS instantiation documentation as well as the SCT and BVT documentation produced in step 3 are given to the operator for its final review and final security acceptance decision.\n\n",
