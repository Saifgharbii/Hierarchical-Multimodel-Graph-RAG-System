When receiving an indication of radio link outage detection, the node hosting the NR PDCP entity considers that traffic delivery over the data radio bearer configured for the UE is unavailable at the corresponding node both in UL and DL. When receiving an indication of radio link resume detection, the node hosting the NR PDCP entity considers that traffic delivery over the data radio bearer configured for the UE is available at the corresponding node both in UL and in DL. When receiving an indication of UL or DL radio link outage detection, the node hosting the NR PDCP entity considers that traffic delivery over the data radio bearer configured for the UE is unavailable at the corresponding node for UL or DL, depending on the indicated outage. When receiving an indication of UL or DL radio link resume detection, the node hosting the NR PDCP entity considers that traffic delivery over the data radio bearer configured for the UE is available at the corresponding node in UL or in DL, depending on the indicated resume. These indications are not applicable to E-UTRA PDCP.\nFor report polling triggered reporting, the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame may include the feedback delay result and the NR-U sequence number of the frame where Report Polling Flag is included and that triggered the signalling of the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS.\nThe node hosting the NR PDCP entity, when receiving the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame:\n-\tregards the desired buffer size under b) and the data rate under c) above as the amount of data to be sent from the hosting node:\n-\tIf the value of the desired buffer size is 0, the hosting node shall stop sending any data per bearer.\n-\tIf the value of the desired buffer size in b) above is greater than 0, the hosting node may send up to this amount of data per bearer:\n-\tfirst including the data to be retransmitted;\n-\tthen the new data, starting from the last \"Highest successfully delivered NR PDCP Sequence Number\" for RLC AM if received, or starting from the last \"Highest transmitted NR PDCP Sequence Number\" for RLC UM if received.\n-\tThe value of the desired data rate in c) above is the amount of data desired to be received in a specific amount of time.
