            "description": "The 3GPP platform was first expanded to the automotive industry by the introduction of support for V2V and V2X services in Release 14. This support forms Phase 1 of 3GPP's ongoing project relating to V2X, and was intended to support a set of requirements sufficient for basic road safety services. Vehicles containing UEs with these features can use the uplink, downlink and sidelink to exchange information on their own status, such as position, speed, and heading with other nearby vehicles, infrastructure nodes, and pedestrians. Phase 2 of the V2X project was standardised in Release 15, and adds a number of new features to the sidelink intended to enhance efficiency and exploit developments in UE and network designs. These enhancements include sidelink carrier aggregation, higher-order modulation, and reduced latency.\nPhase 3 of V2X, in Release 16, adds support to NR (and also 5GC, not addressed in this TR) for advanced V2X use cases, and includes introduction of the NR sidelink. The use-cases are broadly grouped to enable vehicular platooning, exchange of extended sensor information, advanced driving, and remote driving. Phase 3 also allows either RAT's sidelink to be operated under control of the other RAT's Uu interface, as well as permitting connection to EPC or 5GC, to enable usage in the main MR-DC deployment scenarios.\nIn the following clauses, LTE-V2X is described first, then NR-V2X, and finally certain aspects which have a degree of commonality to both RATs.\nAlthough this TR deals with RAN aspects, note that the core network architectures also have many adaptations to support V2X in both EPC and 5GC. These are referred to only as needed for other explanations in this TR, and details can be found in the relevant specifications.\n",

            "description": "The present document provides an overall description of the features introduced by 3GPP to LTE and NR in support of V2X services, starting from Rel-14. The purpose of this TR is to give an overview across the RAN specifications of how the features have been designed, and how they operate together. This document addresses LTE V2X and NR V2X via both sidelink, i.e. the PC5 interfaces, and via the cellular uplink/downlink, i.e. the Uu interfaces. It covers V2V, V2I/N, and V2P, as well as the eNB/gNB, UE, and RSU nodes. The intention is to provide descriptions at approximately the Stage 2 level of detail, and thus references are provided to RAN specifications for the reader to obtain precise details.\nThe document is a 'living' document, i.e. it is permanently updated and presented to TSG-RAN meetings.\n",

            "description": "LTE-V2X is designed with BSM, CAM, and DENM particularly in mind. BSMs and CAMs have the characteristic of generating periodic messages at intervals, whereas DENMs are event-triggered. As an illustration of the different message types, in TR 36.885 [2], BSM/CAM were modelled, for evaluation purposes, as periodically occurring sets of one 300-byte message followed by four 190-byte messages. These types of message regularly broadcast information such as the vehicle's heading, speed, latitude/longitude, etc. ETSI EN 302 637-2 [3], SAE J2735 [4]. In TR 36.885 [2], DENMs were modelled, for evaluation purposes, as Poisson distributed initiations of six 800-byte messages spaced by 100 ms. DENMs can contain various different messages depending on the cause for their transmission, such as imminent collision, sudden braking, or detection of a traffic jam, amongst others ETSI EN 302 637-3 [5]. The requirements relating to traffic size and pattern for LTE-V2X set in TS 22.185 [6] can be summarized as follows, although they do not limit the usage of LTE-V2X. Other requirements relating to general system function are also included in TS 22.185 [6].\n-\tSupport for periodic broadcast messages with payloads of 50-300 bytes.\n-\tSupport for event-triggered messages with payloads of up to 1200 bytes.\n-\tUp to 10 messages per second transmitted by a UE.\n-\tV2V and V2P latency of maximum 100 ms, or for V2V pre-crash sensing, maximum 20 ms.\n-\tV2I latency, i.e. between a UE and RSU, of maximum 100 ms.\n-\tV2N latency, i.e. when transferring messages via the cellular network, of maximum 1000 ms.\n-\tMaximum relative velocity between two vehicles of 500 km/h, and maximum absolute velocity of 250 km/h for V2V and V2P UEs, and of a UE communicating with an RSU.\n-\tRequirements relating to security, integrity, authorization, and privacy.\nNR V2X is designed with a broader set of more advanced V2X use cases in mind. These were specified in TS 22.18 [7], and are broadly arranged into four use case groups: vehicular platooning, extended sensors, advanced driving, and remote driving.\n1)\tVehicles Platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a platoon travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon obtain information from the leading vehicle to manage this platoon. These information allow the vehicles to drive closer than normal in a coordinated manner, going to the same direction and travelling together.\n2)\tExtended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered through local sensors or live video images among vehicles, road site units, devices of pedestrian and V2X application servers. The vehicles can increase the perception of their environment beyond of what their own sensors can detect and have a more broad and holistic view of the local situation. High data rate is one of the key characteristics.\n3)\tAdvanced Driving enables semi-automated or full-automated driving. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares its own perception data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity and that allows vehicles to synchronize and coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. Each vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in proximity too.\n4)\tRemote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive by themselves or remote vehicles located in dangerous environments. For a case where variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as public transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used. High reliability and low latency are the main requirements.\nThe most demanding requirements set in TS 22.186 [7] are for a maximum sidelink range of 1000 m, a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps, a shortest latency of 3 ms, a maximum reliability of 99.999%, and a maximum transmission rate of 100 messages/second. However, there is not a use case which, on its own, demands all of these bounding requirements. The communication scenarios described in TS 22.186 [7] include a mixture of periodic and aperiodic services. Similar to LTE-V2X, there are also requirements relating to security, integrity, authorization, and privacy.\n",

These can be referred to jointly as the sidelink synchronization signal (SLSS).\n-\tA demodulation reference signal (DMRS) associated with each of the three physical channels, specified in TS 36.211 [8, clause 9.8]\nLTE-V2X sidelink physical channels are transmitted using SC-FDMA.\nPSBCH transmits the SL-BCH transport channel, which carries the sidelink V2X Master Information Block (MIB-V2X) from the RRC layer. When in use, PSBCH transmits MIB-V2X every 160 ms in the central 72 subcarriers of the SL bandwidth. DMRS associated with PSBCH are transmitted in the 5th, 7th, and 10th symbols of the subframe.\nPSSS and SSSS are transmitted to allow other UEs to achieve sidelink synchronization when they do not have another source of synchronization available. They jointly convey the SLSS ID selected by the UE. For further details of SLSS and synchronization, refer to Clause 5.1.2. PSSS/SSSS also allow UEs to detect the sidelink subframe boundary, with subframe number and frame number signalled in MIB-V2X.\nPSSCH transmits the SL-SCH transport channel, which carries the TBs of data for transmission over SL. The resources in which PSSCH is transmitted can either be scheduled by an eNB and granted to the UE by a DCI (termed resource allocation mode 3, see Clause 5.2.2.1) or determined through a sensing procedure conducted autonomously by the transmitting UE (termed resource allocation mode 4, see Clause 5.2.2.2). A given TB can be transmitted once or twice, with a second transmission occurring a time gap after the first which is indicated in the scheduling SCI.\nPSCCH transmits physical layer sidelink control information (SCI), also known as a scheduling assignment (SA). For V2X, PSCCH is transmitted in two frequency-adjacent PRBs, and always carries SCI format 1, defined in TS 36.212 [9, clause 5.4.3.1.2]. To receive PSCCH, a UE has to monitor each defined pair of PRBs to determine whether PSCCH has been transmitted in them. PSCCH is transmitted in the same subframe(s) as the associated PSSCH, and can be transmitted in PRBs that are either frequency adjacent or frequency non-adjacent to the PSSCH.\nDMRS associated with PSSCH and PSCCH are transmitted in the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th symbols of a subframe.\n",

                            "text_content": "There are four basic sources, or references, from which a V2X UE can derive its own synchronization: GNSS, its serving eNB, another UE transmitting SLSS (a SyncRef UE), or its own internal clock. In general, GNSS or eNB are regarded as the highest-quality sources. SyncRef UEs are distinguished between those which are directly synchronized to GNSS or an eNB, those which are 1 further step away, and those which are ≥ 2 further steps away from GNSS/eNB. As a last resort, a UE unable to find any other synchronization reference will use its own internal clock to transmit SLSS. The V2X synchronization procedure defines a hierarchy or set of priorities among such synchronization references and requires all UEs to continuously search the hierarchy to get to the highest-quality one they can find. The general preference order is as follows, with details specified in TS 36.331 [10, clause 5.10.8]:\nLevel 1.\tEither GNSS or eNB, according to (pre-)configuration.\nLevel 2.\tA SyncRef UE directly synchronized to a Level 1 source.\nLevel 3.\tA SyncRef UE synchronized to a Level 2 source, i.e. indirectly synchronized to a Level 1 source.\n-\tWhen the Level 1 preference is (pre-)configured as GNSS, in Level 2 and 3, SyncRef UEs in hierarchies derived from GNSS and eNB are of equal preference as a synchronization source.\nLevel 4.\tAny other SyncRef UE.\nLevel 5.\tUE's internal clock.\nWithin a Level 2, or 3, or 4 set of SyncRef UEs, the one with the highest S-RSRP is selected. The hierarchy also allows fallback between eNB-derived and GNSS-derived chains should the Level 1 type chosen by (pre-)configuration be unsuitable.\nThe transmission and reception of SLSS (and PSBCH) is an optional V2X UE capability, and they can be transmitted on one or multiple synchronization carriers.\nA UE which is deriving its own synchronization from eNB or GNSS can be configured by the network to transmit SLSS on a synchronization carrier, or the network can permit it to do so if the RSRP of a reference cell falls below a threshold. If the network is not available, and the UE is synchronized to GNSS, it will transmit SLSS if permitted by its pre-configuration. When such a UE does not have GNSS synchronization, it will transmit SLSS, if permitted by its pre-configuration, while it cannot find a SyncRef UE with sufficiently high S-RSRP. Full details of the conditions for SLSS transmission are specified in TS 36.331 [10, clause 5.10.7.2].\nIn a V2X system, there can be a variety of UEs which are deriving synchronization from different sources, and since a UE can transmit SLSS on multiple carriers, it can have different synchronization sources among them. SLSS is therefore transmitted in different subframes depending on what synchronization source the UE is using. The system can be configured with either two or three different offsets with respect to the start of the 160 ms PSBCH period can be defined, which can allow different subframes for transmission according to whether the UE is synchronized to GNSS, eNB, or another SyncRef UE.\nPSSS and SSSS use the same sequences as PSS and SSS, respectively, with different root indices. When in use, both sequences are transmitted in the central 62 subcarriers of the SL bandwidth, in the same subframe as PSBCH, i.e. every 160 ms. PSSS is in the 2nd and 3rd symbols of the subframe, and SSSS in the 12th and 13th symbols. The two symbols of each signal are the same, which allows detectors to benefit from phase tracking between the two symbols. Figure 5.1.2.1-1 shows the relevant contents of a subframe which contain PSBCH, PSSS, and SSSS.\nThe figure depicts the contents of an LTE-V2X synchronization subframe, illustrating the various data elements and their respective meanings. The subframe contains information about the time synchronization, data synchronization, and the presence of a V2X message. This subframe is crucial for ensuring the proper functioning of the LTE-V2X communication system.\nFigure 5.1.2.2-1: Contents of an LTE-V2X synchronization subframe.\nThe SLSSID itself conveys information about the synchronization source of the transmitting UE. In general, the further a UE is away from a high-quality source of GNSS or eNB, the lower quality will be its own synchronization and thus the quality of an SLSS it transmits. There are a series of association rules among SLSS IDs, designed to allow the identification, and propagation through the system of, high-quality synchronization sources. Thus, for example, a UE which is in-coverage and directly synchronized to an eNB (a Level 2 SyncRef UE) uses an SLSSID which is configured by the network from 1-167, allowing SLSSID planning, and a UE using such a UE as a SyncRef UE (a Level 3 SyncRef UE) uses the same SLSSID, but indicates in V2X MIB that it is not directly eNB-synchronized. Subsequent UEs  in this example hierarchy (Level 4 SyncRef UEs) use the SLSSID+168 to indicate their source is not directly synchronized to an eNB. A similar propagation hierarchy is used starting with a UE which is directly synchronized to GNSS, whose SLSSID is always 0, resulting in any UE which is more than one further step from GNSS using SLSSID 168 (or, in some cases, 169) so that a synchronization hierarchy based on GNSS can always be identified. Finally, a UE which cannot find GNSS, eNB, nor a SyncRef UE, selects an SLSSID randomly from 170-335, and UEs which synchronize to it propagate the same SLSSID.\n",

When operating in CA, a given (sidelink) MAC PDU is transmitted, and if necessary re-transmitted, on a single sidelink carrier, and multiple MAC PDUs can be transmitted in parallel on different carriers. This provides a throughput gain in a similar way as for Uu CA.\nSidelink CA in resource allocation mode 3 using a dynamic grant is similar to on the Uu interface, by including a carrier indication field (CIF) in the DCI from the eNB. This indicates which among the up to 8 configured sidelink carriers the allocation in the DCI applies to.\nSidelink CA in resource allocation mode 4 uses the sensing procedure described in Clause 5.2.2.2 to select resources independently on each involved carrier. The same carrier is used for all MAC PDUs of the same sidelink process at least until the process triggers resource re-selection. Procedures to avoid unexpected UE behaviour when the demands of CA become high are also specified, which allow a UE to drop a transmission which uses an unmanageable amount of resources or transmit chains, or to reject and re-select resources for which it cannot meet the RF requirements under CA.\nSidelink synchronization can also operate on multiple carriers, as mentioned in Clause 5.1.2. In addition, in sidelink CA operation, a SyncRef UE uses a single synchronization reference for all aggregated carriers, and may transmit SLSS/PSBCH on one or multiple of them according to capability. A receiving UE likewise uses the same synchronization reference (not necessarily a SyncRef UE) for all its aggregated carriers, and it uses the highest priority synchronization reference present among the available synchronization carriers.\nAnother form of CA is PDCP duplication, where the same PDCP packet is transmitted in parallel on multiple sidelink carriers, to increase reliability. See Clause 5.4.7 for more discussion.\n",

                            "text_content": "PSCCH and PSSCH resources are defined within resource pools for the respective channels. This concept is used because in general PSCCH/PSSCH cannot be transmitted (and thus are not expected to be received) in all PRBs and subframes in the system bandwidth, nor within a given frequency span configured for V2X sidelink. The notion of a resource pool also reflects, in resource allocation mode 4, that a UE will make its resource selections based on sensing within the (PSSCH) pool.\nFor PSSCH, a resource pool is divided into sub-channels in the frequency domain, which are consecutively non-overlapping sets of ≥4 PRBs in a subframe, the size depending on (pre-)configuration. Resource allocation, sensing, and resource selection are performed in units of a sub-channel, although it is possible that a small number of PRBs within a sub-channel are not used for transmission.\nFor PSCCH, the resource pool definition depends on whether adjacent or non-adjacent transmission of PSCCH and PSSCH has been (pre-)configured for the resource pool. Adjacent transmission is achieved by defining the lowest pair of PRBs in each subchannel as candidates to contain PSCCH, and PSSCH is transmitted in the contiguous PRBs above them for the allocated number of subchannels. Non-adjacent transmission is achieved by defining sequential pairs of PRBs starting at the lowest frequency of the resource pool for PSCCH, and associating the nth pair to PSSCH transmission occupying from the nth PSSCH sub-channel for the allocated number of subchannels. Figure 5.2.1-1 shows examples of adjacent and non-adjacent transmission. To receive PSCCH, a UE has to monitor each defined pair of PRBs to determine whether PSCCH has been transmitted in them.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of adjacent allocations of PSCCH and associated PSSCH in a 5G network. The figure illustrates the distribution of these resources, highlighting the importance of efficient resource allocation in ensuring network performance.\nFigure 5.2.1-1a: Illustration of adjacent allocations of PSCCH and associated PSSCH.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of non-adjacent allocations of PSCCH and associated PSSCH in a 5G network. The figure illustrates the distribution of these resources, highlighting the importance of efficient resource allocation in ensuring network performance.\nFigure 5.2.1-1b: Illustration of non-adjacent allocations of PSCCH and associated PSSCH.\nResource pools are (pre-)configured to a UE separately from the transmission perspective (TX pools) and the reception perspective (RX pools). This allows a UE to monitor for PSCCH, and hence receive PSSCH transmissions, in resource pools other than those in which it transmits, so that it can attempt to receive transmissions made by other UEs in those RX pools.\nIn addition, there are exceptional resource pools configured to a UE, in its serving cell's SIB21 or in dedicated signalling. These can be used e.g. during RLF, handover, transition from RRC IDLE to RRC CONNECTED, or during change of dedicated V2X sidelink resource pools within a cell. In these cases, a UE may not have a stable configuration of TX resource pools but nevertheless should not be removed from the V2X system, so it can randomly select resources in the exceptional pool provided in its serving cell's SIB21 or in dedicated signalling, and use them temporarily. Likewise, UEs need to monitor the exceptional pools for PSCCH transmissions.\n",

                            "text_content": "LTE sidelink defines four resource allocation modes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Modes 1 and 2 apply to D2D, while modes 3 and 4 apply to LTE V2X.\nMode 3 is for resource allocation scheduled by eNB. As described in Clause 4, among the primary use cases for LTE-V2X is transmission of periodically-occurring messages, and for this reason there is particular support for sidelink SPS. However, dynamic sidelink grants are equally supported.\nThe eNB scheduling activity is driven by the UE needing to send data on sidelink performing a sidelink BSR procedure similar to that on Uu to request a sidelink resource allocation from eNB. Depending on the type of traffic the UE has, eNB can provide a dynamic sidelink grant, or an activation of a SPS sidelink grant.\nA dynamic sidelink grant DCI provides, amongst other details TS 36.212 [9, clause 5.3.3.1.9A], the resources for up to two transmissions of the same TB. This is to allow higher reliability to be achieved without a feedback-based HARQ procedure, since LTE-V2X physical layer supports only broadcast transmission. Unlike Uu UL grants, the MCS information can optionally be provided by RRC signalling instead of the traditional DCI. For the case where RRC does not provide the MCS,  the transmitting UE is left to select an appropriate MCS/TBS itself based on the knowledge it has of the TB to be transmitted and, potentially, the sidelink radio conditions. The transmitting UE populates its SCI  with the information from eNB and other fields related to sidelink operation TS 36.212 [9, clause 5.4.3.1.2], and then transmits it and the associated PSSCH.\nThe UE can be configured by eNB with up to 8 sidelink SPS configurations. Each configuration has an identifying index, and provides a different periodicity of sidelink transmission resource. A sidelink SPS configuration is not used by the UE until the eNB sends the UE a DCI which indicates it is now active. The activating DCI also provides all the same fields as a dynamic sidelink scheduling DCI described above, allowing the precise resource allocation for SPS to be determined by eNB at the time it is needed. A transmitting UE can use the thus activated sidelink SPS resources, at the configured periodicity, until they are released (i.e. de-activated) by the eNB transmitting a special DCI. Note that each time the UE uses the resources, it either uses the RRC configured MCS/TBS or selects one itself, i.e. the same way as dynamic operation.\nMode 4 is for UE autonomous resource selection. Its basic structure is of a UE sensing, within a (pre-)configured resource pool, which resources are not in use by other UEs with higher-priority traffic, and choosing an appropriate amount of such resources for its own PSCCH/PSSCH transmission. Having selected such resources, the UE can transmit in them on a periodic (i.e. SPS) basis for a certain number of times, or until a cause of resource reselection is triggered.\nAs described in Clause 5.2.2.1, the SCIs transmitted by UEs on PSCCH indicate the time-frequency resources in which the UE will transmit a PSSCH. The same SCI contents is used in mode 4, and also indicates the periodicity with which the UE will use the same resources. These SCI transmissions are used by sensing UEs to maintain a moving sensing window in the immediate past of which resources have been reserved by other UEs. This window is 1000 ms long for FDD systems. A sensing UE also measures the PSSCH-RSRP in the subframes of the sensing window, which implies the level of interference which would be caused and experienced if the sensing UE were to transmit in them.\nThe sensing UE then selects resources for its first transmission from within a resource selection window. This window begins ≤4 ms after the trigger for transmission, and is bounded by the latency requirement of the traffic, up to 100 ms (see Clause 4). The sensing UE assumes the same resources will be used by other UEs in the future as have been found reserved during the sensing window, according to the indicated periodicities and durations. Reserved resources in the selection window with PSSCH-RSRP above a threshold are excluded from being candidates by the sensing UE, with the threshold set according to the priorities (PPPP) of the traffic of the sensing and transmitting UE. Thus, a higher priority transmission from a sensing UE can occupy resources which are reserved by a transmitting UE with sufficiently low PSSCH-RSRP and sufficiently lower-priority traffic.\nFrom the set of resources in the selection window which have not been excluded, the sensing UE identifies those containing the lowest total received energy as a way to account for transmissions which were not found during decoding of PSCCHs, and identifies resources totalling 20% of the available resources within the traffic's latency bound, including gradual relaxation of the PSSCH-RSRP exclusion thresholds in 3 dB steps if necessary. The UE then selects a resource at random from the identified 20% and uses this resource semi-persistently for its transmissions.\nThere are a number of triggers for resource re-selection. They are designed to support high mobility, and ensure that a UE cannot assume occupation of a resource for an excessive period, nor when the selected resource is either insufficient or excessive for what is needed by the UE's traffic, amongst other causes.\nThe figure depicts a summary of sensing and resource (re-)selection procedures in a 5G network. It highlights the importance of signal quality, network capacity, and user experience in determining the optimal path for data transmission. The figure illustrates the various sensing and resource selection techniques, such as beamforming, time-division multiple access (TDMA), and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), which are used to optimize network performance.\nFigure 5.2.2.2-1: Summary of sensing and resource (re-)selection procedures.\nCellular networks are designed to support resource re-use over a given geographical area, to manage interference and improve area spectral efficiency. A similar concept is available in LTE-V2X. LTE-V2X can optionally divide the world into zones, which have a (pre-)configurable width and height. Nearby zones are assigned different resource pools, with spatially-periodic re-use over a distance controlled by the zone width and height. A UE performs transmission within the resource pool(s) associated with its current zone, for mode 4. Figure 5.2.3-1 shows an example of the configuration of zones, where those with the same zone_id use the same transmission resource pools.\nThe figure depicts a network topology with zones, illustrating the distribution of nodes and their corresponding locations. Each zone is represented by a rectangle with a label indicating the zone's location, such as \"x = 0.0, y = 0.0\" for the center of the city. The figure also includes a legend that explains the notation used in the figure, such as \"x '  = ceil( x / L ) mod  N x ; y '  = ceil( y / W ) mod  N y ; zone_id=  y ' × N x + x ' ; where  x  and  y  are the longitude and latitude of the UE ' s location, L , W  are the length and width of each zone, respectively, and N x , N y  are the number of zones in length and width respectively.\"\nFigure 5.2.3-1: Illustration of zones. x' = ceil(x/L) mod Nx; y' = ceil(y/W) mod Ny; zone_id= y'×Nx+x'; where x and y are the longitude and latitude of the UE's location, L, W are the length and width of each zone, respectively, and Nx, Ny are the number of zones in length and width respectively.\nResource pools for mode 3 and mode 4 are (pre-)configured separately from one another. In  Rel-14, a receiving UE whether operating in mode 3 or mode 4 does not know in any particular way that a transmission in mode 3 has SPS characteristics, since the mode 3 SCI always indicates that its PSSCH transmission is single-shot. Thus, a mode 4 UE will not exclude the occupied resources during its resource selection procedure. In Rel-15, resource pool sharing is enabled by the mode 3 SCI also indicating a SPS reservation period, and mode 4 UEs of both releases are therefore able to account for such transmissions in the resource (re-)selection procedure.\nIt is also possible for a UE operating in mode 3 to perform the mode 4 sensing procedure in order to report to eNB regarding the occupancy of resources in the mode 4 pools. This provides information which the eNB can use in determining its scheduling behaviour for mode 3.\n",

PPPR allows management of reliability, for example see Clause 5.4.7. The PPPP of a packet is indicated dynamically in the SCI which schedules the PSSCH for the packet. A physical measurement of CBR is also defined in each subframe TS 36.214 [12, clause 5.1.30], which measures the portion of the resource in a resource pool which has a high received signal energy (S-RSSI) in the most recent 100 subframes. CBR is a measurement of the congestion present recently in the resource pool. Another measurement, CR defined in TS 36.214 [12, clause 5.1.31], counts the total number of subchannels a UE has and will transmit in during a window of up to 1000 ms including the current subframe. CR is thus a measurement of how much resource a UE has recently, and will soon, claim.\nA UE can be (pre-)configured with a set of CBR ranges to each of which is linked a CR-limit. When a UE finds its CR exceeds the CR-limit for the CBR range it currently measures, it  must reduce its CR to not exceed the limit. How this is done is up to UE implementation, and can include increasing MCS to reduce resource occupation, dropping (re-)transmissions, etc. PPPP can also be (pre-)configured with a mapping to the UE's maximum permitted transmit power, the limitation on which acts to reduce the CBR measured by sufficiently distant UEs.\nPPPP is used as described in Clause 5.2.2 to aid distributed sidelink congestion control based on the relative priorities of traffic from UEs that consider occupying a given resource. PPPP and CBR can each also be (pre-)configured with mappings to ranges of values of transmission parameters, e.g. a range of MCS values, and/or a range of numbers of subchannels, etc. In this case, the UE has to choose its transmission parameters from within the range corresponding to the prevailing PPPP and/or CBR.\n",

Whereas in Rel-8 UL SPS a single SPS configuration can be provided by RRC, for LTE-V2X, up to 8 UL SPS configurations can be provided, similar to on the sidelink, which the eNB is assisted in the configuration of by information on traffic characteristics, etc., reported provided by the UE. A specialised version of DCI format 0 is then used to activate/release UL V2X SPS configurations as needed, and separately from the normal UL SPS configuration.\nLTE supports multicast/broadcast operation via SC-PTM and MBSFN transmission.

See clause 6.2.3 for CSI.\nNR-V2X sidelink supports subcarrier spacings of 15, 30, 60 and 120 kHz. Their associations to CPs and frequency ranges are as for NR UL/DL, but using only the CP-OFDM waveform. The modulation schemes available are QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM.\nPSBCH transmits the SL-BCH transport channel, which carries the sidelink V2X Master Information Block (MIB-V2X) from the RRC layer. When in use, PSBCH transmits MIB-V2X every 160 ms in 11 RBs of the SL bandwidth, with possible repetitions in the period. DMRS associated with PSBCH are transmitted in every symbol of the S-SSB slot. S-PSS and S-SSS are transmitted together with PSBCH in the S-SSB. They jointly convey the SLSS ID used by the UE. For further details of S-SSB, SLSS, and synchronization, refer to Clause 6.2.2.\nSidelink control information (SCI) in NR V2X is transmitted in two stages. The first-stage SCI is carried on PSCCH and contains information to enable sensing operations, information about the resource allocation of the PSSCH, and, when needed, indication that the UE can receive conflict information in inter-UE coordination.\nPSSCH transmits the second-stage SCI and the SL-SCH transport channel. The second-stage SCI can carry information needed to identify and decode the associated SL-SCH, as well as control for HARQ procedures, triggers for CSI feedback, inter-UE coordination requests and information, etc. SL-SCH carries the TB of data for transmission over SL.\nThe resources in which PSSCH is transmitted can be scheduled or configured by a gNB (termed resource allocation mode 1, see Clause 6.3.2.1) or determined through a sensing procedure conducted autonomously by the transmitting UE (termed resource allocation mode 2, see Clause 6.3.2.2). A given TB can be transmitted multiple times, as described in Clauses 6.2.4 and 6.3.2. DMRS associated with rank-1 or rank-2 PSSCH can be transmitted in 2, 3, or 4 sidelink symbols distributed through a sidelink slot.\nMultiplexing between PSCCH and PSSCH is in time and frequency within a slot, illustrated in two examples in Figure 6.2.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a slot format for 2-symbol PSCCH, 2-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and no PSFCH. The slots are numbered from 1 to 12, with 1 representing the start of the slot and 12 representing the end. The slots are labeled with the symbol and the corresponding data rate, with the symbol indicating the data rate. The figure also includes a legend to help interpret the symbols and data rates.\nFigure 6.2.1-1(a): Example slot format of 2-symbol PSCCH, 2-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and no PSFCH.\nThe figure depicts a 3-symbol PSCCH, 3-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and PSFCH signal format, illustrating the different types of signaling used in 5G networks. The figure includes key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 6.2.1-1(b): Example slot format of 3-symbol PSCCH, 3-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and PSFCH.\nWhen used for HARQ purposes, PSFCH carries HARQ feedback over the sidelink from a UE which is an intended recipient of a PSSCH transmission (henceforth an Rx UE) to the UE which performed the transmission (henceforth a Tx UE). Sidelink HARQ feedback may be in the form of conventional ACK/NACK, or NACK-only with nothing transmitted in case of successful decoding; for more information refer to clause 6.2.4. PSFCH can also convey inter-UE coordination information; refer to clause 6.8.\nPSFCH transmits a Zadoff-Chu sequence in one PRB repeated over two OFDM symbols, the first of which can be used for AGC, near the end of the sidelink resource in a slot. The time resources for PSFCH are (pre-)configured to occur once in every 1, 2, or 4 slots. Frequency/code resources are derived implicitly from those used by the associated PSSCH transmission, together with the L1 identity of the UE transmitting PSSCH and, when groupcast with ACK/NACK feedback is used, the identity within the group of the UE transmitting PSFCH.\n",

                            "text_content": "There are four basic sources, or references, from which a V2X UE can derive its own synchronization: GNSS, a gNB/eNB, another UE transmitting SLSS (here termed a SyncRef UE), or its own internal clock. In general, GNSS or eNB/gNB are regarded as the highest-quality sources. SyncRef UEs are distinguished between those which are directly synchronized to GNSS or a gNB/eNB, those which are 1 further step away, and those which are ≥2 further steps away from GNSS or gNB/eNB. As a last resort, a UE unable to find any other synchronization reference will use its own internal clock to transmit S-SSB. The V2X synchronization procedure defines a hierarchy or set of priorities among such synchronization references and requires all UEs to continuously search the hierarchy to get to the highest-quality one they can find. The general preference order is as follows, with details specified in TS 38.331 [17, clause 5.8.6]:\nLevel 1.\tEither GNSS or eNB/gNB, according to (pre-)configuration.\nLevel 2.\tA SyncRef UE directly synchronized to a Level 1 source.\nLevel 3.\tA SyncRef UE synchronized to a Level 2 source, i.e. indirectly synchronized to a Level 1 source.\nLevel 4.\tWhichever of GNSS or eNB/gNB was not (pre-)configured as the Level 1 source.\nLevel 5.\tA SyncRef UE directly synchronized to a Level 4 source.\nLevel 6.\tA SyncRef UE synchronized to a Level 5 source, i.e. indirectly synchronized to a Level 4 source.\nLevel 7.\tAny other SyncRef UE.\nLevel 8.\tUE's internal clock.\nThe NR V2X scheme is intended to allow the merging of otherwise-separate hierarchies derived from GNSS and gNB/eNB, so that a UE is able to move between nearby such hierarchies without loss of sidelink service. However, since it is possible that a gNB/eNB does not itself have synchronization to GNSS, use of Levels 4-6 can be disabled when GNSS is used as Level 1, so that there is no deviation from the hierarchy being derived from GNSS.\nS-PSS and S-SSS use the same types of sequence as NR PSS and SSS respectively, i.e. an M-sequence and a Gold sequence. When in use, both sequences are transmitted in 127 subcarriers of the S-SSB bandwidth, in the same slots as PSBCH. S-PSS is in the 2nd and 3rd symbols of the slot, S-SSS is in the 4th and 5th symbols, and PSBCH and its DMRS in each of the remaining symbols. The two symbols of each synchronization signal are the same, which allows detectors to benefit from phase tracking between the two symbols. Figure 6.2.2.2-1 shows the contents of a slot containing S-SSB, the frequency location of which is (pre-)configured.\nThe figure depicts a slot containing S-SSB for normal CP, with each PSBCH symbol containing DMRS. This slot is part of a larger system, which includes S-SSB, S-SSB-1, and S-SSB-2, each with their respective DMRS. The DMRS are used to transmit data in the S-SSB system, ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 6.2.2.2-1: Contents of a slot containing S-SSB for normal CP. Each PSBCH symbol contains DMRS.\nS-SSB can be transmitted on one or multiple synchronization carriers. The MIB-V2X is transmitted on PSBCH every 160 ms, and thus S-SSB occurs on the same period. Within a period, there can be multiple transmissions of S-SSB, with the number depending on subcarrier spacing and frequency range. For details refer to TS 38.213 [18, clause 16.1].\nThe SLSSID itself conveys information about the synchronization source of the transmitting UE. In general, the further a UE is away from a high-quality source of GNSS or gNB/eNB, the lower quality will be its own synchronization and thus the quality of an SLSS it transmits. There are a series of association rules among SLSS IDs, designed to allow the identification, and propagation through the system of, high-quality synchronization sources. The operation of this procedure is essentially the same as LTE-V2X, described in Clause 5.1.2.2.1, with the main difference that there are 672 SLSS IDs in NR-V2X, divided into 0, 1, …, 335 for in-coverage indication and 336, …, 671 for out-of-coverage indication. The special SLSS IDs of 0, 336, and 337 in NR-V2X are used equivalently to 0, 168, and 169 respectively in LTE-V2X.\n",

In addition, it supports blind re-transmission schemes, which are described in clauses 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2 on resource allocation modes 1 and 2, respectively.\nWhen ACK/NACK (or DTX) operation is used, the sidelink HARQ procedure is similar to the Uu scheme for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ feedback is transmitted based on the success or failure of the whole transport block.\nNACK-only operation is defined for groupcast to allow a potentially lower sidelink resource demand to be created when a larger number of Rx UEs need to send feedback to the same Tx UE. A typical use case is an extended sensors scenario where UEs within a given radius all receive the same sensor information from the Tx UE, and re-transmission will occur if any UE fails to decode successfully. Since such information may only be relevant within a given radius around the Tx UE (e.g. a few tens or hundreds of meters around a road junction), the transmission of NACK-only feedback can be restricted to UEs within such a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide any HARQ feedback. The minimum range requirement of a service is provided together with the associated QoS parameters from service layers.\nOne bit of sidelink HARQ feedback is carried on PSFCH from an Rx UE to its Tx UE. In addition, when under the control of a gNB in resource allocation mode 1, the Tx UE informs the gNB via PUCCH or PUSCH of the status of the sidelink HARQ feedback it has computed related to a particular dynamic or configured grant to assist the scheduling of re-transmissions and allocation of sidelink resources.\n",

If the two RATs are widely spaced in frequency, e.g. being in different bands, then there need be no particular issues to consider since it is assumed that a separate RF chain will be provided for each band.\nIf, however, a sufficiently close frequency spacing is deployed, then it is desirable to enable a single RF chain to be used in the implementation, and also to adhere to the sidelink half-duplex principle established in LTE-V2X, i.e. that the UE is not required to simultaneously transmit and receive on sidelink. The former constraint means that interference between the two RATs' receptions can occur in the device if they are placed sufficiently close together in the frequency domain, and that simultaneous transmission on both RATs is prevented by the UE's single power budget. The latter constraint implies that one RAT cannot be received/transmitted while the other RAT is doing the opposite.\nIt is possible to (pre)-configure the resource pools for the two sidelinks such that overlapping is avoided entirely. When this is not arranged, the general rule is that (at least) one of the RATs may be dropped at times when both occur simultaneously, but that in some cases where the priority of the V2X service on both RATs is known, the higher priority one is automatically selected:\n-\tReceive/receive overlap handling is always left to UE implementation decision.\n-\tTransmit/transmit overlap handling and transmit/receive overlap handling will automatically select the RAT with the highest priority service if both priorities are known. If the priorities are equal or not both known, the handling is left to UE implementation to decide.\nIn the above rules, the priority of transmission and reception of sidelink synchronization signals/channels is set by (pre-)configuration and that of PSFCH is the same as the corresponding PSSCH.\nFor devices which contain both LTE-V2X and NR-V2X modules, there is support for the NR module to make use of information obtained from the LTE module's mode 4 resource allocation procedure in the NR mode 2 resource allocation procedure, when the subcarrier spacing of NR-V2X is 15 or 30 kHz.\nIn this feature, the NR module additionally excludes from its resource selection window resources which, according to LTE-V2X mode 4 information, are considered occupied by LTE-V2X transmissions by the same or other LTE-V2X UEs, as well as resources in which a NR PSCCH/PSSCH transmission would result in a corresponding PSFCH in such LTE resources. Occupancy can be determined according to relative priority between LTE-V2X and NR-V2X traffic, SL-RSRP, periodicity of LTE-V2X, and resources in which the LTE-V2X module did not sense.\nThere are similar steps as with NR's own resource selection to expand the candidate resource set if insufficient resources are found to be present.\n",

This provides a throughput gain in a similar way as for Uu CA.\nSidelink CA uses the sensing procedure described in Clause 6.3.2.2 to select resources independently on each involved carrier. The same carrier is used for all MAC PDUs of the same sidelink process at least until the process triggers resource re-selection.\nThe carrier(s) that can be used for transmitting data for a destination L2 ID are provided by the V2X layer per QoS flow. The V2X layer provides multiple carriers associated to a service type with QoS flow to carrier mapping information to the AS for all cast types. For groupcast and broadcast, TX profile is used to indicate whether the transmission corresponding to the service type is backward compatible or not.\nCarrier selection is performed at the MAC layer, depending on the CBR measurement of the allowed carriers associated to the logical channel priority. For unicast, CA related UE capability is exchanged between the TX UE and RX UE, and the TX UE delivers the carrier configuration to the RX UE in PC5-RRC.\nSidelink synchronization can also operate on multiple carriers, as mentioned in Clause 6.2.2.2. A SyncRef UE uses a single synchronization reference for all aggregated carriers, and may transmit S-SSB on one or multiple of them according to capability. A receiving UE likewise uses the same synchronization reference (not necessarily a SyncRef UE) for all its aggregated carriers, and it uses the highest priority synchronization reference present among the available synchronization carriers.\nAnother form of CA is PDCP duplication, where the same PDCP packet is transmitted in parallel on multiple sidelink carriers, to increase reliability. See Clause 6.5.8 for more discussion.\n",

                            "text_content": "BWPs are defined for the sidelink in a similar way as for UL/DL, to provide a convenient way to specify aspects relating to a UEs RF hardware chain implementation. A UE is configured with one active sidelink BWP when in connected mode to a gNB, which is the same as the single sidelink BWP used for idle mode or out-of-coverage operation.\nThe subcarrier spacing used on sidelink is provided in the sidelink BWP (pre-)configuration, from the same set of values and associations to frequency ranges as for the Uu interface (i.e. 15, 30, or 60 kHz for FR1; and 60 or 120 kHz for FR2).  Sidelink transmission and reception for a UE are thus contained within a sidelink BWP, and the same sidelink BWP is used for both transmitting and receiving. This means that resource pools, S-SSB, etc. must also be contained within an appropriate sidelink BWP from the UE's perspective.\nPSCCH and PSSCH resources are defined within resource pools for the respective channels. This concept is used because in general PSCCH/PSSCH cannot be transmitted (and thus are not expected to be received) in all RBs and slots in the NR system bandwidth, nor within the frequency span configured for V2X sidelink. The notion of a resource pool also reflects, in resource allocation mode 2, that a UE will make its resource selections based on sensing within the pool.\nA resource pool is divided into sub-channels in the frequency domain, which are consecutively non-overlapping sets of ≥10 PRBs in a slot, the size depending on (pre-)configuration. Resource allocation, sensing, and resource selection are performed in units of a sub-channel. The UE's PSCCH occupies a (pre-)configurable number of PRBs within one sub-channel, starting from the lowest PRB of the PSSCH it schedules.\nWithin the slots that can be used for PSSCH transmission, there can be from 7 to 14 of the symbols reserved for sidelink operation, of which PSSCH can be transmitted in 5 to 12 symbols. The remaining sidelink symbols transmit some or all of PSCCH, PSFCH, AGC symbol(s), guard symbol(s). Refer to Figure 6.2.1-1 for examples of slot formats.\nResource pools are (pre-)configured to a UE separately from the transmission perspective (TX pools) and the reception perspective (RX pools). This allows a UE to monitor for PSCCH, and hence receive PSSCH transmissions, in resource pools other than those in which it transmits, so that it can attempt to receive transmissions made by other UEs in those RX pools.\nIn addition, there are exceptional resource pools configured to a UE, in its serving cell's broadcast or in dedicated signalling. These can be used e.g. during RLF in some cases, handover, transition from RRC IDLE to RRC CONNECTED, or during change of dedicated V2X sidelink resource pools within a cell. In these cases, a UE may not have a stable configuration of TX resource pools but nevertheless should not be removed from the V2X system, and so it can randomly select resources in the exceptional pool, and use them temporarily. Likewise, UEs need to monitor the exceptional TX pools for PSCCH transmissions.\n",

                            "text_content": "Mode 1 is for resource allocation by gNB. As described in Clause 4, the use cases intended for NR V2X can generate a diverse array of periodic and aperiodic message types. Therefore, resource allocation mode 1 provides dynamic grants of sidelink resources from a gNB, as well as grants of periodic sidelink resources configured semi-statically by RRC, termed sidelink configured grants.\nA dynamic sidelink grant DCI can provide resources for one or multiple transmissions of a transport block, in order to allow control of reliability. The transmission(s) can be subject to the sidelink HARQ procedure, if that operation is enabled.\nA sidelink configured grant can be such that it is configured once and can be used by the UE immediately, until it is released by RRC signalling (known as Type 1). A UE is allowed to continue using this type of sidelink configured grant when beam failure or physical layer problems occur in NR Uu until an RLF detection timer expires, before falling back to an exception resource pool. The other type of sidelink configured grant, known as Type 2, is configured once but cannot be used until the gNB sends the UE a DCI indicating it is now active, and only until another DCI indicates de-activation. The resources in both types are a set of sidelink resources recurring with a periodicity which a gNB will desire to match to the characteristics of the V2X traffic. Multiple configured grants can be configured, to allow provision for different services, traffic types, etc.\nMCS information for dynamic and configured grants can optionally be provided or constrained by RRC signalling instead of the traditional DCI. RRC can configure the exact MCS the Tx UE uses, or a range of MCS. It may also be left unconfigured. For the cases where RRC does not provide the exact MCS, the transmitting UE is left to select an appropriate MCS itself based on the knowledge it has of the TB to be transmitted and, potentially, the sidelink radio conditions.\nThe gNB scheduling activity is driven by the UE reporting its sidelink traffic characteristics to the gNB, or by performing a sidelink BSR procedure similar to that on Uu to request a sidelink resource allocation from gNB.\nMode 2 is for UE autonomous resource selection. Its basic structure is of a UE sensing, within a (pre-)configured resource pool, which resources are not in use by other UEs with higher-priority traffic, and choosing an appropriate amount of such resources for its own transmissions. Having selected such resources, the UE can transmit and re-transmit in them a certain number of times, or until a cause of resource reselection is triggered.\nThe mode 2 sensing procedure can select and then reserve resources for a variety of purposes reflecting that NR V2X introduces sidelink HARQ in support of unicast and groupcast in the physical layer. It may reserve resources to be used for a number of blind (re-)transmissions or HARQ-feedback-based (re-)transmissions of a transport block, in which case the resources are indicated in the SCI(s) scheduling the transport block. Alternatively, it may select resources to be used for the initial transmission of a later transport block, in which case the resources are indicated in an SCI scheduling a current transport block, in a manner similar to the LTE-V2X scheme (clause 5.2.2.2). Finally, an initial transmission of a transport block can be performed after sensing and resource selection, but without a reservation.\nThe first-stage SCIs transmitted by UEs on PSCCH indicate the time-frequency resources in which the UE will transmit a PSSCH. These SCI transmissions are used by sensing UEs to maintain a record of which resources have been reserved by other UEs in the recent past. When a resource selection is triggered (e.g. by traffic arrival or a re-selection trigger), the UE considers a sensing window which starts a (pre-)configured time in the past and finishes shortly before the trigger time. The window can be either 1100 ms or 100 ms wide, with the intention that the 100 ms option is particularly useful for aperiodic traffic, and 1100 ms particularly for periodic traffic. A sensing UE also measures the SL-RSRP in the slots of the sensing window, which implies the level of interference which would be caused and experienced if the sensing UE were to transmit in them. In NR-V2X, SL-RSRP is a (pre-)configurable measurement of either PSSCH-RSRP or PSCCH-RSRP.\nThe sensing UE then selects resources for its (re-)transmission(s) from within a resource selection window. The window starts shortly after the trigger for (re-)selection of resources, and cannot be longer than the remaining latency budget of the packet due to be transmitted. Reserved resources in the selection window with SL-RSRP above a threshold are excluded from being candidates by the sensing UE, with the threshold set according to the priorities of the traffic of the sensing and transmitting UEs. Thus, a higher priority transmission from a sensing UE can occupy resources which are reserved by a transmitting UE with sufficiently low SL-RSRP and sufficiently lower-priority traffic.\nIf the set of resources in the selection window which have not been excluded is less than a certain proportion of the available resources within the window,  the SL-RSRP exclusion threshold is relaxed in 3 dB steps. The proportion is set by (pre-)configuration to 20%, 35%, or 50% for each traffic priority. The UE selects an appropriate amount of resources randomly from this non-excluded set. The resources selected are not in general periodic. Up to three resources can be indicated in each SCI transmission, which can each be independently located in time and frequency. When the indicated resources are for semi-persistent transmission of another transport block, the range of supported periodicities is expanded compared to LTE-V2X, in order to cover the broader set of envisioned use cases in NR-V2X.\nShortly before transmitting in a reserved resource, a sensing UE re-evaluates the set of resources from which it can select, to check whether its intended transmission is still suitable, taking account of late-arriving SCIs due, typically, to an aperiodic higher-priority service starting to transmit after the end of the original sensing window. If the reserved resources would not be part of the set for selection at this time (T3), then new resources are selected from the updated resource selection window. The cut-off time T3 is long enough before transmission to allow the UE to perform the calculations relating to resource re-selection.\nThe timeline of the sensing and resource (re-)selection windows with respect to the time of trigger n, are shown in Figure 6.3.2.2-2(a), and the effect of the possibility of re-evaluation before first use of the reservation in Figure 6.3.2.2-2(b).\nThere are a number of triggers for resource re-selection, several of which are similar to LTE-V2X in Clause 5.2.2.2. In addition, there is the possibility to configure a resource pool with a pre-emption function designed to help accommodate aperiodic sidelink traffic, so that a UE reselects all the resources it has already reserved in a particular slot if another nearby UE with higher priority indicates it will transmit in any of them, implying a high-priority aperiodic traffic arrival at the other UE, and the SL-RSRP is above the exclusion threshold. The application of pre-emption can apply between all priorities of data traffic, or only when the priority of the pre-empting traffic is higher than a threshold and higher than that of the pre-empted traffic. A UE does not need to consider the possibility of pre-emption later than time T3 before the particular slot containing the reserved resources.\n\nThe figure depicts a summary of sensing and resource (re-)selection procedures in a wireless communication system. It illustrates the various steps involved in determining the best path for a signal to travel, including the use of sensing techniques to detect obstacles and the selection of the most efficient path based on the available resources. This figure is crucial for understanding the complex process of signal transmission and the importance of efficient resource allocation in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-1: Summary of sensing and resource (re-)selection procedures\nThe figure depicts a timeline of the sensing and resource re-selection procedure triggered at time n, without re-evaluation before m.

Its first reserved resource is at time m.\nThe figure depicts a timeline of the sensing and resource re-selection procedure in a wireless network, illustrating the process of re-evaluation of resources. The timeline starts with the triggering of the sensing and resource re-selection procedure at time n, which has a first reserved resource at time m. The re-evaluation process continues until time m - T3, when the resources are no longer selectable. The new re-evaluation cut-off is determined by the new re-evaluation cut-off at time m - T3.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-2(b): Timeline of sensing and resource (re-)selection procedure originally triggered at time n, which has a first reserved resource at time m, when re-evaluation occurring at m-T3 determines the resources are no longer selectable.

The main differences are that each packet is associated with a single 'priority' value, passed down to the physical layer from upper layers, which is comparable to PPPP in LTE-V2X. The priority value is transmitted in the first-stage SCI associated with each transport block. Broadly equivalent measurements of CBR and CR, together with CR-limits are defined, which can be used similarly to constrain the ranges of transmission parameters. NR V2X sets a shorter time of 1 ms or 2 ms in which the UE must calculate the CR and CBR than LTE-V2X's 4 ms, with the aim of adapting to faster fluctuations in congestion due to aperiodic traffic.\n",

            "description": "LTE-V2X was developed over the course of two 3GPP Releases, Rel-14 and Rel-15. In Rel-15, non-backward compatible changes to physical transmission formats were introduced, primarily to support the use of 64-QAM on PSSCH compared to the maximum of 16-QAM in Rel-14. Such transmissions cannot be decoded by Rel-14 UEs. However, on sidelink, a transmitting UE cannot know the Release of specifications supported by the UEs which will receive the PSSCH transmission, since the transmission is broadcast in the physical layer. Therefore, the concept of transmission profiles was introduced, which associates to each transmission by a Rel-15 UE a (pre-)configuration of which Release's transmission format to use. A transmitting UE performs transmission format selection based on the profile indicated by higher layer of the 3GPP protocol stack. If a Rel-14 format is indicated, then the transmission can be decoded by both Releases of UE, whereas if Rel-15 format is indicated, it can be decoded only by Rel-15 UEs. When a UE has traffic from different application sources to transmit at the same time, the transmission profile associated with the highest-priority traffic is applied. The association of transmission profiles to traffic sources (specifically, logical channels) is provided by 3GPP protocol layers outside of RAN.\nTransmission profiles are also defined in NR, for the support of sidelink DRX, which was introduced in Rel-17; see Clause 9.3. This is to ensure compatibility for sidelink groupcast and broadcast between UEs supporting and not supporting sidelink DRX, since a receiver UE would miss transmissions sent in its DRX inactive times. Only if all those transmission profiles of interest to the receiver UE correspond to support of sidelink DRX does the UE assume it can be used. Similarly, a transmitting UE only assumes sidelink DRX is used by its groupcast or broadcast receiver UEs when the relevant transmission profile corresponds to support of sidelink DRX.\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "As described in Clause 5.2.2.2, a LTE-V2X UE performs sensing continuously in a 1000 ms historical window, implying an amount of ongoing power consumption due to the sensing procedure. It is allowed for a LTE P-UE to not support sidelink reception, so that it is only broadcasting packets relating to its own location and direction. This type of P-UE is allowed, if a resource pool's (pre-)configuration permits, to select transmission resources randomly, with no sensing procedure. For a LTE P-UE which does support sidelink reception, it can be permitted by (pre-)configuration to perform partial sensing. In partial sensing, only a subset of the subframes in the typically 1000 ms sensing window have to be monitored. The LTE UE implementation can choose how few subframes it wishes to monitor, by trading off the reliability of its transmissions with the power saving, subject to monitoring a (pre-)configured minimum number. (Pre-)configuration can also set how far into the past the sensing window extends, and can require that the UE performs partial sensing in a number of these truncated sensing windows.\nIn NR-V2X, there are two similar power-saving resource allocation methods which, as well as being applicable to P-UEs and VRUs, are also intended to have applicability to non-V2X applications. As with LTE-V2X, a UE is allowed, if a resource pool's (pre-)configuration permits, to select transmission resources randomly, with no sensing procedure. To retain the higher reliability provided by sidelink HARQ, the resources selected must still obey the constraints of HARQ feedback preparation time, and allow successive re-transmission resources to be signalled in the reach of one SCI.\nFor partial sensing in NR-V2X, there is a need to account for the wider set of targeted periodicities, and also for aperiodic traffic. Partial sensing therefore has two parts: periodic-based (PBPS), and contiguous (CPS). PBPS is similar to the LTE-V2X partial sensing, where a UE chooses a set of Y candidate slots, subject to a minimum number, and monitors that set. The UE can be (pre-)configured to monitor the Y slots at least according to a subset or the whole set of periodicities configured in the resource pool. When traffic arrives at slot n, sensing information from either the most recent one, or the most recent two, monitoring occasions of Y slots at each relevant periodicity is used in performing resource (re-)selection. PBPS is designed to provide sufficient sensing information to manage resource allocation for periodic traffic, whilst providing configurability to balance sensing accuracy with power consumption. On its own, PBPS may not be sufficient for detecting aperiodic traffic. For this purpose, CPS is performed in each of at least M sidelink slots ending shortly before the first of the Y candidates. M can be (pre-)configured to balance detection of aperiodic SCIs with UE power consumption. An example of this combined PBPS and CPS operation is shown in Figure 9.1. It is also possible for the UE to perform only CPS, if the resource pool does not permit periodic reservations.\nThe figure depicts a partial sensing scenario in a 5G network, where the network operator (NO) is able to detect the presence of a candidate slot (Y) in a candidate slot (Y) and a sidelink slot (M) in a candidate slot (Y) using partial sensing. The figure shows the PBPS (Partial Sensing) of Y candidate slots at two periodicities, P1 and P2, for the two most recent PBPS occasions before slot n. The CPS (Candidate Sensing) for M sidelink slots ending a processing time before the Y candidate slots is also depicted. This figure illustrates the concept of partial sensing in 5G networks, where the network operator can detect the presence of a candidate slot in a candidate slot and a sidelink slot in a candidate slot, using partial sensing techniques.\nFigure 9.1: Example of NR partial sensing. PBPS of Y candidate slots at two periodicities, P1 and P2, for the two most recent PBPS occasions before slot n, and CPS for M sidelink slots ending a processing time before the Y candidate slots.\nFor partial sensing applied to periodic transmissions, re-evaluation and pre-emption are also performed before the resources are used (see Clause 6.3.2.2) for the remaining PBPS candidate slots, and CPS slots preceding them.\n",

In the DRX active part of the cycle, full or partial sensing is performed as usual, together with reception and decoding of PSCCH, PSSCH, etc. In the DRX inactive part, a UE only performs reception of PSCCH and SL-RSRP measurements for sensing. When resource (re-)selection is performed, the physical layer ensures that at least a subset of the resources reported to the MAC layer are within the active time of the UE to which the intended transmission will be sent.\nSidelink DRX is supported for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. For unicast, sidelink DRX is configured per pair of source L2 ID and destination L2 ID.

RSU is a logical entity that supports V2X application logic using the functionality provided by either a 3GPP network (referred to as an eNB/gNB-type RSU) or a UE (referred to as UE-type RSU).\nSince an RSU is essentially only different from a eNB/gNB or UE in terms of its deployment nature, e.g. it may be deployed by a national roads authority instead of an MNO, there is no specification of features particular to RSUs. They operate simply according to sidelink or UL/DL specifications as appropriate.\n\n\n\n",
