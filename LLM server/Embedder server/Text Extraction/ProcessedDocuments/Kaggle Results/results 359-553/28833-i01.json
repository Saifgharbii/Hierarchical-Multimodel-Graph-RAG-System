            "description": "4.1\tGeneral description\nAs defined in TS 23.501 [2], A 5G Virtual Network (VN) group consists of a set of UEs using private communication for 5G LAN-type services. The service requirements for 5G LAN-type service are specified in TS 22.261 [3].\n5G VN Group is a set of UEs using private communication for 5G LAN-type service.\n4.2\tUser plane architecture to support 5G LAN-type Services\nThere are two types of user plane architecture to allow 5G LAN-type services:\n-\tLocal switch, where traffic is locally forwarded by a single UPF if this UPF is the common PSA UPF of different PDU Sessions for the same 5G VN group. Figure 4.2-2 depicts the non-roaming user plane architecture to support 5G LAN-type service using local switch.\nThe figure depicts a local-switch based user plane architecture in a non-roaming scenario, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The user plane is composed of a local switch, a router, and a set of user equipment (UE). The local switch is responsible for routing traffic between the user equipment and the network, while the router handles the routing decisions and traffic management. The user equipment is responsible for receiving and processing the traffic, and the router is responsible for forwarding the traffic to the appropriate user equipment. The figure also includes a set of distributed nodes, which are responsible for providing additional capacity and redundancy to the network. The layered design of the architecture aligns with SDN principles, allowing for better network management and control.\nFigure 4.2-1: Local-switch based user plane architecture in non-roaming scenario\n-\tN19-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN group communication is forwarded between PSA UPFs of different PDU sessions via N19. N19 is a reference point between two UPFs for direct routing of traffic between different PDU Sessions without using N6. It has a per 5G VN group granularity. Figure 4.2-2 depicts the non-roaming user plane architecture to support 5G LAN-type service using N19 tunnel.\nThe figure depicts a user plane architecture in a non-roaming scenario, illustrating the use of N19-based signaling for efficient communication. The architecture includes a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and a network layer (NL). Key components include the network layer, which is responsible for routing and forwarding traffic, and the user equipment, which is responsible for receiving and processing data. The figure also shows the use of N19 signaling, which is a key feature in this architecture, allowing for efficient communication and reducing the need for redundant paths.\nFigure 4.2-2: N19-based user plane architecture in non-roaming scenario\n4.3\t5G VN group management\n5G System supports management of 5G VN Group identification and membership (i.e. definition of 5G VN group identifiers and membership) and 5G VN Group data (i.e. definition of 5G VN group data). The 5G VN Group management can be configured by a network administrator or can be managed dynamically by AF.\nA 5G VN group is characterized by the following:\n-\t5G VN group identities: External Group ID and Internal Group ID are used to identify the 5G VN group.\n-\t5G VN group membership: The 5G VN group members are uniquely identified by GPSI. The group as described in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 [4] is applicable to 5G LAN-type services.\n-\t5G VN group data. The 5G VN group data may include the following parameters: PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI and Application descriptor, Information related with secondary authentication / authorization (e.g. to enable IP address assignment by the DN-AAA).\nThe Information related with secondary authentication / authorization corresponds to the procedures described in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2]; it allows e.g. the AF to provide DN-AAA server addressing information and possibly to request the SMF to get the UE IP address from the DN-AAA server.\nIn order to support dynamic management of 5G VN Group identification and membership, the NEF exposes a set of services to manage (e.g. add/delete/modify) 5G VN groups and 5G VN members. The NEF also exposes services to dynamically manage 5G VN group data.\nThe support of 5G VN group management configured by a network administrator (OAM-based 5G VN group management) is described in clause 5.25.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n",

The PDU session establishment procedure for a UE to access the 5G LAN-type service is described in TS 23.502 [4].\nSession management as defined for 5GS in clause 5.6 of TS 23.501 [2] is applicable to 5G-VN-type services with the following clarification and enhancement:\n-\tA UE gets access to 5G LAN-type services via a PDU Session of IP PDU Session type or Ethernet PDU Session type.\n-\tA PDU Session provides access to one and only one 5G VN group. The PDU Sessions accessing to a certain 5G VN group should all anchor at the same network, i.e. the common home network of 5G VN group members.\n-\tThe SM level subscription data for a DNN and S-NSSAI available in UDM, as described in clause 5.6.1 of TS 23.501 [1], applies to the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group.\n-\tSession management related policy control for a DNN and S-NSSAI as described in TS 23.502 [3], is applicable to the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group. This includes also usage of URSP, for the UE to determine how to route outgoing traffic to a PDU Session for the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group.\n-\tSession and service continuity SSC mode 1, SSC mode 2, and SSC mode 3 as described in clause 5.6.9 are applicable to N6-based traffic forwarding of 5G VN communication within the associated 5G VN group.\n-\tA PDU Session provides unicast, broadcast and multicast communication for the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group. The PSA UPF determines whether the communication is for unicast, broadcast or multicast based on the destination address of the received data, and performs unicast, broadcast or multicast communication handling.\n-\tDuring the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF retrieves SM subscription data related to 5G-VN type service from the UDM as part of the UE subscription data for the DNN and S-NSSAI.\n-\tIn order to realize N19 traffic routing, the SMF correlates PDU sessions established to the same 5G VN group and uses this to configure the UPF with the group level N4-session including packet detection and forwarding rules for N19 tunnelling forwarding.\nUser Plane management as defined for 5GS in clause 5.8 of TS 23.501 [2] is applicable to 5G LAN-type services with the following clarifications:\n-\tThere are three types of traffic forwarding methods allowed for 5G VN communication:\n-\tN6-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN communication is forwarded to/from the DN;\n-\tN19-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN group communication is forwarded between PSA UPFs of different PDU sessions via N19. N19 is based on a shared User Plane tunnel connecting PSA UPFs of a single 5G VN group.\n-\tLocal switch, where traffic is locally forwarded by a single UPF if this UPF is the common PSA UPF of different PDU Sessions for the same 5G VN group.\n-\tThe SMF handles the user plane paths of the 5G VN group, including:\n-\tThe SMF may prefer to select a single PSA UPF for as many PDU sessions (targeting the same 5G VN group) as possible, in order to implement local switch on the UPF.\n-\t(if needed) Establishing N19 tunnels between PSA UPFs to support N19-based traffic forwarding.\n-\tFor Ethernet PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the UPF(s) to classify frames based on VLAN tags, and to add and remove VLAN tags, on frames received and sent on N6 or N19 or internal interface (\"5G VN internal\"), as described in clause 5.6.10.2 of TS 23.501[2].\nThe NRM IOC of SMFFunction is specified in clause 5.3.2 of TS 28.541 [5]. The attributes of managedNFProfile in SMFFunction IOC can include smfinfo of the configured SMF to serve a 5G VN group communication. So as the DNN/S-NSSAI for the SMF serving a 5G LAN-type communication service can be provided based on current definition of NRM IOC for SMFFunction.\nIn order to support the 5G VN Group management configurated by OAM, the procedure of management of the PDU session of 5G VN Group configuration for network function is following.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for managing the PDU session of 5G VN Group configuration for network functions. It includes a detailed explanation of each step, ensuring a clear understanding of the process.\nFigure 5.2.4.2-1: Procedure of management of the PDU session of 5G VN Group configuration for network functions\n1.\tThe management service provider after received the 5G LAN-type service requirements from customers can allocate the 5G LAN-type service request to the management service provider, which may be the management function of network functions, including External Group Id and 5G VN group configurations.\n2.\tThe management service customer allocates the 5G LAN-type service configuration to the specific network functions (e.g. AMF/SMF/NRF/UDM). The attributes of managedNFProfile in network functions' IOC can include the information of 5G VN group related information and the correspondence between the 5G VN group ID and the supported SMFs.\n3.\tThe management service customer sends respond to the management service provider.\n",

The performance indicators are split into subcounters per Internal Group ID for 5G VN group.\nIn case a performance measurement is defined for more than one sub-counter, it is convenient to use Filter to define the performance measurement of interest (see TS 23.552[6]). Therefore, a new Filter value Internal Group ID is added.\nThe DNN/S-NSSAI for the SMF serving a 5G LAN-type communication service which is already provided based on current definition of NRM IOC for SMFFunction.
