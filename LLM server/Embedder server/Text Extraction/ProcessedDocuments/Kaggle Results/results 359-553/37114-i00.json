For EMC requirements of the MSR BS for BS type 1-C, refer to TS 37.113 [4].\nThe present document specifies the applicable test conditions, performance assessment and performance criteria for base stations in the following categories:\n-\tActive Antenna System Base Station for UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA, NR and MSR meeting the conducted requirements of TS 37.105 [2], with conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 37.145-1 [3],\n-\tActive Antenna System Base Station for UTRA FDD, E-UTRA, NR and MSR meeting the OTA requirements of 3TS 37.105 [2], with conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 37.145-2 [10].\nTechnical requirements related to the TAB connector are not included in the present document. These are found in the relevant product standards [2, 3, 10].\nThe present document does not cover ancillary equipment requirements, where ancillary equipment is not incorporated in the radio equipment and can be assessed on a stand-alone basis, as declared by the manufacturer. Ancillary equipment EMC requirements are still applicable to the AAS BS and are covered by other EMC specifications in TS 25.113 [5], TS 36.113 [6], TS 37.113 [4] or TS 38.113 [30].\nThe present document does not specify test conditions, performance assessment and performance criteria for the Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in single RAT E-UTRA operation as defined in TS 36.113 [6], or for AAS BS in MSR operation using E-UTRA as defined in TS 37.113 [4].\nThe present document does not specify test conditions, performance assessment and performance criteria for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by AAS BS.\nThe scope of the present document is twofold:\n-\tRequirement, procedures and values of a hybrid AAS BS with TAB connectors for every transceiver unit at the transceiver array boundary (TAB), subject to conducted requirements,\nNOTE 3:\thybrid AAS BS in the single RAT NR operation is equivalent to BS type 1-H defined in NR BS specification TS 38.104 [31].\n-\tRequirements, procedures and values of an OTA AAS BS without TAB connectors and relying in the radiated interface, subject to radiated requirements.\nNOTE 4:\tOTA AAS BS in the single RAT NR operation is equivalent to BS type 1-O defined in NR BS specification TS 38.104 [31].\nThe electromagnetic environment classification used in the present document refers to the residential, commercial and light industrial environment classification used in IEC 61000-6-1 [7] and IEC 61000-6-3 [8].\nThe EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial environments.
