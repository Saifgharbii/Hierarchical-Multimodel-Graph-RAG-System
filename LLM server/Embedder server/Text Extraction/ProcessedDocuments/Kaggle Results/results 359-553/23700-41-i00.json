            "description": "The Technical Report studies the gaps and performs evaluations of potential architecture enhancements to support Network Slicing with the following objectives:\n1.\tStudy whether and how to address the following scenario in order to provide service continuity: if an existing network slice or network slice instance cannot serve the PDU session, or if the existing network slice instance cannot meet the performance requirements of the applications. The study should investigate whether deployment optimization is sufficient. Minimized system optimisations can be considered if valuable.\n2.\tStudy whether and how to initiate a registration for a rejected S-NSSAI that was rejected in a first TA of the RA but may be available in another TA of the RA.\n3.\tStudy whether and how to support the following stage one Rel-18 EASNS requirements related to roaming specified in TS 22.261 clause 6.1.2.1, i.e. Requirement on enhancement the information available to the UE in roaming scenarios regarding the availability of network slices in VPLMNs available in the roaming country, in order to allow the UE to select and obtain services from the VPLMN supporting the network slices which UE may wish to use.\n4.\tStudy whether and how to enhance the system to ensure network controlled behaviour of network slice usage including UE registration and PDU Session establishment (e.g. so that when performing NSAC the network slice can serve UEs/PDU Sessions with actual activity).\n5\tStudy deployment considerations when a service provided has an area of service that does not overlap with the already deployed Tracking Areas and/or have a limited lifetime and how existing mechanisms including network slicing can help support such scenarios. If existing mechanisms are concluded to be not sufficient to achieve the scenarios, study whether and how additional mechanisms can resolve the analysed gap.\n6.\tStudy whether and how to enhance the support of NSAC when more than one NSACF is involved in enforcing a shared maximum allowed number of the UEs or PDU Sessions for a network slice in one PLMN or in roaming, in order to avoid fragmentation of the shared maximum allowed number. This item depends on the outcome of corresponding Rel-17 CRs.\n",

Also, it is not clear whether a UE can be requested by the operator to establish connectivity with a DNN based on own logic and URSPs at any time e.g. based on the UE configuration alone.\nOperators currently do not have the ability to enforce when the UE can register with network slices based on e.g. only on actual need of connectivity in a network slice, or by configuration independent of detected need of connectivity, etc. depending on e.g. what is best for the domain of application (e.g. to save battery usage one may just register based on configuration despite the URSPs are provisioned, or, when NSAC is applied on the number of UEs, the operators may want the UE to deregister from the slice subject to NSAC and register with it based on actual usage.)Operators also cannot provide to the UE a policy for deregistration of a network slice or tear down of a PDU session (e.g. the operator cannot control the time when a PDU session is released after it is last needed by any application running in the UE, nor can the operator define the earliest time a UE is allowed to deregister from a network slice after there are no more PDU sessions established over it).\nThere is also no way for the serving PLMN to steer a UE to a preferred slice of the serving PLMN (i.e. the HPLMN or VPLMN) even if the UE may have the related HPLMN slice included in the possible connectivity options (URSP) for one application.\nNOTE:\tfor the purpose of this Key Issue, usage of a PDU session means there is at least one application actually uses the connectivity of the PDU session.\nThis Key Issue will study how to enable network-controlled behaviour and ensure the proper utilization of Slices in the system (e.g. what the network can request to the UE and how and what additional policies the network can provide to the UE) taking into account the above aspects (e.g. actual slice usage, UE activity, etc.).\n",

The scenario covers the case where NFs (e.g. AMF, SMF, UPF...) in a network slice instance support multiple S-NSSAIs. How to split the resource depends on implementation. It is possible that the resource of one S-NSSAI is getting congested, while other S-NSSAI is not (e.g. there is a fixed allocation of resources to each S-NSSAI in the NF instances). This solution proposes that when one S-NSSAI is congested, the network can associate the PDU session with additional S-NSSAI in order to provide service continuity during mobility scenario (scenario 2d), so the resource allocated in SMF and/or UPF for one S-NSSAI can be shared by other S-NSSAI if other S-NSSAI is getting congested. This solution can also be used for PDU Session establishment procedure in scenario 1b.\nEditor's note:\tThe validity of the scenario that this solution covers is to be further assessed.\nNOTE:\tThis solution may be extended to cover no mobility scenarios 1b and 1c described in clause 5.1.1\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether and how the PDU Session can be associated with more than one S-NSSAI within a PLMN\n",

The AMF, SMF and UPF is configured with which S-NSSAIs are associated with the network slice instance. When the UE establishes PDU session it determines the requested S-NSSAI based on the URSP rules. The PDU Session is initially associated with this requested S-NSSAI. When this requested S-NSSAI become congested in the area of interest, the network may associate the PDU session with an additional S-NSSAI which can be associated with the network slice instance and is not congested in this area. The network then sends during the PDU Session establishment this additional S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session to the NG-RAN, instead of the original requested S-NSSAI. After the S-NSSAI congestion is mitigated, the network may remove the additional S-NSSAI of the PDU Session locally in the CN.\nThe AMF may determine the S-NSSAI is congested in the area of interest and the impacted PDU sessions based on the load level information or service experience for a Network Slice or network slice instance provided by the NWDAF.\nWhen the AMF determines to associate the PDU session with an additional S-NSSAI and if there is an I-SMF, the AMF provides the additional S-NSSAI to the I-SMF and the I-SMF provides the additional S-NSSAI to the SMF. If there is no I-SMF, the AMF provides the additional S-NSSAI to SMF. The I-SMF/SMF uses this additional S-NSSAI in the N2 information and send it to NG-RAN. The I-SMF/SMF may also send the additional S-NSSAI to the UPF.\nThis additional S-NSSAI is not provided to the UE, so from UE perspective the PDU session is still associated with the original requested S-NSSAI and therefore no impact on the UE side. Since the PDU session is still associated with the original requested S-NSSAI, the anchor SMF/UPF and the IP address is not changed so service continuity is ensured.\nNOTE 1:\tFrom RAN perspective, the PDU session is only associated with single S-NSSAI\nEditor's note:\tIn this solution PDU session can be associated with different S-NSSAIs in UE and RAN node. The impact on the RAN is FFS.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is not necessary that the additional S-NSSAI is part of Allowed NSSAI.\nFor PDU Session with home routed scenario, the AMF may determine to associate this PDU session with additional S-NSSAI in the VPLMN. The AMF doesn't update the slice mapping between VPLMN and HPLMN in the UE.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the AMF detects that the original requested S-NSSAI is not congested, the AMF may remove the additional S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session.\nDuring PDU Session establishment procedure, if the requested S-NSSAI is congested in this area, the AMF may also determine to associate both the requested S-NSSAI and the additional S-NSSAI with the PDU session.\n",

Specifically, the RAN is based on local information detecting the target RAN node cannot serve the current slice and it is configured with a valid replacement so it can continue the sessions associated with the replaced slice temporality till they are replaced by session with the correct slice. This may be dues to e.g. the AMFs in target RAN node region not supporting the S-NSSAI any more for e.g. maintenance or other causes so they provide an AMF configuration update to tell the RAN a S-NSSAI no longer is supported and a replacement is defined for it.\nThis solution relies on using SSC mode 3 type of service continuity in a network-controlled manner across network slices (SSC3 only operates for same DNN and S-NSSAI today so strictly speaking this is not the existing SSC mode 3).

                            "text_content": "The call flow below in figure 6.3.3-1 proposes using SSC mode 3 type of mobility across network slices to provide the service continuity solution. A single NG-RAN node may also be involved, two NG-RAN nodes are shown for generality and only the Xn Handover case is shown but this can apply also to NG Handover. Also, more than one AMF can be involved but for simplicity only one is considered (if more than one is involved there is an extra AMF reallocation step to be added where the context is transferred alongside the slice remapping information).\nThe figure depicts a service continuity scenario in a 3G network, illustrating the process of a slice change. The figure shows the network topology, including the base station (BTS), user equipment (UE), and the network slicing (NS). The slice change is indicated by the change in the color of the network, from green to red, indicating the transition to a new slice. The figure also shows the network's redundancy paths, which are shown in dashed lines, ensuring that the network can continue to function even if a slice is changed.\nFigure 6.3.3-1: service continuity upon slice change\n1.\tAMF has sent the UE Allowed NSSAI to the serving NG-RAN node as part of the registration and the UE per existing procedures. The UE had indicated to the AMF it supports this new feature in the registration request.\n2.\tUE has ongoing PDU session 1 of slice 10 where the SMF has indicated to the AMF is support this SSC mode 3 like type of behaviour across slices.\n3.\tSource NG-RAN triggers Handover to target NG-RAN. The target NG-RAN node 2 informs during the HO procedure the source NG-RAN node 1 that it accepts the PDU session 1 of slice 10 temporarily due to slice re-mapping action which it has been configured with for slice 10. It also indicates the new slice 11 for the PDU session. It is assumed that the AMF provided this information to impacted NG-RAN nodes by indication of the alternative slice is replacing the overloaded slice by a NG-AP AMF Configuration Update procedure.\n4.\tAt handover completion, the target NG-RAN indicates to AMF in Path Switch Request that PDU session 1 of slice 10 needs to be terminated and a new PDU session is to be setup with slice 11.\n5.\tThe AMF provides a new Allowed NSSAI including both S-NSSAI 10 and S-NSSAI11 in the UE Configuration Update command and may include S-NSSAI 11 in the Configured NSSAI as temporary S-NSSAI replacing S-NSSAI 10. Because the AMF has received (end slice 10) at step 4, the AMF still includes the slice 10 in the Allowed NSSAI towards the UE at this step (the slice is indeed still temporarily available until it receives from SMF notification of the final release of PDU session 1 of slice 10 at step 9). This is just a temporary allowed NSSAI that will be soon replaced and may include two S-NSSAIs in the serving PLMN supporting same HPLMN S-NSSAI exceptionally. The Allowed NSSAI information element is indicating that a S-NSSAI is Allowed to replace another S-NSSAI in the Allowed S-NSSAI. In roaming case, this additional allowed S-NSSAI maps to the same HPLMN slice(s) (temporarily). This should be possible as what slice maps to HPLMN slice(s) is a VPLMN decision (whether permanently or temporarily). The Configured NSSAI update may not be required if SA2 will specify this is not updated for this case and the UE shall ignore inconsistencies. The AMF may include back off timer for the original slice and/or includes the original slice in the Rejected NSSAI to prevent the UE requesting the slice due to URSP rule re-evaluation.\n6.\tAMF sends an Update message to SMF indicating end of PDU session 1 of slice 10 and remapping to slice 11. The SMF triggers step 7 as the UE has indicated SSC mode 3.\n7.\tIn reaction to step 5, the SMF triggers towards the UE the NAS PDU Session Modification Command (Cause, PCO (PDU Session Address Lifetime value), end slice 10, new slice 11) to invoke SSC mode 3 type of behaviour. The (end slice 10, new 11) may be included towards the UE to prompt the UE to setup the new PDU session 2 with slice 11. By this feature the possibility that SSC mode 3 type of behaviour applies across slices is introduced even if the UE had not indicated the existing SSC mode 3 when the PDU session was established.\n8.\tThe UE triggers the establishment of PDU session 2 with slice 11 according to SSC mode 3 procedure as per existing procedures described in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [5]. The S-NSSAI requested is S-NSSAI 11, the DNN is the same as used for the existing PDU session.\n9.\tAt the expiry of SSC mode 3 timer, the SMF triggers the release of the PDU session 1 of slice 10 according to SSC mode 3 procedures (existing procedures described in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [5]).\n10.\tUpon notification from the SMF that PDU session of no longer supported slice 10 has been released, the AMF sends a final the UCU (UE Configuration Update) message in order to update the Allowed NSSAI towards the NG-RAN and the UE. In this example, the new Allowed NSSAI is slice 11. When the slice 10 can be resumed the inverse procedure can take place by swapping slice 11 with slice 10 using the same method.\n",

The UDM may retrieve the UE capabilities to handle the slice-based SoR information. The slice-based SoR information may be either generated in the UDM or the UDM may request the SoR AF to create it.\nIf the UDM can create the slice-based SoR information itself, the UDM proceeds further with step 5.\nAfter the UE's UPU/SoR capabilities are retrieved, they may be stored in the UDM on per IMEI basis.\nNOTE:\tThe conclusion clause for this KI to explicitly mentions that the procedure includes the functions performed by UDM, SoR AF independently.\n2.\tThe UDM initiates towards the SoR AF an Nsoraf_SoR_Get Request (VPLMN ID), SUPI of the UE, access type (see TS 29.571 [6], subscribed S-NSSAIs, UE location, UE capability to receive enhanced information). The UDM passes transparently information included in the container and relevant for the SoR AF to consider.\n3.\tSoR AF creates slice-based SoR information taking into account the information provided by the UDM and availability of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs in the possible VPLMNs. To enable the SoR AF to create the slice-based SoR information, the SoR AF scans the possible list of VPLMNs and for each one determines the extent to which the Subscribed NSAAIs are supported. The SoR AF may then order the information as an example as shown below:\n-\tVPLMNs supporting all the Subscribed NSSAIs in any order preferred by HPLMN.\n-\tVPLMN supporting a subset of the Subscribed NSSAIs in any order preferred by HPLMN.\n-\tList of additional networks supporting the Subscribed NSSAIs or Requested NSSAIs not preferred by HPLMN.\nEditor's note:\tAdditional information to be included is FFS.\n4.\tSoR AF sends the slice-based SoR information to the UDM in a Nsoraf_SoR_Get Response.\n5.\tUDM sends the slice-based \"steering of roaming information\" to the UE via the AMF.\n6.\tUE uses the slice-based SoR info and if the Allowed NSSAI doesn't include all slices desired by the UE then the UE scans for VPLMN supporting the S-NSSAIs not in Allowed NSSAI and selects and registers accordingly.\nThe two options for UDM detection of UE capabilities are described below. Both options incorporate the common aspects between them for completeness and clarity. Steps 2 to 4 and step 6 are common for both options.\nThe procedure below implements the UE initiated option to indicate the UPU/SoR capabilities.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an UE initiates a request for extended SoR information, indicating a potential issue with the network's signaling or data transmission.\nFigure 6.6.3.1.1-1: UE Initiated for Extended SoR Information\nThe steps in the call flow are described briefly below:\n1.\tWhile roaming, the UE includes a new transparent container in a 5GC Registration Request, when UE performs Initial Registration or when the UE wants HPLMN to be aware of UE changes e.g. UE capability changes or UE requests new network slices. This new container is an indication that the UE wants the UDM to provide the UE with information relevant to Subscribed/Requested NSSAIs in the current VPLMN as well as other VPLMNs where the UE is currently located. The container includes the requested information and includes UE information that is pertinent to the request. The UE may send a protected container (transparent for AMF i.e. container is protected with home network security information) that includes info relevant for UDM e.g. UE capabilities, UE location, Requested NSSAI, etc.\nNOTE:\tSecurity aspects on how to protect the UE capabilities provided by the UE are to be discussed in SA WG3.\n2.\tnew info: AMF forwards the received container transparently from the UE in the Nudm_UECM_Reg Request towards the UDM.\n3.\tUDM uses UE capabilities to check that UE supports ability to handle the additional information and if the UE does support the additional information, then UDM initiates a request to the SoR AF and indicates in such a request the UE capabilities.\n4.\tThis is identical to step 2 in clause 6.6.3.1.\n5.\tThis is identical to step 3 in clause 6.6.3.1.\n6.\tThis is identical to step 4 in clause 6.6.3.1.\n7.\tHPLMN (or CH) sends SoR information within the Access and Mobility Subscription data i.e. AMF is transparent to the content of such data.\n8.\tAMF forwards the \"steering of roaming information\" within the Registration Accept as per current specification.\n9.\tThis is identical to step 6 in clause 6.6.3.1.\nThe procedure below implements the Network triggered option to retrieve the UPU/SoR capabilities.\nThe figure depicts a network initiated for extended SoR information, with a focus on the network initiated for extended SoR information.

During that procedure, the UDM may interact with the SoR AF to provide SoR info to the UE during initial registration (e.g. based on local configuration)\n2.\tUDM decides to fetch the UE capabilities to see if the UE supports slice-based SoR information. The UDM may determine to trigger this step based on e.g. local configuration, UE location in specific PLMN or a new indication provided by the SoR AF to the UDM in step 1.\n3.\tThe UDM triggers an extended UPU procedure requesting the UE to send its UPU capabilities in the response. Hence, UDM sends to the AMF, an Nudm SDM Notification including a UPU transparent container to trigger the UE to return its UPU capabilities.\nNOTE:\tSecurity aspects of the protection of the UPU transparent container are to be discussed in SA WG3.\n4.\tThe AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the UE, where this DL NAS TRANSPORT message including the UPU transparent container where the UDM requests the UE capabilities of the UE to handle enhanced SoR information (e.g. a list of VPLMNs and optional supported network slices and/or applicability/validity info, as described herein).\n5.\tThe UE returns its capabilities within an UPU ACK transparent container in an NAS UL TRANSPORT message to the AMF.\n6.\tThe AMF sends, to the UDM, an Nudm_SDM_Info including the UPU ACK transparent container indicating that the UE has the capabilities to receive enhanced SoR information.\n7.\tThis is identical to step 2 in clause 6.6.3.1.\n8.\tThis is identical to step 3 in clause 6.6.3.1.\n9.\tThis is identical to step 4 in clause 6.6.3.1.\n10.\tThe UDM sends, to the AMF, a Nudm_Notify and includes the enhanced SoR information.\n11.\tThe AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message including the enhanced SoR information to the UE.

Following existing procedures, the UE constructs the Requested NSSAI based on the NSSP and Configured NSSAI, which the UE uses to associate applications to specific S-NSSAIs.\nThe visited network accepts the Registration request, via a Registration Accept message, but it may reject the UE's request for an S-NSSAI, the UE included in the Requested NSSAI. In this option, as the UE is not configured to expect to receive Slicer-Aware SoR, the HPLMN may not deliver the Slice-Aware SoR, i.e. the slice-based SoR in the UDM subscription is not set.\nIf no Slice-Aware SoR information is provided, the UE may decide, in an implementation specific manner,  that it does not want to remain in a VPLMN that does not provide the entire Requested S-NSSAI, or S-NSSAIs the UE requires for specific applications and the UE triggers a Deregistration procedure and it provides a new Deregistration Type: \"S-NSSAI not available\" and it provides which S-NSSAI(s) was/were not available.

CN releases all inactive PDU Session first;\n-\tsecond is to check whether the active PDU Session are for emergency, critical and priority service; If active PDU Sessions are not for emergency, critical and priority service, the CN further releases these PDU Sessions even they are active PDU Sessions after a certain operator's pre-defined period of time. If active PDU Session are for emergency, critical and priority service, it is recommended to keep such PDU Session at least for another operator's pre-defined period of time.\n-\tTo trigger the CN NF (AMF) to start tearing down PDU sessions, OAM configures the UDM with the information that the network slice is to be terminated and when to be terminated. The UDM sends an update notification to the AMF on the subscription data related to the Access and Mobility.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is possible that OAM configures directly the AMF(s) affected by the S-NSSAI to be terminated. In this case, UDM will not trigger the affected AMF(s) as depicted in Figure 6.8.3-1. However, once all PDU Sessions associated with the S-NSSAI to be terminated are released, OAM should inform the UDM to remove the S-NSSAI from the UE's subscription data. In case, an operator wants to terminate a S-NSSAI in a specific region and not for the whole PLMN, OAM can configure directly the AMF(s) in that region, where the S-NSSAI is to be terminated.\n-\tIn roaming scenario, where a VPLMN plans to terminate a network slice in its network, it is assumed that OAM in VPLMN configures network functions (i.e. AMF) associated with the network slice to be terminated with the information about when and which network slice is to be terminated. This enables the affected AMF(s) to gradually release roaming UE's PDU Session(s) and to update the Allowed NSSAI to the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the roaming UE, the update of Allowed NSSAI could potentially consist of associating the mapping of subscribed S-NSSAI to another S-NSSAI in the serving network.\n",

The figure shows the process of updating the session management subscriber data, which is an essential component of the AMF protocol. The figure includes various elements such as the session management subscriber data, the update process, and the update message. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the AMF update process, making it easy to understand and interpret.\nFigure 6.8.3-1: Updating session management subscriber data in AMF\n1.\tThe UDM is configured by the OAM with the information of which S-NSSAI is subject to be terminated and when the S-NSSAI will be terminated. This information is part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data. In addition, if the S-NSSAI termination is only applicable within a specific region within the PLMN, OAM configures UDM with the location information such as TAI list along with the S-NSSAI that is subject to be terminated.\nNOTE 1:\tThe information about \"when the S-NSSAI will be terminated\" can be in different forms, e.g. \"to be terminated in a due time, like in 1 hour\", or \"to be terminated at a specific date and time\".\n2.\tBased on the implicit subscription during registration procedure, the UDM notifies the update of the Access and Mobility Subscription data to the affected AMF(s) by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation. The Nudm_SDM_Notification Request message includes the S-NSSAI(s) subject to be terminated, and optionally, the time period indicating when the S-NSSAI is to be terminated.\n3.\tThe AMF responds to the UDM with the Nudm_SDM_Notification Response message.\n4.\tThe AMF modifies the Access and Mobility Subscription data in the UE context that is stored in the AMF.\nThe AMF performs the following for a PDU Session associated with the S-NSSAI marked as \"subject to be terminated\":\nNOTE 2:\tThis step 3 is performed for all UEs that are affected by the S-NSSAI marked as \"subject to be terminated\".\n-\tIf a PDU Session is already established but inactive, the AMF triggers the respective SMF to releases the PDU Session. Similar to step 1a in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\n-\tIf a PDU Session is already established and still active, the AMF does not trigger the respective SMF to release the PDU Session. When the PDU Session becomes inactive, the AMF triggers the SMF to release the PDU Session. Similar to step 1a in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5]. Subject to operator's policy, the AMF may check if the PDU Session is used for Emergency, Critical and Priority services.\nNOTE 3:\tBased on step 4 in clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [5], for NB-IoT RAT Type, it is possible that AMF is aware of active/inactive status of PDU Session. One possible way is that the AMF subscribes to an event report from SMF on when the PDU Session is activated or is deactivated via an existing Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether and how the AMF is aware of PDU Session Status (active/inactive).\n-\tIn case the PDU Session is not used for Emergency, Critical and Priority services, subject to operator's policy, the AMF triggers the SMF to release the active PDU Session after an operator's pre-defined period of time expires. Similar to step 1a in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\n-\tIn case the PDU Session is used for Emergency, Critical and Priority services, subject to operator's policy, the AMF may keep the PDU Session for an operator's pre-defined period of time. After that, the AMF triggers the SMF to release the active PDU Session for Emergency, Critical and Priority services. Similar to step 1a in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\n-\tIf the AMF receives a new PDU Session Establishment Request or any requests (e.g. Registration Request) for the S-NSSAI subject to be terminated, the AMF rejects the request or does not include the S-NSSAI subject to be terminated in the Allowed NSSAI.\n5.\tWhen AMF has released all PDU Sessions associated with the S-NSSAI subject to be terminated, the AMF informs the UDM of the result accordingly. This can be done with Nudm_SDM_Info service operation or a new message,\n6.\tWhen UDM receives a response from all affected AMF(s) associated with the S-NSSAI subject to be terminated, the UDM deletes the S-NSSAI from the UE's subscription data, which triggers an update towards the AMF to remove the S-NSSAI from the Configured NSSAI and from the Allowed NSSAI.\nAfter this, the network operator can safely terminate the corresponding network slice at the point in time according to the schedule known by the OAM.\nNOTE 4:\tFor any RAN, which are affected by terminating the network slice, the OAM removes the supported S-NSSAI from the RAN. For interoperability between the RAN and the AMF, the affected RAN uses RAN Configuration Update procedure as specified in clause 8.7.2 of TS 38.413 [8] to inform the AMF about updating S-NSSAI(s) supported by the RAN. In addition, the affected AMF also informs the RAN about updating S-NSSAI(s) supported by the AMF by using the AMF Configuration Update procedure in clause 8.7.3 of TS 38.413 [8].\n",

                            "text_content": "As the use cases for network slicing become more and more advanced and permit addressing private networking and industrial IoT applications, the Area of Service (AoS) of network slice can become limited to small areas of a PLMN which may not map to already existing TA boundaries. In order to accommodate this, with the current set of specification the way to achieve this would be to redesign the TAs topology of the network.\nIndeed, if the goal of an operator is to support legacy UEs while using such slices, the only possible solution is to redesign the TA boundaries and potentially add new and smaller TAs.\nSo, it can be concluded that to support legacy UEs, the only solution possible to address the problem space is to redesign the TAs to enable matching the needs to deploy limited AoS network slices not matching already deployed TAs topology.\nWhile this can be a solution, this implies that even users that do not have interest in the specific limited AoS slices may end up having to be allocated to such smaller tracking area and/or the TAI list can become rather complicated to form or even in some cases exceed the limit of 16 TAs in the TAI-list. It may in some situations cause also additional signalling traffic due to mobility management and needs of UE configuration update even if the UEs are not interested at all by the use of these specific slices. So, for rel-18 and beyond, improvements can be considered.\nIf there are network slices that the operator knows the customer has full control on the UE population of and the specification of the supported UEs capabilities is part of the SLA, we can explore alternative option that is presented here.\nThe solution is based on allowing the broadcast on SIB of additional TACs (we expect only a small number if not just one additional to be only needed to cover most cases, RAN2 to define how many can be configured) that supporting UEs can read. These additional/secondary TAC values are passed to the CN with the associated slices supported in NG-AP messages uses to maintain the supported slices and explicitly indicated as \"Secondary TACs\" in UE specific signalling when the TAC is included today to signal the UE location in the Initial UE message,  The AMF then forms the RA by considering the support of slices as today, but it can only include in the Allowed NSSAI network slices requiring TAs that are broadcasted as secondary TAs in the RA for the supporting UEs (so e.g. Note well that the support of slices that are not fully supported in a TA is not signalled, as per today's specifications (so, e.g. TA4 only uniformly supports S-NSSAI 1 and S-NSSAI 4). See figure 6.9.2-1. These slices whose AoS also requires some secondary TAs, can be allowed in the in the secondary TAs indicated in the RA only for supporting UEs - so, if the RA includes secondary TAs, then only supporting UEs can received these slices S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI. Primary TAs may be included in the RA for these slices in addition to secondary TAs only if the S-NSSAIs is uniformly supported in the primary TA that are indicated in the RA. Of course these capable UEs are as capable as the legacy UEs to be allowed to use slices that fully match existing deployed TAs  (so if the supporting UE requests S-NSSAI 1 only, it can be indicated a RA=(TAI1,TAI5).\nThe figure depicts a 9-2-1 TA topology, which is a common configuration for wireless networks. The primary TA (9) is responsible for transmitting data, while the secondary TA (2) is responsible for receiving data. The figure also includes a 1-2-1 TA (1) for redundancy, ensuring that the primary TA can still function even if the secondary TA fails. The figure illustrates the importance of proper network design and redundancy in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 6.9.2-1: Example TA topology including Primary and Secondary TAs\nBased on the uniform support of network slices per TA in figure 6.9.2-1, if, the UE requests S-NSSAI 3 and S-NSSAI 1 only, then the RA includes TAI 3 but not TAI1. It is not permitted to add TA4 as cells broadcasting TA4 do not always support S-NSSAI 3 (see above in figure 6.9.2-1 that the cells broadcasting TA4 under primary TA5 do not support S-NSSAI 3).\nIn other words, the uniform support of slices is assumed also at the secondary TAI level.\nSince a gNB only provides the supported slices under the TAC it administers, S-NSSAI(s) uniform support by a secondary TA shall be configured in each gNB even though for the cells under its scope support may be considered uniform (e.g. in figure 6.9.2-1 the TA5 and TA1 may be under different gNBs and so TA4 may be considered uniformly supporting S-NSSAI 3 from the gNB supporting TAI1 and not supporting S-NSSAI 3 in gNB supporting TAI5). The alternative is that the AMF or NSSF determine the uniform support based on the received information from the RAN by combining the support indication received by different NG-AP sources (i.e. if gNB 1 declares S-NSSAI3 is supported by TAI4 and gNB5 does not indicate support  of S-NSSAI3 by TAI4, then TAI4 does not support S-NSSAI 3 uniformly and the NSSF/AMF can summarize this when they combine the indication by different gNBs).\n",

This validity timer for each temporary S-NSSAI is sent to the UE e.g. in the configured NSSAI list during the registration procedure. When the UE receives the S-NSSAI with a validity timer in the configured NSSAI, the UE runs a validity timer. The UE will register to the S-NSSAI when the validity timer is running. In CM-IDLE once the validity timer expires the UE locally removes the S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI list and the UE locally release the PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI. The network (e.g. AMF) also runs the validity timer for the S-NSSAI, once the validity timer expires the network removes the S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI list and locally release the PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI. In CM-CONNECTED state, on expiry of the validity timer, the AMF initiates PDU session release procedure. The network may also associate a S-NSSAI with validity timer if the S-NSSAI was not associated with any validity timer. The UE provides the capability to the AMF which provides to the UDM or other network function that it support configured NSSAI with validity timer.

When receiving the Allowed NSSAI containing a validity time for the S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to temporary slices, the UE runs a timer and, when the validity timer expires, the UE locally removes the S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI list and the UE release the PDU session associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI.\n-\tThe AMF provides a set of conditions to the UE for the S-NSSAIs (here called Conditional S-NSSAI) that are valid only under specific conditions (e.g. only in specific TAs, or that have a validity time associated) and therefore cannot be placed in the Allowed NSSAI (here called Conditional S-NSSAI):\n-\tthe conditions may include a list of TAs (not included in the present RA) where the S-NSSAI is allowed.\n-\tthe conditions may include an Area of Service (as defined in KI#3) for the S-NSSAI. The Area of Service may be defined as a set of TAs or a set of cells. If the Area of Service of an S-NSSAI does not match exactly one or a set of TAs, the RA selected for the UE may not include the TAs that overlap with the area of service and the S-NSSAI corresponding to the Area of Service may be provided as a Conditional S-NSSAI to the UE with the Area of Service information. The Conditional S-NSSAI may be supported in one or more TAs of the RA but not in all of the TAs of the RA.\n-\tit is assumed that the AMF is informed about a slice availability on a per-cell basis from the NG-RAN.\n-\tit is assumed that the AMF is informed about a slice availability in terms of validity time based on OAM or subscription information.\n-\tthe conditions may include \"time-related conditions\" (e.g. specific times at which an S-NSSAI is available or the time period in which the S-NSSAI is available) to support the use cases associated with KI#3.\n-\tmultiple conditions may be associated to an S-NSSAI (e.g. list of TAs and \"time-related conditions\").\nNOTE 1:\tAn S-NSSAI that is allowed in the whole RA or part of the RA but only under specific time conditions would be placed in the Conditional S-NSSAI.\n-\tthe conditions are provided by placing the S-NSSAI in a new Conditionally Allowed NSSAI IE which contains all the S-NSSAIs the UE requested and that cannot be placed in the Allowed NSSAI since they are not available in the whole RA, but that may be available under different conditions (other TAs, other times, etc.). The UE is allowed to request resources (e.g. establish a PDU session) for the S-NSSAI in the Conditionally Allowed NSSAI without requiring the UE to re-register. If the UE supports the Conditionally Allowed S-NSSAI feature, the UE shall indicate its support for it in the Registration Request message and the AMF shall provide the Conditionally Allowed NSSAI to the UE only if the UE indicated support for it.\nEditor's note:\tThe exact impact of allowing the UE to request resources for S-NSSAIs in the Conditionally Allowed NSSAIs without allowing the UE to re-register is FFS.\nEditor's note:\tThe impact of using the Conditionally Allowed NSSAI as described above on NSCAF mechanisms is FFS.\nNOTE 2:\tThe decision with respect to which IE is used to convey the additional information should be taken in CT WG1.\nNOTE 3:\tS-NSSAIs that are placed in the Pending NSSAI may be considered Conditional NSSAIs once the NSSAA procedure is completed successfully.\n-\tThe AMF provides the conditions to the UE anytime the AMF provides, or updates, the Allowed NSSAI and Rejected NSSAI to the UE (e.g. registration procedure, UCU procedure).\nEditor's note:\tHow the AMF is provided such condition information, e.g. via OAM or other mechanisms, is FFS.\n-\tThe UE shall not request resources for a Conditional S-NSSAI unless the associated conditions indicate the S-NSSAI is available (e.g. specific TA or time).\n-\tWhen the UE determines that  one or more Conditional S-NSSAI(s) are available and that the applications in the UE require connectivity with the Conditional S-NSSAI(s), the UE and may request a PDU session for such S-NSSAI(s).\n-\twhen the UE is in a TA corresponding to the set of TAs where a Conditional S-NSSAI is available, the UE may request the establishment of a PDU session for the Conditional S-NSSAI.\n-\twhen the validity time associated with a Conditional S-NSSAI applies (i.e. the slice is currently available according to the validity time), then the UE may request the establishment of a PDU session for the Conditional S-NSSAI.\n-\twhen the UE is in the Serving Area where a Conditional S-NSSAI is available, the UE may request the establishment of a PDU session for the Conditional S-NSSAI.\n-\tWhen the UE performs a Service Request for an S-NSSAI that is no longer available (e.g. the UE has moved outside the TA or Serving Area where the S-NSSAI is available or the time conditions have changed), the request for the resources associated to the S-NSSAI is rejected and an indication is provided to the UE as to why. If the S-NSSAI was in the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF may provide a new Allowed NSSAI and a Conditionally Allowed NSSAI to the UE.\n-\tNot all AMFs in a network may support this extension, thus to enable compatibility a UE receiving the additional information regarding Conditional S-NSSAIs shall ignore it and no capability indication to the AMF is required.\n-\tWith this solution, non-supporting AMFs cannot support S-NSSAIs with Serving Area or time constraints.\n",

                            "text_content": "In this solution and in support of 5GS only slices, when multiple Service Areas are deployed, it is proposed that a single central NSACF NF performs the PLMN global counting and admission to ensure a consistent counting, e.g. such that during handover between different Service Areas no additional admission needs to be performed. The admission request includes all necessary information to enable the central NSACF NF to collect all pertinent information per Service Area. Interaction between the NF performing the admission, be it the SMF or the AMF, occurs with the designated central NSCAF for that purpose. The central NSACF NF responsible for PLMN global count is discovered via NRF as per clause 6.12.2.4 or can be pre-configured.\nTwo options are proposed to enable a Service Area to perform some local tasks; e.g. keeping local statistics in conjunction with centralized counting with a single central NSACF NF:\nOption 1: Transparent Proxying to central NSACF NF Via an intermediate NF\nBased on policy, an NF, e.g. SMF or AMF performing the admission with the central NSACF NF may additionally and optionally interact with a local NF associated with the Service Area, for any additional capabilities not supported by the central NSACF NF. Such additional capabilities are not specified. but can be e.g. to keep local statistics.\nThe interaction with such a local NF is such, that the local NF in the Service Area proxies the original request, as is, to the central NSACF NF, after performing the tasks it desires upon receipt of the admission Request intended for the central NSACF NF. Hence, in this option1, the interaction with the central NSACF server is proxied via an intermediate NF to the central NF, as long as it is transparent to the central NSACF NF. Transparent means that the central NSACF NF cannot distinguish whether the Request is direct from the AMF/SMF or proxied via an intermediate NF. It also need ensure the response message from central NSACF go through the intermediate NF. The local NF can be configured in this option with the central NSACF, can discover the central NSACF as per clause 6.12.2.4, or can receive the information from the AMF/SMF.\nOption 2: Dual Interaction with Local NF and central NSACF NF\nBased on policy, an NF, e.g. SMF or AMF performing the admission with the central NSACF NF may additionally and optionally interact with a local NF associated with the Service Area, for any additional capabilities not supported by the central NSACF NF. Such additional capabilities are not specified. but can be e.g. to keep local statistics\nHence the AMF/SMFs performs dual interactions in parallel; once towards the central NSACF NF and an additional one towards a local NF in the Service Area.\nFor both options 1 or 2, AMFs/SMFs are configured with a service area to be used for a local NF selection and a service area to be used for central NSACF selection.\nNOTE 1:\tThese two-service areas are for two different NF discovery and selection. It can be different.\nAs an additional option, the AMFs/SMFs can be configured with the local NFs to be used. The central NSACF to be used can be discovered by the appropriate NF or be configured in the appropriate NFs depending on the selected option by the PLMN.\nIn support of roaming and to enable such a central NF to handle roaming UEs, as well as home bound UEs, the admission query to the central NF includes the PLMN-ID where the UE is roaming.\nTo support EPS counting while interworking with 5GS when activated and where home routing is the only option for attachment to EPS, a central NSCAF NF could be optionally dedicated for 5GS-EPS interworking shared count as per clause 6.12.2.4. In this case, such a dedicated NF is discovered. The PLMN can also reuse a single NSACF NF for all admissions.\nSimilar to the 5GS case and based on policy, a NF performing admission with the central NSACF responsible for the shared 5GS-EPS count may additionally and optionally interact with a local NF associated with the Service Area, for any additional capabilities not supported by the central NSACF NF. Such additional capabilities are not specified. Hence, in this case as well, both options 1 and 2 above for 5GS only slices are supported for the 5GS-EPS interworking case.\nWith central count regardless of any interactions with a local NF based on either option 1 or option 2, admission is solely based on the central NSACF, even if these local NFs are local NSACFs maintaining count. Given that the service area is included in the interaction with the central NSACF for all cases, see clause 6.12.2.1.1, as one example, the central NSACF is able to determine when a UE, who has a stored state in it as being registered in one service area, has moved to a new service area when a new admission request arrives from a new service area and as such the central NSACF does not perform an admission in this case.\nNOTE 2:\tAs stated before functions performed in the local NF are out of scope. A Release 17 NSACF, as currently specified, is not expected to be used in this case as a local NF. This solution defines access to a central NSACF and any local NF must adapt to ensure compliance, depending on the adopted option. Indeed, implementations may choose not to support any local NF option for a centralized NSACF as all information is available there. However, a Release 17 NSACF is enhanced, as detailed in the procedures below, to become a centralized NSACF.\n",

This could be as an example, the PLMN ID. In roaming case the PLMN ID is the HPLMN ID. Stage 3 makes the final determination This enables an AMF/SMF utilizing centralized counting to be able to select the appropriate NSACF.\nIf applicable an NSACF can be utilized exclusively for 5GC EPC interworking, when EPC and 5GC have a joint admission counting between them. In this case, there shall be an NSACF service area distinctly and unambiguously identified for that purpose. A PLMN can only have only one NSACF for that purpose used by both EPC and 5GC for admission purposes in this case. This NSACF is also utilized for home and outbound roamers in all VPLMNs.\n",

If the Primary NSACF has no more available allowance for maximum number of PDU sessions, the Primary NSACF may indicate to NSACF to reject any new increase request. At any time, the Primary NSACF may notify NSACF to remove the indication of reject any new increase request if it has been notified to NSACF in earlier interaction.\n7.\tThe Primary NSACF returns the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberUpdate_Response. The response may include a new allocated local maximum PDU session number, or it may return indication to reject any further new PDU sessions with a cause code.\n8.\tIf the primary NSACF provides a new allowance e.g. for the number of PDU sessions, the NSACF replaces the local maximum PDU session number with the received allocated local maximum PDU session number value. If the allocated local maximum PDU session number is increasing, the NSACF creates or adds the associated PDU session ID into the UE entry. Otherwise the NSACF rejects the permission to establish the PDU session as indicated.\n9.\tSame as the step 4 defined in clause 4.2.11.4 of TS 23.502 [5].\nThe figure depicts a distribution of local maximum numbers in a 13-digit number system, with each number represented by a distinct shape. The numbers are distributed in a way that ensures the local maximum is at the top of the number, with each subsequent number being a multiple of the previous one. This distribution is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the number system and ensuring that the digits are evenly distributed across the digits.\nFigure 6.13.3.3-1: Redistribution of local maximum number\nAt any time the Primary NSACF may update the allocated local Maximum number of UE or PDU session configured at the NSACF as follow:\n1-2.\tThe Primary NSACF subscribes the slice event exposure service from the NSACF. This is to get the status of the current registered number of UE or established PDU session number. Per the subscription, the NSACF notifies the status of the current registered number of UE or established PDU session number based on the configured value to the Primary NSCAF periodically or when above or below the configured threshold per the event subscribed.\n3.\tPer the received current registered UE/PDU session number at NSACFs and operator's policy, the Primary NSACF decides to update the local maximum UE/PDU session number values at the NSACF(s), i.e. the configured value.\n4.\tThe Primary NSACF invokes Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberUpdate_Request to the NSACF. The message includes the allocated new local maximum number.\n5.\tThe NSACF replaces the local maximum number with the received new local maximum number value.\n6.\tThe NSACF returns the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberUpdate_Response.\nFor maximum number of PDU session control, there is no impact on PDU session handling in case of UE mobility across service area.\nFor maximum number of UE control, the NSACF discovered by the AMF (or SMF+PGW-C) is deployed as the following:\n-\tDifferent service area within one PLMN: the NSACF is deployed in each service area.\n-\tRoaming: the NSACF is located at the VPLMN.\n‐\tEPS interworking: when the UE camps at the EPS network, the SMF+PGW-C select the NSACF at the serving PLMN or the NSACF at the HPLMN depending on whether the PDU session is LBO PDU session or HR PDU session. When the UE camps at the 5GS network, the AMF selects the NSACF at the camping service area of the serving PLMN.\nIn all above cases there is only one Primary NSACF instance or one NSACF Set, which is located at the HPLMN.\nWhen UE moves across different service area, different NSACF may be interacted to perform the maximum UE number control. If local Maximum number is not reached at the target NSACF, the NSACF accepts the UE registration at the new service area. If local Maximum number is reached, the target NSACF delegates the NSAC request to the Primary NSACF. The Primary NSACF updates the UE ID entry per the received UE ID information until the maximum number at the Primary NSACF is reached. Thus even if the local maximum number at one NSACF is reached, the session continuity is still supported.\nAs the Primary NSACF can balance the maximum number among different NSACFs and also manage the UE ID directly, in general, the support of session continuity when UE move to a new service area should be no issue.\nPer the S2-2202800, GSMA has sent the new NSAC requirement. It includes two parts:\n1.\tNSAC controlled by the HPLMN for UE/PDU session number control.\nThis is supported with the Primary NSACF located at the HPLMN.\n",

The identification of the selected target serving NSI corresponding to the Allowed S-NSSAI and the serving NRF for the target NSI are identified and responded to the serving AMF to support future PDU session establishment.\n-\tLate Binding (LB) - Associating the UE with Allowed S-NSSAI upon the successful UE registration, however, the selection of the target NSI happens only when receiving the first PDU session establishment request for the specific Allowed S-NSSAI. Once the target NSI is selected, the serving NRF for the target NSI is also selected to progress the PDU session establishment procedure.\nAs a consequence of only one Network Slice instance associated with a given S-NSSAI to serve UE, the AMF is constrained to discover SMF using the same Network Slice instance for a given S-NSSAI, once the Network Slice instance is selected by NSSF to serve UE that is allowed to use this S-NSSAI.

The UE determines to use a network slice for an application by using URSP rules.\nHowever, current specification allows the network to provide multiple RSDs for a traffic descriptor, i.e. the network can use multiple slices for an application. Also network can provide \"match all\" traffic descriptor to the UE. In this case, the UE may use a slice in the RSD of \"match all\" traffic descriptor if the UE fails to establish a PDU Session using the slice with traffic descriptor for the specific application. From the UE perspective, all slices (e.g. slice in the RSD of matched traffic descriptor with higher priority, slice in the RSD of matched traffic descriptor with lower priority and slice in the RSD of \"match all\" traffic descriptor) are allowed for the application. So the UE can choose whether to trigger VPLMN selection when a slice in the higher priority URSP rule is in not available in the registered VPLMN. For example, some UEs may not triggers VPLMN selection at all since the slice in the \"match all\" traffic descriptor is expected to be supported in all VPLMNs. But operator may prefer to use a slice in the higher priority URSP rule if it is available by triggering VPLMN selection.\nIn addition to above case, there are some cases that a slice the UE wants to use is supported in the VPLMN but temporally rejected by the network due to some reasons. For example, the network may not allow using the slice due to NSAC failure, congestion control, not allowed in the current registration area. In these cases, each operator may have different preference, e.g. as those conditions are temporal restriction some operators may want to keep the UE in the registered PLMN while some operators may want to trigger VPLMN selection.\nIn order to control the UE behaviour in above cases, this solution proposes that the HPLMN may provide Slice based VPLMN Selection Policy (SVSP) to the UE. The policy indicates in which condition the UE is allowed to trigger VPLMN selection to find a network that supports slices the UE want to use. The operator may provide different policy depending on the UE. For example, the PCF or UDM (adding the policy to SoR Info) may consider subscription of the UE, location, etc. to generate SVSP. The SVSP contains following information for each S-NSSAI:\n-\tWhether the UE can trigger VPLMN selection when the S-NSSAI the UE wants to use is not available due to\n-\tNot allowed in the current registration area\n-\tWhether the UE can trigger VPLMN selection before using a slice in the URSP rule with \"match all\" traffic descriptor.\nNOTE:\tIt is expected that SA WG3 will define end-to-end security-mechanism to ensure that VPLMN does not modifies UE policy if this policy is conveyed by PCF and not by SoR container.\n",

The UE sends a capability that it supports Slice based SoR procedure to the AMF.\n2.\tThe AMF determines that some S-NSSAI(s) are allowed and some S-NSSAI(s) are rejected (e.g. the S-NSSAI is not supported in the TA or the PLMN). The AMF sends Registration accept message containing the allowed NSSAI and rejected NSSAI.\n3-4.\tUpon reception of the Registration accept message, the UE sends Registration complete message. The registration complete message contains secured assistance information e.g. rejected NSSAI and allowed NSSAI which is passed transparently to the UDM via AMF. The UE may also send secured assistance information in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message e.g. Registration complete message is not required to send.\nThe UE sends the assistance information only when the UE receives rejected NSSAI from the AMF (i.e. rejected S-NSSAI due to no support in the RA or in the PLMN or other reject values).\n5.\tThe AMF sends Nudm_UECM_Update containing assistance information e.g. allowed NSSAI and rejected NSSAI to the UDM.\n6.\tThe UDM sends Nudm_UECM_Update response message.

The allowed NSSAI and rejected NSSAI is provided as assistance information to the HPLMN. For example, if the rejected NSSAI indicates a S-NSSAI is rejected with cause \"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\" then the UDM may steer the UE to another VPLMN.\n8b.\tThe SoR-AF calculate preferred PLMN list depending on the allowed NSSAI and rejected NSSAI and sends it in the Nsoraf_SoR_Get response message (Preferred PLMN list). The preferred PLMN list consists of PLMN IDs and the S-NSSAIs supported by the PLMN in the preferred PLMN list.\n9.\tThe UDM send SoR as defined in TS 23.122 [7].

                            "text_content": "It is normal practice for operators to configure the UE with a (set of) preferred PLMN(s) in a certain country while the UEs are roaming. In the 5GS this set of preferences may e.g. be configured or updated in the UE using the SoR (Steering of Roaming) procedure defined in TS 23.502 [5] and TS 33.501 [14].\nTS 23.502 [5] reads:\n\"During registration the Home Network can provide Steering of Roaming information to the UE via the AMF (i.e. a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or HPLMN indication that 'no change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is needed). The Home Network can include an indication for the UE to send an acknowledgement of the reception of this information. Details regarding the handling of Steering of Roaming information including how this information is managed between the AMF and the UE are defined in TS 23.122 [7].\"\nThe home operator may want the UE to remain with a list of preferred PLMNs (i.e. PLMNs in the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" and the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"), unless the UE requires to use a network slice which these PLMNs do not support. Also, the home operator may have specific preferred PLMN list when specific network slices are used. This is not possible today with the current PLMN selection mechanisms as the UE will, in automatic PLMN selection, always remain with the preferred PLMNs (in respective priority order) if they are available.\nThis solution proposes to configure the UE with additional network slice aware PLMN selection information, in the form of one or more lists of PLMNs that are preferred when the UE requires to use a respective S-NSSAI of the HPLMN. The S-NSSAI values in this information are the HPLMN S-NSSAIs (i.e. the mapped value of the S-NSSAIs in the V-PLMN are not considered and so there is no impact on this solution if the VPLMNs decide to change the value of S-NSSAI they use to identify the network slice locally). The UE therefore can be configured with the preferred PLMN list as today and additional Network-Slice-Aware PLMN lists per S-NSSAI which may take precedence as an exception over the preferred PLMN list. In other words, the UE may be configured with:\n-\tnothing (i.e. neither \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" nor Network Slice Aware PLMN list);\n-\tjust a preferred PLMNs list (e.g. \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\");\n-\ta mix of preferred PLMN list and at least one Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list; or\n-\tat least one Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list.\nThe UE is configured with a Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list of alternate (potentially ordered by a priority value) PLMN IDs associated with the supported S-NSSAIs. Some of the S-NSSAIs may not be supported (or are preferred instead of) by the PLMNs in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list.\nWhen the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list is provided for an S-NSSAI and this S-NSSAI is required but not yet allowed or rejected, this is a trigger for evaluation by the UE whether to consider the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list to perform PLMN selection.\nThe Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list may be associated with validity parameters (e.g. location in particular country or time period restriction). If so, the UE applies the configuration when the validity restriction is fulfilled.\nWhen attempting to use/register with a S-NSSAI associated with a Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list, the UE prefers and selects one of the PLMNs identified in the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list if a PLMN ID is present in such list for this S-NSSAI that is of higher priority of the current PLMN, or if the PLMN ID of the current PLMN is not among the PLMN IDs in the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list for the S-NSSAI.  The UE may return to using the ordinary list of preferred PLMNs when it deregisters from all S-NSSAIs associated to any Network-Slice-Aware PLMN lists it is configured with, so in a sense the UE uses the Network Slice Aware PLMN list when an S-NSSAI is not available in currently registered PLMN or to find a PLMN which is preferable when some S-NSSAIs are associated to a Network Slice Aware PLMN list..\nIt is assumed that the UE at any time selects the PLMN ID which maximises the number of S-NSSAIs that the UE can use. If all S-NSSAIs can be used in a set of PLMNs, the UE selects the common PLMN ID across all the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list which ranks higher on average. This average may also consider predefined weighted factors assigned to each Network Slice. In case a UE needs to use a network slice which is present in the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list and another network slice which is not present in the Network Slice Aware PLMN list, then the UE shall give preference to the PLMNS in the order of the Network Slice Aware PLMN list. If there are no common PLMNs where both can be supported, then the UE will decide which slice to use based on local policy. An example of a UE configuration with set of Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list is in figure 6.19.2-1. Alternatively, if the HPLMN does not provide a weight factor per S-NSSSAI with a Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list the UE can create internally a list of preferred S-NSSAIs, generate locally the weights accordingly and can select a PLMN ID (from the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN list) which serves the preferred S-NSSAIs.\nEditor's note:\tThe use of weight factors or some other means is FFS.\nNOTE\tHow the HPLMN generates these weight factors and in general the PLMN lists is outside the scope of 3GPP (as for existing SoR info).\nTable 6.19.2-1: Example of a UE configuration with 3 Network-Slice-Aware PLMN lists\n\nBased on the configuration in Figure 6.19.2-1, let's suppose the UE needs to request S-NSSAI1, S-NSSAI2 and S-NSSA3. If the UE needs to perform PLMN selection (as e.g. it may be on a PLMN which does not support all 3 S-NSSAIs), then the UE computes the average PLMN priority of the common PLMNs where all three S-NSSAIs can be supported this way:\n\n\nThis example shows that PLMN1 is the PLMN to be used as it has the highest priority.\nIn the event that there were no common PLMNs in the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN lists for two S-NSSAIs and the UE needs to request both, the UE would restrict the selection to the S-NSSAIs associated with the highest weight factor. If none of the two has highest weight factor, local policy applies. By extension, if there are S-NSSAIs that have common PLMNs in the Network-Slice-Aware PLMN lists but are incompatible with other S-NSSAIs Network-Slice-Aware PLMN lists, then the groups for S-NSSAIs with common PLMNs with the highest total weight factor are considered for PLMN selection.\n",

It illustrates the usage of this list in a 5G network, demonstrating how it can be used to create different network slices based on the user's requirements. The list includes various network slices, such as core, access, and edge, and is used to allocate resources and manage network traffic.

Then the UE will access to a non-optimized PLMN.\nIt is proposed that the UDM should generate the SoR information based on the expected S-NSSAIs (i.e. the S-NSSAIs the UE expects to include in the Request NSSAI in the next Registration) if SoR-AF is collocated with the UDM.

If there is only one PCF in the network or OAM can consistently update more than one PCF, the PCF could get the information based on OAM. The PCF should generate the Route Selection Validation Criteria in the URSP based on the information of the temporary slice. For example, the Time window or Location Criteria could be exactly the one received from the UDR or a little bit more limited than the one received from UDR. The UE will release the PDU Session gracefully based on URSP and its implementation as described in TS 23.503 [12].\nOn other aspects related to slicing, the current mechanism described in clause 5.15 of TS 23.501 [2] is not changed. The NSSF/AMF could remove the S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI when it is not in the valid duration based on configuration. In particular, when the operator removes the S-NSSAI (i.e. the S-NSSAI is removed from Subscribed S-NSSAIs of a UE via OAM), the AMF should set the S-NSSAI as rejected S-NSSAI if it is in Allowed NSSAI for a UE via UCU procedure as described in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5]. And the AMF trigger PDU Session Release as described in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5] if the UE does not release the PDU Session in time. Besides, the AMF may also configure the serving area/time window of the S-NSSAI (or from NSSF) and subscribe the UE location. When UE is in Connected Mode and does not release the PDU Session in time if the UE is out of the serving area, the AMF should trigger the PDU Session Release as described in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5] if the operator wants to control it strictly based on operator policy. If the operator wants to control is in a soft way based on operator policy, i.e. can wait for UE entering CM-IDLE state, there is no additional action needed.\nNOTE:\tAs described in TS 23.503 [12], if the re-evaluation of RSD in the URSP leads to a change of the application to PDU Session association, the UE can enforce such changes in a timely manner based on implementation, e.g. immediately or when UE enters CM-IDLE state.\nEditor's note:\twith this approach, the time-based validity is totally taken away from the route selection and used to support the temporary slice. this means this solution needs to explain how the current use of thee time-based validity independent of the slice availability is supported.\n",

The AMF in the serving PLMN combines any timing information received from UDM and in the Serving PLMN to derive the combined timing information.\nIf a UE is capable of supporting optimizations for temporary/periodic Network Slice and TAs support, it signals in the UE MM capabilities that it can support the related RM and MM optimisation for temporary/periodic Network Slices.\nNOTE:\twhether/temporary/periodic TAs support can be considered a standalone capability can be evaluated, but in principle one could deploy temporary TAs just to optimize the RM/Paging trade off at certain time of day, irrespective of the need to support temporary/periodic Network Slices with a AoS that does not match existing/permanent TA boundaries.\nFor UEs that can support the temporary/periodic Network Slices optimizations, the UE can be provided with the timing information for the S-NSSAIs and any temporary/periodic TAs that are needed to support these slices. Otherwise, for non-supporting UEs, the network must provide at any time the information Configured NSSAI, Allowed NSSAI and TAI in the RA to UE that is consistent with the timing information.\nIt is proposed that the timing information for Temporary/Periodic network slices and TAs is configured in the (R)AN and that the (R)AN can indicate it to the AMF alongside the related S-NSSAIs for the TAs where these temporary/periodic network slices are supported.\nThe timing information can be passed to SMF also when PDU sessions are established to cause the local release of PDU sessions without additional signalling being needed. For periodic slices, the timing information allows the periodic deactivation and reactivation of PDU sessions without additional system wide signalling also.\nThe timing information can be of the forms:\n-\t{Ts, Te} indicating an absolute time of start (Ts) and end (Te).\n-\t{Ts, [Tu, Td]}, indicating an absolute time of start Ts and an up time period (Tu) and a down time period (Td) with the first uptime starting at time Ts.\n",

The figure also illustrates the use of encryption and authentication protocols to protect the registration process, and the importance of regular updates and maintenance to ensure the system's reliability and security.\nFigure 6.24.3.1-1: Registration Management aspects\nFigure 6.24.3.1-1 above provides a synopsis of the RM impact for supporting and non-supporting UEs. Additionally, it shows which network entities are configured with the timing information and how the timing information is provides to the AMF and NSSF. the timing information in NSSF is the serving PLMN timing information for TAs and Network slices of the serving PLMN. in roaming case, the AMF provides to the NSSF the timing information for the mapped S-NSSAIs of HPLMN if any applies as received from the UDM.\n0.\tThe timing information for the S-NSSAIs in the serving PLMN is configured in the (R)AN, as well as any timing information for the TAs. The UDM can also be configured with timing information for S-NSSAIs in the UE subscriptions information.\n1.\tThe (R)AN provides any per S-NSSAIs and any per TA timing information to the AMF using NG-Set up. the AMF also provides this information to the NSSF using the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability_Update service operation.\n2a.\tThe AMF and NSSF provide in a Registration Accept (and update, when necessary, by a UE Configuration Update Command ) a non-supporting UE with the Configured NSSAI, allowed NSSAI and RA that are based on taking into account the combined timing information for the S-NSSAIs and the corresponding mapped S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN and also any timing information that is associated to the TAIs received from the (R)AN at NG Setup.\n2b.\tThe AMF and NSSF provide in a Registration Accept (and update, when necessary, by a UE Configuration Update Command) a supporting UE with the Configured NSSAI with the combined timing information for S-NSSAIs (based on serving PLMN and HPLMN information) and any timing information for the TAIs in the RA. The allowed NSSAI may include periodically available S-NSSAIs even when these are in the time period when these are not available.\n3.\tA supporting UE which has received at step 2b timing information, can use it locally to adapt the Allowed NSSAI, Configured NSSAI and RA. For the S-NSSAI in the Configured NSSAI that are periodic, these can be used in the registration request in the Requested NSSAI even when the timing information indicates they are in the period when they are not available. The (R)AN and AMF/NSSF locally adapt without further signally as the (R)AN is the source of the timing information and the AMF receives the information from the (R)AN at step 1a.\nIn order to ensure that there is a coherent end to end handling of the timing information, the UE may include this in the PDU Session Establishment Request (and update the timing information by PDU Session Modification request, if necessary). The UE can request explicitly that the PDU sessions are automatically released (e.g. if the respective network slices have an end of life timing information) or retained and restored (e.g. if the respective network slices have a periodic timing information). Alternatively, e.g. when the UE indicates no S-NSSAI when it establishes a PDU session, the UE indicated in the UE MM capabilities that it supports the SM timing information and the AMF can include this based on the combined S-NSSAIs timing information for the S-NSSAI (which may be also determined b the AMF) of the PDU session in the request towards the SMF that PDU sessions are automatically released (e.g. if the respective network slices have an end of lifecycle) or retained and restored (e.g. if the respective network slices are periodic). In all cases, the SMF that supports the feature then returns in the PDU session Establishment/Modification Accept and in the N1N2 the acceptance of the requested behaviour so that the UE and AMF and (R)AN can adapt locally the behaviour without any further signalling. In addition, the AMF provides the confirmed timing information for the PDU session to the (R)AN in N2 message transporting the PDU session Accept message to the (R)AN and triggering the DRBs configuration for the PDU session. The two behaviours are indicated in figures 6.24.3.2-1 and 6.24.3.2-2 respectively, where the new aspects of the procedure from TS 23.502 [5] are highlighted in boldface. The NAS message is a PDU session Request or a PDU session Accept as it can be understood from the context.\nThe figure depicts a 24 GHz 3.2-1 UE-requested PDU Session Establishment with timing indication from the UE, illustrating the communication process between the UE and the network.\nFigure 6.24.3.2-1 UE-requested PDU Session Establishment with timing indication from UE\nThe figure depicts a 24 GHz 3.2-2 channel with a UE-requested PDU Session Establishment without timing indication from the UE. The figure shows the signal path, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The UE-requested PDU Session Establishment is a key feature in 5G networks, allowing for efficient data transmission.\nFigure 6.24.3.2-2: UE-requested PDU Session Establishment without timing indication from UE\nFigure 6.24.3.2-3 here below shows the procedure for PDU session modification. it should be noted that this figure shows the UE providing the updated timing information because it has received an updated timing information from the AMF for the related network slice S-NSSAI. However, it is also possible for the AMF to initiate this if the RAN is providing the updated PDU session related modification to the AMF for capable UEs (for which timing information was provided to the RAN for the PDU session). which approach to select can be further studied.\n\nThe figure depicts a 24 GHz 3.2-3 UE-requested PDU Session Modification with timing indication from the UE, illustrating the process of modifying a PDU session in a wireless communication system.\nFigure 6.24.3.2-3: UE-requested PDU Session Modification with timing indication from UE\n",

The additional slice information is based on UE requested S-NSSAI which is only available in some TAs of UE's RA. The additional slice information comprises the mapping between an S-NSSAI within the rejected S-NSSAIs and TAIs that can support/or cannot support such S-NSSAI. e.g. the information can be either S-NSSAI 1 in the rejected S-NSSAI together with the TAI(s) supporting it, or indicating S-NSSAI 1 is rejected for TA1, TA2, TA3.The current cause value \"rejected S-NSSAI in the RA\" can be changed to \"rejected S-NSSAI in current TA\". Thus, when UE moves out of the current TA, it can start registration update to get updated allowed NSSAI including also the rejected S-NSSAI in the previous TA and potentially also a new RA. AMF can also provide additional slice information to UE, so that UE can start registration update only when moves to a TA where the rejected S-NSSAI can be supported.\nIn both options, UE can initiate the service request with new allowed NSSAI after the registration update in the new TA. The difference is just the number of rejected S-NSSAI and TAI pairs to be included in the signalling to the UE.\nNOTE:\tSuch registration update is based on the application requirements, UE can also decide not to perform registration update when changes to a new TA.\n",

In fact, KI#5 drives the need to define smaller TAs as to maintain a uniform support of network slice availability per TA. Defining smaller TAs and supporting moving UEs will likely challenge the current maximum of 16 TAs within an RA and supporting TAs with different capabilities and network slice availability will also drive the need for enabling the UE being registered with multiple network slices while some are only available in a subset of the TAs of the UE's RA.\nThe following principles are proposed as to address the above aspects:\n-\tThe total number of TAs of the RA is increased;\n-\tS-NSSAIs can be available and registered for all of the TAs of the RA or for a subset of the RA;\n-\tThe AMF/NSSF can provide S-NSSAIs and TAIs to the UE as follows:\n-\tAllowed NSSAI includes S-NSSAIs that are registered in the whole RA;\n-\tList of Secondary Allowed NSSAI and associated Secondary RA:\n-\tA Secondary Allowed NSSAI includes S-NSSAIs that are registered and available in the associated Secondary RA;\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether the associated Secondary RA needs to be a set of TAIs that are a subset of the RA, or if it is possible to include TAIs that are not part of the RA.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether information like network capabilities, IMS voice support indication etc are to be kept per RA or adding the possibility to indicate Secondary RA.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether slicing functionality like NSSAA, NSAC and NSSRG are to be set for the RA or per Secondary RA.\n-\tThe UE is not allowed to register an S-NSSAI in a TA where the S-NSSAI is not defined to be available;\n-\tIf an S-NSSAI is registered and the UE moves to a TA where the S-NSSAI is not defined to be available then:\n-\tUP for any PDU Sessions for the S-NSSAI will be deactivated;\n-\tThe UE is not allowed to request to activate UP for a PDU Session for such S-NSSAI;\n-\tIf the UE is paged for an S-NSSAI and the UE is located in a TA where the S-NSSAI is not defined to be available, then the UE replies to the paging but the AMF/SMF ensures that the UP is not activated.\nWhile maintaining the network slice availability uniform per TA it means that some cells can be located outside the service area i.e. there is no need for the operator to serve the customer services (e.g. meeting the KPIs) using the network slice in those cells.\nA TA with cells within a customer provided service area and cells outside the customer provided service area while is visualized in Figure 6.26.2.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a customer-provided service area relation to cells, illustrating the spatial distribution of service areas and their corresponding cells. The diagram shows the relationship between the customer's location and the service area, with cells marked as circles and their corresponding cells marked as squares. The figure is a visual representation of the spatial layout of service areas and their corresponding cells, providing a clear understanding of the customer's location and the distribution of service areas.\nFigure 6.26.2.2-1: Example of customer provided service area relation to cells\nThe following principles are used for cells inside and outside the customer defined service area while maintaining uniform support of network slices within the TA:\n-\tCustomer wants service in a specific area i.e. the customer provided area.\n-\tOperator uses a network slice with S-NSSAI-1 for the customer\n-\tWhen UE uses cell A-C the user will get service as specified in agreed KPI's.\n-\tS-NSSAI-1 is defined to be available in TA-1 (i.e. available in cells A-E)\n-\tWhen UE is in cell D,E, the S-NSSAI is available, but only shared resources are allocated to the S-NSSAI-1 i.e. cannot expect to get the KPI's as agreed to be available within the customer provided area.\n-\tWhen user moves out of TA to Cell-F the S-NSSAI-1 is not available.\nFor the cells outside the service area, but within the TA i.e. cells D and E, the operator defines that the network slice is available but defines the RRM policies such that the network slice uses shared resources, see figure 4.3.36-2 from TS 28.541 [13]. As the network slice only get shared resources outside the service area means that the network slice does not compete with other network slices requiring dedicated resources in that cell and also means that uniform support of network slices can be maintain by re-using existing OAM mechanisms.\nThe figure depicts a structured representation of the RRM policy ratio, which is a key metric in network management. The structure is organized into two columns, with the first column representing the policy ratio and the second column representing the actual policy ratio.

If operator and implementation policy require, the AMF may also provide a list of TA (included in the current RA) where the rejected S-NSSAI(s) is supported and associated the list of TA to each rejected S-NSSAI.\n4.\tThe UE continues with Registration procedure.\nWhen the UE moves to another TA in current RA where the UE received the Rejected S-NSSAI and the cause value indicates \"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\", if the exception indication indicates that the Rejected S-NSSAI(s) is TA granularity so that it is allowed to use the Rejected S-NSSAI in anther TA, the UE is allowed to use the Rejected S-NSSAI in the Registration procedure. If the previously Rejected S-NSSAI is included in the Allowed NSSAI, UE can request the service for the S-NSSAI. If the AMF provides a list of TA associated with the rejected S-NSSAI(s) to the UE, the UE will send Registration Request for the rejected S-NSSAI when the UE moves into a new TA that is in the list of TA.\nFor example, the simple implementation of the exception indication can be realized by adding 1 bit indication in octet 3 bit8 of TS 24.501 [16] Figure 9.11.3.75.2 Extended rejected NSSAI information element.\nNOTE:\tIt is left to Stage-3 specifications to define the exact format of how the exception indication information would be provided to the UE. Here, for the purpose clarifying the aspect of \"simple implementation\", the example format is shown.\n\n\n\n",

It can often happen that the primary TAs support commonly used slices like eMBB and the Secondary TAIs are related to the Area of Service (AoS) of more specific slices like those associated with venues, enterprise slices with a smaller AoS that often would not map to any deployed TA perfectly. So, a UE supporting solution in 6.9 can be given an RA including both primary and Secondary TAIs in the RA TAI list and the Secondary TAIs are typically associated to e.g. Partially Allowed or Partially rejected S-NSSAIs in the RA.\nThis Solution proposes optimizations of the RA formation while taking into account the S-NSSAIs of the requested NSSAI.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution covers the case a UE is registering with a S-NSSAI from a TA where at least one of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAIs is not supported. In rel-17 the only possible solution to let the UE attempt to register again with any such S-NSSAI would be to indicate a RA which only includes the TAIs where allowed S-NSSAIs are supported, but then exclude from the RA any TAIs where at least one of the rejected S-NSSAIs is supported. This however was limiting the RA formation optimality. In Rel-18 we propose to resolve this by proposing that two options can be supported by a network for supporting UEs:\n1) the UE is provided with a RA including TAIs where the S-NSSAIs which are not supported in the current TA are also included, but for each rejected S-NSSAI the AMF provides a list of TAIs in the RA where the rejected S-NSSAI is supported (or, alternately, a list of TAIs in the RA where the rejected S-NSSAI is known to be not supported). This allows the UE, when it is camping in a cell of a TAI where the rejected S-NSSAI is known to be supported, to be able to trigger registration with such S-NSSAI if needed. The AMF provides for S-NSSAIs that are rejected in the whole RA the existing cause code (\"Not supported in the RA\") and for S-NSSAIs that are rejected in a subset of the RA TAIs a new cause code \" Partially Rejected/supported in the RA\" or some similar cause code\n2) the alternative is that the AMF provides an Allowed NSSAI that is known to be supported in the whole RA (if any) and then one or more \"Partially Allowed S-NSSAI in the RA\" including for each the Partial RA (subset of the RA) where these are supported. the advantage of this approach is that the UE can avoid further registrations as it moves in the RA among TAIs where the support of the Slices changes. This solution option shows also how the MO/MT transaction in idle mode happen and how the connected mode mobility is supported.\nBoth options can be supported in the same network as for instance the option 1) is optimal for the case where the AMF does not support both S-NSSAIs indicated in Requested NSSAI (so redirection to a AMF supporting both happens only if the UE lands at some point in a TA supporting both S-NSSAIs and the UE does still request both). Option 2) is more convenient when the AMF supports all the requested S-NSSAIs that it indicates in the Allowed NSSAI and in partially allowed S-NSSAIs. Also, it is possible to combine the two approaches in one procedure (e.g. let's suppose that there is a third S-NSSAI3 that is partially supported in the RA but not in the AMF in case 2), then this third S-NSSAI could be rejected with indication of where this S-NSSAI3 works).\nIn addition. if a S-NSSAI is subject to NSSAA and the UE is not yet authorised (NSSAA has not already occurred earlier) but not supported in current TA, the AMF behaviour is to indicate it is \"Partially rejected in the RA\" so NSSAA is executed upon the UE registering in the TA where the S-NSSAI is supported (if the S-NSSAI was partially allowed this means the UE would not cause the triggering of NSSAA).\nFor slices subject to simultaneous use constraints, the operator can only include in the same registration accept Allowed NSSAI and/or Partially allowed S-NSSAIs which can work together in the same TAIs for all the TAIs where the S-NSSAIs are allowed to be used together simultaneously.\nIf a S-NSSAI is subject to NSAC, the operator indicates the S-NSSAI not supported in the current TA is \"Partially rejected in the RA\", so that the counting of Allowed S-NSSAIs is matching exactly what is allowed at any time. Whether it could be desirable to enable operators to also support the behaviour where the Partially allowed S-NSSAIs is counted (so that the additional registration is avoided upon mobility inside the RA) can be further discussed in normative phase.\nWhen there are overlapping TAs with TA(s) where a S-NSSAI which is partially rejected is supported, which however do not support the S-NSSAI, a further optimization is to indicate to the UE the TAs where the UE is allowed attempting to register with a Partially Rejected S-NSSAI, even if it is not in the list of TAs where the slice is actually supported. Similarly, for the case of Partially Allowed S-NSSAI, a further optimization is to indicate to the UE the TAs where the UE is allowed attempting to e.g perform a SR or establish a session within a Slice that was indicated as partially allowed, even if it is not in the list of TAs where the slice is actually supported. This type of optimization enables avoiding blind attempts to use the slice.\nThis indication of TAs where the UE can initiate registration (or, respectively, service request and PDU session establishment/modification) can be done with an explicit indication of such TAs in the Registration accept/UE configuration update when the Partially rejected/Allowed S-NSSAI is provided.\nIn the message flows in the following clauses, we do not show this particular optimization for overlapping TAs and rather show for the partially allowed TA the case without such optimization.\n",

If it does apply to all S-NSSAIs, step 7 includes contacting the SMFs for s-NSSAI 1 to enable the applicable connectivity for S-NSSAI1.\nIt should be noted that the AMF detects in step 3 that the S-NSSAI2 connectivity is only possible if a HO is executed to a cell supporting S-NSSAI2 so this is requested by the AMF to the RAN. if this is successful, like in this case, step 11 enables connectivity for S-NSSAI2 PDU session.\nThe figure depicts a failure case scenario in a 29-3-2-2 MO service request, where TAs (Telecommunication Access Points) are supported by different gNBs (Gigabit Network Backbones). The figure illustrates the different scenarios where TAs may fail, such as when the gNB is not available, the gNB is not in the correct mode, or the gNB is not in the correct frequency band. The figure also shows the different scenarios where TAs may be supported by different gNBs, such as when the gNB is not in the correct mode, the gNB is not in the correct frequency band, or the gNB is not in the correct mode.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.2-2: MO service request: failure case with TAs supported by different gNBs\nFigure 6.29.3.2.2-2 shows the service request with the UE which is registered in TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2.This may apply to just S-NSSAI2 PDU session(s) or all s-NSSAIs PDU Session(s). If it does apply to all S-NSSAIs, step 7 includes contacting the SMFs for s-NSSAI 1 to enable the applicable connectivity for S-NSSAI1 and since it was not possible to handover to a TA supporting S-NSSAI2, the PDU session for S-NSSAI2 are set as deactivated so DL data is not sent till the UE moves in connected mode to a cell supporting S-NSSAI2 (in TAI2).\nThe figure depicts a successful MO service request with TAs supported by a single gNB, illustrating the communication between the gNB and the TAs. The figure shows the MO service request, the gNB, and the TAs, with the gNB acting as the central point of communication. The figure also includes the TAs' support, which is indicated by the single gNB. This figure provides a visual representation of the communication process and the support provided by the gNB.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.2-3: MO service request: success case with TAs supported by single gNB\nFigure 6.29.3.2.2-3 shows the service request with the UE which is registered in TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under the same gNB. This may apply to just S-NSSAI2 PDU session(s) or all s-NSSAIs PDU Session(s). If it does apply to all S-NSSAIs, step 8 includes contacting the SMFs for s-NSSAI 1 to enable the applicable connectivity for S-NSSAI1 and since it was possible to handover to TA2 supporting S-NSSAI2, SMFs for PDU sessions for S-NSSAI2 are also contacted to enable connectivity at step 8.\nTwo options are considered:\nOPTION A:\nThe figure depicts a successful MT service request with TAs supported by different gNBs, illustrating the various gNB-based MT services and their respective support.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.3-1: MT service request: success case with TAs supported by different gNBs\nFigure 6.29.3.2.3-1 shows the MT service request with the UE which is registered in RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs. This DL paging applies to a PDU session for S-NSSAI2. the UE replies to paging and the AMF at step 4 detect the UE replied for TAI1 not supporting the Slice. This triggers a Initial UE context setup including indication the S-NSSAI2 PDU session is conditionally activated subject to successful Handover to a cell of a supporting TA (TA2 in this example). At step 7, the AMF delays contacting the SMFs for the PDU sessions as it has received indication that the S-NSSAI2 PDU session activation is pending handover completion. Since it was possible to handover to TA2 supporting S-NSSAI2, as detected at the AMF when it receives the confirmation at step 9, SMF for the PDU session for S-NSSAI2 is contacted to enable connectivity at step 10. The triggering data is received at step 11. Otherwise, if the gNB cannot handover to a TA supporting the S-NSSAI2, the gNB updated the AMF with a NG-AP message (not shown in the figure above as it is describing only the success case) indicating the requested HO is not possible and the AMF may trigger AN connection release.\nOPTION B:\nThe figure depicts a successful MT service request with TAs supported by different gNBs, illustrating the various gNB-based MT services and their respective support.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.3-2: MT service request: success case with TAs supported by different gNBs\nFigure 6.29.3.2.3-2 shows the MT service request with the UE which is registered in RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs. This DL paging applies to a PDU session for S-NSSAI2 and noticing the S-NSSAI 2 is partially allowed in the RA at step 2 the paging request includes the S-NSSAI 2. The RAN receives S-NSSAI 2 in the paging request and selects a preferred band from one of the TA2 cells bands (i.e. the preferred band for S-NSSAI2 is indicated). For paging messages sent to cells in TA1, the gNB1 sends to the UE a paging message with the indication of the preferred band (how this is done needs to be decided by RAN2) and the UE shall trigger cell reselection to this preferred band only considering cells in the RA. Regardless of the outcome of cell reselection, the UE issues then a service request. If the cell reselection had positive outcome, like in the figure 6.29.3.2.3-2, the SR is received at the AMF and the AMF detects it is from TA2 where the S-NSSAI2 is supported. This then allows the SR to successfully complete. The triggering downlink data is received at step 11. Otherwise, if the SR is received from TAI1, the AMF may trigger AN connection release.\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where mobility is enabled and deactivated based on the presence of S-NSSAI2 sessions. The figure shows the different gNB (base station) configurations and their corresponding mobility states.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-1: CONNECTED mobility with deactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1 (different gNB)\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-1 shows mobility of UE which is CM-CONNECTED with RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs and where the UE has PDU sessions activated for both S-NSSAI1 and S-NSSAI2. Upon mobility to TAI1, the PDU session(s) for S-NSSAI2 are deactivated, meaning the context is preserved but the DL data is dropped and is not accounted for. the related DRBs are also reconfigured to be deactivated during the HO. The trigger for deactivation at AMF is the reception of a Path switch indicating S-NSSAI2 is now not supported (whether this is explicitly indicated, or the ULI allows the AMF to detect that, can be decided in normative phase).\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where mobile users are connected to the TAI2 network, and upon entering TAI2, they are reactivated by the S-NSSAI2 session. This is achieved through the use of a different gNB, which is connected to the TAI2 network. The figure illustrates the connectivity and reactivation process, highlighting the importance of network reconfiguration and the use of different gNB connections for different network segments.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-2: CONNECTED mobility with reactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI2 (different gNB)\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-2 shows mobility of UE which is CM-CONNECTED with RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs and where the UE has PDU sessions activated for S-NSSAI1 and deactivated for S-NSSAI2. Upon mobility to TAI2, the PDU session(s) for S-NSSAI2 are reactivated, meaning the context now set in SMF/UPF to enable data forwarding for the PDUs sessions for S-NSSAI2. The related DRBs are also reconfigured to be activated during the HO. The trigger for reactivation at AMF is the reception of a Path switch indicating S-NSSAI2 is now supported (whether this is explicitly indicated, or the ULI allows the AMF to detect that, can be decided in normative phase).\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where mobility is supported by reactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1. This is achieved through the use of a gNB, which is connected to the S-NSSAI2 sessions. The figure also shows the reactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1, which is a key feature of the network architecture.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-3: CONNECTED mobility with reactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1 (same gNB)\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-3 shows mobility of UE which is CM-CONNECTED with RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs and where the UE has PDU sessions activated for S-NSSAI1 and deactivated for S-NSSAI2. Upon mobility to TAI2, the PDU session(s) for S-NSSAI2 are reactivated, meaning the context now set in SMF/UPF to enable data forwarding for the PDUs sessions for S-NSSAI2. The related DRBs are also reconfigured to be activated during the HO. The trigger for reactivation at AMF is the reception of a NG-AP message indicating S-NSSAI2 is now supported (whether this is explicitly indicated, or the ULI allows the AMF to detect that, can be decided in normative phase). which NG-AP message is used is up to RAN3 to decide, but in this case a path Switch seems not sent based on current standards.\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where mobility is enabled with the deactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1. The network is segmented into different gNB (gNB1, gNB2, and gNB3) with no deactivation at the SMF (Service Mobility Framework) option. This configuration allows for seamless connectivity between gNB1 and gNB2, enabling the deactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-4: CONNECTED mobility with deactivation of S-NSSAI2 sessions upon entering TAI1 (different gNB) with no deactivation at SMF option\nFigure 6.29.3.2.4-4 shows mobility of UE which is CM-CONNECTED with RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs and where the UE has PDU sessions activated for both S-NSSAI1 and S-NSSAI2. Upon mobility to TAI1, as an alternative to the approach followed in figure 6.29.32.3.4-1, the DL for the PDU session(s) for S-NSSAI2 data is dropped in the RAN. The related DRBs are also reconfigured to be deactivated during the HO. Since there is DL dropped data at the RAN, this data is accounted for so a report of the dropped data volume may need to be sent periodically and when the AN connection is released as per configuration in the RAN. this may be sent to HPLMN SMF based on roaming agreement. the advantage of this configuration is that the activation/deactivation of sessions is local event in the RAN based on the TA where the UE is. It may also be more beneficial when RRC inactive is enabled. whether this option of the one requiring end to end modification of the state of PDU sessions is pursued is subject to evaluation in this study.\nThe figure depicts a PDU session setup for S-NSSAI 2 from TAI1, with different gNBs supporting the session. The setup includes the PDU, S-NSSAI 2, and TAI1, as well as the gNBs. The figure illustrates the communication between the PDU and the S-NSSAI 2, and the support from the gNBs.\nFigure 6.29.3.2.5-1: PDU session Establishment for S-NSSAI 2 from TAI1, TAs supported by different gNBs\nFigure 6.29.3.2.5-1 shows mobility of UE which is registered with RA= TAI, TAI2 with Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAI1 and Partially allowed S-NSSAI in TAI2 S-NSSAI2 where the TAI1 and TAI2 are supported by cells under different gNBs and where the UE attempts to establish a PDU session for S-NSSAI 2 while in a cell in TAI1 which does not support the S-NSSAI2. The PDU session is established but it is marked as deactivated. Upon connected mode mobility it is reactivated in step 8 when the UE moves to TAI2.\nDuring the AN release procedure, the Inactive PDU session are all marked as active so the data can be delivered to the RAN upon paging the UE.\n",

The Slice-Specific Service Area information element is a list of TA(s) in the RA where the slice that was not allowed is available, The Slice-Specific Service Area information element can be provided for a requested slice that is not allowed and is not available in the current TA, but is available in some TA(s) of the RA.\nDuring Registration, the UE may indicate to the AMF, in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability information element, that the UE is able to receive the Slice-Specific Service Area information element. The AMF can consider the UE's capability when forming the RA. For example, if the UE is capable of receiving the Slice-Specific Service Area information element, then the AMF may choose to include TA(s) in the RA where a slice that was not allowed is available. If the UE does not indicate that it is capable of receiving the Slice-Specific Service Area, the AMF may choose to avoid including TA(s) in the RA where a slice that was not allowed is available.\nThis solution includes two options.\n-\tOption A reuses the existing slice rejection cause code value of \"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\". However, compared to a Rel-17 UE, the solution proposes that a UE will interpret this cause code differently if the Slice-Specific Service Area information element is provided for the rejected slice. The solution explains how the UE may request rejected S-NSSAI again only if it is in a TA of the RA where the slice is available i.e. based on Slice-Specific Service Area information.  The UE can then be sent a new RA when it performs a new registration.\n-\tOption B proposes to reuse the existing Rel-17 option to neither reject nor allow slices that are available in only some TAs of the RA. In Rel-17 it is already possible to neither allow nor reject a slice. However, in this scenario, the Rel-17 UE would not be prevented from attempting again to register to a slice that is not available in the TA. The solution proposes that if the Slice-Specific Service Area information element is provided to the UE for a slice that is not rejected or allowed, then the UE may request the not allowed S-NSSAI again only if it is in a TA of the RA where the slice is available i.e. based on Slice-Specific Service Area information.

                            "text_content": "Operators would like to control the use of a network slice so as to optimize the performance of their network. In addition to that, there can be other reasons for a capability to enforce a certain usage of network slices, e.g. an operator may like to pull a network slice out of service for maintenance or other reasons and would like to let the UE use another network slice instead.\nAlso, the operator may experience congestion in a network slice due to some unforeseen circumstance for example due to Network Slice Admission Control (NSAC) there may a need to off-load a network slice, or simply due to a large amount of other UEs using the network slice (e.g. to access higher prioritized services or the other UEs are considered to be of higher priority) and therefore the network would like to control the use of the slice so as to alleviate e.g. the congestion.\nIrrespective of the reasons, in this solution different actions are proposed depending on the level of control required by the operator. The following network initiated capabilities are proposed to be supported:\nAction 1: Deregistering network slices for UEs or deregistering the UEs that are registering in network slices without establishing any PDUs.\nAction 2: Deregistering network slices for UEs or deregistering the UEs that have PDU sessions that are not active.\nAction 3: Enabling PDU sessions to be transferred from one network slice to another network slice, the other network slice can be previously included in the Allowed NSSAI or will be added to the Allowed NSSAI. This action 3 applies to KI#1 as well\nThe above capabilities can be applied in the context of deregistering the network slice for a limited number of UEs with progressively applying one or more of the above capabilities, as required, or applying all of the above capabilities in case of a network slice being taken out of service permanently or for a limited time (i.e. in such case the capabilities of case 3 is done first and then subsequently applying the deregistration).\nFor case 1 and case 2, the AMF can deregister a UE (e.g. when the UE is only registered to one network slice) using existing procedure \"network initiated deregistration\" as specified in clause 4.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [5] or deregistering a network slice for a UE by removing the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI using the UE Configuration Update procedure as specified in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5]. The AMF monitors/acquires the needed information regarding the usage of the network slice, e.g. if no PDU Session is established for the slice according to the network policy and/or if not complying with the network policy the AMF deregisters the UE from the network slice. As stated before, the means of detecting non-compliance are out of scope as well as triggers can be initiated by other NFs such as PCF, NSACF.\nFor case 3, there are several options:\nOption 1.The AMF initiates UE Configuration Update procedure towards the UE. The procedure is extended to support a PDU session transfer request from a source (network slice to be removed) network slice to a new target network slice if the AMF can locate another suitable network slice in the Allowed NSSAI or a new network slice is to be requested. If the target network slice is already in the Allowed NSSAI (before the UE Configuration Update procedure or is added to the Allowed NSSAI by the UE Configuration Update procedure, the UE then uses existing procedures to initiate a new PDU session using the target network slice for that purpose and tears down the PDU session on the source slice. If the target network slice is required to be registered by the UE, i.e. needs to be added to the Allowed NSSAI, the UE first requests the network slice by issuing a registration request and including the target network slice in the Requested NSSAI and then when the target NSSAI is in the Allowed NSSAI the UE establish PDU Session(s) using the target network slice.\nOption 2. The AMF initiates a request towards the SMF for a PDU session transfer, extending the existing service Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSM Context to support transfer of a PDU session from source slice to target slice. The SMF uses existing session management procedures extended with the necessary information to notify the UE to initiate a new PDU session towards the target slice and to tear down the old PDU sessions on the source slice.\nOption 3. The PCF initiates SM Policy Control Update Notify to SMF. The procedure is extended to include the target network slice. Then, as option 2, the SMF uses existing session management procedures with extensions to notify the UE to initiate a new PDU session towards the target slice and to tear down the old PDU sessions on the source slice. The PCF selection of UEs whose PDU sessions need to be transferred is use case dependent and relies on the existing mechanisms. In this option, the target network slice selection is per operator’s policy. To ensure that selected target S-NSSAI is part of the subscribed NSSAI, the PCF selects a target NSSAI based on per NSSAI policy data received from UDR. When the target S-NSSAI is not in the cell the UE is camped on, the transfer will not take place.\n",

The to be removed network slice can either be kept in the Allowed NSSAI for the duration of the UCU procedure and later removed, or directly removed by the UE Configuration Update command, but regarded as still allowed until the transfer to the target network slice has been completed.\nThe call flow in Figure 6.32.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure depicted above. The following is a brief description of the steps in the call flow.\nThe assumption in the call flow is a UE that has some PDU Sessions already established on a network slice and these PDU sessions have to be transferred to another network slice.\n-\tIn step 1, the AMF initiates a UE Configuration Update Command, marking in (or in relation to) the Allowed NSSAI the network slice to be removed and including a new IE information to instruct the UE regarding the removed slice (or to be removed network slice) and the new target network slice that replaces it. As stated before, if the target network slice is not added by the UCU procedure to the Allowed NSSAI, the UE first requests the network slice to be registered by issuing a registration request and including the target network slice in the Requested NSSAI and then when the target NSSAI is included in the Allowed NSSAI the UE establishes PDU Session(s) using the target network slice. Note that the Figure below does not show the aspect of UE registering to request the target slice to be used. In the UE Configuration Update Command, the AMF may provide back off timer for the source S-NSSAI and/or includes the original slice in the Rejected NSSAI so that the UE cannot request a PDU Session according to the existing URSP rule until the back off timer is expired.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS if additional information is to be included in the new IE to perform PDU Session Transfer.\n-\tIn step 2 the UE acknowledges the reception of the Configuration Update Command.\nThe remaining steps are based on existing procedures per clause 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\nThe figure depicts a PDU Session Transfer process initiated by an UE in a 32-bit 1-1-1 system. It illustrates the steps involved in initiating a session, including the initiation of the session, the establishment of the session, and the completion of the session. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 6.32.2.1-1: PDU Session Transfer - UE Initiated Procedure\nIn this solution, the Slices in Allowed NSSAI are not changed but one of the slices for example is temporarily taken out of service and should not be used. The AMF, per operator's policy or by learning from other NFs that a slice shouldn't be used instructs the SMF used for the source network slice (i.e. network slice to not be used), to initiate a PDU Session Transfer from the source network slice to the target network slice (new network slice to be used). The Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service is extended to support such a capability e.g. the AMF indicates a Target network slice to the SMF. The SMF in turn sends a PDU Session Modification Request to the UE to initiate a PDU Session transfer. The PDU Modification Session Request can be extended to support this new capability (e.g. adding target slice and optionally source slice that otherwise could be derived from existing PDU Session, either in PCO together with existing \"PDU Session Address Lifetime value\" or in a new IE. The UE uses existing procedures to establish the PDU session using the new target slice and usually the same DNN and releases the old PDU sessions used with the source network slice.\nThe call flow in Figure 6.32.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure depicted above. The following is a brief description of the steps in the call flow.\nThe assumption in the call flow is that a UE has some PDU Sessions already established on a network slice and these PDU sessions have to be transferred to another network slice.\n-\tIn step 1, the AMF initiates a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to initiate a PDU session transfer from a source slice to a target slice. The Request is extended to support this new capability e.g. the Target network slice to the SMF and possible an indication that a transfer is to be initiated.  The Request is now extended with the following optional information so that the SMF can inform the UE to perform a PDU Session transfer from source slice to a target slice:\n-\tSource network Slice,\n-\tTarget network Slice,\n-\tAction: Perform Session transfer for all PDU sessions immediately or at a scheduled tie time applicable to the UE location.\n-\tIn step 2, the SMF initiates action to notify the UE about a PDU session transfer from a source slice to a target slice as indicated above is extending the PDU Session Modification Request sent to the UE to include the needed information.\n-\tIn step 3, SMF returns Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response to the AMF.\n-\tIn step 4, the SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to include an SM container towards the UE with a PDU Session Modification Command extended (e.g. with target S-NSSAI) to inform the UE of a PDU Session Transfer.\n-\tIn step 5 the AMF forwards the SM Container content to the UE.\nThe AMF may include back off timer for the original slice and/or includes the original slice in the Rejected NSSAI to prevent the UE requesting the slice due to URSP rule re-evaluation.\nThe remaining steps are based on existing procedures per clause 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\nThe call flow does not show the aspect of UE registering to request the target slice to be used if this step is required, when the target slice is not in the Allowed slices.\nThe figure depicts a session management procedure in an AMF initiated PDU session transfer, illustrating the steps involved in managing session data.\nFigure 6.32.2.2.1-1: AMF initiated PDU Session Transfer - Session Management Procedure\nEditor's note:\tthe impact of overriding of the SSC mode need be evaluated.\nIn this solution the PCF initiates the PDU session transfer. The flow is the same as the one described in clause 6.32.2.2.1 with the exception of Step 1. In this solution the PCF sends a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify to initiate a PDU session transfer from a source slice to a target slice. The update notify is extended to indicate the SMF, the Target network slice and indication that a PDU transfer is to be initiated. The Update Notify message sent from the PCF is extended with the following information to enable the SMF to request the UE to perform a PDU Session transfer from source slice to a target slice:\n-\tSource network Slice;\n-\tTarget network Slice;\n-\tAction: Perform Session transfer for all PDU sessions immediately or at a scheduled time applicable to the UE location.\nThe figure depicts a PCF Initiated PDU Session Transfer, which is a crucial step in the session management procedure in a network. It illustrates the initiation of a PDU session, the transmission of session information, and the subsequent management of the session. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, making it easier to understand the steps involved in session management.\nFigure 6.32.2.2.2-1: PCF Initiated PDU Session Transfer - Session Management Procedure\nIt is desirable that SSC mode 3 is employed for performing PDU session transfer from a source network slice to a target network slice. This is critically important for emergency PDU sessions and PDU sessions used for MC applications and which cannot be disconnected before completion or otherwise have to be handled with SSC mode 3. It is thus possible for either of the above solutions that the UE may receive the SSC mode 3 to be used during the PDU session transfer. This implies that the UE overrides the SSC mode currently used for the PDU session to be transferred.\nMore specifically, in the UE initiated approach, the target NSSAI in the UE Configuration Update Command can indicate that the UE can apply SSC mode 3 logic for the PDU session transfer.\nFor the network initiated approach, the PDU Modification Session Request can be extended to include the SSC mode 3 logic to be used for PDU session transfer.\n",

This solution can be used during the Registration procedure and work in addition to other solution which monitor the usage of a Network Slice after the Registration procedure. The assistance information is basically the reason for registration with the S-NSSAI. The reason for registration with the S-NSSAI can be one of the following:\na)\tThe S-NSSAI is requested due to need for 'immediate use': an application in the UE requests connectivity and a matching URSP rule or UE Local Policy determined to use an S-NSSAI (e.g. as part of the URSP rule's RSD). In this sense, the UE needs the slice registration for (immediate) usage. In another example, if there are already established PDU Sessions (with active or inactive UP resources) in the S-NSSAI, the UE can use this reason for registration.\nb)\tThe S-NSSAI is requested due to a match to 'default applications': based on local configuration, the UE is aware about the default applications and can determine the corresponding S-NSSAI (which can be identified as \"always on\" S-NSSAIs). For example, a voice-centric UE knows that IMS voice application is needed at any time, i.e. the IMS voice application is a default application. The corresponding S-NSSAI falls into this category.\nc)\tThe S-NSSAI is requested due to a 'proactive registration': based on UE implementation, the UE may want to register to an S-NSSAI in order to be able to immediately establish a PDU Session in this network slice when needed at some point of time.\nThe network (e.g. the AMF) may configure the UE whether to include the reason for registration with the S-NSSAI.\nWhen the network (e.g. AMF or NSSF) receives a reason for registration with S-NSSAI, the network determines, based on internal policies and the received reason for registration with each S-NSSAI of the Requested NSSAIs, which S-NSSAI of the Requested NSSAI are included in the Allowed NSSAI.\nThe AMF can optionally include a requested S-NSSAI with reason for registration 'proactive registration' in the list of rejected S-NSSAIs with an appropriate reject cause (e.g. rejected due to 'proactive registration'). The UE may request the S-NSSAI at any time later if there is application which needs this S-NSSAI.\nRegarding the UE behaviour, if an application request data connectivity and the matching URSP rule includes an S-NSSAI which is not in the Allowed NSSAI (but also not rejected due unavailability in the PLMN, RA, or NSAC), the UE can first sends a request to register with the S-NSSAI before processing further RSDs or before the UE concludes that the RSD is invalid.\n",

The procedure is executed as following:\n1.\tThe AF which uses the indicated slice provides the UE inactivity time parameter to the UDM as defined in the clause 4.15.6.2 of TS 23.502 [5]. The UE inactivity time includes two parts, i.e. the PDU session inactivity time and S-NSSAI inactivity time.\nThe defined PDU session inactivity time is associated with a DNN and S-NSSAI combination pair and optional UE type (e.g. factory UE, Vehicular UE which can be identified as group of UE). It indicates exactly when a given PDU session can be released after an observed inactivity.\nThe S-NSSAI inactivity time is associated with a S-NSSAI and optional UE type (e.g. factory UE, Vehicular UE which can be identified as group of UE). It defines exactly when the serving AMF can remove that S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI after an observed inactivity of a UE that has registered to a given S-NSSAI but has not established any PDU session associated with that indicated S-NSSAI.\nIt is also possible that the UE inactivity time is set by a mobile network operator and stored in the UDM even without any AF provisioning.\n2.\tA UE performs registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [5]. As part of that procedure, the serving AMF get the S-NSSAI inactivity time from the UDM.\nOnce the UE has registered on a given S-NSSAI, the serving AMF gets notified whether a given UE supports UE behaviour control policies.\n-\tIf the UE does not support that policy handling, the AMF will starts monitoring the S-NSSAI inactivity time. For each UE this S-NSSAI inactivity time is per each given S-NSSAI if the given S-NSSAI is in the Allowed NSSAI.\n-\tIf UE supports UE behaviour control policies and there is no additional configuration that requires an AMF to still keep network control in terms of dealing with UE inactivity, the serving AMF may not configure inactivity timers for those UEs and subsequently monitor those UEs for their inactiveness before deregistering them from an unused S-NSSAI.\n3.\tA UE performs PDU session establishment procedure as defined in clause 4.3.2.2 of TS 23.502 [5]. As part of that procedure, the serving SMF gets the PDU session inactivity time from the UDM and also whether UE supports UE behaviour control policies.\nIf the UE does not support that policy handling, the SMF configures the indicated time value at the UPF.\nA Serving SMF will configure inactivity timer and monitor PDU Sessions belonging to those UEs in case the support for UE behaviour control policies is not available for those UEs. However, a serving SMF may still keep the control of having to release PDU Sessions after an inactivity has been monitored over a configured inactivity timer even for UEs that support UE behaviour control policies, e.g. monitoring of misbehaving UEs.\n4.\tWhen the UPF detects no traffic on the related PDU session at least over the configured PDU session inactivity time, it will report to the serving SMF. The serving SMF determines that the PDU session can be released unless this PDU session is related to MPS or Emergency service.\n5.\tThe serving SMF triggers the PDU session release procedure as defined in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [5].\nThe serving SMF may give an indication to AMF while releasing the PDU session due to inactivity.\n6.\tIf the serving AMF detects that no established PDU session associated with the indicated S-NSSAI over the related access type and the S-NSSAI inactivity timer (if configured at step 2) is expired, it determines that the UE's S-NSSAI can be deregistered from a given Allowed S-NSSAI for the given access type.\nFor established PDU session the AMF may deregister the UE from indicated S-NSSAI if the AMF receives the PDU session release indication which is set by SMF at step 5 and the PDU session is the last PDU session associated with S-NSSAI.\n7.\tThe serving AMF initiates the UE configuration update procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [5] to remove the indicated S-NSSAI from Allowed NSSAI of the UE.\n",

These rules are configured either in the NSSF or the PCF, and are provided to AMF for inclusion the Registration Accept or UPU procedure. Figure 6.38.3.2.2-1 depicts the procedure.\nNOTE 1\tThe NSSF based solution does not allow per UE policies.\nNOTE 2:\tIn roaming case this means also querying the HPLMN NSSF /PCF to get the HPLMN policies and to check whether the VPLMN can set the policies.\nNOTE 3:\tThis option proposes 2 sub-options but only one sub-option is expected to be selected if this sub option is selected.\nThe figure depicts a network slicing scenario where the NSSF/PCF option is used to update the UE behaviour slice usage policies. This is achieved through the use of a policy management system (PMS) that manages the slice usage policies for the network slices. The figure illustrates the process of updating the slice usage policies, including the selection of the NSSF/PCF option, the creation of a new policy, and the deployment of the new policy. The figure also shows the communication between the PMS and the network slices, as well as the communication between the PMS and the UE.\nFigure 6.38.3.2.2-1: NSSF/PCF Option for Update of UE behaviour Slice Usage policies\nThe steps in the call flow are as shown below.\n1.\tIn step 1, the UE registers in 5GS. The UE includes its capabilities to support handling and processing of network slice (and DNN/PDU Session) usage policies/rules. The UE MM Core Network Capability (i.e. in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability ) is extended to include this information.\n2.\tIn step 2 Registration procedure steps 2-19c are performed according to TS 23.502 [5] with the additional need to store the new UE capabilities. In case, the V-PCF sub-option is selected to provide the policies, the Access and mobility related policy information is extended such that AMF provides to V-PCF the Configured NSSAI and DNNs in the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create (see TS 23.502 [5] step 2 of figure 4.16.1.2-1) or the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Update (see TS 23.502 [5] step 1 of figure 4.16.2.1.1-1) and the V-PCF derives the related policies and provides them in the response. V-PCF can later on update the policies in Npcf_AMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify (see TS 23.502 [5] step 3 of Figure 4.16.2.2-1).\n3.\tIn step 3 if the AMF is not configured for the policies for the Allowed slices (and V-PCF sub-option of step 2 is not used), the AMF sends a Nnssf_NSSelection_Get Request to the NSSF to either fetch Network Slice selection information and policies or just the policies applicable to usage of allowed slices (e.g. all S-NSSAIs of Configured NSSAI). The Nnssf_NSSelection_Get Request is extended to include the request of network slice usage policies for Allowed slices/Configured Slices. Alternatively, a new NSSF service operation is used to retrieve the policies in which case the AMF provides the applicable S-NSSAIs e.g. all S-NSSAIs of the Configured NSSAI, PLMN ID of the UE or complete UE ID (e.g. SUPI) and the related DNNs of the S-NSSAIs.\n4.\tIn step 4 the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get Response is extended to include this additional network slice usage policies/rules information, or a response of the new service operation.\n5.\tIn step 5, the AMF stores the received information, and checks if the UE supports the ability to store and process network slice usage policies/rules, unless that was done before in step 2 or before step 3.\n6.\tIn step 6 assuming UE supports the policies, the AMF includes this information in the Registration Accept response to the UE.\n7.\tIn step 7, the UE applies the received network slice rules/policies.\n8.\tIn step 8 the AMF enforces the policies. The AMF action in case of policy violation could be based on policy but is out of scope.\nIf the network wants to update the polices, the AMF provides the updated policies to the UE using UE Configuration Update Command (see Figure 4.2.4.2-1 in TS 23.502 [5]).\nThe above procedure is performed in the visited network.\nSeparately from the generic UE behaviour control provided by the UE behaviour control policies by HPLMN and VPLMN, it should be possible via the URSPs to control additional aspects of UE behaviour. The URSP can be augmented with information indicating whether certain RSD S-NSSAI registration is mandatory or whether certain RSD DNN+S-NSSAI PDU session establishment is mandatory.\nAlso, if the RSDs matching a TD share the DNN but have different priority order due to respective S-NSSAIs, the related PDU connection can be used interchangeably to serve the application in priority order. If an indication is provided to the UE to do so in the URSP, meaning that the UE is indicated explicitly to always attempt use the highest priority S-NSSAI RSD even if one RSD related to a lower Priority S-NSSAI is already being used and the higher priority RSD slice is not yet allowed.\n",

But the Rel17 NSAC feature increase the probability for the UE's PDU session to get rejected if the quota for the concurrent established PDU session for the given slice is about to exhaust. Hence there is a need for serving network to steer to some other preferred slice by updating the URSP and sending to those UEs.\nThe following are the main principles of the solution:\n-\tPCF will subscribe using the Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe service operation with NSACF to the event 'the number of PDU Sessions established on a network slice' and the threshold can be set as per the configuration. PCF will NSACF discovery as in clause 6.3.22 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tNSACF will notify to the PCF.\n-\tPCF will derive the list of UEs for which the slice is applicable. Then PCF will update the URSP by replacing that slice or lowering the precedence of that slice with some other preferred slice for the DNN/Application and send to UEs. In case of replacement, the PCF can select one available slice from at least one of Allowed NSSAI, subscribed S-NSSAI and/or Configured NSSAI and replace the exhausted slice with the selected slice.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of an example of an URSP rule modification, which is a key concept in network management and optimization. The figure shows a network with multiple paths, each represented by a different color, and a set of rules that dictate how these paths should be used. The color-coded paths represent different types of traffic, such as voice, video, and data, and the rules dictate which paths should be used for which type of traffic. The figure also includes a legend that explains the different colors and their meanings. This simplified representation of the URSP rule modification process is useful for understanding the concept and for implementing it in a real-world network.\nFigure 6.39.1-1: Example of URSP rule modification\n",

The following use cases are not targeted: (a) the same S-NSSAI can be used and the change of NSI within the S-NSSAI is required or (b) the S-NSSAI change within a network internal network resource partitioning is required.\nIf the user traffic from the S-NSSAI-1 can be served over the alternative network slice (e.g. S-NSSAI-2), then there are several cases how the alternative S-NSSAI-2 relates to the UE's Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) list:\nCase A:\tThe S-NSSAI-2 is part of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and already part of the Allowed NSSAI.\nCase B:\tThe S-NSSAI-2 is part of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, but not part of the allowed NSSAI.

                            "text_content": "The solution proposes that the AMF (or together with the NSSF or OAM system) determines that an old S-NSSAI (e.g. S-NSSAI-1) is unavailable and the alternative S-NSSAI (e.g. S-NSSAI-2) is available in the current TA and should be used to replace the S-NSSAI-1. The AMF internally checks the UE network slice configuration (e.g. Subscribed S-NSSAIs, Allowed NSSAI, Rejected NSSAI) against the S-NSSAI-2 and the AMF applies one of the following procedures:\n1)\tWhen the S-NSSAI-2 is part of the UE's subscribed S-NSSAIs and S-NSSAI-2 is not part of the rejected NSSAI for the UE (e.g. in the Cases A and B from clause 6.42.1), it is assumed that the S-NSSAI-2 would be also configured in the UE's URSP rules. Specifically, the URSP rule which is used to establish the existing PDU Session on S-NSSAI-1 would also include further RSD including S-NSSAI-2. Therefore, the AMF deduces that the UE configuration with URSP rules (and Configured NSSAI) allows the UE to use S-NSSAI-2; or in other words the AMF determines that UE Network Slice reconfiguration is not needed, i.e. NAS SM procedure can be applied. When the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI-1 becomes unavailable, the AMF triggers SM procedure towards the SMF to indicate that the PDU Session on S-NSSAI-1 should be released and alternative S-NSSAI may be used. The SMF indicates to the UE in the NAS SM signalling for PDU Session release procedure that a new PDU Session can be establish on an S-NSSAI different from S-NSSAI-1. The UE re-evaluates the URSP rule determines to use S-NSSAI-2 (as part of a further RSD) for the new PDU Session establishment. If the S-NSSAI-2 is not part of the Allowed NSSAI, the UE first performs Registration procedure to request the registration to S-NSSAI-2 and afterwards the PDU Session establishment procedure.\nNOTE:\tThe assumption that the UE is configured with a URSP rule containing an RSD with S-NSSAI-1 and an RSD with S-NSSAI-2 is justified by the fact that the UE is subscribed with both S-NSSAI-1 and S-NSSAI-2: Furthermore, the network is configured/aware that both S-NSSAI-1 and S-NSSAI-2 can server the same user traffic, but with different slice preferences, at the time of URSP creation in the PCF.\n2)\tWhen a first determined alternative S-NSSAI is part of the UE's subscribed S-NSSAIs, but part of the Rejected NSSAI (e.g. due to NSSAA failure), the AMF may determine another alternative S-NSSAI (e.g. S-NSSAI-2) which the UE can use in the current TA. Furthermore, the S-NSSAI-2 may not be part of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs of the UE, which means that the S-NSSAI-2 is not part of the Configured NSSAI. In other words, the UE cannot request, register with, and use the alternative S-NSSAI-2 which is according to the Case C from clause 6.42.1. When the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI-1 becomes unavailable, the AMF triggers UE network slice reconfiguration procedure (e.g. UCU procedure) in order to send a new Configured NSSAI with a corresponding Mapping of the Configured NSSAI information containing the mapping of S-NSSAI-2 to S-NSSAI-1. Such slice mapping information can be also applicable in the HPLMN.\nPlease note that in case the S-NSSAI-1 becomes unavailable and there is already established PDU Session on S-NSSAI-1, the network anyhow needs to release the PDU Session independent of the SSC mode of the PDU Session. In case of PDU Session in SSC modes 1 or 2, the SMF initiates PDU Session release procedure and may indicate to the UE that an alternative S-NSSAI can be used. In case of PDU Session in SSC modes 3, the SMF initiates PDU Session modification procedure and indicates to the UE that an alternative S-NSSAI should be used. In any of the cases, the service continuity on the application layer is provided if the application using the PDU Session can manage IP address change.\n",

It illustrates the step-by-step process of replacing the S-NSSAI-1 with S-NSSAI-2, including the use of SM (Signal Modulation) and MM (Multiplex Modulation) procedures. The figure also includes a visual representation of the signal flow, highlighting the key components and their interactions.\nFigure 6.42.3-1: Signalling flow for replacing the S-NSSAI-1 with S-NSSAI-2 by using either SM or MM procedures\nThe detailed description of the steps is provided as follows:\n0a.\tThe UE requests registration with the network and with a network slice S-NSSAI-1.\n0b.\tThe UE initiates the establishment of a PDU Session on S-NSSAI-1. The SMF1 is selected by the AMF to be the serving SMF for the PDU Session.\n1.\tThe AMF determines at least one of: (a) S-NSSAI-1 becomes unavailable and (b) an alternative S-NSSAI (e.g. S-NSSAI-2) can be used to replace S-NSSAI-1. The reason why S-NSSAI-1 becomes unavailable can be one of: non-mobility event (e.g. OAM or NSSF/NF reconfiguration, S-NSSAI-1 will be down due to network maintenance); or UE mobility event (e.g. the T-AMF does not support S-NSSAI-1).\nThe AMF proceeds either with Option 1) in step 2 or with Option 2) in step 4 as described below.\nOption 1) (using SM procedure and existing URSP rules):\n2a.\tIf the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI-2 is part of the UE's subscribed S-NSSAIs or part of the Configured NSSAI, the AMF assumes that the UE has been provided with the URSP rules including the use of the S-NSSAI-2. If there is at least one established PDU Session on S-NSSAI-1, the AMF triggers Session Management procedure to sends a request to the SMF1 to release the PDU Session.\n2b.\tThe AMF sends to the SMF1 Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext request message including one or more indications that the S-NSSAI-1 is unavailable and alternative S-NSSAI may be used.\n2c.\tThe SMF1 initiates the PDU Session release procedure in case of SSC mode 1 and 2. In case of SSC mode 3, the SMF1 may trigger PDU Session modification procedure to trigger the UE to initiate the establishment of a new PDU Session. In any of the procedures (e.g. PDU Session release/modification procedure), the SMF includes an indication that the PDU Session may be re-established on an S-NSSAI different from S-NSSAI-1.\n2d.\tThe SMF1 acknowledges to the AMF the release of the PDU Session.\n3a.\tIf the S-NSSAI-2 is not part of the Allowed NSSAI (e.g. Case B from clause 6.42.1), the UE first performs Registration procedure to request the registration to S-NSSAI-2.\n3b.\tThe UE re-evaluates the URSP rule and determines a further RSD having an S-NSSAI different from S-NSSAI-1, i.e. S-NSSAI-2. In Case A from clause 6.42.1 or after step 3a, the UE triggers a new PDU Session(s) establishment according to the further RSD which contains S-NSSAI-2. The UE sends a NAS message to the AMF including S-NSSAI-2, and in case of SSC mode 3, the UE includes the old PDU Session ID.\nOption 2) (using MM procedure for UE network slice reconfiguration):\n4a.\tIf the determined alternative S-NSSAI cannot be potentially included in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE (e.g. due to stored NSSAA failure result or available S-NSSAIs in the current UE's TA) as per Case C from clause 6.42.1, the AMF may determine yet another alternative S-NSSAI (e.g. S-NSSAI-2) not part of the UE's Subscribed S-NSSAIs; or the AMF simply determines an alternative S-NSSAI-2 which is not part of the UE's Subscribed S-NSSAIs. Then the AMF determines to configure the UE to use the S-NSSAI-2 in addition to S-NSSAI-1, i.e. by applying the network slice mapping mechanisms to configure the UE to use S-NSSAI-2 wherein the S-NSSAI-2 is mapped to the S-NSSAI-1.\nIf the NSSF is responsible to determine the Configured NSSAI, Allowed NSSAI and/or Rejected NSSAI, the AMF sends a Nnssf_NSSelection_Get request service operation to the NSSF including an additional indication that an alternative S-NSSAI to S-NSSAI-1 is required. The NSSF may determine the S-NSSAI-2 to replace S-NSSAI-1, the NSSF may create the Configured NSSAI and Allowed NSSAI with the corresponding mapping information and send them to the AMF.\n4b.\tThe AMF triggers the UE Configuration Update (UCU) Command procedure where the AMF may include a new Configured NSSAI containing S-NSSAI-2 and in addition mapping information of S-NSSAI-2- to S-NSSAI-1; and new Allowed NSSAI with corresponding mapping of Allowed NSSAI information.\nNOTE:\tThe AMF can wait with step 4b until the established PDU Session on S-NSSAI-1 is not in active state (e.g. the user plane resources are not activated). This would allow the UE to establish new PDU Session(s) and terminate the existing PDU Session(s) while there is no user traffic to be sent over the PDU Session(s).\n5a.\tThe UE internally determines to trigger the establishment of new PDU Session(s) for the user traffic which is currently routed to the S-NSSAI-1. If the S-NSSAI-2 is not part of the Allowed NSSAI, the UE first performs Registration procedure to request the registration to S-NSSAI-2.\n5b.\tThe UE applies the same URSP rule and same RSD, but the UE includes the S-NSSAI-2 and the mapping information of S-NSSAI-2 to S-NSSAI-1 in the NAS message to the AMF. The UE creates the PDU Session establishment request according the matching URSP and the UE includes it the N1 SM container in the NAS message to the AMF.\n5c.\tThe SMF2 uses the mapped S-NSSAI value (e.g. S-NSSAI-1) from the slice mapping information received from the UE to retrieve the UE subscription data from the UDM.\nAfter some time when the AMF may determines that S-NSSAI 1 can be used again, the AMF would perform the UCU procedure to configure the UE to use the S-NSSAI-1 again.\n",

In this step, Target AMF stores the mapping messages of Allowed NSSAI UE can access in current registration area and Secondary NSSAI returned by NSSF, avoiding query NSSF every time UE registered into the network.\n7,8:\tThe rest of the registration procedure.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where a PDU session is transferred to a new network slice in a no mobility scenario. The PDU is represented as a rectangular shape with a label indicating its type (e.g., PDU-1). The session is transferred to a new network slice, which is represented by a rectangular shape with a label indicating its type (e.g., Network Slice-1). The new network slice is labeled with a label indicating its type (e.g., Network Slice-2). The scenario is depicted with a dashed line indicating the path of the session, and the new network slice is shown with a dashed line indicating the path of the session.

As documented in the#40 in Table 7.X-1, it is unclear how the PCF knows whether the alternative S-NSSAI is supported in the current TA and the RAN node.\nRegarding the impacts to the UE, the solutions can be categorized into the following groups:\n-\tSolutions without impact to the UE:\n-\tFor scenarios where the same S-NSSAI is deployed on multiple NSIs and NSI change is performed (e.g. solution #15): the NSI change is performed seamlessly to the UE, although there is signalling to the UE, but it uses legacy signalling.\n-\tFor scenarios where the old and alternative S-NSSAIs are deployed on the same NSI (e.g. solution #1): the principle is that the change of the old S-NSSAI to alternative S-NSSAI is handled within the 5GC and NG-RAN and transparent to the UE.\n-\tSolutions with impact to the UE (e.g. solutions #2, #3, #4, #5, #32, #41, #42, etc.): the UE is informed either by using NAS MM signalling from AMF and/or by using NAS SM signalling from the SMF that the old S-NSSAI is to be replaced by an alternative S-NSSAI. It is beneficial if only a single configuration is performed to the UE. Usually, the NAS SM signalling is meant to influence a single PDU. It appears beneficial to use both:\n-\tNAS MM signalling to include the alternative S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI, the alternative S-NSSAI replaces the old S-NSSAI.\n-\tNAS SM signalling is used to release the PDU Session with an indication to use an alternative S-NSSAI (e.g. as per NAS MM configuration).\nIn solutions #4, #5 and #32, it is described that the AMF may provide back off timer for the old S-NSSAI and/or includes the old S-NSSAI in the Rejected NSSAI to prevent the UE requesting the old S-NSSAI due to URSP rule re-evaluation. However, if the old S-NSSAI is included in the Rejected NSSAI or back-off timer is configured, and the URSP rules have only the old S-NSSAI in the RSDs, the UE will not be able to establish a new PDU Session for the matching URSP rule, as the RSDs will be determined as invalid. Such solution is only applicable if the URSP rule(s) or local configuration contains multiple RSDs including the old S-NSSAI and the alternative S-NSSAI.\nNOTE:\tGiven the limitation of this solution (i.e. include the old S-NSSAI in the Rejected NSSAI or using of BOT), it would be beneficial if the old S-NSSAI is excluded from the Allowed NSSAI but included as replaced (or mapped) S-NSSAI value in the Mapping OF Allowed NSSAI (or a new IE), i.e. similar to the mapped S-NSSAI value sent in the existing mapping of Allowed NSSAI.\n",

Given that this KI is related to a roaming UE, where SoR is already invoked, it is recommended that reuse of existing SoR procedures should be an important evaluation criterion.\nSolution #19 proposes some new SoR information that is slice aware is provided to the UE proactively from the HPLMN in addition to the existing SoR info, to trigger the Slice aware behaviour for specific S-NSSAIs and enable indication of specific separate preferred PLMN lists per S-NSSAI and a way to weight the PLMN selection when multiple such S-NSSAI are impacted.

                    "text_content": "Solutions related to the improved support of limited AoS not matching deployed TAs:\nSolution 9 proposes that the limited AoS slices may be based on the configuration of additional secondary TAIs in addition to the existing Primary TAIs. This requires RAN2/3 to agree defining this concept as outlined in the solution in detail. The companion solution 29 then helps with UEs that need also to be allowed slices associated with AoS matching the existing TAs, then with the partially rejected or partially Allowed S-NSSAIs approach there is good way to form a RA that is encompassing a mix of Primary and Secondary TAs and optimally support this use case.\nSolution 11 bases the limited-service area support on the awareness of slice support at cell level in the system. This requires RAN3 impact as NG-RAN informs slice availability on per-cell basis. The AMF provides Conditional S-NSSAI (i.e. S-NSSAI with TA info the S-NSSAI is available) to the UE. The UE can use the Conditional S-NSSAI without further Registration if location condition is fulfilled.\nSolution 21 uses the validity rules of URSP to indicate only some area can support the service. The AMF does not removes slices from the Allowed NSSAI when the UE is outside of the service area of the slices if the UE is remains current Registration area.\nSolution 23 proposes inclusion of conditional slices in Registration Area Accept response to the UE. This solution is similar to solution 11 when cell level granularity is assumed.\nSolution 26 proposes to use the existing per cell RRM Policy Ratio logic such that cells outside the wanted service area are given only shared/limited or no resources for the concerned network slice, while slice support is maintained on a per TA level. This enables the KPIs to be met while the UE is within the defined service area while when the UE is outside the defined service area still within the TA supporting the S-NSSAI the S-NSSAI is supported but with reduced capabilities and that also enables the possibility to steer the UE back to the defined service area as soon as possible with using existing mechanisms. The solution enables the users to get the requested services and KPIs as per defined SLA, and efficiently get back to service if the UE temporary needs to access a cell outside of the area. The solution does allow the UE to access cells also outside the defined service area if there are resources i.e. it does not prohibit a complete access to the cell.\nSolution 29 is mainly oriented to KI#5 but it potentially with clarifications/changes supports solutions like Solution 9 where additional smaller secondary TA are deployed as it can allow these to be more flexibly added to the RA. This solution proposes procedure enhancements when Partially Allowed / Rejected S-NSSAIs is supported in the network.\nSolution 44 proposes to apply per S-NSSAI Service Area Restrictions. The UDM, RAN and UE needs to support such Service Area Restrictions per S-NSSAI.\nSolution 45 assumes the RAN is configured fit cells in TAs outside the AoS of a S-NSSAI as belonging to a CSAN (constrained service area) where the SLA is not met in the TA. This then results in a differentiated handling of UEs inside and outside the CSAN in the TA. There is no awareness in the UE and CN about the CSAN so this can result in the UE and CN behaving as if the network slice is supported inside the whole TA.\nSolutions related to the support of temporary network slices:\nSolution 10 that indicates network slices timing information, but this does not remove the need to update sessions with explicit signalling despite the timing information was known in advance. Also, this is driven by UDM or NSSF but there is no signalling instructing the RAN or the RAN itself cannot be the root cause of a slice termination if some slice support is time based in the RAN.\nSolution 11 proposes new temporary slices to be supported conditionally based on timing conditions. The AMF provides Conditional S-NSSAI (i.e. S-NSSAI with timing info the S-NSSAI is available) to the UE. The UE can use the Conditional S-NSSAI if timing condition is fulfilled.\nSolution 21 uses the validity criteria of URSP to indicate when some connections of a slice are no longer available. The UE to re-evaluate these conditions based on existing mechanism.\nSolution 24 proposes to associate a \"timing information\" allowing per S-NSSAI and per any associated limited time TAs to indicate a start and end time and also a periodicity. It is then proposed that the slices that are associated with time info are released from allowed NSSAI with their PDU sessions at the indicated time silently (i.e. without additional signalling needed) in the system and the UE as applicable (in roaming case only the UE and the used SMF/UPF in HPLMN are impacted if the slices are not actually terminated in the VPLMN network). in addition, this also triggers PDU session level indication of timing, so the sessions are silently released in SMF/UPF without signalling.\nSolutions related to the support of how to gracefully terminate sessions:\nSolution 8 provides a mechanism to trigger AMF (either via OAM to UDM and then to AMF or via OAM to AMF directly) to terminate PDU Sessions associated with the S-NSSAI subject to be terminate. An order of termination of PDU sessions and specific timing to terminate PDU Sessions are subject to operator’s policy.\nSolution 11 proposes new temporary slices to be supported conditionally based on timing conditions. The AMF provides Conditional S-NSSAI (i.e. S-NSSAI with timing info the S-NSSAI is available) to the UE. The UE can use the Conditional S-NSSAI if timing condition is fulfilled.\nSolution 22 is similar to solution 21 but applies to graceful termination. Slice termination time is provided to the UE via validity criteria of URSP. The UE re-evaluate these conditions based on re-evaluation indication provided with the URSP.\n",

The central NSACF is able to determine the Number of registrations per service area through configuration of the different service areas in the central NSACF. This enables the central NSACF to distinguish new UE registrations vs UE registrations related to a UE already admitted in another service area. Optionally the information about service area is passed as additional attributes to the NSACF together with the PLMN where the UE is registering.\nFor solution #13, the two-tier NSACF architecture enables counting and admission at the NSACF or Primary NSACF.\nUE registration/ PDU Session establishment handling\nFor solution #12 NSAC handling is always at the central NSACF regardless of which service area UE is attached to.\nFor solution #13 NSAC handling can be at the local NSACF associated with a service area where UE is attached to.\nUE Mobility\nFor solution #12 as the NSAC is always handled at the central NSACF there is no UE mobility issue.\nFor solution #13, two-layer NSACF supports UE mobility. In particular, for the PDU session handling in case of UE mobility, there is no additional request to or check since the PDU session is anchored at the same SMF as before hence no need to interact with NSACF. For the UE counting handling in case of UE mobility, the NSACF associated with a new service area performs the admission together with the primary NSACF to update UE’s status if needed. Session continuity is supported.\nFor the interaction between NSACF and Primary NSACF, there are two options on how to handle NSAC if the NSACF cannot admit the new UE registration request by itself:\n1.\tOption 1: Quota based control. The Primary NSACF updates the quota at the NSACF.\n2.\tOption 2: Threshold based control. Threshold is used to control how much percentage of local quota can be used for admission of UEs for initial registration at the NSACF. The primary NSACF can adjust the threshold setting at the NSACF.\nIt is proposed to include support for both options and operator can configure which option to use.\n-\tSolution #14 addresses KI#4 in a proprietary manner. The solution assumes the node handling the quota distribution will be able to distribute quota in a way to ensure that there is never an issue during mobility between multiple services areas. This proprietary solution is similar to what currently exists in Release 17 and for which specific key issue is created to resolve in a more predictable and standardized manner.\n",

                    "text_content": "There are 9 solutions proposed for the KI#6.\n1.\tSolution #32 (The applicable part for KI#6):\n-\tNetwork to deregister network slices for UEs or deregistering the UEs that have PDU sessions that are not active.\n-\tNetwork to deregister slices for UEs or deregister the UEs that are registering in network slices without establishing any PDUs.\n-\tEnabling network controlled transfer of PDU session from one network slice to another network slice.\nComment: In top two cases it is proposed that UE's slice need to be removed from the allowed list once slice inactivity is detected and the 3rd case enables network controlled transfer of PDU session from one network slice to another network slice addressing the \"what\" and \"how\" of the following KI#6 objective: \"what the network can request from the UE and how\".\n2.\tSolution #33:\n-\tUE indicates its implicit slice registration deactivation capability during registration and timer is set by network. UE and AMF start the slice-specific implicit registration deactivation timer when there are no PDU sessions with active user plane resources on the slice that is associated with the implicit timer. On the expiry of the timer both UE and AMF will remove the slice implicitly.\n-\tUE indicates its implicit PDU deactivation capability during registration and timer is set by network UE and SMF start the slice-specific implicit PDU session deactivation timer when the user plane connection is deactivated for the PDU session. On the expiry of the timer both UE and SMF will release the PDU session implicitly.\nComment: Both UE and AMF can remove the slice from allowed list when inactivity is detected in case of no PDU session. But for PDU session with no data transfer only releasing PDU session is not sufficient. UE can remove the slice from allowed list here as well but SMF need to indicate AMF so that AMF will remove the slice as suggested in solution 37.\n3.\tSolution #34: on-demand S-NSSAI.\n-\tWhen the Serving PLMN configures the UE with Configured NSSAIs, the Serving PLMN may include an additional indication whether each S-NSSAI in the list of Configured NSSAI is an on-demand S-NSSAI. The UE, upon receiving the list of Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, will not attempt to register for any of the Configured NSSAI that are indicated as on-demand S-NSSAI. Rather, when the UE evaluates URSP rules and an on-demand S-NSSAI appears in the Route Selection Descriptor of a URSP rule, the UE will attempt to register the on-demand S-NSSAI with the AMF.\nComment: Only guiding the UE about when to register a particular slice won't help completely because the same PDU can be inactive. Hence to release the inactive session belong to on-demand slice also need implicit/explicit deactivation mechanism. Another comment is the network can not verify whether the slice registration request sent by the UE is really on demand.\n4.\tSolution #35: propose for the network to deregister the UE from the network slice if the network slice is not utilised for the duration of the slice usage control timer (e.g. no PDU Session on the network slice by the UE).\n-\tThis timer is started at NSACF defined by the operator policy and updates AMF when to deregister the slice.\nComment: This solution may not work completely as the same NSACF may not support both the UE count and PDU count. Also NSACF will not be able to identify the case when PDU session becomes inactive (no data transfer) and it will still treat as PDU established, hence will never indicate to release the slice. Also all the slices may not be subject to NSAC.\n5. Solution #36 provides assistance information (e.g. like the kind of registration) for each slice which means whether this slice will be used immediately (immediate registration) or after some duration (proactive registration) or because of default application.\n-\tThe network may reject a S-NSSAIs due to 'proactive registration'. In such case, the UE will only request registration to this S-NSSAI when there is application traffic which needs this S-NSSAI, i.e. URSP rules evaluation process is modified: if an application request data connectivity and the matching URSP rule includes an S-NSSAI which is not in the Allowed NSSAI (but also not rejected due unavailability in the PLMN, RA, or NSAC), the UE can first sends a request to register with the S-NSSAI before processing further RSDs or before the UE concludes that the RSD is invalid. Once the UE is registered with a slice (e.g. due to immediate use), the release of slice and PDU session may be done as suggested in other solutions.\nComment: This solution applies to scenarios where the network dynamically determines (e.g. based on current load or current number of slices/PDU Session close to the threshold when S-NSSAI is subject to NSAC) whether to apply network controlled UE behaviour for the registration to a particular S-NSSAI. This solution avoids the applicability of implicit/explicit deactivation solution when the UE requests e.g. proactive registration, especially when NSSAA or NSAC applies to an S-NSSAI and the inclusion of that S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI would cause additional signalling.\nIn scenarios where the network is statically configured that an S-NSSAI is to be used \"on-demand\", then solution #34 and solution #38 may be more efficient in term of avoiding the UE to request registration to S-NSSAI(s) for 'proactive registration'.\nAnother comment is the information sent from the UE may not be trustable so the decision made based on this information may not accurate. \"immediate registration\" may get higher possibility to be accepted by the network so the UE may always set \"immediate registration\" and the network cannot verify it is real situation.\n6.\tSolution #37: This solution proposes to deregister the slice once slice inactive is detected by AMF (no PDU session is for certain duration).\n-\tSimilarly to release the PDU session once slice inactive is detected by SMF (PDU inactive case) and then inform AMF so that same slice can be removed as well. This is network based approach where timer is running at AMF & SMF.\n-\tAnother approach is provided where timer may be only running at UE and it will indicate to network to remove the slice and release the PDU session once inactivity is detected at UE end. The UE PDU session status and Allowed NSSAI will be always synchronized with network later.\nComment: Solution #37 which is an extension of CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing PDU Session as specified in clause 4.3.7 of TS 23.502 [5] has a unique feature of getting appropriate timers from an AF. With this, the 5GC can learn what a reasonable inactivity time of a given UE type or a UE group using a specific S-NSSAI. By doing this way abrupt releasing or deregistration can be minimized. Solution #37 also supports passing the control of having to deal with a UE inactivity on to a UE which has a required support (e.g., UE behaviour control policies). This way it relieves a serving AMF or SMF load. Further, network can still monitor the UE slice usage if needed, e.g. for malformed UE.\n7.\tSolution #38:\n1.\tWhether to register with all the Slices in the Configured NSSAI for the PLMN or whether to register when a PDU session needs to be established in the network slices or whether to register with a list/subset of slices from configured-NSSAI irrespective of whether a PDU session is to be established or not.\n2.\tWhether to establish all the PDU sessions configured in the RSDs or to establish them based on the need to use these by applications or whether to establish PDU sessions to specific set of DNNs irrespective of whether an application needs it or not.\n3.\tTime to release a PDU session after no application is detected in the UE to need to use the PDU session This time, for example, can be immediately after use is over, or the PDU session can remain Idle up to a maximum time.\n4.\tTime to deregister from a network slice since the last PDU session is released which was using the network slice.\n5.\tPolicy can be configured by HPLMN and VPLMN authorized by HPLMN.\nComment: UE support is needed for this solution to work. This solution is not requiring an implicit deactivation timer based on traffic monitoring as the UE releases the session when no Application is detected to need a PDU sessions. how this is detected can be left to implementation of the UE (e.g. no application has a socked on the IP address of a PDU session or a logical association with the PDU sessions. the Modem layer is expected to be able to receive such indications from the OS layer). the release is explicit (i.e. with signalling). the advantage of this approach is that some applications may not be active for a long time if they are just expecting notifications. with an explicit timer approach the PDU session may be releases needlessly and with that the related slice if this was the last PDU session on the slice.\n8.\tSolution #39 It proposes to steer the UE to another preferred slice by PCF updating the URSP rules once the originally intended slice is reaching quota limit. Based on the operator policy, the URSP will be updated only for the list of UEs configured at PCF.\nComment: This solution works only for slices which are subject to NSAC.\n9.\tSolution #40 It extends the PDU session inactivity mechanism in 5GS to PDN connection in EPS.\n-\tThis solution works for both implicit deactivation/explicit deactivation based solution.\nComment: This is not a standalone solution and complement any supported solution (be it implicit deactivation or explicit deactivation or both).\nThere are broadly two categories of solutions which addresses the KI#6 of proper utilization of network slices by UE.\nIn the first category, the usage of slices by UEs are considered and then based on whether slices are in use or not deactivation is triggered.\n1.\tUE impacting with UE configuration: In this case the UE indicates its capability of handling the configuration information or implicit deactivation to network and then network updates the corresponding  configuration information or implicit timers to UE. the UE configuration runs at UE only and causes sessions to be released and slices to be deregistered explicitly based on the configuration information. the configuration information may also indicate which slices are to be kept registered at all times and which can be activated based on need/demand. The implicit registration slice deactivation timer runs at both UE & AMF and after the expiry of the timer both will remove the slice from the allowed list (no PDU session is established during this time period). Similarly implicit PDU session deactivation timer runs at both UE & SMF/SMF+PGW-C and after the expiry of the timer (PDU session is inactive) both will release the PDU session/PDN connections.\n2.\tNetwork based on slice deactivation and explicit PDU session deactivation: In this case the UE does not need any new capabilities. The explicit registration slice deactivation timer runs at AMF and after the expiry of the timer it will remove the slice from the allowed list (no PDU session is established during this time period). Similarly explicit PDU session deactivation timer runs at both UE & SMF/SMF+PGW-C and after the expiry of the timer (PDU session is inactive) it will release the PDU session/PDN connections.\n3.\tTimer setting, the timer is used to monitor the PDU session/Allowed NSSAI usage as per point 2. To avoid abrupt PDU Session release or slice deregistration (i.e., removing an S-NSSAI form Allowed-NSSAI), the timer is set by the AF and stored at the UDM.\nIn the second category, network will configure policy for some slices which will indicate whether the slice need to be registered and present all the time irrespective of the any corresponding PDU session is there or not. The following sub-categories may apply:\n1.\tStatic configuration per some slices: the network may indicate to the UE whether to register whenever the UE wants or only when it wants make one PDU session using that slice. This indication can be provided by the network either in the configured NSSAI or in URSP.\n2.\tDynamic configuration per network slice: the network may determine based on current conditions whether to apply network controlled UE behaviour for the registration to a particular S-NSSAI. The UE indicates the type of registration to an S-NSSAI (e.g. immediate use, proactive or default). The network can reject network slices for 'proactive registration' and the UE will initiate registration to such slices only when there is matching application traffic.\nSolutions to address the aspect of KI#6 to enable network-controlled behaviour for the scenario where there is an existing PDU session, can be categorized as AMF initiated and PCF initiated mechanisms. In both approaches the network controls the transfer of PDU session from one network slice to another network slice and the difference is in the core network NF that triggers the transfer.\n",

                    "text_content": "For operators implementing a single centralized solution, solution 12 is proposed. The central NSACF reuses the Release 17 NSACF extended with optional attributes for the AMF to convey the Service Area and PLMN during the Update operation. The Release 17 NRF discovery procedure is to be extended to allow the central NSACF to register multiple Service Areas to be supported by central NSACF\nFor operators implementing hierarchical NSACF architecture as defined in solution13, there are two types of NSACF, i.e. the Primary NSACF and NSACF. An NSCAF can be configured to support quota-based control (option 1), or UE admission threshold based control (options 2) as described below\n-\tOption 1: UE admission quota based control, admission of any UE is accepted up to the local maximum number.\n-\tOption 2: UE admission threshold based control, admission of new UEs registering in for the first is accepted only below UE admission threshold.\nThe following applies to both options:\n-\tThe Primary NSACF handles overall NSAC for an S-NSSAI at the global level (i.e. it is ultimately responsible for the NSAC for an S-NSSAI).\n-\tThe Primary NSACF registers its NF profile to the NRF with the service area information as the global service Area. A consumer NF may utilise the NRF to discover the central NSACF by using the serving area information set to \"global\", and additional home PLMN ID information in roaming case.\n-\tTo enable Primary NSACF to update the local maximum number and established PDU session for NSCAFs configured with option (1), NSACFs subscribes to Primary NSCAF for that purpose. The primary NSACFs updates the NSACFs with the needed information via an explicit NOTIFY or in responses to requests initiated from the NSACF.\n-\tTo enable Primary NSACF to update the new UE admission threshold for NSCAFs configured with option (2), NSACFs subscribes to Primary NSCAF for that purpose. The primary NSACFs updates the NSACFs with the needed information via an explicit NOTIFY or in responses to requests initiated from the NSACF.\n-\tThe Primary NSACF subscribes from the NACFs that it is in contact with to obtain the number of registered UEs or established PDU sessions admitted at the NSACF.\nNSAC for the maximum number of UEs\nFor NSACF supporting option 1, if the local maximum number has been reached, or the UE entry is managed by the Primary NSACF, the NSACF interacts with the Primary NSACF for the delegation of NSAC request for a UE.\nFor NSACF supporting option 2, if UE admission is at or above the threshold level stored at the NSACF, NSACF immediately rejects UEs registering in for the first time. If the local maximum number has been reached but the registering UE already admitted in a previous service area, or the UE entry is managed by the Primary NSACF, the NSACF interacts with the Primary NSACF for the delegation of NSAC request for a UE.\nThe Primary NSACF supports the following capabilities depending on the NSACF configuration it interacts with:\n-\tReturning a new updated local maximum number for the NSACF if the NSACF is configured to support that feature. Or\n-\tReturning a new updated UE admission threshold if the NSACF is configured to support that feature.\nThe Primary NSACF handles and stores entries only related to UEs that are already admitted in an existing service area but cannot be admitted in the new service area due to no remaining local maximum number.\nNSAC for the maximum number of PDU session\nThe NSACF interacts with the Primary NSACF when the local maximum number is exceeded.\nThe Primary NSACF supports the following capabilities:\n-\tReturning a new updated local maximum number for the NSACF.\nTo enable Primary NSACF to update the local maximum number PDU session, NSACFs subscribes to Primary NSCAF for that purpose. At any time, in the response to a request from NSACF, or via a Notification, the Primary NSACF can update the local maximum number of PDU sessions per the current registered number of PDU session.\nSupport for NSAC with HPLMN while Roaming\nVPLMNs shall support NSAC with HPLMN if the SLA requires that. A VPLMN can be configured or can fetch the applicable NSAC admission mode from HPLMN (UDM).\nIf the NSAC admission mode is VPLMN, NSAC admission is determined by the VPLMN. Otherwise if the NSAC admission mode is HPLMN, NSAC admission is determined by the HPLMN.\nIn this case every AMF in this VPLMN performs NSAC admission for the number of registered UEs with the HPLMN central or primary NSACF for all related inbound roamers from that HPLMN when they register in this VPLMN. The AMF discovers the HPLMN primary or central NSACF or optionally be configured with the needed information.\nAdditionally, every SMF in this VPLMN performs NSAC admission for the number of LBO PDU sessions with the HPLMN central or primary NSACF for all related inbound roamers from that HPLMN when they initiate an LBO PDU session. The SMFs discovers the HPLMN primary or central NSACF or optionally be configured with the needed information.\nAs mentioned before, AMFs and SMFs identifies the NSAC mode at UE registration and PDU session establishment from the UDM AMF and SMF data respectively.\nSupport for HPLMN Delegated NSAC Mode while Roaming\nIn this HPLMN delegated NSAC mode, HPLMN delegates NSAC to the VPLMN, both for number of registered UEs and the number of LBO sessions.\nNSAC NFs, i.e. NSACF, performing admission in the VPLMN need to acquire from the HPLMN central or primary NSACF the applicable quota for the number of registered UEs and/or the number of LBO sessions before or triggered by the NSAC admission request. In order to acquire the maximum number of registered UEs, and maximum number of LBO PDU sessions for admission for inbound roamers for an HPLMN, every NSAC in this VPLMN subscribes to the VPLMN primary NSACF for this information. Subsequently, the VPLMN primary or central NSACF subscribes to the HPLMN central or primary NSACF for this information. If re-distribution of quota is required in the VPLMN amongst multiple NSACs than this is handled by the primary NSACF in VPLMN with no involvement from the HPLMN.\nIn this case every AMF in this VPLMN performs NSAC admission for the number of registered UEs with NSACF serving that service area in VPLMN for all related inbound roamers when they register in this VPLMN.\nAdditionally, every SMF in this VPLMN performs NSAC admission for the number of LBO PDU session with NSACF serving that service area in VPLMN for all related inbound roamers when they initiate an LBO PDU session.\nIf the NSAC admission mode is determined in the HPLMN, when the applicable quota to the VPLMN is exceeded, the primary or central NSACF in VPLMN interact with HPLMN Primary NSACF to determine whether the NSAC admission is accepted or rejected unless forbidden by the SLA. This applies the same principles as in the non-roaming case.\nAs mentioned before, AMFs and SMFs identifies the NSAC mode at UE registration and PDU session establishment from the UDM AMF and SMF data respectively. This information is passed subsequently to the NSACF during NSAC admission.\nSupport for NSAC in VPLMN while Roaming\nRelease 18 enables NSACs in the VPLMN, in this mode, where the VPLMN performs admission, by fetching from the HPLMN primary or central NSACF the maximum number of registered UEs as well as the maximum number of PDU sessions to enforce. However, in this case, the VPLMN rejects any additional requests when the applicable quota is consumed.\nNOTE:\tNSACs in VPLMN can also be preconfigured with the maximum number of registered UEs as well as the maximum number of PDU sessions to enforce with no fetching required.\n",
