                            "text_content": "The UAV USS authentication and authorization (UUAA) is the procedure to ensure that the UAV can be authenticated and authorized by a USS before the connectivity for UAS services is enabled. This clause specifies the relationship between primary authentication (as described in clause 6.1 in TS 33.501 [2]) and UUAA. An UAV is allowed to perform UUAA with the USS/UTM only after the UAV (UE) has completed successfully primary authentication.\nIt may be triggered by the AMF when UAV is registering with 5GS or triggered by the SMF during the PDU session establishment procedure. The UUAA procedure may also be triggered by a USS for re-authentication if the USS had authenticated the UAV. Network support for UUAA during registration is optional while it is mandatory during the PDU Session establishment. UE Support for UUAA during registration and during the PDU Session establishment is mandatory.\nThe AMF or SMF triggers the UUAA procedure if the UAV has an Aerial UE subscription and the UAV requests access to UAS services by providing the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV in the Registration Request or PDU Session Establishment Request.\nThe UUAA is performed between the UAV and the USS. The UAV is authenticated based on the CAA-Level UAV ID and credentials associated to the CAA-Level UAV ID. The authentication messages are included in a transparent container and conveyed between the UAV and the USS via a 3GPP UAS NF.\nNOTE:\tThe provision of CAA-Level UAV ID, credentials, and the actual authentication methods and information that needs to be sent to perform the UUAA are out of scope of the 3GPP specifications.\nOn successful completion of a UUAA, the USS can send UAS security information in the UUAA Authorization Payload to the UAV. The contents of that security information are out of scope of the 3GPP specifications.\nThe UUAA procedure at registration in 5G is described in the clause 5.2.1.2 and the UUAA procedure during PDU session establishment procedure is described in the clause 5.2.1.3.\nAt any time after the initial registration, the USS or the AMF (when the networking supports UUAA during registration) may initiate the Re-authentication procedure for the UAV. The AMF initiated Re-authentication procedure is described in the clause 5.2.1.2, whereas the USS initiated Re-authentication procedure is described in the clause 5.1.2.4.\nFigure 5.2.1.1-1 provides an example of how UUAA fits into the 5GS procedures. The complete description of this flow is given in TS 23.256 [3].\nThe figure depicts a 5G signal path, illustrating the multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network. It highlights the role of base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers in signal reflection and combination. Beamforming techniques are employed to mitigate interference, and the layered architecture aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 5.2.1.1-1: UUAA in 5GS\n1.\tThe UE sends a Registration Request message to the AMF. The UE may provide a CAA-Level UAV ID, and optionally a USS address/IP address, to indicate the request is registering for UAS services. In case the CAA-Level UAV ID and/or USS address/IP address is configured not to be sent in plain text, e.g., the USS address or an IP address not to be exposed in public, the CAA-Level UAV ID, and USS/IP address if available, shall be sent after the NAS security is established.\n2.\tAMF completes security set up including primary authentication as needed.\n3.\tAfter successful Primary authentication, AMF determines whether UUAA is required for the UE. UUAA shall only be triggered if the UE has provided a CAA-Level UAV ID and has a valid Aerial UE subscription. AMF may skip UUAA if the UE has completed UUAA successfully before and the UE UUAA is current, i.e., the UE's authentication and authorization has not been revoked after a previous successful UUAA.\n4a. AMF shall return a Registration Accept message to the UE and indicate that UUAA is pending.\n4b.\tUE may send a Registration Complete message to acknowledge the AMF.\n5. AMF triggers the UUAA procedure if determined needed in step 3 as described in clause 5.2.1.2.\nThe following procedure is for UUAA during PDU session establishment:\n6. The UE sends a PDU Session Establishment Request message to the SMF including a CAA-Level UAV ID to indicate the request is for UAS services. If a successful UUAA has been performed at Registration, there is no need for the USS to perform UUAA at PDU Session establishment. When a UE sends PDU Session Establishment Request message with DNN/S-NSSAI related to UAS service, if the AMF has successful UUAA result available for the UE, the AMF shall send the successful UUAA result indication along with the PDU Session Establishment Request message to the SMF.\n7. The SMF determines whether UUAA is required for the UE. UUAA shall only be triggered if the UE has provided a CAA-Level UAV ID and has a valid Aerial UE subscription. SMF may skip UUAA, if it receives successful UUAA result from the AMF or the UE has completed UUAA successfully with the same USS/DN before, i.e., at registration as in step 5 or in previous PDU Session Establishment procedures.\n8. The SMF triggers the UUAA procedure if determined needed at step 7 as described in clause 5.2.1.3.\nThe UUAA procedure at registration is triggered by an AMF with the details described below, which considers only the security related parameters (see TS 23.256 [3] for full details of the flows). For an AMF initiated re-authentication, the procedure starts from the step 2.\nThe figure depicts the UUAA procedure at registration, which is a crucial step in the network's operation. It illustrates the steps taken by the network to authenticate and authorize users, ensuring a secure and efficient communication environment.\nFigure 5.2.1.2-1: UUAA Procedure at Registration\n1. The AMF triggers the UUAA procedure as described in clause 5.2.1.1.\n2. The AMF sends a message Nnef_Auth_Req to the UAS NF, including the GPSI and the CAA-Level UAV ID, and the Aviation Payload if provided by the UE for USS to authenticate the UAV. The AMF may include other information in the request as in TS 23.256 [3].\n3. The UAS NF resolves the USS address based on CAA-Level UAV ID or uses the provided USS address. Only authorized USS shall be used in order to ensure only legitimate entities can provide authorization for UAVs. The UAS NF sends an Authentication Request to the USS. The Authentication Request shall include the GPSI, the CAA-Level UAV ID, a UAS NF Routing information (e.g., an FQDN or IP address) which uniquely identifies the UAS NF located in the 3GPP network that handles the UAV related messages exchanges with the corresponding external USS/UTM and the transparent container. Other information may also be included in this message as in TS 23.256 [3].\n4. The USS and the UE exchange Authentication messages:\nNOTE 1:\tMultiple round-trip messages (4a to 4f) may be needed as required by the authentication method used by the USS. The method used to authenticate the UE (e.g. whether over EAP or not) and the content of Authentication Messages (e.g. EAP packets) to support that method are out of scope of 3GPP. The USS determines the authentication method used.\n4a. The USS replies to UAS NF with the Authentication Response message. It shall include the GPSI and a transparent container composed of an authentication message.\n4b. The UAS NF sends the transparent container received in 4a to the AMF with the GPSI.\n4c. The AMF forwards the transparent container to the UE over NAS MM transport messages.\n4d. The UE responds to the AMF with an Authentication message embedded in a transparent container over a NAS MM transport message.\n4e. The AMF sends a message Nnef_Auth_Req to the UAS NF, including the GPSI and the CAA-Level UAV ID, and the transparent container provided by the UE.\n4f. The UAS NF sends an Authentication Request to the USS. The Authentication Request shall include the GPSI, the CAA-Level UAV ID and the transparent container.\n5. The USS sends the UAS NF an Authentication Response message. The Authentication Response shall include the GPSI, the UUAA result (success/failure), the authorized CAA-level UAV ID, and a UUAA Authorization Payload that contains UAS security information if the USS has such information to send.\nNOTE 2:\tThe content of security information (e.g. key material to help establish security between UAV and USS/UTM) is not in 3GPP scope.\nThe UAS NF stores the GPSI, USS Identifier (and the binding with the GPSI) and the CAA-level UAV ID (and the binding with the GPSI).\nNOTE 3:\tThe USS Identifier is used to ensure that a USS requesting a subsequent re-authentication or revocation is the same one that authenticated the UAV in the first place. The USS identifier is based on the security link on the interface between UAS NF and USS (e.g. the identity mapped during link establishment or the identity in certificate, prior to the UUAA procedures).\n6. The UAS NF sends the AMF an Authentication Response message, including the GPSI, the UUAA result (success/failure), the authorized CAA-level UAV ID, and the UUAA Authorization Payload received in step 5.\n7. The AMF sends to the UE the UUAA result (success/failure) received in step 6. The message(s) used in step 7 are given in TS 23.256 [3].\nThe AMF stores the results, together with the GPSI and the CAA-level UAV ID.\n8. If UUAA result is success, the AMF sends to the UE the UUAA Authorization Payload, received in step 6, during a UCU procedure as described in TS 23.256 [3]. The UE shall store the authorization information if received such as UAS Security information along with the CAA-level UAV ID.\nThe SMF may trigger a UUAA procedure during the PDU session establishment procedure with details described below, which considers only the security related (see TS 23.256 [3] for full details of the flows).\n\nFigure 5.2.1.3-1: UUAA Procedure at PDU Session Establishment\n1. The SMF determines whether UUAA is required as described in the clause 5.2.1.1 and if the UUAA result is not received from the AMF, if the UE provides a CAA-Level UAV ID indicating UAS services and optionally the Aviation Payload if provided by the UE for USS to authenticate the UAV in the PDU Session Establishment request. The SMF triggers a UUAA procedure after the determination in step 7 in the clause 5.2.1.1.\n2. The SMF sends a message Nnef_Auth_Req to the UAS NF, including the GPSI and the CAA-Level UAV ID, and the transparent container if provided by the UE. The SMF may include other information in the request as in TS 23.256 [3].\n3. The UAS NF resolves the USS address based on CAA-Level UAV ID or uses the provided USS address. Only authorized USS shall be used in order to ensure only legitimate entities can provide authorization for UAVs. The UAS NF sends an Authentication Request to the USS which includes the GPSI, the CAA-Level UAV ID, the UAS NF Routing information (e.g., a FQDN or IP address) which uniquely identifies the NF located in the 3GPP network that handles the UAV related messages exchanges with the corresponding external USS/UTM, and the transparent container. Other information may also be included in this message (see TS 23.256 [3]).\n4. The USS and the UE exchange multiple Authentication messages:\nNOTE 1:\tMultiple round-trip messages (4a to 4f) may be needed as required by the authentication method used by the USS. The method used to authenticate the UE (e.g. whether over EAP or not) and the content of Authentication Messages (e.g. EAP packets) to support that method are out of scope of 3GPP. The USS determines the authentication method used.\n4a. The USS replies to UAS NF with the Authentication Response message. It shall include the GPSI, a transparent container composed of an authentication message.\n4b. The UAS NF sends the transparent container to the SMF.\n4c. The SMF forwards the transparent container to the AMF, which then forwards to the UE over a NAS MM transport message.\n4d. The UE responses the AMF with an Authentication message embedded in a transparent container over a NAS MM transport message. The AMF forwards to the SMF.\n4e. The SMF sends a message Nnef_Auth_Req to the UAS NF, including the GPSI and the CAA-Level UAV ID, and the transparent container provided by the UE.\n4f. The UAS NF sends an Authentication Request to the USS. The Authentication Request shall include the GPSI, the CAA-Level UAV ID and the transparent container.\nNOTE 2:\tMultiple round-trip messages (4a to 4f) may be needed as required by the authentication method used by USS. The method used to authenticate the UE and the content of Authentication Messages are out of scope of 3GPP.\n5. The USS sends the UAS NF an Authentication Response message. The Authentication Response shall include the GPSI, the UUAA result (success/failure), the authorized CAA-level UAV ID, and a UUAA Authorization Payload that contains UAS security information if the USS has such information to send to the UAV.\nNOTE 3:\tThe content of security information (e.g., key material to help establish security between UAV and USS/UTM) is not in 3GPP scope.\nIf UUAA successful, the UAS NF stores the UAV UEs' UUAA context, including the GPSI, USS Identifier (and the binding with the GPSI) and the CAA-level UAV ID (and the binding with the GPSI).\nNOTE 4: The USS Identifier is used to ensure that a USS requesting a subsequent re-authentication or revocation is the same one that authenticated the UAV in the first place. The USS identifier is based on the security link on the interface betweenUAS  NF and USS (e.g. the identity mapped during link establishment or the identity in certificate, prior to the UUAA procedures).\n6. The UAS NF sends the SMF an Authentication Response message, including the GPSI, the UUAA result (success/failure), the authorized CAA-level UAV ID, and the UUAA Authorization Payload received in step 5.\nThe SMF stores the results, together with the GPSI and the CAA-level UAV ID.\n7. The SMF sends the UUAA result (success/failure), and the UUAA Authorization Payload received in step 5 to the UE. The message(s) used in step 7 and any further actions the UE and SMF take are given in TS 23.256 [3].\n8. The UE on receiving the UUAA result as success, shall store the authorization information if received such as, CAA-level UAV ID, and UAS Security information.\nAs described in clause 5.2.1.1, the USS or the AMF (if support UUAA during registration) may initiate the Re-authentication procedure for the UAV at any time.\nThis clause describes the USS initiated Re-authentication procedure (the AMF initiated Re-authentication procedure is described in the clause 5.2.1.2). The below description considers only the security related parameters (for full details of the flows see TS 23.256 [3]).\nThe figure depicts a re-authentication process in a 5G network, specifically focusing on the use of UUAA (Universal User Access Architecture) for network authentication. The figure illustrates the steps involved in re-authenticating a user, including the use of a central authentication server (CAS) and the subsequent authentication process. The figure also highlights the importance of network security and the role of CAS in ensuring user authentication.\nFigure 5.2.1.4-1: UUAA re-authentication in 5GS\n1. The USS sends a re-authentication request for the UAV to UAS-NF that includes GPSI, CAA-Level UAV ID, and an authentication message. It may contain the PDU Session IP address if available. The USS shall use the UAS NF Routing information received during the previous successful UUAA related to GPSI for sending the re-authentication request.\n2. The UAS NF retrieves the UAV UE's context. The UE's context contains identity mapping between the GPSI and the USS identifier that performed UAA. The UAS-NF verifies the USS re-authentication request by checking whether the GPSI and the USS identifier match of the USS requesting the re-authentication the stored mapping of GPSI and USS identifier. The UAS-NF shall only continue the re-authentication procedures if match.\nNOTE 1:\tThe USS identifier is based on the security link on the interface between UAS NF and USS (e.g. the identity mapped during link establishment or the identity in certificate).\nThe UAS NF determines whether the target NF is an AMF or an SMF.\n-\tIf the target NF is an AMF, the UAS NF further determines the target AMF for re-authentication and continues step 3a.\n-\tIf the target NF is an SMF, the UAS NF further determines the target SMF for re-authentication and continues step 3b.\n3a or 3b. The UAS NF sends to either the target AMF or the target SMF the UAA re-authentication request for the UE identified by the GPSI and for the SMF only the PDU Session IP address if available.\n4. The UAS NF responses the USS that the UAA Re-authentication has been initiated.\n5a.

If the target NF is an SMF, the SMF initiates re-authentication of the UAV as UUAA described in the clause 5.2.1.3 (step 2 to step 7).\nUSS may trigger revocation of UUAA at any time. The below description considers only the security related parameters (for full details of the flows see TS 23.256 [3]).\nThe figure depicts a UUAA revocation in a 5G network, illustrating the process of revocation in the context of 5G. The figure shows the UUAA (Universal Unique Address Architecture) revocation process, which is a key component of 5G network security. The figure includes key elements such as the UUAA, the revocation process, and the revocation mechanism. The figure is a visual representation of the complex and technical aspects of 5G network security.\nFigure 5.2.1.5-1: UUAA revocation in 5GS\n1. The USS sends an UUAA revocation request to UAS-NF. The request includes GPSI and CAA-Level UAV ID.\n2. The UAS NF retrieves the UAV UE's context. The UE's context contains identity mapping between the GPSI and the USS identifier that performed UUAA. The UAS-NF verifies the USS revocation request by checking whether the GPSI and the USS identifier of the USS requesting the revocation match the stored mapping of GPSI and USS identifier.

The UAS NF sends to either the target NF, i.e., the target AMF or the target SMF the UUAA revocation message for the UE identified by the GPSI and the PDU session identified by the GPSI and the IP address. The target NF (i.e., the target AMF or the target SMF) shall respond to the UAS NF to indicate the revocation has been successful.\n3c. The UAS NF responds back to the USS indicating that authorization revocation request has been successfully initiated as in TS 23.256 [3] and the UAS NF shall delete the UUAA context.\n4. The target NF i.e., either the target AMF or the target SMF on receiving UUAA revocation notification message, determines to send UUAA revocation indication to the UE. The target NF (either an AMF or an SMF) informs the UE that UUAA is revoked and takes actions as described in TS 23.256 [3] with the following adaptations.\n4a. If the target NF is AMF, the AMF shall send UUAA revocation indication in the UCU procedure as described in TS 23.256 [3] Clause 5.2.7 and the AMF shall delete the UUAA context being revoked.\n4b. If the target NF is SMF, the SMF shall send UUAA revocation indication in a network initiated PDU session release process as described in TS 23. 256 [3], clause 5.2.7 and the SMF shall delete the UUAA context being revoked.\n5. The UE on receiving UAA revocation indication shall delete all UUAA related authorization data corresponding to the CAA-Level-UAV ID and the UE sends an UUAA revocation acknowledgement to the target NF which provided the UUAA revocation indication.\n",

This clause specifies the relationship between authentication and UUAA. An UAV is allowed to perform UUAA with the USS/UTM only after the UAV (UE) has completed successfully authentication with EPC. The SMF+PGW-C triggers the UUAA procedure if the UAV has an Aerial UE subscription and the UAV requests access to UAS services by providing the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV when attaching to the network.\nThe UUAA is performed between the UAV and the USS. The UAV is authenticated based on the CAA-Level UAV ID and credentials associated to the CAA-Level UAV ID. The authentication messages are included in a transparent container and conveyed between the UAV and the USS via a 3GPP UAS NF.\nNOTE:\tThe provision of CAA-Level UAV ID, credentials, and the actual authentication methods and information that needs to be sent to perform the UUAA are out of scope of the 3GPP specifications.\nOn successful completion of a UUAA, the USS sends UAS security information (if determined by the USS) in the UUAA Authorization Payload to the UAV. The contents of that security information are out of scope of the 3GPP specifications.\nThe UUAA procedure is described in the clause 5.2.2.2.\nThe UUAA procedure is triggered by an SMF+PGW-C with the details described below, which considers only the security related parameters (see TS 23.256 [3] for full details of the flows).\nThe figure depicts a UUAA procedure, which is a method used in network management to ensure the proper functioning of a network.

Other information may also be included in this message as in TS 23.256 [3].\n4. The USS and the UE exchange Authentication messages:\nNOTE 1:\tMultiple round-trip messages (4a to 4f) may be needed as required by the authentication method used by the USS. The method used to authenticate the UE (e.g. whether over EAP or not) and the content of Authentication Messages (e.g. EAP packets) to support that method are out of scope of 3GPP. The USS determines the authentication method used.\n4a. The USS replies to UAS NF with the Authentication Response message.
