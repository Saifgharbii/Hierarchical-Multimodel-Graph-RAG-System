It illustrates the structure view of the BAP layer, highlighting its components such as the BAP, BAP-A, and BAP-B.

This figure is essential for understanding the network's architecture and its components, which are crucial for the efficient and reliable operation of 5G networks.\nFigure 4.2.1-1: BAP layer, structure view\nThe BAP sublayer is configured by upper layers TS 38.331 [3] and TS 38.473 [5].\n",

                            "text_content": "On the IAB-node, the BAP sublayer contains one BAP entity at the MT function and a separate collocated BAP entity at the DU function. A mobile IAB-node may have two logical DU functions, as defined in TS 38.401 [6], which are supported by one common BAP entity at the MT function. The RAN node operating as a mobile IAB-node has no BAP entity at the DU function. On the IAB-donor-DU, the BAP sublayer contains only one BAP entity. Each BAP entity has a transmitting part and a receiving part.\nNOTE: The modelling of BAP entities does not restrict internal implementation of IAB-nodes, i.e. the exact modelling of BAP sublayer may vary for different IAB-node implementations.\nThe transmitting part of the BAP entity has a corresponding receiving part of a BAP entity at the IAB-node or IAB-donor-DU across the BH link.\nFigure 4.2.2-1 shows one example of the functional view of the BAP sublayer. This functional view should not restrict implementation. The figure is based on the radio interface protocol architecture defined in TS 38.300 [2].\nIn the example of Figure 4.2.2-1, the receiving part on the BAP entity delivers BAP PDUs to the transmitting part on the collocated BAP entity. Alternatively, the receiving part may deliver BAP SDUs to the collocated transmitting part. When passing BAP SDUs, the receiving part removes the BAP header and the transmitting part adds the BAP header with the same BAP header content as carried on the BAP PDU header prior to removal. Passing BAP SDUs in this manner is therefore functionally equivalent to passing BAP PDUs, in implementation. The following specification therefore refers to the passing of BAP Data Packets.\nBesides, BAP entity generates, delivers/receives BAP Control PDU(s) as described in clause 6.1.2. BAP Control PDU can only be exchanged between peer BAP entities across the BH link.\nIn addition to the functions shown in Figure 4.2.2-1, the transmitting part of the BAP entity may perform BAP header rewriting operation, in accordance with clause 5.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a functional view of the BAP sublayer, illustrating its components and their interconnections. The BAP sublayer is a crucial component in 5G networks, responsible for managing the flow of data between the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE). The figure shows the various components, such as the BAP, BAP-A, and BAP-B, as well as the connections between them. The figure also includes a visual representation of the network topology, highlighting the importance of the BAP sublayer in ensuring efficient data transmission.\nFigure 4.2.2-1.
