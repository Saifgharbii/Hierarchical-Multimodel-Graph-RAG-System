Further study whether or not to have new solutions.\n-\tCA_n5-n28 (full range) with uplink configuration of CA_n5-n28.\nIn RAN 99 a new SI [5] was approved.  This SI concerns the consideration of the APT 600 MHz band  (n105) that has been recently has been introduced into 3GPP specifications [6]. After the completion of APT 600MHz band, operators have the further demands to combine this 600MHz band with other sub-1GHz bands together to achieve a good performance for the real deployment. However, some challenges were identified for a device with a smart phone form factor to support the combinations of those low bands including 600MHz band. For example, UE RF architecture need to be further studied due to larger antenna size for 600MHz band and some RF requirements need to be evaluated, e.g. MSD. The previous SI on Enhancement for 700/800/900MHz band combinations didn’t include the evaluation and studies for 600MHz band. Additionally band 26 is also considered.\nSummary of band combinations considered in the SI\n\nNOTE 1: The study of 3 band combination can only start after completion of 2 bands fallbacks\nNOTE 2: Check at RAN4#107 whether CA_n5A-n28A-n105A could be included in the SI based on study progress for the fall back combinations listed in the above table.\n\nThe following aspects need be studied\n-\tUE architecture including n-plexing, PA\n-\tStudy feasibility of low band wideband antenna\n-\tPerformance due to impacts including inter-modulation products\n-\tMethod to manage the inter-modulation product impacts\nNote: Revisit in RAN#98 whether additional aspects need to be added.\nPower class 3 (PC3) is considered in this study\n3\tIdentify potential impacts to relevant RAN4 requirements.\nThe present document is the technical report for this Study Item.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "The following UE RF architectures can be assumed in the future meetings’ analysis for CA_n5-n8: 2 antenna, 3 antenna. The antenna number is the total number of antennas to support Main UL/DL and diversity DL for all bands.\nDue to the frequency range overlap between n5 DL and n8 UL, one possibility to enable CA_n5-n8 operation with 2-antenna implementation is to allow non-simultaneous Rx/Tx between n5 DL and n8 UL or single UL in n5 only to avoid n5 REFSENS impact due to n8 UL transmission. With that the filter isolation between n5 DL and n8 UL would no longer be needed and a triplexer can be used to provide the semi-full-duplex carrier aggregation to a single antenna in the main path, as is shown in Figure 5.1.1-1. On the other hand, since the triplexer center band range is over 5% bandwidth ratio (band range divided by center frequency) and the frequency gap between center band and n8 DL is only 10 MHz which may pose design challenge on achieving acceptable filter isolation and insertion loss, the feasibility of a single triplexer for CA_n5-n8 needs to be studied.\n\n\nThe figure depicts a possible CA_n5-n8 UE architecture and operation diagram for semi-full-duplex CA, showcasing the various components and their interconnections.\nFigure 5.1.1-1 Possible CA_n5-n8 UE architecture and operation diagram for semi-full-duplex CA\nAnother architecture variant with 2-antenna implementation is to move n8 UL to the diversity path as is shown in Figure 5.1.1-2 which may potentially ease the triplexer design in the main TRx path owing to the narrower middle band range and wider frequency separation between n5 DL and n8 DL. The filter design challenge however would be shifted to the diversity TRx path duplexer due to the wider band range to cover n5 DL and n8 UL.\nThe figure depicts a possible CA_n5-n8 UE architecture based on a 2-antenna implementation, illustrating the different configurations and their corresponding signal paths.\nFigure 5.1.1-2 Possible CA_n5-n8 UE architecture based on 2-antenna implementation\nFor the 3-antenna implementation, the two of the three antenna are used in the main path to aggregate the n5 and n8 signals over the air, as shown in Figure 5.1.1-3. As n5 and n8 signals do not need to be combined through a multiplexer, there is no additional insertion loss in both n5 and n8 main signal paths as compared to single-band implementation.\nHaving two antenna in the main signal path not only avoids the more complicated multiplexer implementation and the associated additional insertion losses, but also allows narrower frequency coverage for each of the two antenna as compared to single-antenna implementation which can be up to 348 MHz (from n105 to n8) to support all the sub-1GHz bands above 600 MHz as defined in 3GPP. On the other hand, the additional antenna cannot be added without occupying more phone space. Therefore, the feasibility on placing more than two low-band antenna in a smartphone needs to be investigated with the concern of the expected narrower bandwidth and regressed radiating performance due to the limitation in form factor.\nThe figure depicts the architecture of a 5G network, specifically focusing on the UE (User Equipment) component. It illustrates the 3-antenna implementation of the CA (Cell Aggregation) system, which is crucial for enhancing the network's capacity and performance. The figure highlights the importance of antenna diversity and beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 5.1.1-3 CA_n5-n8 UE architecture based on the 3-antenna implementation\nDespite the 3-antenna implementation can help reduce n8 UL interfering n5 DL via antenna isolation which however is far from sufficient even under the restricted frequency ranges for CA operation where n8 UL does not overlap with n5 DL. Therefore, semi-full-duplex operation with non-simultaneous Rx/Tx between n5 DL and n8 UL as diagramed in Figure 5.1.1-1 is still required for the CA combination.\nIn consideration of the operation frequency ranges restriction for this specific band combination as is shown below,\n-\tn5r: UL 824 - 835 MHz; DL 869 - 880 MHz\n-\tn8r: UL 904 - 915 MHz; DL 949 - 960 MHz\n\nThe figure depicts a restricted spectrum range for the CA_n5-n8 frequency band, highlighting the specific frequency range within which the CA operates. The CA is a crucial component in 5G networks, responsible for managing the radio frequency spectrum. The figure provides a visual representation of the CA's operating range, allowing for better understanding of its role in the overall 5G network architecture.\nFigure 5.1.1-4 CA_n5-n8 restricted spectrum range\nDedicated filter implementation may be considered to potentially enable 2UL/2DL simultaneous operation. Due to the frequency range restriction on the dedicated filters, additional full-band duplexers for either or both n5 and n8 would be required in order to support the single-band full-band operation. Figure 5.1.1-5 and Figure 5.1.1-6 show the architecture diagrams with dedicated quadplexer in main TRx path based on 2-antenna implementation where the former uses both partial ranges for n5 and n8 in the quadplexer and the latter uses partial range only for n8 UL in the quadplexer.\n\n\nFigure 5.1.1-5 CA_n5-n8 architecture with dedicated quadplexer using partial ranges in both n5 and n8\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1.1-6 CA_n5-n8 architecture with dedicated quadplexer using partial range in n8 UL only\nFigure 5.1.1-7 and Figure 5.1.1-8 show the architecture diagrams with dedicated duplexers for both n5 and n8 and n8 UL only respectively in main TRx path based on 3-antenna implementation.\nDedicated filter based on specific frequency range restriction for operation bands usually is not a common practice in UE implementation as it adds additional cost and area to the devices.\n\nThe CA_n5-n8 architecture, depicted in Figure 5.1.1-7, utilizes dedicated duplexers with partial ranges in both n5 and n8 to enhance network performance and reliability. This architecture is designed to accommodate the varying distances between the core switches and the distributed nodes, ensuring efficient data transmission and minimizing the risk of network congestion.\nFigure 5.1.1-7 CA_n5-n8 architecture using dedicated duplexers with partial ranges in both n5 and n8\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1.1-8 CA_n5-n8 architecture using dedicated duplexers with partial range in n8 UL only\nThe CA_n5-n8 architecture, depicted in Figure 5.1.1-9, utilizes dedicated triplexers with partial range in n8 and n5 to enhance network performance. This architecture is designed to provide a reliable and efficient communication path for data transmission, while also ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure.\nFigure 5.1.1-9 CA_n5-n8 architecture using dedicated triplexers with partial range in n8 and n5\nIn the architecture of Figure 5.1.1-9, dedicated triplexers are used. In this architecture, UL’s are transmitted from different antennas, which may help in optimizing the TRP for each of the UL’s resulting in better coverage.\n",

Single UL in n5\n-\tOption 2: Support both 1UL/2DL and 2UL/2DL CA. Non-concurrent n5 DL and n8 UL\n2)\tDedicated RF filters implementation with partial frequency range\n-\tOption 3: Support both 1UL/2DL and 2UL/2DL CA. Dedicated filter to allow simultaneous n5 DL and n8 UL\nAccording to the updated WID for 700/800/900MHz band combinations in RAN#101, uplink is only in band n5 for CA_n5-n8. Thus, only Option 1 is specified in Rel-18 specification. However, if operator requests this 2UL/2DL CA_n5-n8 in futurte release, it should be further decided whether option 2, option 3 or both are specified.\nIf UE capabilities need to be updated or defined to distinguish different implementations, it’s encouraged to send LS to RAN2 for UE capabilities as soon as RAN4 has decided which options to specify.\nCA_n5-n8 MSD values:\nThe following test configuration and MSD from n5 UL to n8 DL are agreed in Table 5.1.3.4-1 and the requirements are already specified in Rel-18 specification.\nTable 5.1.3.4-1: CA_n5-n8 MSD value for 1U/2D n5UL/n8DL\n\nThe following test configuration and MSD from n8 UL to n5 DL are agreed in Table 5.1.3.4-2 and the requirements apply if the Option 3 is specifed.\n\nTable 5.1.3.4-2: CA_n5-n8 MSD value for 1U/2D n8UL/n5DL\n\nClarification on the scenario:\nThe RAN4 discussion for the 2UL scenario for CA_n5-n8 with the scheduling restriction of non-concurrent n5 DL and n8 UL is based on the assumption that UE is configured by RRC with two UL and two DL, i.e. not two UL and one DL. Based on that assumption, RAN4 has the following answers for the questions in the LS R2-2306862.\nQuestion 1: Does RAN4 see problem if cross carrier scheduling is used in this scenario i.e. PCell (n8) scheduling SCell (n5)?\nAnswer to Question 1:\nCross carrier scheduling is transparent from RAN4’s perspective. RAN4 didn’t see any impact to RAN4 specifications.\nQuestion 2: What are RAN4 understanding regarding RRM measurements in this kind of scenario? Does UE need to measure the cell with UL only (n5) (e.g. for SCell addition/change/release purpose)?\nAnswer to Question 2:\nRAN4 expects measurement of the SCell (n5) in this scenario is needed.\nIn RAN4 understanding, network would avoid the collision with the DL transmission of SCell (n5) when scheduling the UL in n8.\nNo impact to existing RRM specifications is seen from RAN4 perspective.\nHow to distinguish UE implementation for CA_n5-n8?\n\nSituation 1: if Option 1 is supported in Rel-18, then\n\nIn addition, one note can be added in RAN4 that band n8 can only be configured as DL Scell for band combinations including DL CA_n5-n8.\n\nSituation 2: if Option 1 and option 2 are supported in Rel-18.\n\nSituation 3: if Option 1 and option 3 are supported in Rel-18.\n\nSituation 4: if Option 1, option 2 and option 3 are supported in Rel-18.\n\n",

These are two other variants based on assumption 1a. They may allow easier implementation of either triplexer or duplexer in main path owing to that the frequency separations between the sub-bands are wider than the architecture assumed for DC_8-20_n28. However, the downside with two variants is that the widest frequency range which needs to be covered by any of the antenna is still relatively wide at 212 MHz and 257 MHz respectively.\n\nThe figure depicts a potential UE architecture variant to support CA_n8-n20-n28 with 3 antennas, showcasing various antenna configurations and their corresponding signal paths.\nFigure 5.3.1.1-1 Potential UE architecture variants to support CA_n8-n20-n28 with 3 antenna\n\nThe assumption 2A for UE RF architecture with two antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28 are shown as below. Pentaplexer design is considered.\n1)\tn28UL/n20+n28DL/n20UL/n8UL/n8DL pentaplexer on antenna 1\n2)\tn20+n28DL/n8DL duplexer on antenna 2\n3)\t10dB antenna isolation is used for MSD calculations\nThe assumption 2B for UE RF architecture with two antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28 are shown as below.

The first challenge is that the antenna design needs to cover the entire spectrum range of 257 MHz simultaneously as shown in Figure 5.3.1-1 for either of the variants, which is equivalent to a 31% bandwidth ratio and that would far exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar antenna design in a smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the combination is expected to be compromised.\nThe second challenge is on the feasibility of a pentaplexer design for variant (a) to aggregate five closely spaced spectrum ranges as shown in Figure 5.3.1-1, not only with sufficient filter isolation between self-band and cross-band but also with acceptable insertion loss. The variant (b) though avoids the use of pentaplexer, the design of the intended quadplexer is still relatively challenging considering the closely spaced spectrum ranges with nearly 8% bandwidth ratio for the n20/n28 combined DL range.\n\nThe assumption 3A and 3B for UE RF architecture with four antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28 are shown as below.\nThe figure depicts the RF architecture for a 5G network, specifically focusing on the assumption 3A for UE (User Equipment) RF architecture. It illustrates the use of 4 antennas for the UE, with each antenna being assigned to a specific frequency band. The figure also includes a diagram of the network's core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, highlighting the importance of redundancy and failover in the network's architecture.\nFigure 5.3.1.3-1 The assumption 3A for UE RF architecture to support CA_n8-n20-n28 with 4 antenna\n\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the radio frequency (RF) architecture for a 5G network, specifically focusing on the assumption 3B for the use of 4-antenna base stations (BSs) to support Carrier Aggregation (CA) with 8-20-28 GHz frequency bands. The figure illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the 4-antenna BS, the 4-antenna core, and the distributed nodes. The figure also highlights the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 5.3.1.3-2 The assumption 3B for UE RF architecture to support CA_n8-n20-n28 with 4 antenna\nFor the 4-antenna implementation, the three of the four antenna are used in the main path to aggregate the n8, n20, and n28 signals over the air, as shown in Figures 5.3.1.3-1 and 5.3.1.3-2. As n8, n20, and n28 signals do not need to be combined through a multiplexer, there is no additional insertion loss in n8, n20, and n28 main signal paths as compared to single-band implementation.\nHaving 3 antenna in the main signal path not only avoids the more complicated multiplexer implementation and the associated additional insertion losses, but also allows narrower frequency coverage for each of the 3 antenna as compared to single-antenna implementation. However, the additional antenna cannot be added without occupying more phone space.\n\n",

Thus, general values for low band combinations can be used for Delta Tib and Rib.\nTable 5.4.3.4-1: ΔTIB,c for 2-antenna implementation\n\nTable 5.4.3.4-2: ΔRIB,c for 2-antenna implementation\n\nBy referring to contribution [8], the two antenna implementation should drive the ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values for CA_n5-n105. Based on other LB-LB cases, and especially DC_5_n71, a Delta T of 0.5dB for both bands can be used. For Delta Rib, CA_n5-n12 values can be reused.\nTable 5.4.3.4-3: ΔTIB,c for 2-antenna implementation\n\nTable 5.4.3.4-4: ΔRIB,c for 2-antenna implementation\n\nBy referring to contribution [9], the following values are derived for ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c:\nTable 5.4.3.4-5: ΔTIB,c for 2-antenna implementation\n\nTable 5.4.3.4-6: ΔRIB,c for 2-antenna implementation\nBy referring to contribution [7], the following evaluation for MSD due to cross band isolation is provided for CA_n5-n105.\nTable 5.4.3.5-1 MSD due to Cross band isolation from n5 to n105\n\nTable 5.4.3.5-2 MSD due to Cross band isolation from n105 to n5\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the REFSENS degradation can be neglected. Thus, there is no need to specify MSD due to cross band isolation for CA_n5-n105.\nBy referring to contribution [8], the 1UL cross band interference is as follows for the IMD orders of the allocated UL Resource blocks (RBs) and its image:\nFor the n105 20MHz maximum UL CBW, the IMD interference order to n5 is >9 RBs\nFor the n5 20MHz maximum UL CBW, the IMD interference order to n105 is >9 RBs\nGiven this, there is no MSD due to IMDs. Nonetheless, the transmitter noise floor must be considered.\nWith the architecture aspects discussed above and the need to support multiple LBLB cases, conservative values should be considered:\n45dB cross band Tx-Rx isolation for the triplexers\n40dB Tx rejection in the other DL band\n10dB antenna couplingf\n4dB post PA losses\nTransmitter noise floor of -125dBm/Hz.\nBased on these assumptions, the MSD with MRC combining is calculated in Table 5.4.3.5-3.\nTable 5.4.3.5-3: MRC calculations for band n5 and n105 Cross-band MSD.\n\n1UL cross-band MSD for CA_n5-n105 is proposed in Table 5.4.3.5-4.\nTable 5.4.3.5-4: CA_n5-n105 1UL cross-band MSD\n\nBy referring to contribution [9], one aspect that needs to be pointed out is that n105 is a recently standardised band, with very challenging frequency arrangements from RF filtering point of view. Hence, especially given the band is new and implementations are just under development, we don’t see it possible to optimize the CA characteristics at the expense of attenuation at US CH36 and n105 TX/RX isolations. Please note that the numbers are not derived from dedicated triplexers, but instead from what can be achieved by matching DPX and RX filters together, without optimizations which may offer improved performance over time.\nThe MSD with MRC combining is calculated in Table 5.4.3.5-5 and Table 5.4.3.5-6.\n\nTable 5.4.3.5-5 MSD due to cross band isolation n105 to n5\n\n\nTable 5.4.3.5-6 MSD due to cross band isolation n5 to n105\n\n\n1UL cross-band MSD for CA_n5-n105 is proposed in Table 5.4.3.5-7.\n\nTable 5.4.3.5-7: CA_n5-n105 1UL cross-band MSD\n\n",

The figure includes key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and illustrates the layered architecture of the optical backbone.\nFigure 5.5.2.1-1 CA_n28A-n105A UE RF first architecture variant with 2-antenna implementation\n\nThe figure depicts a second architecture variant of CA_n28A-n105A, featuring a 2-antenna implementation. It illustrates the antenna configuration, including the number of antennas (2), the number of elements per antenna (105), and the number of elements per element (n28). The figure also includes a schematic representation of the antenna array, highlighting the distribution of elements and the arrangement of the elements within the array. The figure is used to compare the second architecture variant with the first architecture variant, CA_n28A-n105A, and to illustrate the differences in antenna configuration and array configuration.\nFigure 5.5.2.1-2 CA_n28A-n105A second architecture variant with 2-antenna implementation\n\nThe first architecture variant, due to the relatively wide frequency range (a single filter covering both n28 and n 105) in the middle sub-band for the main signal path triplexer, is considered rather challenging and impracticable for implementation and will not be further pursued in this study item.\nFor the second architecture variant, both the main antenna and diversity antenna design need to cover the entire spectrum range of 191 MHz simultaneously as shown in Figure 5.5.1-1, which is equivalent to a 27% bandwidth ratio and that would exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar antenna design in a smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the combination likely would be compromised.\n\nFor the 3-antenna implementation, the two of the three antennas are used in the main path to aggregate the n28 and n105 signals over the air, as shown in Figure 5.5.2.2-1. As n28 and n105 signals do not need to be combined through a multiplexer, there is no additional insertion loss in both n28 and n105 main signal paths as compared to the single-band implementation.\nThe figure depicts a 3-antenna UE RF architecture with CA_n28A-n105A, illustrating the radio frequency (RF) components and their arrangement. The figure includes antennas, RF connectors, and a 3-antenna base station (UE) with a 3-antenna RF front-end (RF front-end). The RF front-end is connected to the base station via a 3-antenna RF back-end (RF back-end). The RF back-end is connected to the UE via a 3-antenna RF front-end (RF front-end). The RF front-end is connected to the base station via a 3-antenna RF back-end (RF back-end). The RF back-end is connected to the UE via a 3-antenna RF front-end (RF front-end). The RF front-end is connected to the base station via a 3-antenna RF back-end (RF back-end). The RF back-end is connected to the UE via a 3-antenna RF front-end (RF front-end). The RF front-end is connected to the base station via a 3-\nFigure 5.5.2.2-1 CA_n28A-n105A UE RF architecture with 3-antenna implementation\nHaving two antenna in the main signal path not only avoids the more complicated multiplexer implementation and the associated additional insertion losses, but also allows narrower frequency coverage for each of the two antennas as compared to single-antenna implementation. However, the additional antenna cannot be added without occupying more phone space. Therefore, the feasibility on placing more than two low-band antennas in a smartphone needs to be investigated, with narrower bandwidth and regressed radiating performance expected due to the limitation in form factor.\n2UL IMD3/IM5 may fall into either n105 DL or n28 DL or both DL bands simultaneously to cause REFSENS degradation (MSD), as conceptually illustrated in Figure 5.5.2.3-1.\nThe figure depicts a conceptual illustration of the impact of 2UL IMD3/IMD5 on the DL bands for CA_n28A-n105A, highlighting the potential interference and the need for mitigation strategies.\nFigure 5.5.2.3-1 Conceptual illustration on 2UL IMD3/IMD5 impact to DL bands for CA_n28A-n105A\nFor both 2-antenna and 3-antenna implementations, depending on the carrier allocation and Tx filter isolation on the two UL carriers, the MSD caused by two simultaneous up links (2UL) IMD3 to n105 DL carrier could potentially be higher than 30 dB; especially when the n28 UL carrier is close to n105 UL band where the n105 Tx filter does not provide any rejection to n28 UL carrier and the n105 PA reverse IMD would dominate the MSD. For carrier allocations where both Tx filters can provide sufficient isolation to the cross-band UL carriers, the MSD caused by 2UL IMD3 could still be around 20 dB to either or both of the DL carriers which would be dominated by PA forward IMD.\nDue to the concern of the 2UL IMD issue, only single UL configuration is considered in this study item where UL can be in either n28 or n105.\nApart from the 2UL IMD concern, the combination may also be subject to cross-band UL to DL interference issue due to frequency proximity even under single UL operation where the REFSENS impact needs to be further analyzed.\n",

Furthermore, the DTV channels below 608 MHz are also victims of the CA_n28-n105 IMD3 and higher orders and thus the coexistence between UL CA_n28-n105 and DTV channels may be compromised.\nBased on the above IMD analysis, the IMD3 and IMD5 MSD test points in Table 5.5.4.2-1 were discussed. Some estimations of the IMD3 MSD ranged between 25 dB and 44dB depending on the performance of the filters and antenna coupling assumptions. Based on this large MSD and the potential coexistence issue with (US) DTV channels, it was agreed together with the band combination proponent, that 2UL configuration will not be supported.

From a high level perspective, based on the proponent operator’s feedback, one possibility is that RAN4 move forward with option 4 (i.e. both options 1 and 3 being captured in the specification) which would allow maximum implementation flexibility.\nOption 1 Keep current CA_n26A-n28A with entire n28 frequency range and specify n26 UL and UL CA support for entire frequency range\nOption 2 Modify current CA_n26A-n28A to include only lower 30MHz of n28 and specify n26 UL and UL CA support for lower 30MHz frequency range\nOption 3 Keep current CA_n26A-n28A with entire n28 frequency range and specify n26 UL and UL CA support for lower 30MHz frequency range\nOption 4 Combination of options 1 and 3\nReferring to table 5.5A.3.1-1h of TS 38.101-1, DL_n26A-n28A_BCS0 and BCS1 has been specified\nThere is no need to specify harmonics and harmonics mixing exception for CA_n26-n28 as we didn’t specify them in current spec.\nFor cross band isolation issue:\nCase 1: The 2nd adjacent channel leakage from band n26 may fall into band DL frequency range (774~788) when 20MHz UL CBW is assumed for band n26.\nCase 2: the 1st adjacent channel leakage from band n26 may fall into n28 DL frequency range (796~803) when 20MHz UL CBW is assumed for band n26.\nOption 1 is proposed based on the agreed ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values for CA_n5-n28 in WF [11] which can be reused for CA_n26-n28.\nOption 2 is proposed in the contribution [10].\nTable 5.6.3.4-1: ΔTIB,c\nTable 5.6.3.4-2: ΔRIB,c\n\n1) Referring to the contribution [12], the following band n28A MSD evaluations, assuming 35dB and 45dB Tx filter rejection of band n26.\nTable 5.6.3.5-1: band n28A MSD evaluations due to cross band isolation for CA_n26-n28\n\nReferring to the contribution [12], we have the following band n28B MSD evaluations, assuming filter performance with set 1 and set 2 in Table 5.6.3.5-3.\nTable 5.6.3.5-2: band n28B MSD evaluations due to cross band isolation for CA_n26-n28\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-3: Filter performance assumption\n\n2) Referring to the contribution [13], the following analysis were provided.\nTo evaluate the potential 1UL and 2UL for CA_n26-n28 with band n28 full (n28F) or the lower 30MHz (n28A), it is useful to compare existing cases for CA_n5-n28F and CA_n18-n28F and CA_n18-n28A. This can be done by observing the IMD landscape provided in Figure 5.6.3.5-1, and the related wanted UL RB allocation and its image IMDs overlaps for 5MHz and 30MHz n28DL for n28F or n28A scenarios that are collected in Table 5.6.3.5-4.\nIn addition, 1UL cross band MSD for n28F and n28A were proposed in 1UL cross band MSD for n28F and n28A.\n\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a 5G network's signal propagation in a 5G network, illustrating how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 5.6.3.5-1: IMD landscape of n5, n18, n26 and n28 for n28F and n28A cases.\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-4: Distance to n28 victim DL and IMD overlap for different UL and DL scenarios\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-5: 1UL cross band MSD for n28F and n28A\n\n3) Referring to the contribution [10], the technical analysis for two cases (case 1: n28 Cross-band MSD for lower 30MHz of n28 / case 2: n28 Cross-band MSD for entire n28) are shown below.\nTable 5.6.3.5-6: Cross-band MSD for lower 30MHz of n28\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-7: n28 Cross-band MSD for entire n28\n\nIt’s observed that MSD is about 15-20dB higher if the entire n28 must be supported, compared to case when only lower 30MHz of n28 is supported.\nTable 5.6.3.5-8: n28 Cross-band MSD test point for lower 30MHz of n28 and entire n28\n\n4) Referring to the contribution [17], the following analysis were provided.\nThe combo is a L-L band combination with small gap between uplink range of n26 and downlink range of n28. The maximum uplink bandwidth of n26 is up to 20MHz that its ACP1 would fall into DL range of n28 directly if uplink is allocated full RB. Below table lists our assumption for MSD characterization. Here we consider three-antenna implementation since the frequency gap between n26 uplink and n28 downlink is only 11MHz that we don’t think a low band diplexer is feasible with existing technology. Based on previous RAN4 agreement, there shall not be frequency range constraint on n28 thus MSD shall be characterized with full frequency range.\nTable 5.6.3.5-9 Receiver performance parameters for MSD analysis\n\nWith above parameters, we calculate MSD due to cross band isolation as below:\nTable 5.6.3.5-10 Link analysis for Band 28 5MHz REFSENS calculation at fc = 800.5 MHz\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-11: band n28B MSD evaluations due to cross band isolation for CA_n26-n28\n\n5) Referring to the contribution [18], new evaluation based on measurements were provided compared to [13] which was based on extrapolated from similar combination:\n-\t20MHz band n26 output noise in n28A (first 30MHz of band n28) and n28B (last 30MHz of band n28) for:\n-\t5, 20, 25 and 30MHz band n28 CBW\n-\tAt 23dBm for 1UL and 20dBm for 2UL\n-\tBand n28 self-desense for 5, 20, 25 and 30MHz band n28 CBW at 23dBm for 1UL and 20dBm for 2UL.\nBased on the chosen architecture, the following RF front-end performance is assumed:\n-\tPost PA and pre LNA losses = 4dB\n-\tAntenna isolation 10dB\n-\tBand n26 UL filter from n26UL/n26DL/n28DL triplexer performance:\n-\tn26 UL to n28A DL T/R isolation = 38dB\n-\tn26UL to n28A DL antenna rejection = 35dB\n-\tn26 UL to n28A DL T/R isolation = 35dB (11MHz distance)\n-\tn26UL to n28A DL antenna rejection = 32dB (11MHz distance)\n-\tThese performances are justified by the fact that band n26 is one of the most critical low band duplexers (35MHz BW with 10MHz duplex gap)\n-\tBand n28 UL filter from n28AorBUL/n26DL/n28AorBDL triplexer performance\n-\tn28 UL to n26 DL T/R isolation = 40dB\n-\tn28 UL to n26 DL antenna rejection = 38dB\nThese performances are justified for a full band n28 design and the proximity of band n26.\nFor CA_n26-n28, the 1UL scenario is using the largest n28 and n26 UL CBW (respectively 30MHz and 20MHz) closest to the victim band with a 5MHz Rx CBW. Still, in previous meetings, there was discussion regarding whether the 30MHz lower band n28 or the full band n28 should be considered, for this we evaluated n28A and n28B (representative of full band) cases:\n-\tn28B (upper 30MHz) is victim of IMD3 of band n26 UL wanted RBs and their image including its peak\n-\tn28A (lower 30MHz) is victim of IMD5 of band n26 UL wanted RBs and their image including its peak\n-\tn26 is victim of n28B IMD9 and n28A IMD11, at these high IMD offsets, the noise is dominated by the wideband transmitter white noise floor.\nWe performed measurements for both sub-band n28A and n28B cases and the MSD after MRC results are summarized in Table 3.\nTable 5.6.3.5-12: Post MRC MSD calculations based on measured transmitter noise.\n\nObservations:\n-\tWith only the transmitter noise floor contributing, the band n26 MSD due to band n28 is small\n-\tThe MSD of band n28B victim of band n26 UL IMD3 is confirmed to be significantly above 30dB\n-\tThe MSD of band n28A victim of band n26 UL IMD5 is slightly lower than estimated in [2].\nThese observations lead to the following 1UL cross band isolation MSD proposals, which provides MSD for full band and lower 30MHz of band n28 as spectrum availability varies in different regions.\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-13: 1UL cross band MSD for CA_n26-n28 accounting for both full band and lower 30MHz only of band n28.\n\n6) Referring to the contribution [19], new evaluation for one uplink is provided:\nDuring the study phase for the CA_n26-n28 band combination, there was no agreement on whether to consider only the lower 30MHz section of n28 or the entire band, as captured in the following WF:\n-\tCase 1: lower 30MHz of n28 (UL: 703~733MHz, DL: 758~788MHz) is supported.\n-\tCase 2: entire n28 frequency range (UL: 703~748MHz, DL: 758~803MHz) is supported.\nAs a consequence of this, we will do the MSD analysis and access the ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c for both cases. The corresponding aggregated spectrums are shown in Figures 2.3-1 and 2.3-2 below:\n\nThe figure depicts the aggregated spectrum allocation for the CA_n26-n28 combination, which is a combination of the CA_n26 and CA_n28 bands. The figure shows the full n28 band, with the CA_n26 band highlighted in red and the CA_n28 band in green. The figure illustrates the allocation of spectrum to each band, with the CA_n26 band being allocated to the central area and the CA_n28 band being allocated to the outer area. The figure also shows the allocation of spectrum to each sub-band, with the CA_n26 sub-band being allocated to the central area and the CA_n28 sub-band being allocated to the outer area. The figure is important for understanding the allocation of spectrum to different bands in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.6.3.5-2: Aggregated spectrum allocation for the CA_n26-n28 combination (full n28 band)\n\nThe figure depicts the aggregated spectrum allocation for the CA_n26-n28 combination, which is a 30MHz portion of the n28 band. This allocation is crucial for ensuring efficient use of the available spectrum in the CA_n26-n28 combination. The figure illustrates the distribution of spectrum across different bands, allowing for optimal utilization of the available resources.\nFigure 5.6.3.5-3: Aggregated spectrum allocation for the CA_n26-n28 combination (lower 30MHz of n28 band)\n\nThe two-antenna architecture is captured in the following figure.\nThe figure depicts a CA_n26-n28 RF front-end architecture, which is based on 2 antennas and 2 triplexers. The CA_n26-n28 design is a crucial component in wireless communication systems, enabling efficient signal processing and transmission. The figure illustrates the use of antennas and triplexers to enhance the signal quality and reduce interference.\nFigure 5.6.3.5-4: CA_n26-n28 RF front-end architecture based on 2 antennas and 2 triplexers\n\nCA_n26-n28 MSD Analysis\nAs can be seen from the MSD contributor table below, for n28 UL n26 DL, there is more than 110MHz of spectrum gap. Therefore, the cross-band interference for that case will be minimum and so the MSD for n26 DL will be small. However, for the n26 UL  n28 DL, there is only 11MHz of separation when the n28 full 45MHz band is considered and 26MMHz when the lower 30MHz of n28 (n28A) is assumed. Due to that small frequency separation, there is a strong cross-band interference that will affect the n28 DL. Next, we will examine the n28 DL MSD for both cases.\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-14: CA_n26-n28 MSD cross-band interference sources\n\nFor the n28 DL MSD analysis, we will use the following worst-case assumptions for the RF front-end performance parameters:\n-\tn26 Tx filter rejection at n28 RX (758MHz-803MHz): 30dB\n-\tCross-band TX to RX isolation: 40dB\n-\tACLR2 sideband level: 30dBc\n-\tACLR3 sideband level: 30dBc\n-\tFront-end insertion loss: 4.5dB\n-\tAntenna coupling: 10dB\n-\tRxBW: 4.5MHz\n-\tOutput Power at antenna: 23dBm\nGiven the assumptions above, the MSD analysis is summarized in the table below.\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-15: CA_n26-n28 MSD analysis\n\nCA_n26-n28 ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c Values\nFor CA_n26-n28, we can reuse the values already derived for the CA_n5-n28 as proposed in [10].\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-16: ∆TIB,c  for CA_n26-n28\n\nTable 5.6.3.5-17: ∆RIB,c  for CA_n26-n28\n\n7) Referring to the contribution [20], new evaluation for one uplink is provided:\nWe did further MSD analyses, resulting in slightly different MSD numbers.\nConventional 3GPP assumptions for the TX for the PA noise measurements were used, as well as in factoring the CIM3/CIM5 contributions:\n-\t20 MHz 100RB DFT-s-OFDM\n-\t30dBc ACLR\n-\t4dB Post-PA loss\n-\tImage -28dB\n-\tLO -28dBc\n-\tCIM3 -60dBc\n-\tCIM5 -70dBc\n\nThe figure depicts a cross-band MSD (Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output) for the lower 30MHz of n28, illustrating the signal propagation in a 5G network. The figure shows the signal reflection off buildings and the combination of signals at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 5.6.3.5-5 n28 Cross-band MSD for lower 30MHz of n28\n\nThe figure depicts a cross-band MSD (Maximum Short-Duration) for the entire n28 frequency band, illustrating the impact of various factors on the signal quality.

It can be observed the IMD3 missed the DL channel of band n26 by 5MHz.\nn26: UL 814~819\tDL 859~864\nn28: UL 743~748\tDL 798~803\nIMD3 range is 880~895 MHz\nThat means there is no direct test frequency point which can be found for IMD3 MSD definition.\n2) MSD due to two UL cross band isolation\nEven if the performance of duplexer/filter’s isolation can be guaranteed by one UL cross band isolation MSD, two PA linearity performance should be guaranteed simultaneously by two UL cross band isolation MSD requirements especially for the case that two 1st / 2nd adjacent channel interferences from two different UL aggressor bands hit the DL part of victim band. The following test points were proposed in contribution R4-2307477 for further discussion.\nTable 5.6.4.3-1: 2UL cross band MSD for n28F and n28A\n\nNew evaluation based on measurement in [16] is also provided as below:\nSince CA_n26-n28 UL configuration is also considered and, similar to the work performed for CA_n5-n28, the MSD due to the addition of the band n28 UL and band n26 UL noises must be evaluated. For this, we measured the noise levels at 20dBm for the band n26UL for 20/25/30MHz CBW of band n28 and again looking at the lower or upper 30MHz.\nThis time we had to measure the transmitter noise, evaluate the corresponding noise leaking to the receiver for each UL accounting for the front-end performance and assuming 3dB lower noise floor at 20dBm than 23dBm.\nThis resulted in the interference levels at the receiver in:\n-\tTable 5.6.4.3-2 for 20dBm band n26 UL in band n28A which correspond to an IMD5 case (ACLR2)\n-\tTable 5.6.4.3-3 for 20dBm band n26 UL in band n28B which correspond to an IMD3 case (ACLR1)\n-\tTable 5.6.4.3-4 for the 20dBm band n28 UL self desense. It corresponds to an IMD5 case for 20 and 25MHz CBW and IMD3 case for 30MHz CBW.\n\nTable 5.6.4.3-2: 20dBm band n26 UL noise in band n28A for 20/25/20MHz CBW.\n\nTable 5.6.4.3-3: 20dBm band n26 UL noise in band n28B for 20/25/20MHz CBW.\n\nTable 5.6.4.3-4: 20dBm band n28 UL noise for 20/25/20MHz CBW.\n\nFrom the above, we can derive the MSD post MRC accounting for the addition of n26 and n28 UL noises, but also considering that the main and diversity antennas are swapped between the two bands in the proposed architecture. The calculations are provided for the three band n28 victim bandwidths in Table 5.6.4.3-5 for n28A and Table 5.6.4.3-6 for n28B.\n\nTable 5.6.4.3-5: REFSENS degradation in n28A.\n\nTable 5.6.4.3-6: REFSENS degradation in n28B.\n\nObservations:\n-\tEven in the n28A case, the 2UL noise is above the band n28 REFSENS levels that already suffers from IMD3 or IMD5 self-desense.\n-\tIn many n28A cases the band n26 UL noise dominates\n-\tIn the n28B case the band n26 noise dominates compared to band n28 self desense and although significantly lower than the n26 1UL case, it still results in significant MSD\n-\tGiven that it shows the contribution from both UL the 30MHz CBW for band n28 is preferred.\nWith the above, the following 2UL MSD is proposed considering both full band n28 and upper 30MHz cases as spectrum availability varies in different regions.\n\nTable 5.6.4.3-7: 2UL cross band MSD for CA_n26-n28 accounting for both full band and lower 30MHz only of band n28.\n\n",

UE RF architecture with three antennas for CA_n5-n28-n105 is used as baseline for evaluation. The UE RF architectures with two or four antennas are not precluded in the study item. In addition, simultaneous 2-band transmission for UL CA_n28-n105 has been precluded in this combination which can be leveraged to potentially simplify the RF front-end architecture.\nFor UE RF architecture with two antennas, three types (a) (b) and (c) are provided below for CA_n5-n28-n105.\nThe figure depicts a two-antenna RF architecture for a CA_n5-n28-n105 system, illustrating the various components and their connections. The architecture includes two antennas, each with a different phase and amplitude configuration, to achieve a balanced and efficient signal transmission. The figure also shows the distribution of the antennas, with one antenna at the transmitter and the other at the receiver, to ensure a symmetrical signal path.

Specifically,\n1)\tFor CA_n5A-n28A-n105A with 2-antenna implementation, the pentaplexer and hexaplexer with 5 and 6 closely spaced frequency ranges could be relatively challenging for filter implementation with acceptable insertion loss and isolation.\n2)\tFor CA_n5A-n28A-n105A with 2-antenna implementation, both main and diversity antennas need to cover the entire spectrum range of 282 MHz simultaneously, which is equivalent to a 37.5% bandwidth ratio and that would far exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar antenna design in a smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the combination likely would be highly compromised.\nIn addition, the other difficulties can be observed, e.g.\n-\tUses the lower the entire band n28\n-\tNeed the two most critical low bands n28 and n105 in terms on BW and duplex gap\n-\tNo gap between n105 and n28\n-\tNo option for co-banding\n-\tn5 very close to n28 (even more if implemented with a band 26 filter)\n\nFor three-antenna RF architecture, three types (a) (b) and (c) are provided below for CA_n5-n28-n105.\nThe figure depicts a three-antenna RF architecture for a CA_n5-n28-n105 system, illustrating the various components and their connections. The architecture includes three antennas, each with a different phase and polarization configuration, to achieve a balanced and efficient signal transmission. The figure also shows the distribution of the antennas across the system, ensuring optimal coverage and performance.\nFigure 5.7.1.3-1 three-antenna RF architecture (a) for CA_n5-n28-n105\nFor a three-antenna RF architecture in Figure 5.7.1.3-1, the UE has also to implement a quadplexer (n5UL/n5DL/n105DL/n105UL). In addition, wide bandwidth antenna is another challenge for this type of UE RF architecture to cover frequency range from 612MHz to 894MHz. The antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (a) is shown Table 5.7.1.3-1.\n\nTable 5.7.1.3-1 the antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (a)\n\nThe figure depicts a three-antenna RF architecture for a CA_n5-n28-n105 system, illustrating the various components and their connections.

Two Rx filter groups are considered and the antenna efficiency can be compromised for pure Rx wide bandwidth antenna. This kind of implementation can be achieved more easily to reuse the existing components as soon as possible. The antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (c) is shown in table 5.7.1.3-3.\n\nTable 5.7.1.3-3 the antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (c)\n\nThe figure depicts a three-antenna RF architecture for a CA_n5-n28-n105 system, illustrating the use of multiple antennas to enhance signal reception and reduce interference. The architecture includes three antennas, each with a different polarization and phase, to achieve a balanced signal distribution. The figure also shows the distribution of the signal power across the three antennas, ensuring that the signal is received at the desired location. The use of this architecture is crucial for achieving high-quality communication in a CA_n5-n28-n105 system.\nFigure 5.7.1.3-4 three-antenna RF architecture (d) for CA_n5-n28-n105\nThe three-antenna RF architecture (d) is shown in Figure 5.7.1.3-4.

The antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (e) is shown in 5.7.1.3-5. On concept level, this is basically building on top of CA_n28-n105, by adding one new antenna (n5 Duplexer) and n5 DRX into n28-n105 DX antenna.\n\nTable 5.7.1.3-5 the antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (b)\n\nFor three-antenna UE RF architecture, one more low-band antenna can help ease the design of wide bandwidth antenna and avoid to implement the most complicated multiplexer comparing to two-antenna UE RF architecture. For CA_n5A-n28A-n105A with 3-antenna implementation under architecture variant (b), the main TRx front-end design is eased by leveraging the non-concurrent UL transmission configuration between n28 and n105.\n\nUE RF architecture with four antennas for CA_n5-n28-n105 is shown below.\nThe figure depicts a four-antenna RF architecture for CA_n5-n28-n105, which is a crucial component in the CA_n5-n28-n105 system. The architecture includes four antennas, each with a different polarization and polarization angle, to ensure efficient signal transmission. The figure also shows the distribution of the antennas, with one antenna at the center, one at the top, one at the bottom, and one at the left. This design is essential for the CA_n5-n28-n105 system, as it allows for efficient signal transmission and reception.\nFigure 5.7.1.4-1 four-antenna RF architecture for CA_n5-n28-n105\nThe antenna relative bandwidth ratio for four-antenna RF architecture is shown below.\n\nTable 5.7.1.4-1: the antenna relative bandwidth ratio for two-antenna RF architecture\n\nFor four-antenna UE RF architecture, even if UE can avoid implementing wide bandwidth low-band antenna and complex multiplexer, UE pays the price of space and antenna performance. Four-antenna RF architecture will not be used to specify the requirement for this band combination.\n\n",

For example, if the UL carrier in band n28 is configured in 703~718MHz, no matter which UL frequency carrier in band n5 is configured, the IMD3 products will not hit the DL carrier in band n105 directly.\n2) In addition, another contribution [16] proposed to derive the MSD due to IMD3 from CA_n8-n20-n28 with additional scaling factor. The scaling factor mainly consider the following reasons:\n-\tn28 UL distance to n105 is smaller than n20 to n8\n-\tn28 UL filter is more critical than band n20 and the lower side is more critical resulting in lower cross-band isolation\n-\tThe lower IMD3 is often higher since the PA has higher gain at lower frequencies.\nIt’s suggested to increase the MSD level by (6) dBs: 2dB for higher level lower IMD3 vs upper and 4dB for lower isolation compared with the MSD of CA_n8-n20-n28 as below.\nTable 5.7.6-2: REFSENS exceptions due to IMD interference for CA_n5-n28-n105\n\n\n\n\n",
