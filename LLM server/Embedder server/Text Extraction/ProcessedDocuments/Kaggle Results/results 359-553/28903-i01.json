The figure shows a network of edge devices, such as routers and switches, connected to a central cloud server. The MEC framework is designed to enable efficient and scalable processing of data at the edge, reducing latency and improving network performance. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing policies in managing and distributing data across different edge devices.\nFigure 4.1-1: Multi-access Edge Computing framework\nFigure 4.1-1 shows the MEC framework as defined in [4], it mainly contains several components,\nThe MEC host is an entity that contains a MEC platform and a Virtualisation infrastructure which provides compute, storage, and network resources, for the purpose of running MEC applications.\nThe MEC platform is the collection of essential functionality required to run MEC applications on a particular Virtualisation infrastructure and enable them to provide and consume MEC services. The MEC platform can also provide services.\nMEC applications are instantiated on the Virtualisation infrastructure of the MEC host based on configuration or requests validated by the MEC management.\nThe MEC system level management includes the MEC orchestrator as its core component, which has an overview of the complete MEC system. When relying on the NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) for resource orchestration and for orchestration of the set of MEC application VNFs, the MEC Orchestrator (MEO) is replaced by a MEC Application Orchestrator (MEAO), the architecture is described in clause 6.2.2 of [4].\nThe MEC host level management comprises the MEC platform manager and the Virtualisation infrastructure manager, and handles the management of the MEC specific functionality of a particular MEC host and the applications running on it.\nIn Annex C of TS 23.558 [5], both EDGEAPP and ETSI MEC can provide support for hosting different edge applications, it further indicates that \"Both EAS and MEC application are application servers and can provide similar application specific functionalities.

The figure also highlights the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 4.2-1: OP Roles and Interfaces Reference Architecture\nThis study is focused on the NBI and E/WBI requirements as defined in [2]. The NBI is the interface between the application provider and the Capabilities Exposure Role in the Operator Platform, it allows an OP to advertise the above cloud capabilities that it can provide to application providers. In addition, the NBI allows an application provider to reserve a set of resources or request an Edge Cloud service with the resources and features that they require and for the OP to accept or reject the request. The E/WBI interface provides the capabilities with regards to federation management between Ops. This includes managing the federation relationship between Ops, and other capabilities applicable between federated Ops, such as EAS deployment, resource sharing and resource reservation.\nIn this study, it is assumed that the application provider as described in [2] maps to ASP in TS 28.538 [6], and the Operator Platform as described in [2] maps to ECSP management system in TS 28.538 [6].\nThe table 4.2-1 provides the mapping of concepts (not exhaustive) defined in TS 28.538 [6] with the concepts defined in GSMA OPG [2].\nTable 4.2-1\n\n",

An instance of OperatorEdgeDataNetwork IOC should be created and configured for each EDN shared with another operator. When configured the attributes override those in the associated EdgeDataNetwork instance. The attribute of this IOC are same as defined for EdgeDataNetwork IOC in TS 28.538. This IOC when instantiated represents a particular EDN shared with the L-OP.\nIn order to establish the federation, the L-OP request P-OP to create an instance of EdgeFederation IOC. L-OP can then query for the offered edge resources and update the accepted edge resources accordingly. Based on the accepted edge resource, producer instantiate OperatorEdgeDataNetwork IOC to represent the accepted edge resource which is shared with the L-OP. The federation relationship established can be updated by the L-OP at any point of time in future.\nIn order to remove existing federation relationship, the L-OP request P-OP to delete an existing instance of EdgeFederation IOC, this will also result in deletion of related OperatorEdgeDataNetwork MOI.\nNote: The agreed federation information (e.g. offered EDN and selected EDN) should be available to L-OP also so that L-OP can decide if it want to deploy an EAS on P-OPs network if and when required.\n",

The EAS relocation trigger from OP are related with lifecycle management of its edge compute resources (for example, the overload of an edge compute resource, a failure or planned maintenance, a new or expanded edge compute resource, an issue with the network for its edge compute resource). The OP should be cognisant of the policy indication from the Application Provider about its sensitivity to a change of the edge compute resource hosting the Edge Application.\nAs described in clause 5.1.1.2.2 of GSMA OPG [2], the NBI allows an Application Provider to specify their support for a stateful or stateless Edge Application, i.e. whether the Edge Application can be moved from one edge compute resource to another and this with or without prior notification.\nThe Application Provider indicates the following policies:\n-\tIts Edge Application cannot be moved from one edge compute resource to another;\n-\tIts Edge Application can be moved from one edge compute resource to another, without any notification;\n-\tIts Edge Application can be moved from one edge compute resource to another with prior notification.\nWhen the policy is that a change of edge compute resource can be done with prior notification, the OP decides that a change of edge compute resource is needed and selects the new edge compute resource. In this case, the application chooses the exact timing of the move and is responsible for transferring the application state from one edge compute resource to another. Further, it is stated that when required, notifying the Application Provider on a recommended change of edge compute resource, the Application Provider is responsible for determining the exact timing of the change. The application may indicate that it cannot currently handle mobility. Then, the OP can cancel the mobility procedure.\nTS 28.538 [6] does not support this yet. This requires an EAS to be moved from one (source) EDN to another (target) EDN. This will involve terminating EAS from the source EDN and then instantiating EAS on the target EDN. This involves the following issues to be addressed:\n-\tHow the ASP will provide the policies.\n-\tHow the existing application context is retained from source to target EAS.\n",

The policy can dictate whether the EAS can be relocated or not. If it can be relocated does it require prior notification to be sent to the authorized entities? The solution also requires relocation trigger information, decided by ECMS (ECSP Management System), to be included in EASFunction IOC. This information dictates whether EAS should be relocated immediately or at some future point of time. ECMS decides to relocate an EAS for any appropriate purpose e.g. the overload of an edge compute resource, a failure or planned maintenance, a new or expanded edge compute resource, an issue with the network for its edge compute resource.\nOnce decided to relocate the EAS, ECMS considers the relocation policy and trigger information. If the EAS is to be relocated immediately and the relocation policy allows it, ECMS selects the appropriate EDN and instantiate the relocation procedure. That will include instantiating the EAS on the selected EDN as specified in TS 28.538 [6] and then terminate the existing EAS instance. If the relocation policy states that a prior notification is to be provided ECMS notifies all authorized receivers using notifyMOIAttributeValueChange notification, against updates on relocation trigger information in EASFunction IOC, as specified in TS 28.532. The notification will be sent before instantiating the relocation procedure. The consumer can reject the relocation by updating the value of attribute RelocationRejectByConsumer to TRUE.\nIt is proposed to add the following in EASRequirements IOC\n-\tAttribute RelocationPolicy with allowed values as follows\n-\tYes: This dictates that an EAS can be relocated as and when required\n-\tNo: This dictates an EAS cannot be relocated at all\n-\tYesWNotify: This indicates that an EAS can be relocated with a prior notification\nThe solution also requires the following information to be included in the EASFunction IOC\n1)\tRelocationTriggerInfo\na)\tImmediateTrigger: It is a Boolean attribute with default value as FALSE.
