A geostationary orbit is a non-inclined geosynchronous orbit, i.e. in the Earth’s equator plane.\nLow Earth Orbit: Orbit around the Earth with an altitude between 300 km, and 1500 km.\nSatellite: A space-borne vehicle embarking a bent pipe payload or a regenerative payload telecommunication transmitter, placed into Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO), or Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO).\nSatellite Access Node: see definition in TS 36.108 [2].\nsTTI: A transmission time interval (TTI) of either one slot or one subslot as defined in TS 36.211 [3] on either uplink or downlink.\n",

The channel edges are defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the carrier separated by the channel bandwidth, i.e. at FC +/- BWChannel /2.\nThe figure depicts a detailed diagram of the channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth configuration in a 5G network. It illustrates the various components involved, such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, as well as the various types of signal paths and their corresponding bandwidth requirements.

This out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and an Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio.\nThe spectrum emission mask of the category NB1 and NB2 UE applies to frequencies (ΔfOOB) starting from the  edge of the assigned category NB1 or NB2 channel bandwidth. For frequencies greater than (ΔfOOB) as specified in Table 6.5B.3.2-1 the spurious requirements in subclause 6.5B.4 are applicable.\nThe power of any category NB1 or NB2 UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5B.3.2-1.

However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\n[NOTE2:\tWhen the UE is operating in an NGSO deployment, to support coexistence, it is assumed that a guardband at least equivalent to the maximum doppler shift expected for the NGSO constellation between the channel edge of the channel bandwidth operated by the UE and the spectrum block edge has been accounted for as part of system deployment configuration by the operator.]\nThe additional spectrum emission mask for category NB1 and NB2 is not applicable.\nAdjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The assigned category NB1or NB2 channel power and adjacent channel power are measured with filters and measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.5B.3.4-1.
