If no such provision exists in the ME or the UICC or the provision does not authorize the service, then the UE is not authorized to transmit;\nNOTE 1:\tIt is possible for operators to configure UEs (e.g. Public Safety UEs) to use only \"operator-managed\" radio resources (i.e. carrier frequency) for the service when the UE is \"not served by NG-RAN\".\n-\tThe UE provisioning shall support setting Geographical Areas;\nNOTE 2:\tIt is possible for a UE to use other radio resources for 5G ProSe based on the Geographical Area instead of those operated by the serving NG-RAN cell, when provisioned in the UE, even if the UE's serving cell offers normal service and the SIBs for NR Sidelink communication defined in TS 38.331 [16] indicates that the service (the service) is available. This is to cover the scenario when e.g. the radio resources used for the service are not owned by the serving network of the UE.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen cross-carrier operation is supported, according to TS 36.331 [15] or TS 38.331 [16], a UE can be instructed by its serving cell to perform the service over a different carrier frequency. The UE is still considered as \"served by NG-RAN\" in this case.\nNOTE 4:\tThe scenario that a cell is detected and the cell does not provide support for the service when the UE attempts to use a carrier frequency configured for the service, is considered a configuration error. Therefore, the UE does not transmit on that frequency to avoid interference to the network.\n-\tThe service is only specified for NR.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is out of scope of the present specification to define how the UE can locate itself in a specific Geographical Area. When the UE is in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can for example, use information derived from the serving PLMN. When the UE is not in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can use other techniques, e.g. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). User provided location is not a valid input.\n",

The PC5 QoS is controlled with PC5 QoS rules and PC5 QoS parameters (e.g. PQI, GFBR, MFBR, PC5 LINK-AMBR) as specified in clause 5.4 of TS 23.287 [2]. The QoS for the PDU session established between the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and UPF (i.e. Uu QoS control) is controlled with QoS rules and 5G QoS parameters (e.g. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) as specified in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [4].\nAs shown in figure 5.6.2.1-1 below, the end-to-end QoS can be met only when the QoS requirements are properly translated and satisfied over the two legs respectively.\nThe figure depicts the end-to-end QoS translation for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay operation, illustrating the process of ensuring high-quality service delivery to the network.\nFigure 5.6.2.1-1: End-to-End QoS translation for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay  operation\nTo achieve this, the QoS mapping can be pre-configured or provided to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay by the PCF using Prose Policy as specified in clause 5.1.4.1. The QoS mapping includes combinations of the 5QIs and PQIs mapping as entries. The PQI shall have standardized values as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 and in Table 5.4.4-1 of TS 23.287 [2]. The 5QI shall have standardized values as defined in TS 23.501 [4] clause 5.7.4. The QoS mapping also includes an adjustment factor for the PQI's PDB, e.g. 1/5 of the standardized PDB value in Table 5.6.1-1 and Table 5.4.4-1 of TS 23.287 [2].\nIf the QoS Flows setup are initiated by network, the SMF can base on the PCC rules or its local configuration to generates the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters (e.g. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) and signal to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay using PDU Session Establishment/Modification procedure. For the PDU sessions used for relaying, the SMF always provides the QoS Flow level QoS parameters to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay when establishes a QoS Flow. Then the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay decides the PC5 QoS parameters for the corresponding PC5 QoS Flow by determining the PQI based the QoS mapping and the GFBR and MFBR values for the PC5 GBR QoS Flow are set equal to the GFBR and MFBR values for the GBR QoS Flow respectively. The PCF differentiates the relay traffic based on either local configuration, e.g.by a dedicated DNN or S-NSSAI used for relay traffic or by the traffic filters.\nNOTE:\tSeparate QoS mappings can be configured for different RSCs.\nIf the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE initiates PC5 QoS Flows setup or modification during the Layer-2 link establishment or modification procedure, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE provides the QoS Info as described in clause 6.4.3.6 to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay. The received PC5 QoS parameters of the QoS Info (i.e. PQI and conditionally other parameters such as MFBR/GFBR, etc.) are interpreted as the end-to-end QoS requirements by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay for the traffic transmission between 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and UPF. If the end-to-end QoS requirements can be supported by an entry in QoS mapping, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay uses the 5QI of the entry for the Uu QoS control and uses the PQI of the entry for the PC5 QoS control. If the end-to-end QoS requirements cannot be supported by any entries in QoS mapping, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, based on its implementation, decides the 5QI for the Uu QoS control and PQI for the PC5 QoS control. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay provides the QoS Info (including PQI value chosen by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay) as part of the Accept message to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE. If the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE performs the Layer-2 link modification procedure to add new PC5 QoS Flow(s) or modify the existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) for IP traffic or Ethernet traffic over PC5 reference point, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE may also provide the PC5 QoS Rule(s) for the PC5 QoS Flow(s) to be added or modified to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay may generate the Packet Filters used over Uu reference point based on the received PC5 QoS Rule(s).\nThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs the UE requested PDU session Modification as defined in TS 23.502 [5], clause 4.3.3 for authorizing the requested QoS including the 5QI and the Packet Filters. If the PCF authorizes the requested QoS with a different 5QI value, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay may further update the PQI value based on the authorized 5QI value and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs the Layer-2 link modification procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3.6 to update the corresponding PC5 QoS Flow with the updated PQI value.\nAlternatively, reflective QoS control over Uu as defined in TS 23.501 [4], clause 5.6.5.3 can be leveraged for dynamic QoS handling of 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE to save on signalling between SMF and 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay. Upon reception of a DL packet with RQI on the Uu for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE, based on the indicated QFI, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay creates a new derived QoS rule or updates existing derived QoS rule corresponding to the remote UE, as defined in TS 23.501 [4]. The derived QoS rule is for UL packets from the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE at Uu interface.\nBased on signalled QoS rules (via SMF) or derived QoS rules (Uplink Uu via reflective QoS), the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay may generate the Packet Filters used over PC5 reference point and use the L2 Link Modification procedures as defined in clause 6.4.3.6 to either update existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) or to set up new PC5 QoS Flow(s) (when the QFI to PC5 QoS Flow mapping does not exist). The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay may also provide the PC5 QoS Rule(s) for the PC5 QoS Flow(s) to be added or modified to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE.\nWhen the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network relay deletes the derived QoS rule e.g. after the RQ Timer expires, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay may perform L2 Link Modification procedures defined in clause 6.4.3.6 accordingly using the PQI mapped from the 5QI of the currently used QoS rule after the deletion of the derived QoS rule(s).\nWhen accessing 5GS via a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE can request for PDU Session establishment or handover an existing PDU session to the N3IWF using UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure defined in TS 23.502 [5] clause 4.12.5.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with a focus on end-to-end QoS support, specifically through the use of Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay (N3IWF) technology. This relay mechanism ensures that network traffic is prioritized and delivered to the appropriate network devices, enhancing overall network performance and reliability. The figure illustrates the various components involved in this QoS support, including the network devices, the relay, and the network infrastructure.\nFigure 5.6.2.2-1: End-to-End QoS support via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF\nFor the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's PDU session(s) established via N3IWF, QoS differentiation can be provided on per-IPsec Child Security Association basis. N3IWF determines the IPsec child SAs as defined in TS 23.502 [5] clause 4.12. The N3IWF is preconfigured to allocate different IPsec child SAs for QoS Flows with different QoS profiles.\nBased on configuration, the N3IWF can use one of the options below for QoS support in 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's serving PLMN:\n-\ta static QoS mapping mechanism;\n-\ta dynamic QoS signalling based mechanism.\nFor the static QoS mapping mechanism, a SLA is established to govern the QoS handling between the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's 5GC and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's 5GC, e.g. when the RSC is configured. The SLA can include the mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs with the Remote UE and the corresponding QoS and N3IWF IP address(es). The non-alteration of the DSCP field between N3IWF and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's UPF is also assumed to be governed by an SLA and by transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The packet detection filters at the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's UPF can be based on the N3IWF IP address and the DSCP markings.\nWhen the dynamic QoS signalling based mechanism is used by N3IWF, it works as follows:\n-\tWhen the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE establishes or handovers a PDU session via the N3IWF as described in clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [5], the PCF serving the PDU Session in the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's 5GC detects need for specific QoS and provides corresponding PCC rules to SMF in the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's 5GC. The resulted QoS information is provided to N3IWF in step 2b of clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [5]. The N3IWF determines the IPSec Child SA(s) and signals to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE, as in step 4 of clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [5] via IKE signalling including the PDU Session ID, the QFI(s), optionally a DSCP value and optionally the Additional QoS Information specified in clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [5]. The PDU Session Establishment Accept message will be sent to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE as in step 5 of clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [5].\n-\tBased on Additional QoS Information received from the N3IWF, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE determines whether it is necessary to request for QoS session modification for the dedicated QoS Flows toward the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay as described in clause 5.6.2.1. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE also provides the N3IWF address, DSCP and the SPI as the traffic filter to enable filtering and mapping of DL traffic towards the right PDU Session/QoS Flow within the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's 5GC.\nNOTE:\tThis mechanism allows to communicate GBR related parameters such as GFBR and MFBR from the PCF of the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE via the N3IWF and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE would be able to request the GBR resources from its serving network using UE requested PDU session modification as in clause 4.3.3. of TS 23.502 [5].\n-\tIf the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs the PDU Session Modification procedure, the PCF in the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's 5GC authorizes the QoS parameters. If the PDU Session Modification procedure authorized the requested QoS parameters, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay acknowledges the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE over PC5. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay also provides the traffic filter provided by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE to the SMF during the PDU Session Modification procedure and the SMF updates the PSA UPF with DL Packet Detection Rules.\n-\tThe PSA UPF in the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE's 5GC maps the DL traffic from IPSec Child SA tunnel to appropriate PDU Session/QoS Flow considering SPI and N3IWF address (filters provided by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE).\n-\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's or the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's 5GC may initiated PDU Session Modification procedures as specified in clause 4.12.6 of TS 23.502 [5]. When the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE received QoS information from the N3IWF, the same interactions between the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and between the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and its 5GC as described above apply.\nFor a 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE accessing network via 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, the existing 5G QoS control is reused between the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE's core network. The 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE's SMF provides QoS profiles to NG-RAN, how NG-RAN performs QoS enforcement for PC5 interface (between the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay) and Uu interface (between the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and RAN) is specified in TS 38.300 [12].\n",

                            "text_content": "For a 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE connecting with another 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE(s) via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay, the QoS requirement of the relay traffic between the peer 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE(s) can be satisfied by the corresponding QoS control for the PC5 link between source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE and 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay (i.e. first hop PC5 QoS control) and the QoS control for the PC5 link between 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay and target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE (i.e. second hop PC5 QoS control). The first hop PC5 QoS and second hop PC5 QoS is controlled with PC5 QoS rules and PC5 QoS parameters (e.g. PQI, GFBR, MFBR, PC5 LINK-AMBR) as specified in clause 5.6.1.\nAs shown in figure 5.6.3.1-1 below, the end-to-end QoS is met only when the QoS requirements are properly translated and satisfied over the two legs respectively.\nThe figure depicts the end-to-end QoS for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay operation, illustrating the importance of network reliability and performance in 5G networks.\nFigure 5.6.3.1-1: End-to-End QoS for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay operation\nTo achieve this, the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE initiates PC5 QoS Flows setup or modification during the Layer-2 link establishment or modification procedure, the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE provides the QoS Info as described in clause 6.4.3.7.3 to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay. The received PC5 QoS parameters of the QoS Info (i.e. PQI and conditionally other parameters such as MFBR/GFBR, etc.) are interpreted as the end-to-end QoS requirements by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay for the traffic transmission between source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE and target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE. The source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE derives the end-to-end QoS parameters as defined in clause 5.6.1. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay, based on its implementation, decides the PQI for the first hop PC5 QoS control and the PQI for the second hop PC5 QoS control, by considering the received PC5 QoS parameters from the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay provides the QoS Info (including PQI value chosen by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay for the second hop) to the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE. After accepted QoS Info of the second hop QoS from the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE is received, 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay provides the QoS Info (including PQI value chosen by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay for the first hop) to the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE with considering the received second hop QoS. If the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE performs the Layer-2 link modification procedure to add new PC5 QoS Flow(s) or modify the existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) for IP traffic or Ethernet traffic over PC5 reference point, the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE may also provide the PC5 QoS Rule(s) for the PC5 QoS Flow(s) to be added or modified to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay may generate the Packet Filters used over the second hop based on the received PC5 QoS Rule(s).\nFor a 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE connecting with another 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE(s) via 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay, the source 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE and the target 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE negotiate the end-to-end QoS for the traffic transmission between source 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE and target 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether and how to perform QoS enforcement for first hop PC5 interface (between the source 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay) and second hop PC5 interface (between the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay and the target 5G ProSe Layer-2 End UE).\n",

Source Layer-2 IDs are always self-assigned by the UE originating the corresponding layer-2 frames.\nThe selection of the Source and Destination Layer-2 ID(s) by a UE depends on the communication mode of 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5 reference point for this layer-2 link, as described in clauses 5.8.2.2, 5.8.2.3 and 5.8.2.4. The Source Layer-2 IDs may differ between different communication modes.\nFor broadcast mode of 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5 reference point, the UE is configured with the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) to be used for ProSe applications. The Destination Layer-2 ID for a 5G ProSe direct communication is selected based on the configuration as described in clause 5.1.3.1.\nThe UE self-selects a Source Layer-2 ID.\nFor groupcast mode of 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5 reference point, the application layer may provide Application Layer Group ID.\nThe UE determines a Destination Layer-2 ID as below:\n-\tWhen the Application Layer Group ID is provided by the application layer,\n-\tand when ProSe Layer-2 Group ID is configured for the Application Layer Group ID provided by the application layer as specified in clause 5.1.3.1, the UE uses the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID as the Destination Layer-2 ID; or\n-\tand when ProSe Layer-2 Group ID is not configured for the Application Layer Group ID provided by the application layer, the UE converts the Application Layer Group ID into a Destination Layer-2 ID.\n-\tWhen the Application Layer Group ID is not provided by the application layer, the UE determines the Destination Layer-2 ID based on configuration of the mapping between ProSe Identifier and Layer-2 ID, as specified in clause 5.1.3.1.\nNOTE:\tThe mechanism for converting the application layer provided Application Layer Group ID to the Destination Layer-2 ID is defined in Stage 3.\nThe UE self-selects a Source Layer-2 ID.\nFor unicast mode of 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5 reference point, the Destination Layer-2 ID used depends on the communication peer. The Layer-2 ID of the communication peer, identified by the peer's Application Layer ID, may be discovered during the establishment of the PC5 unicast link, or known to the UE via prior ProSe direct communications, e.g. existing or prior unicast link to the same Application Layer ID, or obtained from 5G ProSe direct discovery process. The initial signalling for the establishment of the PC5 unicast link may use the known Layer-2 ID of the communication peer, or a default destination Layer-2 ID associated with the ProSe service (i.e. ProSe identifier) configured for PC5 unicast link establishment, as specified in clause 5.1.3.1. During the PC5 unicast link establishment procedure, Layer-2 IDs are exchanged and should be used for future communication between the two UEs, as specified in clause 6.4.3.\nThe UE maintains a mapping between the Application Layer IDs and the source Layer-2 IDs used for the PC5 unicast links, as the ProSe application layer does not use the Layer-2 IDs. This allows the change of source Layer-2 ID without interrupting the ProSe applications.\nWhen Application Layer IDs change, the source Layer-2 ID(s) of the PC5 unicast link(s) shall be changed if the link(s) was used for 5G ProSe communication with the changed Application Layer IDs.\nBased on privacy configuration as specified in clause 5.1.3.1, the update of the new identifiers of a source UE to the peer UE for the established unicast link may cause the peer UE to change its Layer-2 ID and optionally IP address/prefix if IP communication is used as defined in clause 6.4.3.2.\n",

For broadcast and groupcast, the ProSe layer also determines the NR Tx Profile based on the mapping of ProSe services (i.e. ProSe identifiers) to NR Tx Profiles as described in clause 5.1.3.1. The ProSe layer passes the PC5 QoS parameters and destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer as specified in clauses 6.4.1, 6.4.2 and 6.4.3. The ProSe layer also passes the corresponding NR Tx Profile to the AS layer, if the ProSe layer has determined the corresponding NR Tx Profile.\nNOTE:\tFor broadcast and groupcast, the AS layer needs PC5 QoS parameters as well to determine the PC5 DRX parameter values for reception operation over PC5 reference point. Therefore, the ProSe layer determines the interested ProSe services (i.e. ProSe identifiers) and derives the PC5 QoS parameters based on its reception needs besides the transmission needs. How to derive the PC5 QoS parameters based on its reception needs (e.g. without establishing the PC5 QoS Flows) depends on UE implementation.\nFor broadcast or groupcast, the ProSe layer maintains a list of all ProSe services (i.e. ProSe identifiers), i.e. activated ProSe services and/or ProSe services that the UE is interested for reception, for a given destination Layer-2 ID and determines the NR Tx Profile to be mapped for the respective ProSe service based on the configuration described in clause 5.1.3.1. Whenever the list of the ProSe services for a given destination Layer-2 ID changes, the ProSe layer updates the AS layer for the NR Tx Profiles information by providing all the mapped NR Tx Profiles to the AS layer for the given destination Layer-2 ID, e.g. when providing other information such as the destination Layer-2 ID, PC5 QoS parameters.\nFor broadcast, the mapping from destination Layer-2 ID to NR Tx Profile is configured in the NG-RAN. The NG-RAN may derive the NR Tx Profile from the destination Layer-2 ID to perform the network scheduled operation mode, alignment of Uu DRX and PC5 DRX, etc.\nWhen the PC5 DRX operation is needed, the AS layer determines the PC5 DRX parameter values for 5G ProSe Direct Communication or 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Communication over PC5 reference point, taking into account, e.g., PC5 QoS parameters and/or destination Layer-2 ID provided by the ProSe layer.\nFor broadcast and groupcast, the UE enables the PC5 DRX based on the NR Tx Profile.\nFor unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Communication, two UEs may negotiate the PC5 DRX configuration in the AS layer and the PC5 DRX parameter values can be configured per pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs in the AS layer. For transmitting and receiving Direct Communication Request messages, a default PC5 DRX configuration may be used (see TS 38.300 [12]).\nFor broadcast and groupcast when the UE is \"not served by NG-RAN\", the UE uses the provisioned PC5 DRX configuration for PC5 DRX operation as specified in clause 5.1.3.1.\n",

UE operation related to the path switch for ProSe service is as follows:\n-\tThe UE evaluates the path selection policy in the policy and parameters for ProSe Direct Communication applicable to the ProSe service and switches the communication path as below:\n-\tIf the Uu path is used and PC5 preferred is indicated, the UE should prefer to switch to the PC5 communication path for the ProSe service.\n-\tIf the PC5 path is used and Uu preferred is indicated, the UE should prefer to switch to the Uu communication path for the ProSe service.\n-\tIf no preference is indicated or no path selection policy is provisioned, the UE switches between Uu and PC5 communication path based on its pre-configuration or implementation for the ProSe service.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen either PC5 preferred or Uu preferred is indicated, the UE can still switch to the other non-preferred path, e.g. signal strength of any path below a certain configured signal strength threshold.\nThe UE may decide to perform path switching from Uu path to PC5 path, e.g. because the peer UE is in proximity or for offloading some traffic from the network. The UE may decide to perform path switching from PC5 path to Uu path, e.g. when the PC5 signal strength of the unicast link with the peer UE becomes weak.\nAt path switching, the same traffic type between for PDU Session and for PC5 unicast link is maintained, i.e. IP type, Ethernet type and Unstructured type.\nFor communication path switching from PC5 to Uu reference point, the Uu QoS parameters of each UE are decided based on PC5 QoS parameters and negotiated via the existing PC5 connection between two UEs. Each UE may perform the UE requested PDU Session Modification as defined in TS 23.502 [5] clause 4.3.3 to request the Uu QoS parameters. For IP type traffic, the IP addresses/prefixes of the peer UEs over the Uu reference point can be shared via the existing PC5 connection between the UEs by using application layer signalling to assist them to establish communication with each other via the communication path over the Uu reference point.\nWhen both Uu path and PC5 path are available, a make-before-break mechanism is used when switching between PC5 path and Uu path. That is, the UEs first prepare the target path to communicate with each other and then perform the path switching and communicate over the target path and after this the former path may be released.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is not targeted to support session continuity (e.g. IP address preservation) during path switching between PC5 and Uu reference points.\n",

There are two types of 5G ProSe Direct Discovery supported over PC3a reference point: open and restricted, as defined in TS 23.303 [3]. 5G ProSe Direct Discovery can be a standalone service or can be used for subsequent actions e.g. to initiate 5G ProSe Direct Communication.\nProSe-enabled UEs which have obtained authorization to participate in 5G ProSe Direct Discovery shall not continue in participating in 5G ProSe Direct Discovery procedures over PC3a reference point defined in clause 6.3.1 when they detect loss of NG-RAN coverage in the serving PLMN.\nWith 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, the UE can use inter-PLMN discovery transmission based on the indication from the serving NG-RAN or the provisioned radio resource on the UE. How the serving cell authorizes the UE to use inter-PLMN radio resource is specified in TS 38.331 [16].\nThe figure depicts the overall procedure for Model A 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, which involves the use of a 5G network to enable direct communication between devices. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the process, including the use of a 5G network, the establishment of a direct communication link, and the use of a ProSe protocol for secure communication.\nFigure 6.3.1.2-1: Overall procedure for Model A 5G ProSe Direct Discovery\nThis procedure is applied for open and restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery when the ProSe enabled UE is served by NG-RAN.\n1.\tService authorisation for 5G ProSe Direct Discovery services is performed for as defined in clause 6.2.\nIf the UE is authorised to announce:\n2a.\tWhen the UE is triggered to announce, then it sends a discovery request for announcing to the 5G DDNMF in HPLMN as defined in clause 6.3.1.4.

The exact signalling procedures involving the UE, the 5G DDNMFs and the ProSe Application Server are specified in TS 23.303 [3] clause 5.3.3, with the following modifications:\n-\tthe 5G DDNMF takes the role of \"ProSe Function\" in the procedure;\n-\tUpon receiving a Discovery Request for restricted discovery from a UE, if the 5G DDNMF does not have a valid PDUID for that UE, the 5G DDNMF searches the PCF for the UE using Nbsf_Management_Subscribe Request and BSF provides the address of the PCF for the UE in Nbsf_Management_Subscribe Response as defined in the clause 5.2.13.2.6 in TS 23.502 [5]. The 5G DDNMF gets the PDUID and subscribes to notifications on Change of PDUID using Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Subscribe from the PCF for the UE as defined in the clause 5.2.5.8.6 in TS 23.502 [5], including the SUPI, Event ID set to \"Change of PDUID\" and immediate reporting flag to indicate that the current PDUID value should be provided to the consumer. The PCF provides the PDUID and its validity timer.\nNOTE:\tIf the address of the PCF for the UE is changed, the BSF notifies the 5G DDNMF of the changed PCF address in Nbsf_Management_Notify as defined in the clause 5.2.13.2.8 in TS 23.502 [5].\n-\tAt the time the PCF generates a new PDUID, if the subscription to \"Change of PDUID\" is active it sends Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Notify to the 5G DDNMF to report a new PDUID and its validity timer.\n-\tthe HSS is replaced by UDM;\n-\tthe E-UTRAN is replaced by NG-RAN and E-UTRA is replaced with NR;\n-\tcorresponding 5GS identifiers replace the EPS identifiers, e.g. use SUPI instead of IMSI and use GPSI instead of MSISDN;\n-\tPC5_tech parameter is omitted and the intended PC5 radio technology is NR.\nThe Discovery Request procedure can also be used by the Discoveree UE or the Discoverer UE in order to be authorised to access the discovery resources and perform 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, Model B. The exact signalling procedures are defined in TS 23.303 [3] clause 5.3.3A, with the same modifications as in the above list apply.\nThe events reported by the PCF, described in clause 6.1.3.18 in TS 23.503 [9] are extended to report \"Change of PDUID\" to the 5G DDNMF.\nThe Discovery Reporting procedure can be used by the \"monitoring UE\" (in Model A) and Discoverer UE (in Model B) to request the 5G DDNMF to resolve a matched ProSe Discovery Code(s) (ProSe Application Code for open discovery and ProSe Restricted Code for restricted discovery) and obtain the corresponding ProSe Application ID(s) or RPAUID and additional information, e.g. metadata.\nThe signalling procedures for the \"monitoring UE\" (in Model A) is specified in TS 23.303 [3] clause 5.3.4 and the signalling procedures for the Discoverer UE (in Model B) is specified in TS 23.303 [3] clause 5.3.4A, with the following modifications:\n-\tthe 5G DDNMF takes the role of \"ProSe Function\" in the procedure;\n-\tthe HSS is replaced by UDM;\n-\tcorresponding 5GS identifiers replace the EPS identifiers, e.g. use SUPI instead of IMSI and use GPSI instead of MSISDN;\n-\tPC5_tech parameter is omitted and the intended PC5 radio technology is NR.\nWhen supported by the 5G DDNMF and the UE, the Announcing Alert procedure allows the 5G DDNMF to postpone the ProSe Restricted Code allocation, so that the announcing UE would be only triggered by this procedure to announce when the 5G DDNMF receives a Monitor Request from a UE in the vicinity of the announcing UE. This procedure is an optional step of the Discovery Request procedure defined in clause 6.3.1.4.\nThe signalling procedure of Announcing Alert Procedure is specified in TS 23.303 [3] clause 5.3.5, with the same modifications listed in clause 6.3.1.4.\nThe 5G DDNMF can at any time update/revoke a previously allocated ProSe Application Code, or Discovery Filters. The UE can decide at any time to stop announcing a ProSe Application Code or monitoring set of Discovery Filter(s). The Direct Discovery Update procedure as specified in TS 23.303 [3] clause 5.3.6A.1 allows both the 5G DDNMF and the UE to update or revoke the previously authorized discovery. In the defined signalling procedures, the 5G DDNMF(s) takes the role of the \"ProSe Function\".\nA user may decide at any time to change the discovery permissions relating to other users in a ProSe Application Server; then the corresponding ProSe Application Server triggers the procedure as specified in clause 5.3.6A.2 of TS 23.303 [3] towards the affected 5G DDNMF(s) to update/revoke the discovery permissions. In the defined signalling procedures, the 5G DDNMF(s) takes the role of the \"ProSe Function\".\n",

The parameters contained in this message and the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID used for sending and receiving the message are described in clause 5.8.3.\nThe 5G ProSe Remote UE selects the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay based on the information received in step 1.\nNOTE:\tAccess Stratum layer information used for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay selection is specified in RAN specifications.\nDepicted in Figure 6.3.2.3.3-1 is the procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery with Model B.\nThe figure depicts a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery scenario, where the UE (User Equipment) is connected to the network and communicates with the network through a relay. The figure illustrates the process of relay discovery, which is a crucial step in ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network. The figure shows the UE's connection to the network, the network's connection to the core network, and the relay's connection to the core network. The figure also includes a model B, which represents the relay's behavior in the scenario. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise representation of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery process.\nFigure 6.3.2.3.3-1: 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery with Model B\n1.\tThe 5G ProSe Remote UE sends a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Solicitation message. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Discovery Solicitation message contains the Type of Discovery Message, Discoverer Info, RSC and optionally Target Info and is send using the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID as described in clause 5.8.3. The 5G ProSe Remote UE discovering a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay sends a solicitation message with the RSC which is associated to the desired connectivity service. The RSC is based on the Policy/Parameters specified in clause 5.1.4.1.\nHow the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relays (1 to 3) determine the Destination Layer-2 ID for signalling reception is specified in clause 5.8.3. The Destination Layer-2 ID is configured with the UE(s) as specified in clause 5.1.4.1.\n2.\tIf the RSC contained in the solicitation message matches any of the (pre)configured RSC(s), as specified in clause 5.1.4.1, of a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, and the Target Info contained in the solicitation message, if any, matches the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relays (e.g. 1 and 2) respond to the 5G ProSe Remote UE with a UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Response message. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Response message contains the Type of Discovery Message, Discoveree Info and RSC and is sent using the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID as described in clause 5.8.3.\nFor 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall only respond to a matching RSC in the UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Solicitation message when the S-NSSAI associated with that RSC belongs to the Allowed NSSAI of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\nThe 5G ProSe Remote UE selects the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay based on the information received in step 2.\n5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery is applicable to both 5G ProSe Layer-3 and Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay Discovery for public safety use and commercial services. To perform 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery, the 5G ProSe End UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay are pre-configured or provisioned with the related information as described in clause 5.1.\nA Relay Service Code (RSC) is used in the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery, to indicate the connectivity service the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay provides to 5G ProSe End UEs. The RSCs are pre-configured or provisioned on the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay and the 5G ProSe End UE as defined in clause 5.1. The 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay and the 5G ProSe End UE are aware of whether a RSC is offering 5G ProSe Layer-2 or Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay service based on the UE-to-UE Relay Layer indicator as specified in clause 5.1. A 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay supporting multiple RSCs advertises the RSCs using multiple discovery messages, with one RSC per discovery message.\nDepicted in Figure 6.3.2.4.2-1 is the procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Discovery with Model A.\nThe figure depicts a relay discovery scenario in a 5G ProSe network, where a UE (User Equipment) sends a request to a relay for a specific UE-to-UE link. The figure illustrates the process of relay discovery, including the use of a model A to determine the best relay to forward the request. The figure also shows the steps involved in the relay discovery process, such as the UE sending a request to the relay, the relay sending a response, and the relay forwarding the request to the correct UE.\nFigure 6.3.2.4.2-1: 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery with Model A\n1.\tThe 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay has discovered other UEs in proximity (e.g. via a previous 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Communication procedures). The 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay obtains the User Info ID of other UEs in proximity per RSC.\n2.\tThe 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay sends a UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Announcement message. The UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Announcement message contains the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay, RSC and list of User Info ID of the 5G ProSe End UEs supporting the RSC. The UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Announcement message is sent using the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID as described in clause 5.8.4.\nThe 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay shall only announce User Info IDs of other UEs in proximity that did not include an Announce Prohibited Indication when they were previously discovered.\nNOTE:\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay announces User Info IDs of other UEs in proximity only if their PC5 signal strength measured by the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay is above configured signal strength threshold as specified in TS 38.331 [16].\nA 5G ProSe End UE monitors announcement messages from a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay. The 5G ProSe End UEs determine the Destination Layer-2 ID for signalling reception as specified in clause 5.1.\nDepicted in Figure 6.3.2.4.3-1 is the procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery with Model B.\nThe figure depicts a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay discovery scenario, where the UE (User Equipment) is the source of the signal and the ProSe UE (Proactive User Equipment) is the destination. The figure illustrates the process of relay discovery, which is a key component in 5G network architecture. The ProSe UE is responsible for relaying the signal to the ProSe UE-to-UE relay, which is the next hop in the network. The figure also includes a model B relay discovery protocol, which is a simplified version of the ProSe protocol. The figure is important for understanding the architecture of 5G networks and the role of ProSe in the network.\nFigure 6.3.2.4.3-1: 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery with Model B\n1.\tThe discoverer 5G ProSe End UE (UE-1) sends a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Solicitation message.

If a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay receives a Relay Discovery Soliciation message with an Announce Prohibited Indication it does not consider the 5G ProSe End UE as discovered during this procedure for inclusion in 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery with Model A, see clause 6.3.2.4.2, step 1.\n2.\tIf the RSC contained in the solicitation message matches any of the (pre)configured RSC(s), as specified in clause 5.1.5.1, of a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay, the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay sends a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Solicitation message. The 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Solicitation message contains the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of the discoverer 5G ProSe End UE (UE-1), User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, RSC and User Info ID of the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE (UE-2) and is sent using the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID as described in clause 5.8.4.\nA 5G ProSe End UE determines the Destination Layer-2 ID for signalling reception as specified in clause 5.1.\n3.\tIf the RSC contained in the solicitation message matches any of the (pre)configured RSC(s), as specified in clause 5.1.5.1, of the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE (UE-2), and the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE (UE-2) matches the User Info ID of the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE (UE-2) contained in the solicitation message, then the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE (UE-2) responds to the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay with a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Response message. The 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Response message contains the Type of Discovery Message, RSC, User Info ID of the discoverer 5G ProSe End UE (UE-1) and User Info ID of discoveree 5G ProSe End UE (UE-2) and is sent using the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID as described in clause 5.8.4.

If the 5G ProSe End UE receives the Layer-2 ID of the candidate 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay in a Link Modification Request message, it may set the Layer-2 ID of the candidate 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay as the Destination Layer-2 ID.\nNOTE:\tThe User Info ID of the candidate 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay and the User Info ID of the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE can be distinguished by the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay as different IEs in the message.\n-\tStep 2 and step 3 are skipped because the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE User Info ID is absent, and the User Info ID of the candidate 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay in the received 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Solicitation message matches that of the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay.\n-\tStep 4: If a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay matches the User Info ID of a candidate 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay received in the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Solicitation then it sends the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay Discovery Response (with the RSC received in step 1) and does not include the User Info ID of the discoveree 5G ProSe End UE.\n",

This enables the AS layer to maintain the PC5 Link Identifier together with the PC5 unicast link related information.\nTwo UEs may negotiate the PC5 DRX configuration in the AS layer and the PC5 DRX parameter values can be configured per pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs in the AS layer.\n6.\tProSe data is transmitted over the established unicast link as below:\nThe PC5 Link Identifier and PFI are provided to the AS layer, together with the ProSe data.\nOptionally in addition, the Layer-2 ID information (i.e. source Layer-2 ID and destination Layer-2 ID) is provided to the AS layer.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to UE implementation to provide the Layer-2 ID information to the AS layer.\nUE-1 sends the ProSe data using the source Layer-2 ID (i.e. UE-1's Layer-2 ID for this unicast link) and the destination Layer-2 ID (i.e. the peer UE's Layer-2 ID for this unicast link).\nNOTE 5:\tPC5 unicast link is bi-directional, therefore the peer UE of UE-1 can send the ProSe data to UE-1 over the unicast link with UE-1.\nFigure 6.4.3.2-1 shows the link identifier update procedure for a unicast link. When privacy requirements are configured for a ProSe Identifier associated with the unicast link, identifiers used for the unicast mode of 5G ProSe communication over PC5 reference point (e.g. Application Layer ID, Source Layer-2 ID and IP address/prefix) shall be changed over time as specified in clauses 5.8.2.1 and 5.8.2.4. A UE may decide to change the identifiers for other reasons, e.g. application layer requirement. This procedure is used to update and exchange new identifiers between the source and the peer UEs for a unicast link before using the new identifiers, to prevent service interruptions. When there are privacy requirements as indicated above, this procedure is executed over a security protected unicast link.\nIf a UE has multiple unicast links using the same Application Layer IDs or Layer-2 IDs, the UE needs to perform the link identifier update procedure over each of the unicast links.\nThe figure depicts the update procedure for link identifiers in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps involved in updating the link identifier, including the process of updating the link identifier, updating the link identifier, and updating the link identifier.\nFigure 6.4.3.2-1: Link identifier update procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.4.3.1.\n1.\tUE-1 decides to change its identifier(s), e.g. due to the Application Layer ID change or upon expiry of a timer. UE-1 generates its new Layer-2 ID and sends a Link Identifier Update Request message to UE-2 using the old identifiers.\nThe Link Identifier Update Request message includes the new identifier(s) to use (including the new Layer-2 ID, Security Information, optionally the new Application Layer ID and optionally new IP address/prefix if IP communication is used). The new identifier(s) shall be cyphered to protect privacy if security is configured for the unicast link. After sending the Link Identifier Update Request message, if the UE-1 has data to send, UE-1 keeps sending data traffic to UE-2 with the old identifiers until UE-1 sends the Link Identifier Update Ack message to UE-2.\nNOTE 1:\tThe timer is running on per Source Layer-2 ID.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen one of the two UEs acts as IPv6 router as described in clause 5.5.1.1 and the IP address/prefix also needs to be changed, the corresponding address configuration procedure would be carried out after the Link Identifier update procedure.\n2.\tUpon reception of the Link Identifier Update Request message, UE-2 changes its identifier(s). UE-2 responds with a Link Identifier Update Response message which includes the new identifier(s) to use (including the new Layer-2 ID, Security Information, optionally the new Application Layer ID and optionally a new IP address/prefix if IP communication is used). The new identifier(s) shall be cyphered to protect privacy if security is configured for the unicast link. The Link Identifier Update Response message is sent using the old identifiers. UE-2 continues to receive traffic with the old Layer-2 ID from UE-1 until UE-2 receives traffic with the new Layer-2 ID from UE-1. After sending the Link Identifier Update Response message, UE-2 keeps sending data traffic to UE-1 with the old identifier, if UE-2 has data to send, until UE-2 receives the Link Identifier Update Ack message from UE-1.\n3.\tUpon reception of the Link Identifier Update Response message, UE-1 responds with a Link Identifier Update Ack message. The Link Identifier Update Ack message includes the new identifier(s) from UE-2, as received on the Link Identifier Update Response message. The Link Identifier Update Ack message is sent using the old identifiers. UE-1 continues to receive traffic with the old Layer-2 ID from UE-2 until UE-1 receives traffic with the new Layer-2 ID from UE-2.\n4.\tThe ProSe layer of UE-1 passes the PC5 Link Identifier for the unicast link and the updated Layer-2 IDs (i.e. new Layer-2 ID for UE-1 for the source and new Layer-2 ID of UE-2 for the destination) down to the AS layer. This enables the AS layer to update the provided Layer-2 IDs for the unicast link.\nUE-1 starts using its new identifiers and UE-2's new identifiers for this unicast link.\n5.\tUpon reception of the Link Identifier Update Ack message, the ProSe layer of UE-2 passes the PC5 Link Identifier for the unicast link and the updated Layer-2 IDs (i.e. new Layer-2 ID of UE-2 for the source and new Layer-2 ID for UE-1 for the destination) down to the AS layer. This enables the AS layer to update the provided Layer-2 IDs for the unicast link.\nUE-2 starts using its new identifiers and UE-1's new identifiers for this unicast link.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Security Information in the above messages also needs to be updated at the same time as the Layer-2 IDs. This is defined in TS 33.503 [29].\nFigure 6.4.3.3-1 shows the layer-2 link release procedure over PC5 reference point.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step guide for releasing a Layer-2 link in a network. It illustrates the process of releasing a link from the switch to the network, including the steps of configuring the link, releasing the link, and ensuring network connectivity. The figure is crucial for network administrators and engineers to understand the release procedure and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.\nFigure 6.4.3.3-1: Layer-2 link release procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.4.3.1.\n1.\tUE-1 sends a Disconnect Request message to UE-2 in order to release the layer-2 link and deletes all context data associated with the layer-2 link. The Disconnect Request message includes Security Information.\n2.\tUpon reception of the Disconnect Request message, UE-2 shall respond with a Disconnect Response message and deletes all context data associated with the layer-2 link. The Disconnect Response message includes Security Information.\nThe ProSe layer of each UE informs the AS layer that the unicast link has been released. The ProSe layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate the released unicast link. This enables the AS layer to delete the context related to the released unicast link.\nNOTE:\tThe Security Information in the above messages is defined in TS 33.503 [29].\nFigure 6.4.3.4-1 shows the layer-2 link modification procedure for a unicast link. This procedure is used to:\n-\tadd new PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link.\n-\tThis covers the case for adding new PC5 QoS Flow(s) to the existing ProSe service(s) as well as the case for adding new PC5 QoS Flow(s) to new ProSe service(s).\n-\tmodify existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link.\n-\tThis covers the case for modifying the PC5 QoS parameters for existing PC5 QoS Flow(s).\n-\tThis also covers the case for removing the associated ProSe service(s) from existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) as well as the case for associating new ProSe service(s) with existing PC5 QoS Flow(s).\n-\tremove existing PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step process for modifying a Layer-2 link in a 5G network. It illustrates the various steps involved in modifying the link, such as changing the routing table, changing the IP address, and modifying the MAC address. The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different components and their functions.\nFigure 6.4.3.4-1: Layer-2 link modification procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.4.3.1.\n1.\tThe ProSe application layer in UE-1 provides application information for PC5 unicast communication. The application information includes the ProSe Service Info and the initiating UE's Application Layer ID. The target UE's Application Layer ID may be included in the application information. If UE-1 decides to reuse the existing PC5 unicast link as specified in clause 5.3.4, so decides to modify the unicast link established with UE-2, UE-1 sends a Link Modification Request to UE-2.\nThe Link Modification Request message includes:\na)\tTo add new PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link:\n-\tQoS Info: the information about PC5 QoS Flow(s) to be added. For each PC5 QoS Flow, the PFI, the corresponding PC5 QoS parameters (i.e. PQI and conditionally other parameters such as MFBR/GFBR, etc.) and optionally the associated ProSe identifier(s).\n-\tOptional PC5 QoS Rule(s).\nb)\tTo modify PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link:\n-\tQoS Info: the information about PC5 QoS Flow(s) to be modified.

For each PC5 QoS Flow, the PFI, the corresponding PC5 QoS parameters (i.e. PQI and conditionally other parameters such as MFBR/GFBR, etc.) and optionally the associated ProSe identifier(s).\n-\tOptional PC5 QoS Rule(s).\nThe ProSe layer of each UE provides information about the unicast link modification to the AS layer. This enables the AS layer to update the context related to the modified unicast link.\nThe PC5 Signalling Protocol shall support keep-alive functionality that is used to detect if a particular PC5 unicast link is still valid. Either side of the PC5 unicast link can initiate the layer-2 link maintenance procedure (i.e. keep-alive procedure), based on for example triggers from the AS layer or internal timers. The UEs shall minimize the keep-alive signalling, e.g. cancel the procedure if data are successfully received over the PC5 unicast link.\nThe figure depicts a layer-2 link maintenance procedure, illustrating the steps taken to ensure the proper functioning of a network link. The diagram shows the various components involved in the maintenance process, such as the switch, router, and network interface controller (NIC). The maintenance procedure includes checking the link status, performing a fault-tolerant repair, and ensuring the link is back in service. This figure is crucial for network administrators to understand the steps required to maintain and troubleshoot network links.\nFigure 6.4.3.5-1: Layer-2 link maintenance procedure\n0.\tUE-1 and UE-2 have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.4.3.1.\n1.\tBased on trigger conditions, UE-1 sends a Keep-alive message to UE-2 in order to determine the status of the PC5 unicast link.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is left to Stage 3 to determine the exact triggers for the keep-alive messages. For example, the trigger can be based on a timer associated with the Layer-2 link. The timer can be reset with a successful reception event defined by TS 38.300 [12].\n2.\tUpon reception of the Keep-alive message, UE-2 responds with a Keep-alive Ack message.\nThe UE initiating the keep-alive procedure shall determine the follow-up actions based on the result of the signalling, e.g. proceed with implicit layer-2 link release.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is left to Stage 3 to determine the follow-up actions. For example, a successful reception event can also cancel the layer-2 link release if received in time.\nThe Layer-2 link procedures over PC5 reference point for unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication as depicted from clause 6.4.3.1 to clause 6.4.3.5 can be used for the PC5 reference point between 5G ProSe Remote UE and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, with the following differences and clarifications:\n-\tThe Layer-2 link modification procedure is applicable to ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, other procedures are applicable to both ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.\n-\tThe UE oriented Layer-2 link establishment is used with UE-1 representing the 5G ProSe Remote UE and UE-2 representing the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. For other procedures either UE-1 represents the 5G ProSe Remote UE and UE-2 represents the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, or UE-1 represents the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and UE-2 represents the 5G ProSe Remote UE. I.e. the Layer-2 link establishment is initiated by the 5G ProSe Remote UE, while other procedures may be initiated either by the 5G ProSe Remote UE or by the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\nFor the UE oriented Layer-2 link establishment as described in the clause 6.4.3.1,\n-\tIn step 1, the 5G ProSe Remote UE determines the destination Layer-2 ID for PC5 unicast link establishment based on the unicast source Layer-2 ID of the selected 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay (as specified in clause 5.8.3) during UE-to-Network Relay discovery as specified in clause 6.3.2.3.\n-\tIn step 2, 5G ProSe Remote UE (UE-1) determines the Relay Service Code to be used. The Relay Service Code to be used is selected from the received Relay Service Code(s) during UE-to-Network Relay discovery as specified in clause 6.3.2.3.\n-\tIn step 3, 5G ProSe Remote UE (UE-1) sends a unicast Direct Communication Request message to the selected 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. The destination Layer-2 ID used to send the Direct Communication Request message shall be unicast Layer-2 ID as determined in step 1. The Direct Communication Request message includes:\n-\tSource User Info: the identity of the Remote UE requesting relay operation (i.e. User Info ID).\nNOTE 1:\tThe details of which additional identity/identities of the Remote UE to be included during Layer-2 link establishment are specified in TS 33.503 [29].\n-\tTarget User Info: the identity of the UE-to-Network Relay provided to the 5G ProSe Remote UE during UE-to-Network Relay Discovery procedure (i.e. User Info ID).\n-\tRelay Service Code: indicates the connectivity service (which may be non-emergency or emergency) provided by the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay as requested by the 5G ProSe Remote UE.\n-\tSecurity Information: the information for the establishment of security.\nNOTE 2:\tPC5 link for emergency RSC can be established with or without PC5 security; how to establish PC5 security link for emergency service is specified in TS 33.503 [29].\n-\tIn step 4 and step 5, step 4a and step 5a are performed if the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay's identity matches the Target User Info and the Relay Service Code is one of the Relay Service Codes included during UE-to-Network Relay discovery as specified in clause 6.3.2.3. The Source User Info in the Direct Communication Accept message is the identity of the UE-to-Network Relay (i.e. User Info ID). In the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, the Remote UE does not send the IP Address Configuration, Link-Local IPv6 Address and QoS Info to the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and the Direct Communication Accept message does not include IP Address Configuration, Link-Local IPv6 Address and QoS Info. In the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, the Direct Communication Accept message does not include the IP Address Configuration indicating the value \"address allocation not supported\".\n-\tIn the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, step 6 is not performed.\nFor the link identifier update as described in the clause 6.4.3.2,\n-\tApplication Layer ID is replaced by User Info ID.\n-\tIn the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, the changed identifiers do not include IP address/prefix.\nFor the Layer-2 link release as described in the clause 6.4.3.3,\n-\tIn step1, if the Layer-2 link release procedure is initiated by the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, the Disconnect Request message may indicate the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is temporarily not available as described in clause 5.12.\nNOTE 3:\tThe form of the temporarily not available indication will be determined by stage 3.\n-\tIf the service authorization for acting as a 5G ProSe Remote UE or as a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is revoked, the 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay should initiate the release of the layer-2 link that the revoked authorization affects.\n-\tA 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE or a 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay initiates the release of the layer-2 link upon receiving an indication from its AS layer to trigger PC5 unicast link release as specified in TS 38.331 [16].\nNOTE 4:\tThe timing to initiates layer-2 link release is up to UE implementation.\nA 5G ProSe Remote UE and a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall set up a separate PC5 unicast links if an existing unicast link(s) was established with a different Relay Service Code or without a Relay Service Code.\nNOTE 5:\tA single PC5 unicast link is established between a 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and a 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE, as specified in TS 38.300 [12], for supporting PDU sessions of the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE.\nEach PC5 unicast link for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is associated with a Unicast Link Profile, which includes:\n-\tUser Info ID and Layer-2 ID of 5G ProSe Remote UE;

PDU Session(s) supporting 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall only be used for 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE(s) relay traffic.\nThe PLMN serving the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and the PLMN to which the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE registers can be the same PLMN or two different PLMNs.\nThe figure depicts a 5G ProSe communication system, where the UE-to-Network relay is not using N3IWF (Non-3GPP Interference Warning Function). This system utilizes 5G ProSe Layer-3 communication, which is a new technology designed to improve the performance of 5G networks. The figure shows the communication path between the UE and the network, highlighting the use of 5G ProSe Layer-3 communication and the absence of N3IWF.\nFigure 6.5.1.1-1: 5G ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF\n1.\tService authorization and provisioning are performed for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay (step 1a) and 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE (step 1b) as described in clause 6.2.\n2.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay may establish a PDU Session for relaying. In the case of IPv6, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay obtains the IPv6 prefix via prefix delegation function from the network as defined in TS 23.501 [4].\nNOTE 1:\t5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay can establish a PDU Session for any Relay Service Code it supports before the connection is established with the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE.\n3.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE performs discovery of a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay as described in clause 6.3.2.3. As part of the discovery procedure the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE learns about the connectivity service the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay provides.\n4.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE selects a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and establishes a connection for unicast mode communication as described in clause 6.4.3.6. If there is no PDU Session associated with the Relay Service Code or a new PDU Session for relaying is needed, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay initiates a new PDU Session establishment procedure for relaying before completing the PC5 connection establishment.\nWhen the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE sends the Direct Communication Request message including the dedicated emergency RSC, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay sets up an emergency PDU session for relaying the emergency service if there is not an emergency PDU Session established in step 2.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay has its own emergency service ongoing, how to handle the conflict case is specified in clause 5.4.4.3.\nThe network decides that the PDU Session to be established is for relay traffic and then generates the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters to 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with relay consideration and can initiate the setup of QoS flows as specified in clause 5.6.2.1. The Remote UE can also initiate the setup of QoS flows by providing PC5 QoS info and (optionally) PC5 QoS rule(s) to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay during connection setup, according to the procedure as specified in clause 5.6.2.1.\nThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay determines the PDU Session type for relaying as specified in clause 5.4.1.1.\nAccording to the PDU Session Type for relaying, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs relaying function at the corresponding layer as follows:\n-\tWhen the IP type PDU Session is used for IP traffic over PC5 reference point, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay acts as an IP router. For IPv4, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs IPv4 NAT between IPv4 addresses assigned to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and the IPv4 address assigned to the PDU Session used for the relay traffic.\n-\tWhen the Ethernet type PDU Session is used for Ethernet traffic over PC5 reference point, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay acts as an Ethernet switch.\n-\tWhen the Unstructured type PDU Session is used for Unstructured traffic over PC5 reference point, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs traffic relaying based on a mapping between the PC5 Link Identifier and the PDU Session ID and a mapping between PFI for PC5 Layer-2 link and the QFI for the PDU Session. These mappings are created when the Unstructured type PDU Session is established for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE.\n-\tWhen the IP type PDU Session is used for Ethernet or Unstructured traffic over PC5 reference point, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay uses IP tunneling. For this IP tunnelling, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay locally assigns an IP address/prefix for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and uses it on the Uu reference point to encapsulate and decapsulate the uplink and downlink traffic for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE. The tunnelled traffic over Uu reference point is transported over the PC5 reference point as Ethernet or Unstructured traffic.\n5.\tFor IP PDU Session Type and IP traffic over PC5 reference point, IPv6 prefix or IPv4 address (including NAT case) is allocated for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE as defined in clause 5.5.1.3.\n6.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE may provide PC5 QoS Info and PC5 QoS rule(s) to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay using Layer-2 link modification procedure as specified in clause 6.4.3.4. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay generates the Packet Filters used over Uu interface based on the received PC5 QoS Info and QoS Rule(s) as described in clause 5.6.2.1 and may perform the UE requested PDU Session Modification as defined in TS 23.502 [5] clause 4.3.3 to setup a new QoS Flow or bind the traffic to an existing QoS Flow.\nFrom this point the uplink and downlink relaying can start. For downlink traffic forwarding, the PC5 QoS Rule is used to map the downlink packet to the PC5 QoS Flow. For uplink traffic forwarding, the 5G QoS Rule is used to map the uplink packet to the Uu QoS Flow.\n7.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall send a Remote UE Report (Remote User ID, Remote UE info) message to the SMF for the PDU Session associated with the relay. The Remote User ID, as defined in TS 33.503 [29], is an identity of the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE user that was successfully connected in step 4. The Remote UE info is used to assist identifying the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE in the 5GC. For IP PDU Session Type, the Remote UE info is Remote UE IP info. For Ethernet PDU Session Type, the Remote UE info is Remote UE MAC address which is detected by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay. For Unstructured PDU Session Type, the Remote UE info is not included. The SMF stores the Remote User IDs and the related Remote UE info in the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay's SM context for this PDU Session associated with the relay.\nThe Remote UE Report is N1 SM NAS message sent with the PDU Session ID to the AMF, in turn delivered to the SMF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe privacy protection for Remote User ID is specified in TS 33.503 [29].\nFor IP info the following principles apply:\n-\tfor IPv4, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall report TCP/UDP port ranges assigned to individual 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE(s) (along with the Remote User ID);\n-\tfor IPv6, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall report IPv6 prefix(es) assigned to individual 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE(s) (along with the Remote User ID).\nIf the PDU Session for relaying is released by the UE-to-Network Relay or the network as described in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [5], the UE-to-Network Relay should initiate the release of the layer-2 links associated with the released PDU Session using the procedure defined in clause 6.4.3.3.\nThe PDU Session(s) used for relaying should be released as described in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [5] (e.g. by 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay), if the service authorization for acting as a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay in the serving PLMN is revoked.\nThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall send the Remote UE Report message when the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE disconnects from the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay (e.g. upon explicit layer-2 link release or based on the absence of keep alive messages over PC5) to inform the SMF that the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE(s) have left.\nNOTE 4:\tIn order for the SMF to have the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE(s) information, the HPLMN and the VPLMN where the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay is authorised to operate, needs to support the transfer of the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE related parameters if the SMF is in the HPLMN.\nIt is up to 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay implementation how PDU Session(s) used for relaying are released or QoS Flow(s) used for relaying are removed by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay when 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE(s) disconnect from the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.\nIn order to relay 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's traffic via N3IWF (see clause 6.5.1.2.2 for N3IWF selection), the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay needs suitable ProSe Policies configured for establishing a PDU Session associated with a UPF that conveys the traffic towards the N3IWF. A 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay registers to the network as specified in clause 6.5.1.1. Based on configuration and authorization, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay is provisioned with PDU Session parameters in the ProSe Policy allowing the access to the N3IWF. When the corresponding PDU Session is established, the 5GS, e.g. SMF, based on the parameters (i.e. DNN, S-NSSAI) selects the UPF that ensures the connection to the N3IWF. The UPF for the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and the N3IWF may be collocated.\nA 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with a PDU Session providing access via N3IWF may also have other PDU Sessions for supporting access from the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE without going through a N3IWF.\nNOTE 1:\tWhether a different PDU Sessions need to be established to serve traffics for Layer-3 Remote UE with or without going through a N3IWF is determined by Layer-3 Relay UE per TS 23.503 [9].\nThe figure depicts a connection establishment over 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF support, illustrating the process of establishing a connection between a UE and a network relay. The figure shows the UE, network relay, and N3IWF components, highlighting the importance of these components in ensuring reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 6.5.1.2.1-1: Connection establishment over 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF support\n1.\t5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs Registration procedures and obtains the ProSe Policy that corresponds to the operation supporting the access to N3IWF. The ProSe Policy includes the RSC and PDU Session parameters allowing the access to the N3IWF.\nThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE is configured with the corresponding ProSe Policy and URSP rules. The URSP policy indicates if a particular service needs to be accessed within a PDU Session and thus should use a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF support as described in clause 6.5.4.\n2-4.\tA 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE follow the procedures described in steps 3-5 in clause 6.5.1.1 using the RSC configured for making the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE access to 5GC via N3IWF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe services requiring the access via N3IWF can be configured with the RSC(s) that can be served by the same 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\n5.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE that connects to a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF support selects an N3IWF and determines the N3IWF IP address. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE follows the N3IWF selection procedure as described in clause 6.5.1.2.2.\n6.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE establishes a signalling IPsec tunnel using IKE procedures with a N3IWF and performs NAS Registration as shown in Figure 4.12.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 [5]. After the IPSec tunnel is established, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE can perform any of the NAS procedures (incl. PDU Session establishment for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay PDU Sessions) as specified in clause 4.12 of TS 23.502 [5].\n7.\tAfter the PDU session(s) and associated QoS Flows are established in the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's 5GC, the N3IWF determines the number of IPsec Child SA(s) that is needed and initiates the creation of the Child SA(s) as specified in clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [5]. Once the Child SA(s) has been created the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE will have the mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec Child SA(s), the corresponding QoS and N3IWF IP address(es) and provides this information, if needed, to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay as specified in clause 5.6.2.2. If needed, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay performs the PDU Session Modification procedure to request QoS flow(s) configuration that maps to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE's Child SA(s).\nIKE keep alive(s) between the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and the N3IWF are used for detecting possible path failure. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE may change 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay(s) while maintain the session with the N3IWF when the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and the N3IWF support MOBIKE. This is negotiated between the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and the N3IWF as specified in TS 23.502 [5], clause 4.12.2.2). When IKE keep alive(s) are used, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE needs to keep the PC5 connection and 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay keeps the PDU Session.\nWhen 5G ProSe Remote UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the 5G ProSe Remote UE keeps the PC5 link. When the 5G ProSe Remote UE is in CM-IDLE state, it may either release the PC5 link for relaying or not.\nWhen the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE relays traffic over 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay that supports N3IWF, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE selects the N3IWF using the N3IWF selection procedure that is specified in clause 6.3.6.2 of TS 23.501 [4] for untrusted non-3GPP access with the following differences.\nTo support the N3IWF selection for 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE, a 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE is configured by HPLMN with N3IWF identifier configuration for 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE and 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay access node selection information as described in clause 5.1.4.1.\nWhen the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE decides to select an N3IWF in the HPLMN, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE uses the N3IWF identifier configuration for 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE, if configured, to find the IP address of the N3IWF in the HPLMN. Otherwise, 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE constructs N3IWF FQDN based on either the Tracking Area Identity FQDN or on Operator Identifier FQDN of the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay node selection information.\nTo assist the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE with N3IWF selection, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay supporting N3IWF access advertises the 5GS TAI corresponding to the serving cell, as defined in clause 5.8.3.2, in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery procedure as defined in clause 6.3.2.3.\nA 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE constructs the FQDN using either Tracking Area Identity FQDN or on Operator Identifier FQDN and selects the N3IWF using the procedures of N3IWF selection in clause 6.3.6.2 of TS 23.501 [4].\nWhen the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE relays traffic over 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay using N3IWF for emergency services, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE selects the N3IWF using the N3IWF selection procedure that is specified in clause 6.3.6.4.2 of TS 23.501 [4].\nWhen 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE changes from Direct Network Communication to Indirect Network Communication path, TS 23.502 [5] clause 4.9.2.2 applies after the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE establishes PC5 connection to the 5G Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.\nWhen 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE changes from Indirect Network Communication path to Direct Network Communication, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE follows TS 23.502 [5] clause 4.9.2.1.\nAdditional parameters announcement procedure outlined in figure 6.5.1.3-1 is used by a 5G ProSe Remote UE to request a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay to announce additional parameters (using Model A) as defined in clause 5.8.3.\nThe figure depicts an announcement procedure for additional parameters in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps taken by the network to inform users about the changes in the network parameters. The figure includes a flowchart and a list of steps, which are essential for ensuring that users are informed about any changes in the network's parameters.\nFigure 6.5.1.3-1: Additional parameters announcement procedure\n1.\t5G ProSe Remote UE has discovered a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and requires additional parameters.\n2.\tThe 5G ProSe Remote UE sends to the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay an Additional Parameters Announcement Request to obtain additional parameters.\n3.\tThe 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay acknowledges receipt of the request in step 2 with an Additional Parameters Announcement Response (Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh Timer). The Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh Timer (configurable in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay), is provided to the 5G ProSe Remote UE so that when this timer expires the 5G ProSe Remote UE repeats the Additional Parameters Announcement Request procedure if it still needs to obtain the additional parameters. If the 5G ProSe Remote UE does not initiate new Additional Parameters Announcement Request procedure when this Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh Timer expires and no other UE request additional parameters announcement before the Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh timer expires in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, then the relay shall stop announcing the addtional parameters.\n4.\tThe 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay announces the additional parameters by sending Relay Discovery Additional Information message as defined in clause 5.8.3. This is repeated periodically with a configurable frequency (normally higher than the one related to the Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh Timer) until there is no UE requesting to announce the additional parameters as determined by the Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh Timer running in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\nNOTE:\tBased on UE implementation, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay can send the Relay Discovery Additional Information message several times consecutively in step 4 if there are other 5G ProSe Remote UE(s) that have connected to the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay but not yet requested any additional parameters. This ensures the other 5G ProSe Remote UE(s) obtain such additional parameters without invoking any new request(s).\n5.\tThe 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay detects new or updated additional parameters.\n6.\tDetection of new or updated additional parameters in step 5 triggers the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay to announce the additional parameters by sending a Relay Discovery Additional Information Message immediately and to repeat it periodically with a configurable frequency as in step 4 until there are no UEs requesting to announce the additional parameters, i.e. until the Additional_Parameters_Announcement_Request_Refresh Timer expires in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\n",

If the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay in RRC_IDLE receives a connection request from the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE using emergency RSC, then 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay sets the establishment cause to \"emergency\".\nThe state of 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is controlled by NG-RAN with the following:\n-\tIf any 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE connected to the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Connected state, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay shall remain CM-CONNECTED state with RRC Connected state unless the network needs to release the connection.\n-\tIf all 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UEs connected to the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay enter CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay may enter CM-IDLE state or CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, or may remain CM-CONNECTED with RRC Connected state.\nWhen 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE keep the PC5 link. When the 5G ProSe Remote UE is in CM-IDLE state, it may either release the PC5 link for relaying or not.\nFor paging a 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE, it follows the principles and procedures defined in TS 23.501 [4] and TS 23.502 [5] and the paging message delivery from NG-RAN to 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE is specified in TS 38.300 [12].\nThe figure depicts a connection setup for a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 UE-to-Network relay, illustrating the process of establishing a connection between the UE and the network. The figure shows the UE connected to the network via a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 relay, which is a type of 5G relay node. The connection is established using a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 UE-to-Network relay, which is a type of 5G relay node. The figure also shows the connection setup for a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 UE-to-Network relay, which is a type of 5G relay node. The connection is established using a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 UE-to-Network relay, which is a type of 5G relay node. The figure also shows the connection setup for a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 UE-to-Network relay, which is a type of 5G relay node. The connection is established using a 5G ProSe L-Ayer-2 UE-to-Network relay, which is a type of 5G relay node.\nFigure 6.5.2.2-1: Connection Establishment for 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay\n0.\tIf in coverage, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay may independently perform the initial registration to the network according to registration procedures in TS 23.502 [5].\n1.\tIf in coverage, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay independently get the service authorization for 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay operation from the network. Service authorization and parameters provisioning for 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay operation are performed for the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE as specified in clause 5.1.4.\nIf the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE is \"not served by NG-RAN\", the pre-configured parameters are used and the service authorization and parameters may be updated after step 6.\nIf the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE has not performed Initial Registration, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE may perform the Initial Registration in step 6.\n2.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay perform 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery and selection, as specified in clause 6.3.2.3.\n3.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE initiates a one-to-one communication connection with the selected 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay over PC5 using the procedure as described in clause 6.4.3.\n4.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE establishes an RRC Connection with the same NG-RAN serving the selected 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, specified in TS 38.300 [12]. The 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE sets the RRC Establishment Cause as defined in TS 38.331 [16].\n5.\tDuring step 4, if the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay is in CM_IDLE state and receives a trigger from the AS layer to enter CM-CONNECTED state due to Remote UE's AS layer connection set up with the NG-RAN, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay performs Service Request procedure in the clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\n6.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE sends a NAS message to the serving AMF. The NAS message is encapsulated in an Uu RRC message that is sent over PC5 to the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay forwards the Uu RRC message to the NG-RAN specified in TS 38.300 [12]. NG-RAN selects the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE's serving AMF and forwards the NAS message to this AMF.\nIf 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE has not performed the initial registration, the NAS message is an initial Registration message. Otherwise, the NAS message is either a service request message, or a mobility or periodic Registration message taking into account the TAI in the RRC container received from the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay during Relay Discovery (see clause 5.8.3.3) or PC5-RRC message, as specified in TS 38.300 [12].\n7.\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE may trigger the PDU Session Establishment procedure as defined in clause 4.3.2.2 of TS 23.502 [5].\n8.\tThe data is transferred between the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and UPF via the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and NG-RAN. The 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay forwards all the data messages between the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE and NG-RAN, as specified in TS 38.300 [12].\nXn based (as defined in clause 4.9.1.2 of TS 23.502 [5]) and N2 based (as defined in clause 4.9.1.3 of TS 23.502 [5]) Handover procedure is used for inter-gNB indirect-to-direct and inter-gNB direct-to-indirect path switching for 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_CONNECTED state.\nEditor's note:\tMobility of 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE between Direct and Indirect Network communication path will be defined by RAN WGs and alignment work (if any) will be made by SA2 based on RAN WGs conclusions.\n",

UE1 and UE-to-UE Relay start using the new Layer-2 IDs and new security information for PC5 communication. UE1 starts using its new IP address for IP data exchange with UE2.\nFigure 6.7.1.3-1 shows the Layer-2 link release procedure via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for releasing a Layer-2 link via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay, illustrating the communication process between the UE and the relay.\nFigure 6.7.1.3-1: Layer-2 Link Release procedure via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay\n0.\tThe source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay and the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE have a unicast link established as described in clause 6.7.1.1.\n1.\tThe source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE sends a Disconnect Request message to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay in order to release the layer-2 link and deletes all context data associated with the layer-2 link.\n2.\tUpon reception of the Disconnect Request message, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay shall respond with a Disconnect Response and deletes all context data associated with the layer-2 link.\n3a.\tUpon reception of the Disconnect Request message, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay sends a Disconnect Request message to the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE(s), which has a unicast link for the communication with the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE if there are no other UEs using the layer-2 link.\n4a.\tUpon reception of the Disconnect Request message, the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE shall respond with a Disconnect Response message.\n3b.\tUpon reception of the Disconnect Request message, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay sends a Link Modification Request message to the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE(s), which has a unicast link for the communication with the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE if there are other UEs using the layer-2 link in order to release the PC5 QoS Flow(s) and deletes the context data associated with the PC5 QoS Flow(s).\n4b.\tUpon reception of the Link Modification Request message, the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE shall respond with a Link Modification Accept message and deletes the context data associated with the PC5 QoS Flow(s) used for the communication with the source 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE.\nThe ProSe layer of the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay and the target 5G ProSe Layer-3 End UE provides information about the unicast link modification to the AS layer, which enables the AS layer to update the context related to the modified unicast link.\nFigure 6.7.1.4-1 shows the Layer-2 link modification procedure via Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay. This procedure is used to add/modify/remove PC5 QoS Flow(s) in the existing PC5 unicast link as described in clause 6.4.3.7.3.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for modifying a Layer-2 link in a 5G network.
