                            "text_content": "This operation is invoked by MnS consumers to request a MnS producer to create a (single) managed object instance on the MnS producer.\nThe \"managedObjectClass\" parameter in the request specifies the class name and the \"managedObjectInstance\" parameter the instance name of the object to be created. Both parameters shall be included in the request.\nThe MnS consumer shall generate the instance name by first assigning a value to the naming attribute of the new instance, and then constructing a DN according to TS 32.300 [25].\nThe MnS consumer shall provide in \"attributeListIn\" none, some or all values for the attributes specified by the managed object class definition of the class to be created. The MnS producer shall not update attribute values or remove attribute values, that are provided in the request, before creating the object and returning the \"createMOI\" response.\nThe properties of an attribute determine if attribute values shall, shall not or may be provided in the \"createMOI\" request. If no value is provided and a default value is specified for the attribute, the MnS producer shall set the attribute value to the default value. For further information on attribute properties and their impact on the presence or absence of attribute values in object creation requests and MnS producer behaviour, see TS 32.156 [x], clause 5.2.1 and annex B.\nWhen the MnS producer assigns values, that are not known to the MnS consumer, to one or more attributes for which no value is included in the \"createMOI\" request, the MnS producer shall include \"attributeListOut\" in the \"createMOI\" response, otherwise \"attributeListOut\" may be omitted.\nIn case of a successful operation, the object shall be created immediately upon reception of the \"createMOI\" request, and the \"createMOI\" response shall be returned immediately after the creation of the object. The MnS producer shall not wait with the creation of the object or returning the response until some other potentially long-lasting process or activity, that might be triggered by the reception of the request or the creation of the object, has completed.\nOnly objects, whose parent exists, can be created (directly under that parent). The MnS producer shall consider an attempt to create an object whose parent object does not exist as an error.\nThe model state after applying the \"createMOI\" request shall fulfill all model constraints such as cardinality, multiplicity, allowed values, or data types, otherwise the operation shall fail.\nNote that stage 3 protocols may represent missing values for attributes, that are defined by the object class, in the \"createMOI\" request in different ways. For some protocols just the attribute name may be present, without an attribute value. For other protocols, the complete attribute name/value pair may be absent.\nSome stage 3 protocols do not support returning \"attributeListOut\". In this case, the MnS producer shall not modify the attribute list provided in the request before creating the object. If required by TS 32.156 [x], clause 5.2.1 and annex B, the MnS producer shall assign default values to attributes only after returning the \"createMOI\" response. Attribute value change notifications may be used to notify MnS consumers about the changes. Only default values, that have a specific definitive value may be assigned upon object creation. This is because the MnS consumer knows the MnS producer will assign this value when required according to TS 32.156 [x], clause 5.2.1 and annex B. Default values that are determined by the MnS producer based on standardized or proprietary selection methods are typically not known to MnS consumers.\n\n\nIn case of success, the ManagedEntity instance has been created with the supplied DN. In case of failure, indication of the failure is provided in the Output parameters.\nThis operation is invoked by MnS consumer to request the retrieval of management information (Managed Object attribute names and values) from the MIB maintained by MnS producer. One or several Managed Objects may be retrieved - based on the containment hierarchy.\nA SS may choose to split this operation in several operations (e.g. operations to get \"handlers\" or \"iterators\" to Managed Objects fulfilling the scope/filter criteria and other operations to retrieve attribute names/values from these \"handlers\").\n\n\nIn case of success, all of the ManagedEntity instances selected for retrieval are returned. In case of failure, a specified or unspecified reason may be provided in the Output parameters.\nThis operation is invoked by MnS consumers to request a MnS producer to modify one or more attributes of one or more managed objects on that MnS producer. More specifically, this operation allows to modify (replace, add, remove) complete attributes, attribute fields and attribute elements.\nThe selection of the objects to be modified is achieved with the parameters \"baseObjectInstance\", \"scopeType\", \"scopeLevel\" and \"filter\". If no \"scopeType\" is specified, the value defaults to \"BASE_ONLY\". Also, when no scoping is supported by the MnS producer, the value in \"baseObjectInstance\" identifies the object to be modified.\nA specific protocol solution may choose to split the selection of objects with scoping and filtering and the modification of the attributes of the selected objects into different operations.\nThe modifications to be applied to the selected objects are described in the \"modificationList\" parameter. This is a multi-valued parameter. Each value is a structure composed of \"modifyOperator\", \"nodeIdentifier\" and \"nodeValue\". The values of \"modificationList\" are ordered and shall be applied in the sequence as they occur in the list.\nThe parameter \"nodeIdentifier\" is used to identify the attribute, attribute field or attribute element to which the modification shall be applied. Attributes within one managed object can be identified with their name only. Unambiguous identification of attribute fields is not possible with their names only, because multiple attribute fields within one object may have the same name. Therefore, the identification needs to be based e.g. on global or local identifiers, or on the specification of a path allowing to navigate to the attribute field. Details are protocol specific.\nFor the modification of multi-valued attributes or multi-valued attribute fields two cases are distinguished:\n-\tAll values (elements) are considered as a single value. Elements cannot be addressed individually. If replaced, all existing elements are replaced with the new elements received in the modification request. If deleted, all existing elements are deleted. Addition of new elements to existing elements is not possible.\n-\tEach element can be addressed individually. Single elements can be added, replaced, and deleted.\nThe first case does not need any further considerations. The second case requires the identification of attribute elements and attribute field elements in the modification request, when replacing and deleting elements in ordered and unordered lists, and when adding elements to ordered lists. Details are not defined at stage 2. They are protocol specific and include identification by the element value, identification by a positional index or identification by an auxiliary key added at stage 3. Note that the concept of element keys is not defined at stage 2. Identification of elements may be provided also by the \"nodeIdentifier\" parameter.\nThe \"modifyOperator\" parameter specifies the modification to be applied to the value of the attribute or attribute field, or the attribute element or attribute field element identified by the \"nodeIdentifier\". The parameter can have the values \"replace\", \"add\", \"remove\" or \"setToDefault\":\n-\tFor \"replace\", the \"nodeValue\" specifies the attribute value, attribute field value, attribute element or attribute field element that shall replace the existing value.\n-\tFor \"add\", the \"nodeValue\" specifies the attribute value or attribute field value to be added to an attribute or attribute field without value, or the new attribute element or attribute field element to be added to a multi-valued attribute.\n-\tFor \"remove\", the \"nodeValue\" is absent when an attribute value or attribute field value is removed. When an attribute element or attribute field element is removed, \"nodeValue\" may carry the element to be removed, depending on how on protocol level attribute elements and attribute field elements are identified.\n-\tFor \"setToDefault\", the \"nodeValue\" is absent.\nAttributes and attribute fields without value can be represented in different protocol specific ways, for example by an attribute name without attribute value, by an absent attribute name/value pair, or by a specific attribute value (such as \"null\" or \"nil\").\nThe \"modifyMOIAttributes\" operation allows to modify one or more attributes in one or more objects. When not all attribute modifications can be applied successfully, the MnS producer has different options how to proceed. He may not perform any of the modifications and roll back to the state at the reception of the modification request. He may apply the changes that can be applied, so that some of the requested modifications are applied and some are not applied. He may stop processing the modification request when the first error occurs. The stage 2 definition of this operation does not include any provisions on how to proceed in case an error occurs. These provisions are left to stage 3.\nThe model state after applying the \" modifyMOIAttributes \" request shall fulfill all model constraints such as cardinality, multiplicity, allowed values, or data types, otherwise the operation shall fail.\n\n\n\n\nIn case of success, all of the ManagedEntity instances selected for modification are modified. In case of failure, a specified or unspecified reason may be provided in the Output parameters.\nThis operation is invoked by MnS consumer to request the deletion of one or more Managed Object instances in the MIB maintained by the MnS producer.\n\n\nIn lieu of a synchronization parameter, best effort synchronization will apply; that is, all managed objects selected for this operation will perform the operation if possible regardless of whether some managed objects fail to perform it.\nIn case of success, all of the ManagedEntity instances selected for deletion are deleted. In case of failure, a specified or unspecified reason may be provided in the Output parameters.\n11.1.1.4a.1\tDefinition\nThis operation is invoked by MnS consumers to request a MnS producer to create, delete, and update one or more objects using a single request. The request contains an ordered set of sub-operations. Each sub-operation creates an object, deletes an object, or updates attribute or attribute field values. Sub-operations should be executed in the order they appear in the request.\nThe \"baseObjectInstance\" parameter is common for all sub-operations and identifies the root of the object tree where changes can be made. Each sub-operation is defined by the \"path\", \"modifyOperator\" and \"nodeValue\" parameters. The \"path\" parameter specifies the offset from the root object to the target object, the target attribute or the target attribute field of the sub-operation. The \"modifyOperator\" specifies the operation to be applied. Valid values are \"replace\", \"add\", remove, and for attributes and attributes fields also the value \"setToDefault\".\nThe \"nodeValue\" provides the value for the sub-operation. The parameter shall be absent for \"remove\" operations.\nFor operations on attribute values or attribute field values the same provisions as in clause 11.1.1.3 apply.\nWhen adding (creating) objects, the \"nodeValue\" contains the object representation.\nThe model state after applying the \"changeMOIs\" request shall fulfill all model constraints such as cardinality, multiplicity, allowed values, or data types, otherwise the operation shall fail.\nNote that the parameters introduced and used in this clause just serve the purpose of explaining the functionality. Specific stage 3 solutions may implement the functionality in very different ways.\n\n\n\nThis notification notifies the subscribed consumers that a new Managed Object Instance has been created.\n\nstateBeforeObjectCreation.\n\nstateAfterObjectCreation.\n\nThis notification notifies the subscribed consumers that an existing Managed Object Instance has been deleted.\n\nstateBeforeObjectDeletion.\n\nstateAfterObjectDeletion.\n\nThis notification notifies the subscribed MnS consumers that changes of one or several attributes of a Managed Object Instance in the NRM.\n\nstateBeforeAttributeValueChange.\n\nstateAfterAttributeValueChange.\n\nThis notification notifies the MnS consumer, who has a subscription receiving this type of notification, that certain network events has occurred with potential service impact, for example, system restart and system redundancy shift (backup).\nThis notification definition is generic in the sense that the specific types of network event are not defined.\n\nThis notification reports NRM updates to subscribed MnS consumers. It can report multiple NRM updates that happen at the same time. All possible NRM updates can be reported:\n-\tCreation and deletion of an object.\n-\tCreation and deletion of an attribute, attribute field, attribute element and attribute field element.\n-\tReplacement of an attribute value, attribute field value, attribute element and attribute field element.\n\nThe MnS producer decides whether to send notifications of type notifyMOICreation, notifyMOIDeletion or notifyMOIAttributesValueChange, or a single notifyMOIChanges reporting all changes in a single notification. The MnS producer should take subscription information into account when deciding the notification types to be sent, and not try to send notifications that the MnS consumer did not subscribe to.\nThe notification header includes a notificationId. This identifier shall not be used in the parameter correlatedNotifications potentially carried in other notifications. The notificationId in mOIChanges shall be used instead. This is because the latter notification id is associated to a single MOI only, whereas the former notification id can be associated to changes of multiple MOIs. The correlatedNotifications associates to a single MOI one or more notification ids identifying notifications reporting events for that MOI.\nIn this clause the following definitions apply.\ndata type: Constraint on an attribute value.\nsimple type: Data type constraining an attribute value to a scalar.\ncomplex type: Data type of a structured and/or multi-valued attribute.\nattribute: Information element of an object composed of an attribute name and an attribute value.\nattribute name: Name of an attribute.\nattribute value: Value of an attribute. The value is defined by a simple type or a complex type.\nattribute field: Attribute contained in an attribute.

If they are absent, then the complete alarm list shall be provided (full alarm alignment). If they identify a particular class instance, then only a) the AlarmInformation instances related to this class instance and b) the AlarmInformation instances related to the subordinate class instances of this class instance shall be provided (partial alarm alignment). An instance-a is said to be subordinate to instance-b if the DN of the latter is part of the DN of the former.\nThere are two modes of operation. One mode is synchronous. In this mode, the list of AlarmInformation instances in AlarmList is returned synchronously with the operation. The other mode is asynchronous. In this mode, the list of AlarmInformation instances is returned via alarm notifications. In asynchronous mode of operation, the only information returned synchronously is the status of the operation. A method allowing to abort an ongoing alarm alignment process shall be available in the asynchronous mode. The mode of operation to be used is determined by means outside the scope of specification. To use asynchronous mode, the authorized consumer needs to have established a subscription via the subscribe operation.\n\n\nTable 11.2.1.1.3.3-1: Output parameters for the operation getAlarmList\n\nThe following table defines an item of alarmInformationList.\nTable 11.2.1.1.3.3-2: Definition of an item of alarmInformationList\n\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when a new AlarmInformation is added to the AlarmList. The notification parameters depend on the alarmType and are different for non-security and security alarms.\nThe notifyNewAlarm notification is defined by Table 11.2.1.1.4.2-1, if the alarmType is equal to  \"Communications Alarm\", \"Processing Error Alarm\", \"Environmental Alarm\". \"Quality Of Service Alarm\" or \"Equipment Alarm\".\nTable 11.2.1.1.4.2-1: Input parameters for notifications related to non-security alarms\n\nThe notifyNewAlarm notification is defined by Table 11.2.1.1.4.2a-1, if the alarmType is equal to \"Integrity Violation\", \"Operational Violation\", \"Physical Violation\", \"Security Service or Mechanism Violation\" or \"Time Domain Violation\".\nTable 11.2.1.1.4.2a-1: Input parameters for notifications related to security alarms\n\nnoMatchedAlarm.\n\nnewAlarmInAlarmList.\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when the perceivedSeverity of an existing AlarmInformation changes (except to the value \"CLEARED\").\n\n\nalarmMatched AND alarmNotCleared AND alarmChanged.\n\ninformationUpdate.\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when the AlarmList has been completely or partially rebuilt.\n\nalarmListRebuilt_0 OR alarmListRebuilt_1.\n\nalarmListRebuilt_2.\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when the set of CorrelatedNotification is created, updated or deleted.\n\nnewAlarmCorrelationInfoIsAvailable AND alarmInformationExists.\n\nalarmCorrelatedInfoUpdated.\n\nA MnS consumer invokes this operation to get the number of alarms in the alarm list. The alarms are counted separately for each perceived severity level. An input parameter allows to control which alarms are counted.\n\n\nThere are no pre-conditions.\nallAlarmInformationCounted.\n\n\nA MnS consumer invokes this operation to set a comment in one or more AlarmInformation instances in AlarmList.\n\n\nThe MnS consumer invokes this operation to acknowledge one or more alarms.\nWhen this operation is not supported, the MnS producer shall support acknowledging alarms.\n\n\nNOTE:\tAcknowledgement Information is defined as the information contained in AlarmInformation.ackTime, AlarmInformation.ackUserId, AlarmInformaton.ackSystemId, AlarmInformation.ackState.\n\nThe MnS consumer invokes this operation to remove acknowledgement information kept in one or more AlarmInformation instances.\n\n\nNOTE:\tAcknowledgement Information is defined as the information contained in AlarmInformation.ackTime, AlarmInformation.ackUserId, AlarmInformaton.ackSystemId, AlarmInformation.ackState.\n\n\nThe authorized consumer invokes this operation to clear one or more AlarmInformation instances in AlarmList. For example, this operation can be used to support the manual clearing of the AD (automatic detection and manual clearing, see also TS 32.111-1 [3]) alarms.\n\n\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when the perceivedSeverity of an existing AlarmInformation changes to \"CLEARED\".\n\nalarmMatchedAndCleared OR clearedByProvider.\n\nalarmInformationCleared_1 OR alarmInformationCleared_2.\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when a the acknowledgement state of an alarm changes from \"UNACKNOWLEDGED\" to \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" or back from \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" to \"UNACKNOWLEDGED\".\n\n\nackedByConsumer OR ackedByProvider AND alarmInformationExists.\n\nalarmAckStateHasChanged.\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when a Comment instance is added to an AlarmInformation instance in the AlarmList.\nA MnS producer shall support this notification if it supports the operation setComment.\n\ncommentSetByServiceConsumer OR commentSetInternallyByServiceprovider commentedByServiceprovider AND alarmInformationExists.\n\ncommentInserted.\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when the MnS producer looses confidence in the integrity of its alarm list.\nThe MnS producer may then rebuilt the faulty alarm list. When the alarm List is rebuilt or confidence in the existing alarm list is re-established the MnS producer may generate a notifyAlarmListRebuilt notification.\nThe parameters objectClass and objectInstance are used to specify if the complete alarm list is unreliable or only parts thereof.\nThe MnS consumer behaviour, on reception of this notifyPotentialFaultyAlarmList notification, is not specified. The authorized consumer behaviour is considered not essential for the specification of the interface itself. However, the following are recommended actions the uthorized consumer should take, in case it receives this notification.\n1)\tThe uthorized consumer should not perform any task requiring the integrity of the AlarmInformation identified as faulty or unreliable by the subject notification.\n2)\tThe uthorized consumer should not invoke operations that require integrity of the AlarmList such as getAlarmList., acknolwedgeAlarms operations.\n\nfaultyAlarmListDetected.\n\nfaultyAlarmList\n\nThis notification is generated by the MnS producer when one or more of the following attributes of an AlarmInformation instance in the AlarmList changes its value: perceivedSeverity, backedUpStatus, backUpObject, trendIndication, thresholdInfo, stateChangeDefinition, monitoredAttributes, proposedRepairActions, additionalText, additionalInformation, serviceUser, serviceProvider or securityAlarmDetector.

                            "text_content": "None.\nThis clause introduces the fault supervision related classes (i.e. IOCs, SupportIOCs). The intent is to identify the information required for the Fault management service implementation of its operations and notification emission. This clause provides the overview of all support object classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of various aspects of these support object classes.\n\nAlarmInformation contains information about alarm conditions of an alarmed MonitoredEntity.\nA MnS producer is related to at most one AlarmList. The MnS producer assigns an identifier, called alarmId, to each AlarmInformation in the AlarmList. An alarmId unambiguously identifies one AlarmInformation in the AlarmList.\n\nAlarms have states. The alarm state information is captured in AlarmInformation in AlarmList.\nThe solid circle icon represents the Start State. The double circle icon represents the End State. In this state, the alarm is Cleared and acknowledged. The AlarmInformation shall not be accessible via the Service interface and is removed from the AlarmList.\nNote the state diagram uses \" X / Y ^ Z \" to label the arc that indicates state transition. The meanings of X, Y and Z are:\n-\tX identifies the triggering event;\n-\tY identifies the action of FaultSupervision MnS producer because of the triggering event;\n-\tZ is the notification to be emitted by FaultSupervision MnS producer because of the triggering event.\nNote that acknowledgeAlarm^notifyAckStateChanged and the unacknowledgeAlarm^notifyAckStateChanged refer to cases when the request of the management service consumer is successful for the AlarmInformation concerned. They do not refer to the cases when the request is a failure since in the failure cases, no state transition would occur.\nNote that, to reduce cluttering to the diagram, the setComment^notifyComment is not included in the figure . One transition should be applied from unack&unclear to itself. Similarly, another transition should be applied from ack&unclear to itself. Another one is from unack&clear to itself.\n\"PS\" used in the state diagram stands for \"perceived severity\".\nFigure 11.2.2.1.3.1.3-1 is used if it supports ^notifyChangedAlarm and Figure 11.2.2.1.3.1.3-2 is used if it does not support ^notifyChangedAlarm.\nThe figure depicts a network interface card (NIC) with a specific function, \"notifyChangedAlarm,\" which is supported by the device.\nFigure 11.2.2.1.3.1.3-1 notifyChangedAlarm supported\n\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 11.2.2.1.3.1.3-2 notifyChangedAlarm not supported,\" depicts a network diagram with various components and their connections. The figure is used to illustrate the communication process in a network, with the \"notifyChangedAlarm not supported\" label indicating a specific issue or condition that needs to be addressed. This technical figure is crucial for understanding the network's functionality and identifying potential problems or issues that need to be resolved.\nFigure 11.2.2.1.3.1.3-2 notifyChangedAlarm not supported\nThe MnS producer maintains an AlarmList that contains currently active alarms (i.e. AlarmInformation whose perceivedSeverity is not Cleared) and alarms that are Cleared but not yet acknowledged.\nThere is no additional attribute defined for this class besides those inherited.\nFSMnSProducer is the representation of the entity who provides the fault supervision management service(s) and contains the AlarmList.\nThere is no additional attribute defined for this class besides those inherited.\n\nComment contains commentary and associated information such as the time when the commentary is made.\n\nThe sourceObjectInstance attribute of CorrelatedNotification identifies one MonitoredEntity. For the MonitoredEntity identified, a set of notification identifiers is also identified. One or more CorrelatedNotification instances can be related to an AlarmInformation. In this case, the information of the AlarmInformation is said to be correlated to information carried in the notifications identified by the CorrelatedNotification instances. See further definition of correlated notification in ITU-T Recommendation X.733 [4], clause 8.1.2.9.\nThe notification identified by the CorrelatedNotification, as defined in ITU-T and used here, can carry all types of information and is not restricted to carrying alarm information only. For example, a notification, identified by the CorrelatedNotification, can indicate a managed instance attribute value change. In this case, the information of the AlarmInformation is said to be correlated to the managed instance attribute value change event.\nThe meaning of correlation is dependent on the type of notification itself. See the comment column of the correlatedNotification input parameter for each type of notification, such as notifyNewAlarm.\nNotification carries AlarmInformation. The AlarmInformation instances referred to by the correlatedNotification may or may not exist in the AlarmList. For example, the AlarmInformation carried by the identified notification may have been acknowledged and Cleared and therefore, no longer exist in the AlarmList.\n\n\n\nIt represents classes that can have an alarmed state. The types of classes that can have alarmed state are:\na) \tAll classes whose Notification Tables include alarm notifications.\nb) \tVSE subclass of 3GPP defined classes and VSE defined classes that can have alarmed state.\nThe objectClass and objectInstance of this class identifies an instance of this class. The AlarmInformation uses this information in two places. In one place, the information is used to identify the instance that is in alarmed state. In another place, the information is used to identify an instance that can be used as the back up network resource for the instance that is in alarmed state.\nThere is no attribute for this class.\n\n\n\nThis represents the relationship between FSMnSProducer and AlarmList.\nThere is no role defined for this relationship.\nThere is no constraint for this relationship.\nThis represents the relationship between AlarmList and AlarmInformation.\n\n\nThis represents the relationship between AlarmInformation and Comment.\n\nThere is no constraint.\nThis represents the relationship between AlarmInformation and CorrelatedNotification.\n\nThere is no constraint.\nThis represents the relationship between MonitoredEntity and AlarmInformation.\n\n\nThe relationship represents the relationship between AlarmInformation and the backUpObject.\n\n\n\n\nNone.\nThis clause depicts the set of Support IOCs that encapsulate information within the notification IRP. The intent is to identify the information required for the notification IRP implementation of its operations and notification emission. This clause provides the overview of all Support IOCs in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of various aspects of these Support IOCs.\n\n\nThis clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between Support IOCs.\n\n\nThis Support IOC represents a Subscriber from a notification perspective: a subscriber is fully identified by a management service consumer reference. A management service consumer using multiple management service consumer reference attributes to subscribe will result in multiple NtfSubscriber instances.\n\nThis Support IOC represents a subscription that has been requested by a management service consumer and created.\n\nThis Support IOC represents a notification IRP. It inherits from Support IOC ManagedGenericIRP.\nThis relationship defines the relationship between a NtfSubscriber and its current subscriptions.\n\n\nThis relationship defines the relationship between the NotificationIRP and the current subscribers of notifications.\n\n\nThis clause defines the semantics of the Attributes used in Support IOCs.\n\n-\t\"ntfTimeTickTimer is lower.\n\n",

The choice of technology should ensure that this representation is derived from ISO 8601 [20]. Based on the representation used, the timestamp shall refer to either UTC time or local time or local time with offset from UTC.\nThis clause defines a rule that shall be applied for constructing names for files containing performance data.\n<Type><Startdate>.<Starttime>-[<Enddate>.]<Endtime>[_-<jobIdList>][_<UniqueIdList>][_-_<RC>]\n1)\tThe \"Type\" field indicates if the file contains measurement results for single or multiple measured objects and/or granularity periods where:\n-\t\"A\" means single measured object, single granularity period (this is used when granularity period is equal to reporting period);\n-\t\"B\" indicates multiple measured objects, single granularity period (this is used when granularity period is equal to reporting period);\n-\t\"C\" signifies single measured object, multiple granularity periods (this is used when reporting period is multiples of the granularity period and will contain multiple measurement reports);\n-\t\"D\" stands for multiple measured objects, multiple granularity periods (this is used when reporting period is multiples of the granularity period and will contain multiple measurement reports).\n2)\tThe \"Startdate\" field indicates the date when the granularity period began if the \"Type\" field is set to A or B. If the \"Type\" field is either \"C\" or \"D\" then \"Startdate\" contains the date when the first granularity period of the measurement results contained in the file started. The \"Startdate\" field is of the form YYYYMMDD, where:\n-\tYYYY is the year in four-digit notation;\n-\tMM is the month in two digit notation (01 - 12);\n-\tDD is the day in two-digit notation (01 - 31).\n3)\tThe \"Starttime\" field indicates the time when the granularity period began if the \"Type\" field is set to A or B. If the \"Type\" field is either \"C\" or \"D\" then \"Starttime\" contains the time when the first granularity period of the measurement results contained in the file began. The \"Starttime\" field is of the form HHMMshhmm, where:\n-\tHH is the two-digit hour of the day (local time), based on 24-hour clock (00 - 23);\n-\tMM is the two digit minute of the hour (local time), based on 60-minutes clock (00 - 59);\n-\ts is the sign of the local time differential from UTC (+ or -), in case the time differential to UTC is 0 then the sign may be arbitrarily set to \"+\" or \"-\";\n-\thh is the two-digit number of hours of the local time differential from UTC (00-23);\n-\tmm is the two digit number of minutes of the local time differential from UTC (00-59).\n4)\tThe \"Enddate\" field shall only be included if the \"Type\" field is set to \"C\" or \"D\", i.e. measurement results for multiple granularity periods are contained in the file. It identifies the date when the last granularity period of these measurements ended, and its structure corresponds to the \"Startdate\" field.\n5)\tThe \"Endtime\" field indicates the time when the granularity period ended if the \"Type\" field is set to A or B. If the \"Type\" field is either \"C\" or \"D\" then \"Endtime\" contains the time when the last granularity period of the measurement results contained in the file ended. Its structure corresponds to the \"Starttime\" field.\n6)\tThe \"UniqueIdList\" field indicates the DNs of the measured objects.\n7)\tThe \"RC\" field is a running count, starting with the value of \"1\", and shall be appended only if the filename is otherwise not unique, i.e. more than one file is generated and all other parameters of the file name are identical. Therefore it may only be used by the EM, since the described situation cannot occur with NE generated files. Note that the delimiter for this field, _-_, is an underscore character (_), followed by a minus character (-), followed by an underscore character (_).\n8)\tThe \"jobIdList\" indicates the measurement job id(s) that the performance data file is associated with.\nSome examples describing file-naming convention:\n1)\tfile name:\tA20000626.2315+0200-2330+0200_gNBId, \nmeaning:\tfile produced for gNB <gNBId> on June 26, 2000, granularity period 15 minutes from 23:15 local to 23:30 local, with a time differential of +2 hours against UTC.\n2)\tfile name:\tB20021224.1700-1130-1705-1130_-job10_S-NSSAI,\nmeaning:\tfile containing results for multiple measured objects, generated for measurement job job10, produced for NSI <S-NSSAI> on December 24, 2002, granularity period 5 minutes from 17:00 local to 17:05 local, with a time differential of –11:30 hours against UTC.\n3)\tfile name:\tD20050907.1030+0000-20050909.1500+0000_SubnetworkId_-_2,\nmeaning:\tfile containing results subnetwork <SubnetworkId>, start of first granularity period 07 September 2005, 10:30 local, end of last granularity period 09 September 2005, 15:00 local, with a time differential of 0 against UTC.

When no dedicated object is standardized or instantiated, the \"ManagedElement\", where the file is processed, shall be used. For the case that the file is processed on a mangement node, the \"ManagementNode\", where the file is processed, shall be used instead.\n\nA MnS producer sends this notification to subscribed MnS consumers when an error occurs while preparing a file. For many error reasons, such as low memory or hard disk full, it is very likely that all ongoing file preparation processes fail at the same time. For that reason, it is possible to report with this notification that multiple file preparation processes failed.\nIn case the MnS producer keeps the file, where an error occurred during preparation, the \"fileInfoList\" parameter contains a list item with information about that file, otherwise, if the file is deleted or not created at all, the \"fileInfoList\" parameter has no list item related to that file.\n\nThis operation allows a MnS consumer to subscribe to the notifications of the file data reporting service producer.\n\n\n\nThis operation allows a MnS consumer to cancel subscription(s) at a MnS producer.\nA MnS consumer can cancel one subscription made with a \"consumerReference\" by providing the corresponding \"subscriptionId\" or all subscriptions made with the same \"consumerReference\" by leaving the \"subscriptionId\" parameter absent.\n\n\n\nThis operation allows a MnS consumer to retrieve a list of files available for upload on a MnS producer. The request message contains the file data type of the files, that shall be listed in the response. In addition to that it is possible to specify that only files shall be included in the response whose file ready time falls into a specific time window defined by the \"beginTime\" and \"endTime\" input parameters.\n\n\n\n",

For that reason, it would not be an error if in the example above an attribute value is included in the \"value\" property that did not change value. A MnS producer may consider this compact format hence also for the case that not all attributes of an object have been updated.\nTo allow the MnS consumer to understand which attributes have been updated, the MnS producer may decide to send the following notification.\n\nTable 12.1.1.4.1a.5 -1: Definition of type NotifyMoiCreation\n\nThe following example shows a notification reporting the creation of an object with two attributes \"attrA\" and \"attrB\". Note that the notification includes the name/value pairs representing the attributes of the created object only and not the complete object representation.\nThe creation of an empty object not containing any attribute values is reported as follows.\n\nTable 12.1.1.4.1a.6 -1: Definition of type NotifyMoiDeletion\n\nThe following example demonstrates the deletion of an object. The message body includes the name/value pairs representing the attributes of the deleted object.\nThe message body may include the name/value pairs representing the attributes of the deleted object.\n\nTable 12.1.1.4.1a.7 -1: Definition of type NotifyMoiAttributeValueChanges\n\nThe following example notification reports the modification of the attribute values for \"attrA\" and \"attrB\".\nIn addition to the new values, the old values may be included in the notification.\nIn the example above the attribute values are of simple type. For attributes of structured type, the question is if all attribute fields of an attribute, where at least one attribute field changed its value, need to be reported or only those attribute fields that changed value. Assume an attribute field that did not change value is not included in the notification. In this case the MnS consumer receiving the notification cannot tell if the attribute field was deleted or if the attribute field did not change value. It is not possible to distinguish these two cases based on the information in the notification. For that reason, always all attribute fields of an attribute need to be included in the notification. For structured attributes with many attribute fields this may not be very efficient.\nIn the next example \"attrA\" is a structured attribute with the attribute fields \"attrFieldAA\" and \"attrFieldAB\". The attribute field \"attrFieldAA\" changed value, the attribute field \"attrFieldAB\" did not change value. The attribute value change notification reporting this change may look as follows.\nNote also that for multi-valued attributes all attribute elements of the new value need to be reported. It is not possible to report only added, deleted, or modified attribute elements. Furthermore, the notification does not allow reporting of deleted attributes. When this is required the MnS producer needs to include always all attributes of the object in the notification. It is outside the present document how the MnS producer signals to the MnS consumer if all attributes or only the changed ones are included in the attribute value change notification. The notification itself does not include this information.\n\nTable 12.1.1.4.1a.8 -1: Definition of type NotifyMoiChanges\n\nTable 12.1.1.4.1a.9 -1: Definition of type PatchItem\n\n12.1.1.4.4.1\tGeneral\nThis clause defines simple data types and enumerations that are used by the data structures defined in the previous clauses.\n12.1.1.4.4.2\tSimple data types\nTable 12.1.1.4.3.2-1: Simple data types\n\n12.1.1.4.4.3\tEnumeration CmNotificationTypes\nTable 12.1.1.4.4.3-1: Enumeration CmNotificationTypes\n\n12.1.1.4.4.4\tEnumeration SourceIndicator\nTable 12.1.1.4.4.4-1: Enumeration SourceIndicator\n\n12.1.1.4.4.5\tEnumeration ScopeType\nTable 12.1.1.4.4.4.1-1: Enumeration ScopeType\n\n12.1.1.4.4.6\tEnumeration Operation\nTable 12.1.1.4.4.4.6-1: Enumeration Operation\n\nTable 12.1.1.4.4.4.7-1: Enumeration PatchOperation\n\n12.1.1.4.4.8\tEnumeration Insert\nTable 12.1.1.4.4.4.8-1: Enumeration Insert\n\n",

It is mapped to the NETCONF <edit-config> operation. <edit-config> can delete one or more specific MOIs but only indirectly supports scope or filtered sets of MOIs that are part of the generic deleteMOI 3GPP operation specification. <edit-config> uses a config block, indicating the MOI(s) to be deleted.\nThe Netconf operation attribute on the list representing the baseObjectInstance should be set to delete or remove.\nThe default-operation parameter should be set to none.\nThe IS operation parameters are mapped to SS equivalents according to table 12.1.3.1.5-1 and table 12.1.3.1.5-2.\nTable 12.1.3.1.5-1: Mapping of IS deleteMOI input parameters to SS equivalents\n\nTable 12.1.3.1.5-2: Mapping of IS deleteMOI output parameters to SS equivalents\nNOTE 1: Successful Netconf <edit-config> operations only return an <ok> element.

NETCONF/YANG does not differentiate between the stage 2 concepts of object and attribute, hence there is no need for a delimiter.\n- The value of \"value\" shall follow the JSON encoding of YANG (RFC 7951 [50]).\n- Attribute elements are identified by their value (in case of a YANG \"leaf-list\") or by the values of keys (in case of a YANG \"list\"). In JSON Patch, attribute elements are identified based on their index, i.e. based on the position in the array.\n- In case no key is defined for a YANG \"list\" it is not possible to report the creation, deletion or replacement of individual list entries. In this case, whenever the list is modified, the replacement of the complete attribute or attribute field (the complete list with all list enties) shall be reported.\n- Similarly if an attribute(field)  is mapped to a YANG leaf-list with non-unique values it is not possible to report the creation, deletion or replacement of an individual value. In this case, whenever the leaf-list is modified, the replacement of the complete attribute or attribute field (the complete leaf-list; all values) shall be reported.\n- YANG default values shall be handled as follows:\n- Attributes with default values, for which no value is specified in the object creation request, shall be included in the object creation report with their default values.\n- Attributes with default values, that are deleted and consequently set to their default value, shall be included in attribute replacement reports.\nNote all following use-cases use JSON expressed in YAML notation.\nCase 1: Creation of an MOI is reported with:\n-\toperation: add\n-\tpath: YANG resource identifier pointing to the list entry representing the MOI\n-\tvalue: a complete MOI representation, represented by the \"id\" node and the \"attributes\" container  but exluding the list entry itself encoded according to RFC7951 [50].\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports an object creation:\nhref: node1.lichtenberg.de\n…\nnotificationId: 123456001\npath: \"/3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:PerfMetricJob=job1\"\noperation: add\nvalue:\nid: job1\n3gpp-common-measurements:PerfMetricJob:attributes:\njobId: 9865\nfileReportingPeriod: 30\n\n\nCase 2: Deletion of an MOI is reported with:\n-\toperation: remove\n-\tpath: YANG resource identifier pointing to the list entry representing the MOI\n-\tvalue: not present\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports an object deletion:\nhref: node1.charlottenburg.de\n…\nnotificationId: 123456002\npath: \"/3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:PerfMetricJob=job1\"\noperation: remove\n\nCase 3: Creating a (complete) attribute is reported as follows. (Setting the value(s) of an attribute that had no value before the change):\n-\toperation: add.\n-\tpath: YANG resource identifier pointing to the leaf/leaf-list/container/list representing the attribute. If the attribute is represented by a list or leaf-list, then for this last data node the equal sign, the key value(s) or leaf-list value is omitted, only the list/leaf-list name shall be present.\n-\tvalue: the content of the leaf/leaf-list entry(s)/container/list entry(s) representing the created attribute encoded according to RFC7951 [50]. In case of attribute represented by a container/list the child data nodes are encoded only,the container/list itself is not.\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports setting the values of the performanceMetrics simple, multivalue attribute:\nhref: node1.spandau.de\n…\nnotificationId: 123456003\npath: \"/3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:PerfMetricJob=job1/attributes/performanceMetrics\"\noperation: add\nvalue:\n- inOctets\n- inPackets\n- outPackets\n\nCase 4: Deleting all values of a complete attribute is reported with\n-\toperation: remove.\n-\tpath: Same as in case 3.\n-\tvalue: not present.\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports deleting all values of the performanceMetrics attribute:\nhref: node1.pankow.de\n…\nnotificationId: 123456004\npath: \"/3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:PerfMetricJob=job1/attributes/performanceMetrics\"\noperation: remove\n\nCase 5: Replacing a (complete) attribute is reported as follows. (Removing all previous values of the attribute and setting new value(s)):\n-\toperation: replace.\n-\tpath: Same as in case 3.\n-\tvalue: Same as in case 3.\nCase 6: Adding a new value to a multivalue attribute (an attribute with multiplicity upper bound greater than 1) is reported as follows. (This does not imply any change to exisiting values):\n-\toperation: add/\n-\tpath: YANG resource identifier pointing to a leaf-list/list entry representing an attribute element(value). In case of adding a new element to an attribute with the property isOrdered=True the new element/value is inserted before the pointed element(value), unless the \"insert\" subparameter specifies differently.\n-\tvalue: the leaf-list/list entry representing the new attribute value encoded according to RFC7951 [50]. In case of a list the child data nodes are encoded the list-entry itself is not.\n-\tinsert: an additional input subparameter is added to the moiChange input parameter. This indicates whether the new element/value was added before or after the element/value specified in path. The subparameter is only valid in case of attributes with the property isOrdered=True. It can take the values \"before\", \"after\". If missing it defaults to \"before\".\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports adding a new element/value to the \"performanceMetrics\" attribute before the outPackets element.:\nnotificationId: 123456006\npath: \"/3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:PerfMetricJob=job1/attributes/performanceMetrics/performanceMetrics=outPackets\"\noperation: add\ninsert: before\nvalue: outOctets\n\nCase 7: Deleting a single element/value from a multivalue attribute is reported as follows. (This does not imply any change to any other elements):\n-\toperation: remove.\n-\tpath: Same as case 6.\n-\tvalue: not present.\nCase 8: Replacement of a single value for a multivalue attribute is reported as follows. This implies removing the old value; in case of a structured attribute removal all its subparts. This does not imply any change to any other values:\n-\toperation: replace.\n-\tpath: Same as case 6.\n-\tvalue: Same as case 6.\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports replacing an element/value of the \"thresholdInfoList\" structured attribute:\nnotificationId: 123456008\npath: 3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:ThresholdMonitor=job1/attributes/thresholdInfoList=thr1\noperation: replace\nvalue:\n- idx: thr1\nthresholdDirection: UP\nthresholdValue: '4.5'\n\nCase 9: Adding afield (subpart) of an attribute value is reported as follows (only used for structured attributes represented by a list or container in YANG):\n-\toperation: add.\n-\tpath: YANG Resource Identifier pointing to the leaf/leaf-list/container/list representing the attribute field. If the attribute field is represented by a list or leaf-list, the field has multiplicity upper bound greater than 1, with the property isOrdered=True the new element/value is inserted before the pointed element(value), unless the \"insert\" subparameter specifies differently.\n-\tvalue: the leaf/leaf-list/container/list representing the new attribute field values encoded according to RFC7951. In case of a list/container representing the attribute field, value shall contain only the child data nodes, but not the container/list-entry itself.\n-\tinsert: In case the field has multiplicity upper bound greater than 1 and has the property isOrdered=True, the subparameter is used similarly as in case 6.\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports adding a value to the \" hysteresis \" attribute subpart:\nnotificationId: 123456009\npath: 3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:ThresholdMonitor=job1/attributes/thresholdInfoList=thr1/hysteresis\noperation: add\nvalue: '10'\n\nCase 10: Deleting a field (subpart) of an attribute is reported as follows. (only used for structured attributes represented by a list or container in YANG):\n-\toperation: remove.\n-\tpath: Same as case 9.\n-\tvalue: Not present.\nFor example, the following instance of a \"moiChanges\" array item reports deleting all values of the \"hysteresis\" attribute field:\nnotificationId: 123456010\npath: 3gpp-common-managed-element:ManagedElement=node3/3gpp-common-measurements:ThresholdMonitor=job1/attributes/thresholdInfoList=thr1/hysteresis\noperation: remove\n\nCase 11: Replacement of a field (subpart) of an attribute is reported as follows. This implies removing previous value(s). (only used for structured attributes represented by a list or container in YANG):\n-\toperation: replace.\n-\tpath: Same as case 9.\n-\tvalue: Same as case 9.\nThe Netconf server implementing the MnS provider shall implement some basic capabilities.\nThe Netconf server (MnS producer) shall be compliant to RFC 6243[51] and implement the Netconf urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:with-defaults:1.0 capability. The ‘report-all’ retrieval mode shall be supported. Other retrieval modes may be supported. The basic mode should be ‘report-all’.\n",
