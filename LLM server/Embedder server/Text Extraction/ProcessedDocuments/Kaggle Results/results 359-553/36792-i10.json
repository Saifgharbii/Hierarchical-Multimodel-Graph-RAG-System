            "description": "In Rel-14 and Rel-16, RAN introduced a set of features under the umbrella of “LTE based 5G terrestrial broadcast” that, together with the corresponding enhancements in the core network, enable the deployment of a downlink-only dedicated broadcast network using 3GPP technologies.\nA clear target spectrum for this technology is the portion of UHF spectrum allocated to broadcast systems (~470 - ~694/698MHz, depending on the region). The objective of this work item was to introduce the necessary features for LTE based 5G terrestrial broadcast to operate in the portion of UHF spectrum allocated to broadcast systems in different regions of the globe. For instance:\n-\tFor ITU region 1, a channelization of 8 MHz is used.\n-\tFor ITU region 2, a channelization of 6 MHz is used.\n-\tIn some countries (e.g. North America), frequencies above 614 MHz are used by FDD (B71).\n-\tFor ITU region 3, different channelizations (6/7/8 MHz) are used in different countries, for instance China and India are using 8 MHz.\n-\tIn China broadcast systems are using the spectrum ranges 470 – 702 MHz.\n-\tIn India broadcast systems are using the spectrum ranges 470 – 610 MHz and 614 – 698 MHz.\nIn this work, at least the following specifications are to be taken into account, and requirements reused when available:\n-\tFor ITU region 1, requirements defined in ETSI EN 302 296 [3] and GE06 Agreement [5].\n-\tFor ITU region 2:\n-\tIn United States, FCC Title 47 CFR 73.622 [6].\n-\tIn Brazil, ABNT NBR 15601 [7].\n-\tFor ITU region 3: in China, GB20600-2006 [8].\n\n\n\n",

The spectrum masks defined in the recommendation are not based on the ITU-R Region but on the DTT system.\n\nCurrently there are 4 different DTT systems in operation worldwide:\n-\tAdvanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)\n-\tDigital Video Broadcasting (DVB-T)\n-\tIntegrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB-T)\n-\tDigital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast (DTMB)\nBesides, different TV channel raster are currently in use (6, 7, and 8 MHz).\nATSC1.0 spectrum masks are also considered for ATSC3.0. Furthermore, DVB-T2 uses the same spectrum masks as DVB-T, and DTMB-A uses the same spectrum masks as DTMB.\nEach of these DTT systems can be used in different ITU-R Regions. Although the majority of Region 1 countries use DVB-T (or DVB-T2), there are some countries in Region 1 using ISDB-T or DTMB. Likewise, although in Region 2 ATSC (or ATSC 3.0) is used in North America and ISDB-T is used in most of Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, there are some countries in Region 2 using DVB-T/T2 or DTMB. Finally, in Region 3, all four DTT systems (or their corresponding second-generation systems) are used in different countries.\nRegarding the UHF TV channel raster, only ITU-R Region 1 is fully harmonized using 8 MHz channels.\nIn Regions 2 and 3, there are different countries using all three UHF TV channel raster (6, 7, and 8 MHz).\nTherefore, it is advisable to refer to the spectrum masks defined in Recommendation ITU-R BT.1206 [2] to enhance the compatibility of LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast with existing DTT systems, not based on ITU-R Region, but based on the DTT system and UHF TV channel raster adopted in each country.\nIn addition to the ITU-R BT.1206 [2], GE06 [5] shall be considered as a regulatory reference for ITU Region 1 in respect to OOB emissions. Existing 3GPP specifications with relation to Out-of-Band emissions shall be considered as well.\n",

The reference amplitude for the spectrum shaping limit is the total transmitter output power, including the pilot signal, contained within the 6 MHz channel. Three cases are considered below. The “high power” spectrum limit mask is intended for high-power transmitters which service large populated areas. These transmitters may be co-located with similar transmitters on adjacent channels avoiding interference. The “low power” spectrum limit mask is intended for low power television (LPTV) transmitters and translators. An LPTV transmitter provides a locally- oriented television service in small communities both rural and within larger urban areas. TV translator stations are stations in the broadcast service operated for the purpose of retransmitting the programmes and signals of a TV broadcast station in areas of poor reception. The “simple” spectrum limit mask is also intended for LPTV transmitters and translators in locations where such transmitters and translators will not cause interference.\nThe spectrum shaping limit in the range between one-half of the width of the resolution bandwidth filter used and 500 kHz from the channel edge relative to the total transmitter output power shall be:\nSpectrum shaping limit  –47 (dBDTV)\nThe spectrum shaping limit at any frequency between 500 kHz and 6 MHz from the channel edge should be:\nSpectrum shaping limit  -(11.5 (|ΔF| – 0.5) + 47) (dBDTV)\nwhere:\nΔF is the frequency difference, in MHz, from the channel edge.\nThe spectrum shaping limit at any frequency more than 6 MHz from the channel edge should be:\nSpectrum shaping limit  –110 dBDTV\nThe spectrum limit mask for a high power DTTB transmitter is illustrated graphically in Figure 4.3.3.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a spectrum limit mask for 6 MHz high power 8-VSB digital terrestrial television systems, illustrating the required frequency range for these systems.
