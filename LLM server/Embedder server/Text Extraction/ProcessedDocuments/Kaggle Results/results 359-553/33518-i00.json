Based on the profile of the expected NF/NF service and the type of the NF service consumer, the NRF determines whether the NF service consumer is allowed to discover the expected NF instance(s). If the expected NF instance(s) or NF service instance(s) are deployed in a certain network slice, NRF authorizes the discovery request according to the discovery configuration of the Network Slice, e.g. the expected NF instance(s) are only discoverable by the NF in the same network slice as specified in TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.17.4.\nIf included, the requester-snssais IE is expected to contain the list of S-NSSAI of the requester NF. The NRF is expected to use this to return only those NF profiles of NF Instances allowing to be discovered from the slice(s) identified by this IE, according to the \"allowedNssais\" list in the NF Profile and NF Service as specified in TS 29.510 [5], clause 6.2.3.2.3.1.\nThreat References: TR 33.926 [6], clause H.2.2.1, No slice specific authorization for NF discovery\nTest Case:\nTest Name: TC_DISC_AUTHORIZATION_SLICE_NRF\nPurpose:\nVerify that the NRF under test does not authorize slice specific discovery request for the NF instance which is not part of the requested slice, according to the slice specific discovery configuration of the requested NF instance.\nProcedure and execution steps:\nPre-Conditions:\n-\tTest environment with the NF1 and NF2, which may be simulated.\n-\tThe NF2 is configured with a list of S-NSSAI, which contains slice A but not slice B.\n-\tThe NF1 is configured as a NF instance belonging to slice B and is connected in emulated/real network environment.\n-\tThe NF1 and NF2 is successfully authenticated with the NRF under test.\nExecution Steps\n1.\tThe NF2 registers at the NRF under test with a list of S-NSSAI.\n2.\tThe NF1 sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request to the NRF under test with the expected service name of NF2, NF type of the expected NF2.\n3.\tThe NRF under test determines that NF2 instance only allows discovery from NFs belonging to slice A, according to the \"allowedNssais\" list stored in NF2 Profile.\nExpected Results:\nThe NRF under test returns a response with \"403 Forbidden\" status code, as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2 of TS 29.510 [5].\nExpected format of evidence:\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g., evidence can be presented in the form of screenshot/screen-capture.\n",
