To check whether existing MPR requirements still apply, we conduct a set of simulation cases with the 1.4MHz LTE channel placed in different locations. The common simulation parameters are as follows:\n-\tTx power: PC3 +23dBm\n-\tModulation: DFT-s-OFDM QPSK\n-\tLO placement: always in the centre of the carrier\n-\tRegulations: ETSI and FCC\nAs for the actual channel configurations, Figure 6.2.3-1 below shows three 1.4MHz channel with centre frequencies of 1610.7MHz, 1618.95MHz and 1625.8MHz.\n\nThe figure depicts a set of considered channels for power back-off simulations in a 5G network. These channels are crucial for ensuring the reliability of the network during power outages. The figure includes various types of power back-off scenarios, such as single-hop, multi-hop, and multi-hop with multiple back-off levels. The figure also highlights the importance of considering the channel conditions and the impact of power back-off on the network performance.\nFigure 6.2.3.1-1: Considered channels for power back-off simulations.\nFigure 6.2.3.1-2 below captures summary of the power back-off needed for the LTE MTC 1.4MHz channel placed right at the lower edge of the NTN L-/S-band:\n-\tFor most cases no power back-off is needed at all. Even when a single RB is scheduled at the lower-most edge of the channel resulting in the highest PSD, still no power back-off is required.\n-\tThere are only two cases when power back-off is applied, when 5 and 6 RBs are scheduled. Still power back-off values are quite marginal, 0.2dB, and are within the existing MPR allowances (see Appendix A).\n\nThe figure depicts the power back-off values for the 1.4MHz channel at Fc=1610.7MHz, which is a crucial parameter in the design of power amplifiers (PAs) used in wireless communication systems. The figure shows the power back-off values in dBm (decibels power) for different values of the channel frequency (Fc) and the power amplifier (PA) gain. This information is essential for understanding the performance of the PA in terms of its ability to maintain a stable power output in the presence of noise and interference. The figure also includes a legend to help interpret the values and their significance.\nFigure 6.2.3.1-2: Power back-off values for the 1.4MHz channel at Fc=1610.7MHz.\n\nFigure 6.2.3.1-3 below captures summary of the power back-off needed for the LTE MTC 1.4MHz channel placed in the second ETSI sub-range of 1618.25-1626.5MHz:\n-\tThe main conclusion is that while a UE might need some power back-off to meet emission requirements, it is needed only for 5-6 RBs and the maximum value does not exceed 0.3dB, which is still within existing MPR requirements (see Appendix A).\n-\tIt does not matter much whether the 1.4MHz channel is at the lower or the upper edge of the second ETSI sub-range. While there are out-of-band emission requirements for frequencies above 1628.5MHz, they do not have any discernible impact on the power back-off values.\n\nThe figure depicts the power back-off values for the 1.4MHz channel at Fc=1618.95 and Fc=1625.8MHz, which are used to determine the power levels at which the signal is back-off. The back-off values are essential for ensuring the stability of the communication system and preventing interference.\t\tThe figure depicts the power back-off values for the 1.4MHz channel at Fc=1618.95 and Fc=1625.8MHz, which are used to determine the power levels at which the signal is back-off.
