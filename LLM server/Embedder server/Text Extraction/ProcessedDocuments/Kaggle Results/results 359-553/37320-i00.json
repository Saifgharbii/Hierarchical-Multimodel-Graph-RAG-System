There are also cases of measurement collection not specified as either immediate or logged MDT, such as Accessibility measurements.\n2.\tUE measurement configuration\nIt is possible to configure MDT measurements for the UE logging purpose independently from the network configurations for normal RRM purposes. However, in most cases, the availability of measurement results is conditionally dependent on the UE RRM configuration.\n3.\tUE measurement collection and reporting\nUE MDT measurement logs consist of multiple events and measurements taken over time. The time interval for measurement collection and reporting is decoupled in order to limit the impact on the UE battery consumption and network signalling load.\n4.\tGeographical scope of measurement logging\nIt is possible to configure the geographical area where the defined set of measurements shall be collected.\n5.\tLocation information\nThe measurements shall be linked to available location information and/or other information or measurements that can be used to derive location information.\n6.\tTime information\nThe measurements in measurement logs shall be linked to a time stamp.\n7.\tSensor information\nThe measurements can be linked to available sensor information that can be used to derive UE orientation in a global coordinate system, the uncompensated barometric pressure and the UE speed.\n8.\tUE capability information\nThe network may use UE capabilities to select terminals for MDT measurements.\n9.\tDependency on SON\nThe solutions for MDT are able to work independently from SON support in the network. Relation between measurements/solution for MDT and UE side SON functions shall be established in a way that re-use of functions is achieved where possible.\n10.\tDependency on TRACE\nThe subscriber/cell trace functionality is reused and extended to support MDT. If the MDT is initiated towards a specific UE (e.g. based on IMSI, IMEI-SV, etc.), the signalling based trace procedure is used, otherwise the management based trace procedure (or cell traffic trace procedure) is used. Network signalling and overall control of MDT is described in TS 32.422 [6].\nThe solutions for MDT shall take into account the following constraints:\n1.\tUE measurements\nThe UE measurement logging mechanism is an optional feature. In order to limit the impact on UE power consumption and processing, the UE measurement logging should as much as possible rely on the measurements that are available in the UE according to radio resource management enforced by the access network.\n2.\tLocation information\nThe availability of location information is subject to UE capability and/or UE implementation. Solutions requiring location information shall take into account power consumption of the UE due to the need to run its positioning components.\n",

                            "text_content": "Support of Logged MDT complies with the principles for IDLE and INACTIVE state measurements in the UE specified in TS 25.133[2], TS 36.133 [3] and TS 38.133 [16] and principles for IDLE and CONNECTED mode MBSFN measurements in the UE specified in TS 36.133 [3].\nNOTE:\tIt should be noted the established principles may result in different logged information in different UEs.\nFurthermore, measurement logging is differentiated based on UE states in idle mode i.e. camped normally, any cell selection or camped on any cell. The UE shall perform measurement logging in \"camped normally\" state and \"any cell selection\" state. In \"camped on any cell\" state the UE is not required to perform MDT measurement logging (including time and location information).\nFor Logged MDT, the configuration will always be done in cells of the same RAT type. However, measurements included in the logged MDT report comprises of measurements from the same RAT type (serving cell measurements, intra-frequency and inter-frequency neighbor cell measurements) and different RAT types (inter-RAT neighbor cell measurements).\nLogging of MBSFN measurements is only applicable to E-UTRA.\nLogged MDT measurements are configured with a MDT Measurement Configuration procedure, as shown in Figure 5.1.1.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a configuration for measuring the MDT (Mean Duration of Traces) in a Logged MDT (Mean Duration of Traces with Logged Data). The MDT measurement is crucial for understanding the performance of the network and identifying potential issues. The figure shows the various components and their connections, including the MDT measurement device, the MDT measurement software, and the network infrastructure. The MDT measurement configuration is essential for ensuring accurate and reliable data collection, which is crucial for network management and troubleshooting.\nFigure 5.1.1.1-1: MDT measurement configuration for Logged MDT\nNetwork initiates the procedure to UE in RRC Connected by sending LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message, which is used to transfer configuration parameters for Logged MDT. This is a unidirectional RRC signalling procedure.\nA release operation for logged measurement configuration in the UE is realized only by configuration replacement when the configuration is overwritten or by configuration clearance in case a duration timer stopping or expiration condition is met.\nThe logged measurement configuration consists of:\n-\tconfiguration of downlink pilot strength measurements logging for (E-)UTRA and NR.\n-\tconfiguration of MBSFN measurement logging for E-UTRA.\n-\tconfiguration of the triggering of logging events:\n-\tfor (E-)UTRAN:\n-\tperiodic measurement trigger is supported, for which the logging interval is configurable. The parameter specifies the periodicity for storing MDT measurement results. It should be configured in seconds in multiples of the applied IDLE mode DRX, i.e. multiples of 1.28s which is either a factor or multiple of the IDLE mode DRX. The UE behaviour is unspecified when the UE is configured with a DRX cycle larger than the logging interval.\n-\tfor NR:\n-\tperiodic measurement trigger is supported, for which the logging interval is configurable. The parameter specifies the periodicity for storing MDT measurement results.\n-\tfor E-UTRAN and NR:\n-\tevent-based trigger is supported, for which the logging interval is configurable, which determines periodical logging of available data (e.g. time stamp, location information), and the following two types of events are supported:\n-\tmeasurement quantity-based event L1, for which the event threshold, hysteresis, and time to trigger are configurable. If the configured time to trigger is not a multiple of the DRX cycle, then the UE uses the next multiple of DRX cycle duration that is larger than the time to trigger for evaluating the event L1;\n-\tout-of-coverage detection trigger.\nNOTE:\tThe logging configuration for event-based and periodical DL pilot strength logged measurements can be configured independently. Only one type of event can be configured to the UE.\n-\tconfiguration of the logging duration. This configuration parameter defines a timer activated at the moment of configuration, that continues independent of state changes, RAT or RPLMN change. When the timer expires the logging is stopped and the configuration is cleared (except for the parameters that are required for further reporting e.g. network absolute time stamp, trace reference, trace recording session reference and TCE Id).\n-\tnetwork absolute time stamp to be used as a time reference to UE.\n-\tTrace Reference parameter as indicated by the OAM configuration as specified in TS 32.422 [6].\n-\tTrace Recording Session Reference as indicated by the OAM configuration as specified in TS 32.422 [6].\n-\tTCE Id as indicated by the OAM configuration as specified in TS 32.422 [6].\n-\t(optionally) MDT PLMN List, indicating the PLMNs where measurement collection and log reporting is allowed. It is either the Management Based MDT PLMN List or the Signalling Based MDT PLMN List, depending on how the Logged MDT task was initiated (see 5.1.3).\n-\t(optionally) configuration of a logging area. A UE will log measurements as long as it is within the configured logging area. The scope of the logging area may consist of one of:\n-\ta list of up to 32 global cell identities for PLMN, and, for NR, additionally a list of up to 256 PNI-NPNs. If one or both of these lists are configured, the UE will only log measurements when camping in any of the cells belonging to the list of global cell identities, or in any of the cells belonging to the listed PNI-NPNs.\n-\ta list of up to 8 TAs or 8 LAs or 8 RAs for PLMN, and, for NR, a list of up to 256 PNI-NPNs. If one or both of these lists are configured, the UE will only log measurements when camping in any cell belonging to the preconfigured TA/LA/RAs.\n-\tfor NR, a list of inter-frequency neighbouring cells per frequency.\n-\tfor NR, a list of up to 256 PNI-NPNs.\n-\tfor NR, a list of up to 16 SNPNs.\n-\tfor NR, a list of up to 32 global cell identities for SNPN. If this list is configured, the UE will only log measurements when camping in any of these cells.\n-\tfor NR, a list of up to 8 TAs for SNPN. If this list is configured, the UE will only log measurements when camping in any cell belonging to the configured TAs.\n-\tThe configured logging area can span one of:\n-\tPLMNs in the MDT PLMN List. If no area is configured, the UE will log measurements throughout the PLMNs of the MDT PLMN list.\n-\tAny configured SNPN area.\n-\t(optionally) for NR, configuration of a list of neighbouring frequencies and/or cells, indicating the UE to include neighbouring cell's measurements as indicated in the list in the logged MDT report.\n-\t(optionally) for E-UTRA, configuration of target MBSFN area(s) for MBSFN measurement logging. If target MBSFN area(s) is configured, UE applies it in addition to other restrictions such as the logging area. The UE will log measurements as long as it receives MBMS service from an indicated target MBSFN area and is within the configured logging area. The target MBSFN area(s) is defined by a list of up to 8 entries, where each entry indicates a carrier frequency and optionally indicates a specific MBSFN area on a carrier frequency.\n-\t(optionally) configuration of the WLAN access point names, indicating the UE to attempt to obtain WLAN measurements associated to these access points.\n-\t(optionally) configuration of the Bluetooth beacon names, indicating the UE to attempt to obtain Bluetooth measurements associated to these beacons.\n-\t(optionally) for NR, configuration of the sensor names, indicating the UE to attempt to obtain sensor measurements.\n-\t(optionally) for E-UTRA, configuration indicating the UE to attempt to obtain uncompensated barometric pressure measurements.\n-\t(optionally) for NR, the network can use a flag to indicate if an early measurement/idle mode configuration has relevance for logged measurement purposes, indicating the UE is allowed to log the measurement results related to early measurement frequencies in the logged MDT report.\n-\t(optionally) for NR, logged MDT type flag, indicating the logged measurement configuration is the signalling based MDT (see 5.4.0).\nThe logged measurement configuration is provided in a cell by dedicated control while UE is in CONNECTED and implies:\n-\tlogged measurement configuration for downlink pilot strength measurements (or events) logging is active\n-\tin IDLE UE state in E-UTRAN, or\n-\tin IDLE mode, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states in UTRAN, or\n-\tin CELL_FACH state when second DRX cycle is used in UTRAN, or\n-\tin IDLE and INACTIVE states in NR\n-\tuntil logging duration timer expires or stops\n-\tlogged measurement configuration for MBSFN measurement logging is active\n-\tin IDLE and CONNECTED UE states in E-UTRAN\n-\tuntil logging duration timer expires or stops\n-\tlogged measurement configuration and logs are maintained when the UE is in any state as described above, despite multiple periods interrupted by UE state transitions, e.g. for downlink pilot strength measurements when the UE is in CONNECTED state for E-UTRAN and NR and CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH state when second DRX cycle is not used in UTRAN\n-\tlogged measurement configuration and logs are maintained when the UE is in any state as described above in that RAT, despite multiple periods interrupted by UE presence in another RAT\nThere is only one RAT-specific logged measurement configuration for Logged MDT in the UE. When the network provides a configuration, any previously configured logged measurement configuration will be entirely replaced by the new one. Moreover, logged measurements corresponding to the previous configuration will be cleared at the same time. It is left up to the network to retrieve any relevant data before providing a new configuration.\nNOTE:\tThe network may have to do inter-RAT coordination.\nWhen a logging area is configured, logged MDT measurements are performed as long as the UE is within this logging area. For NR, when determining whether a cell is part of the logging area, only the first entry of the plmn-IdentityList in the first entry of the PLMN-IdentityInfoList (in SIB1), and cellIdentity and TAC corresponding to the first entry of the PLMN-IdentityInfoList are considered. If no logging area is configured, logged MDT measurements are performed as long as the RPLMN is part of the MDT PLMN list. When the UE is not in the logging area or RPLMN is not part of the MDT PLMN list, the logging is suspended, i.e. the logged measurement configuration and the log are kept but measurement results are not logged. In addition, for MBSFN logged measurements, logged MDT measurements are performed in logging intervals when the UE receives MBMS service from a MBSFN area according to the target MBSFN area(s) configuration When the UE is not in the logging area or does not receive MBMS service from a MBSFN area that matches the target MBSFN area(s) configuration in the logging interval the logged measurement configuration and the log are kept but measurement results are not logged.\nNOTE:\tThe logging duration timer continues.\nIn case the new PLMN that does not belong to the MDT PLMN list provides a logged measurement configuration any previously configured logged measurement configuration and corresponding log are cleared and overwritten without being retrieved.\nIn \"camped normally\" state, a UE shall perform logging as per the logged measurement configuration. This state includes a period between cell selection criteria not being met and UE entering \"any cell selection\" state, i.e. 10 s for E-UTRA (See TS 36.133 [3]) or 12 s for UTRA (See TS 25.133 [2]) or 10s for NR (See TS 38.133 [16]).\nIn \"any cell selection\" state, a UE shall perform logging of available information (i.e. at least indicator 'anyCellSelectionDetected', time stamp, and the available location information). In \"camped on any cell\" state, the periodic logging stops. However, it should be noted that the duration timer is kept running. When the UE re-enters \"camped normally\" state and the duration timer has not expired, the periodic logging is restarted based on new DRX and logging resumes automatically (with a leap in time stamp).\nWhen an E-UTRA or NR UE detects an in-device coexistence problem that may affect the logged measurement results, the UE shall stop measurement logging, indicate in the log that an in-device coexistence problem has occurred, and keep the duration timer running. When the in-device coexistence problem is no longer present, and the duration timer has not expired, the logging resumes, with a leap in time stamp.\nFor E-UTRA MBSFN measurement logging, the UE shall perform MBSFN measurements only when receiving MBMS service, and measurement logging is performed only for logging intervals for which MBSFN measurements are available. The UE shall perform MBSFN measurements and MBSFN measurement logging in both IDLE and CONNECTED modes.\nNOTE:\tthe UE is only required to perform MBSFN measurements when receiving MBMS service of the MBSFN area(s) targeted for logging.\nFor WLAN measurement logging and Bluetooth measurement logging, the UE shall perform WLAN and Bluetooth measurements, respectively, only when indicated in the corresponding configuration. The measurement logging is performed only for logging intervals for which WLAN and Bluetooth measurements are available, respectively.\nThe measurement quantities for downlink pilot strength measurement logging are fixed and consist of both RSRP and RSRQ for EUTRA, both RSCP and Ec/No for UTRA FDD, P-CCPCH RSCP for UTRA 1.28 Mcps TDD, Rxlev for GERAN, and Pilot Pn Phase and Pilot Strength for CDMA2000 if the serving cell is EUTRAN cell, and both RSRP and RSRQ for NR.\nFor NR, in addition to the logged measurement quantities of the camped cell, the best beam index (SSB Index) as along with the best beam RSRP/RSRQ are logged as well as the 'number of good beams' (the number of SSBs that are above the configured threshold i.e., absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation, if configured by the network) associated to the cells within the R value range (which is configured by network for cell reselection) of the highest ranked cell as part of the beam level measurements. Sensor measurements are logged if available.\nFor E-UTRA, uncompensated barometric pressure measurements are logged if available.\nThe measurement quantities for E-UTRA MBSFN measurement logging are fixed and consist of MBSFN RSRP, MBSFN RSRQ, BLER for signalling and BLER for data per MCH, in addition to the measurement quantities for downlink pilot strength measurements.\nThe measurement quantities for WLAN measurement logging are fixed and consist of BSSID, SSID, HESSID of WLAN APs. If configured by the network, optionally available RSSI and RTT can be included.\nThe measurement quantity for Bluetooth measurement logging is fixed and consists of MAC address of Bluetooth beacons. If configured by the network, optionally available RSSI can be included.\nUE collects MDT measurements and continues logging according to the logged measurement configuration until UE memory reserved for MDT is full. In this case the UE stops logging, stops the log duration timer and starts the 48 hour timer.\nA UE configured to perform Logged MDT downlink pilot strength measurements indicates the availability of Logged MDT measurements, by means of a one bit, in RRCConnectionSetupComplete or RRCSetupComplete or RRCConnectionResumeComplete or RRCResumeComplete message during connection establishment. Furthermore, the indicator (possibly updated) shall be provided within:\n-\tE-UTRAN handover and re-establishment;\n-\tUTRAN procedures involving the change of SRNC (SRNC relocation), CELL UPDATE, URA UPDATE messages as well as MEASUREMENT REPORT message in case of state transition to CELL_FACH without CELL UPDATE;\n-\tNR re-establishment, reconfiguration.\nThe UE includes the indication in one of these messages at every transition to RRC Connected mode even though the logging period has not ended, upon connection to RAT which configured the UE to perform Logged MDT measurements and RPLMN which is equal to a PLMN in the MDT PLMN list.\nA E-UTRA UE configured to perform Logged MDT MBSFN measurements indicates the availability of Logged MDT MBSFN measurements, by means of an indicator, in RRCConnectionSetupComplete message during connection establishment. The indicator (possibly updated) shall be provided within E-UTRAN also at handover and re-establishment, except when the logged measurement configuration is active in CONNECTED mode, i.e. except when the logging campaign is still ongoing.\nA E-UTRA UE configured to perform Logged MDT WLAN measurements indicates the availability of Logged MDT WLAN measurements, by means of an indicator, in RRCConnectionSetupComplete message or RRCConnectionResumeComplete message during connection establishment. Furthermore, the indicator can be included in some uplink RRC messages, i.e., RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message, RRCConnectionReestablishmentComplete message, or UEInformationResponse message, at every transition to RRC Connected mode even though the logging period has not ended.\nA E-UTRA UE configured to perform Logged MDT Bluetooth measurements indicates the availability of Logged MDT Bluetooth measurements, by means of an indicator, in RRCConnectionSetupComplete message or RRCConnectionResumeComplete message during connection establishment. Furthermore, the indicator can be included in some uplink RRC messages, i.e., RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message, RRCConnectionReestablishmentComplete message, or UEInformationResponse message, at every transition to RRC Connected mode even though the logging period has not ended.\nA NR UE configured to perform Logged MDT WLAN measurements indicates the availability of Logged MDT WLAN measurements, by means of an indicator, in RRCSetupComplete message or RRCResumeComplete message during connection establishment. Furthermore, the indicator can be included in some uplink RRC messages, i.e., RRCReconfigurationComplete message, RRCReestablishmentComplete message, or UEInformationResponse message, at every transition to RRC Connected mode even though the logging period has not ended.\nA NR UE configured to perform Logged MDT Bluetooth measurements indicates the availability of Logged MDT Bluetooth measurements, by means of an indicator, in RRCSetupComplete message or RRCResumeComplete message during connection establishment. Furthermore, the indicator can be included in some uplink RRC messages, i.e., RRCReconfigurationComplete message, RRCReestablishmentComplete message, or UEInformationResponse message, at every transition to RRC Connected mode even though the logging period has not ended.\nAn indicator shall be also provided in UEInformationResponse message during MDT report retrieval in case the UE has not transferred the total log in one RRC message in order to indicate the remaining data availability.\nThe UE will not indicate the availability of MDT measurements in another RAT or in a PLMN that is not in the MDT PLMN list.\nThe network may decide to retrieve the logged measurements based on this indication. In case Logged MDT measurements are retrieved before the completion of the pre-defined logging duration, the reported measurement results are deleted, but MDT measurement logging will continue according to ongoing logged measurement configuration.\nIn case the network does not retrieve Logged MDT measurements, UE should store non-retrieved measurements for 48 hours from the moment the duration timer for logging expired. There is no requirement to store non-retrieved data beyond 48 hours. In addition, all logged measurement configuration and the log shall be removed by the UE at switch off or detach.\nFor Logged MDT the measurement reporting is triggered by an on-demand mechanism, i.e. the UE is asked by the network to send the collected measurement logs via RRC signalling. UE Information procedure defined in TS 25.331 [4] and TS 36.331 [5] and TS 38.331 [15] is used to request UE to send the collected measurement logs. The reporting may occur in different cells than which the logged measurement configuration is signalled.\nTransport of Logged MDT reports in multiple RRC messages is supported. With every request, the network may receive a part of the total UE log. To indicate the reported data is a segment, the UE shall include data availability indicator in UEInformatonResponse message to convey the information that further measurement information is available, as specified in 5.1.1.3.1. In multiple RRC transmissions for segmented Logged MDT reporting, FIFO order is followed, i.e. the UE should provide oldest available measurement entries in earliest message. There is no requirement specified on the size of particular reporting parts. However, each reported part should be \"self-decodable\", i.e. interpretable even in case all the other parts are not available.\nThe UE shall send an empty report when retrieval is attempted and the RPLMN is not in the MDT PLMN list.\nFor downlink pilot strength measurements, the logged measurement report consists of measurement results for the serving cell (the measurement quantity), available UE measurements performed in idle or inactive for intra-frequency/inter-frequency/inter-RAT, time stamp and location information.\nFor E-UTRA MBSFN measurements logging, the logged measurement report consists of MBSFN measurement results from target MBSFN area(s), if configured, and available downlink pilot strength measurement results. Inter-RAT downlink pilot strength measurements are not required to be logged.\nFor WLAN and Bluetooth measurement logging, the logged measurement reports consist of WLAN and Bluetooth measurement results, respectively.\nThe number of neighbouring cells to be logged is limited by a fixed upper limit per frequency for each category below. The UE should log the measurement results for the neighbouring cells, if available, up to:\n-\t6 for intra-frequency neighbouring cells;\n-\t3 for inter-frequency neighbouring cells per frequency;\n-\t3 for GERAN neighbouring cells per frequency;\n-\t3 for UTRAN (if non-serving) neighbouring cells per frequency;\n-\t3 for E-UTRAN (if non-serving) neighbouring cells per frequency;\n-\t3 for NR (if non-serving) neighbouring cells per frequency;\n-\t3 for CDMA2000 (if serving is E-UTRA) neighbouring cells per frequency;\n-\t32 for WLAN APs;\n-\t32 for Bluetooth Beacons.\nNOTE:\tUE in NR IDLE or INACTIVE state will not log measurements from UMTS or GSM.\nThe measurement reports for neighbour cells consist of:\n-\tPhysical cell identity of the logged cell;\n-\tCarrier frequency;\n-\tRSRP and RSRQ for EUTRA and NR;\n-\tRSCP and Ec/No for UTRA FDD,\n-\tP-CCPCH RSCP for UTRA 1.28 Mcps TDD;\n-\tRxlev for GERAN;\n-\tPilot Pn Phase and Pilot Strength for CDMA2000;\n-\tRSSI and RTT for WLAN APs;\n-\tRSSI for Bluetooth Beacons.\nFor any logged cell (serving or neighbour), latest available measurement result made for cell reselection purposes is included in the log only if it has not already been reported.\nWhile logging neighbour cells measurements, the UE shall determine a fixed number of best cells based on the measurement quantity used for ranking during cell reselection per frequency or RAT.\nThe MBSFN measurement results consist of, per MBSFN area where MBMS service is received:\n-\tMBSFN area identity;\n-\tCarrier frequency;\n-\tMBSFN RSRP;\n-\tMBSFN RSRQ;\n-\tMCH BLER for signalling;\n-\tMCH BLER for data, and related MCH index.\nThe WLAN measurement results consist of, per wireless network served by the WLAN AP:\n-\tBSSID, SSID and HESSID;\n-\tRSSI for WLAN;\n-\tRTT.\nThe Bluetooth measurement results consist of, per wireless network served by the Bluetooth beacon:\n-\tMAC address;\n-\tRSSI for Bluetooth.\nMeasurements are performed in accordance with requirements defined in TS 25.133 [2] and TS 36.133 [3] and TS 38.133 [16].\nThe measurement report is self contained, i.e. the RAN node is able to interpret the Logged MDT reporting results even if it does not have access to the logged measurement configuration. Each measurement report also contains the necessary parameters for the network to be able to route the reports to the correct TCE and for OAM to identify what is reported. The parameters are sent to the UE in the logged configuration message, see clause 5.1.1.1.1.\nFor each MDT measurement the UE includes a relative time stamp. The base unit for time information in the Logged MDT reports is the second. In the log associated to periodical logging configuration, the time stamp indicates the point in time when periodic logging timer expires. The time stamp is counted in seconds from the moment the logged measurement configuration is received at the UE, relative to the absolute time stamp received within the configuration. The absolute time stamp is the current network time at the point when Logged MDT is configured to the UE. The UE echoes back this absolute reference time. The time format for Logged MDT report is: YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\nLocation information is based on available location information in the UE. Thus, the Logged MDT measurements are tagged by the UE with location data in the following manner:\n-\tECGI, Cell-Id or NCGI in TS 38.300 [22] of the serving cell when the measurement was taken is always included in E-UTRAN, UTRAN or NR respectively;\n-\tDetailed location information (e.g. GNSS location information) is included if available in the UE when the measurement was taken. If detailed location information is available, the reporting shall consist of latitude and longitude. Depending on availability, altitude, uncertainty and confidence may be also additionally included. UE tags available detailed location information only once with upcoming measurement sample, and then the detailed location information is discarded, i.e. the validity of detailed location information is implicitly assumed to be one logging interval;\n-\tSensor information (i.e. uncompensated barometric pressure measurement (for NR and E-UTRA), UE speed and UE orientation (only in NR)) can be included, if available in the UE when the measurement was taken.\nNOTE:\tThe neighbour cell measurement information that is provided by the UE may be used to determine the UE location (RF fingerprint).\nDepending on location information availability, measurement log/report consists of:\n-\ttime information, RF measurements, RF fingerprints; or\n-\ttime information, RF measurements, detailed location information (e.g. GNSS location information);\ntime information, RF measurements, detailed location information, sensor information.\nFor Logged MDT in IDLE, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH states and CELL_FACH state when second DRX cycle is used and INACTIVE, no need is identified to transfer an MDT context (any related configuration information about measurement and reporting) between (e/g)NBs/RNCs if corresponding MDT configuration has already been configured to UE. In addition, MDT context is assumed to be released in the RAN nodes when the UE is in IDLE and INACTIVE if corresponding MDT configuration has already been configured to UE.\nFor UE in INACTIVE, the MDT context handling during cell reselection as described in 5.4.2 apply.\n",

The UE also provides available neighbour cell measurement information that may be used to determine the UE location (RF fingerprint). ECGI, Cell-Id, or CellIdentity of the serving cell when the measurement was taken is always assumed known in E-UTRAN, UTRAN or NR respectively.\nThe location information which comes with UE radio measurements for MDT can be correlated with other MDT measurements, e.g. RAN measurements. For MDT measurements where UE location information is provided separately, it is assumed that the correlation of location information and MDT measurements should be done in the TCE based on time-stamps.\nWhen the gNB becomes aware of an in-device coexistence interference problem for NR reported by the UE, this information should be forwarded to the TCE which may correlate impacted measurements (e.g. RAN measurements M4, M5, M6, M7) with the in-device coexistence interference problem.\nThe measurements configured in the UE for Immediate MDT should fully comply with the transferring and reconfiguration principles for the current measurements configured in the UE for RRM purpose during handover (including conformance with Rel-8 and Rel-9).\nThe target node releases the measurements configured in the UE for immediate MDT which are no longer needed based on any MDT trace configuration it receives or does not receive.\nIn addition, MDT configuration handling during handover and UE context retrieval depends on MDT initiation from OAM defined in clause 5.1.3:\n-\tThe MDT configuration configured by management based trace function will not propagate during handover.\n-\tFor LTE, the MDT configuration received by signalling based trace messages for a specific UE will propagate during intra-PLMN handover, and may propagate during inter-PLMN handover if the Signalling Based MDT PLMN List is available and includes the target PLMN.

The detailed procedures to transfer the MDT configurations to RAN are specified in TS 32.422 [6].\nFor signalling based MDT within a PLMN, the CN shall not initiate MDT towards a particular user unless it is allowed.\nFor management based MDT within a PLMN, the CN indicates to the RAN whether MDT is allowed to be configured by the RAN for this user considering e.g. user consent and roaming status (see TS 32.422 [6]), by providing management based MDT allowed information. For E-UTRAN/UTRAN, the MDT allowed information consists of the Management Based MDT Allowed indication and optionally the Management Based MDT PLMN List.

One sample is logged each measurement collection period, where one sample corresponds to a measurement period as specified in TS 36.133 [3].\n-\tM4: Data Volume measurement separately for DL and UL, per QCI per UE, by eNB, see TS 36.314 [13].\n-\tM5: Scheduled IP Throughput for MDT measurement separately for DL and UL, per RAB per UE and per UE for the DL, per UE for the UL, by eNB, see TS 36.314 [13]. QCI values of the RABs that have contributed to a measurement value are logged with the measurement values.\n-\tM6: Packet Delay measurement, separately for DL and UL, per QCI per UE, see UL PDCP Delay, by the UE, and Packet Delay in the DL per QCI, by the eNB, TS 36.314 [13].\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE does not detect any UL PDCP delay based on the delay threshold and delay report interval configured by the network, the UE does not report any UL PDCP delay measurement within that period.\nNOTE 2:\tA UE in EN-DC mode of operation can be configured with UL PDCP Packet Average Delay (ul-DelayValueConfig), if UE is capable of performing the UL average PDCP queueing delay.\n-\tM7: Packet Loss rate measurement, separately for DL and UL per QCI per UE, by the eNB, see Packet Loss rate in the UL and Packet Uu Loss rate in the DL TS 36.314 [13].\n-\tM8: RSSI measurement by UE, see TS 36.331 [5].\n-\tM9: RTT measurement by UE, see TS 36.331 [5].\nMeasurement collection triggers:\n-\tFor M1:\n-\tEvent-triggered measurement reports according to existing RRM configuration for events A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 A6, B1 or B2\n-\tPeriodic, A2 event-triggered, or A2 event triggered periodic measurement report according to MDT specific measurement configuration.\n-\tFor M2:\n-\tReception of Power Headroom Report (PHR) according to existing RRM configuration.\nNOTE 3:\tPHR is carried by MAC signalling. Thus, the existing mechanism of PHR transmission applies, see TS 36.321 [10].\n-\tFor M3:\n-\tEnd of measurement collection period\n-\tFor M4:\n-\tEnd of measurement collection period.\n-\tFor M5:\n-\tEnd of measurement collection period.\n-\tFor M6:\n-\tEnd of measurement collection period.\n-\tFor M7:\n-\tEnd of measurement collection period.\n-\tFor M8:\n-\tAssociated to M1 and/or M6 related measurement reporting triggers.\n-\tFor M9:\n-\tAssociated to M1 and/or M6 related measurement reporting triggers.\nThe Radio Link Failure report contains information related to the latest connection failure experienced by the UE. The connection failure can be Radio Link Failure (RLF) or Handover Failure (HOF). The contents of the RLF report and the procedure for retrieving it by an eNB are described in TS 36.300 [12] or by an NG-RAN are described in TS 38.300 [22].\nRLF reports can be collected by OAM. Upon RLF/HOF detection in the UE, rlfReport defined in TS 36.331 [5] also includes available location information on where RLF occurred, i.e. if detailed location information (e.g. GNSS location information) is available the reported location information in rlfReport consists of:\n-\tLatitude, longitude (mandatory)\n-\tAltitude (conditional on availability)\n-\tVelocity (conditional on availability)\n-\tUncertainty (conditional on availability)\n-\tConfidence (conditional on availability)\n-\tDirection (conditional on availability).\nAs an indication of impact to MMTEL calls the UE indicates in the radio link failure report whether a radio bearer with QCI 1 was established when radio link failure was detected.\nRLF reports may also include available WLAN measurement results and/or Bluetooth measurement results for calculating UE location.\nIf available, the UE can indicate NR neighbor cell measurements in measurements results.\nThe M1 measurements are tagged by the UE with location data in the following manner:\n-\tDetailed location information (e.g. GNSS location information) is included if available in the UE when the measurement was taken. If detailed location information is available, the reporting shall consist of latitude and longitude. Depending on availability, altitude, uncertainty and confidence may be also additionally included. The UE should include the available detailed location information only once. If the detailed location information is obtained by GNSS positioning method, GNSS time information shall be included. For both event based and periodic reporting (see 5.2.1.1), the detailed location information is included if the report is transmitted within the validity time after the detailed location information was obtained. The validity evaluation of detailed location information is left to UE implementation.\n-\tTo support UE location information in SCG failure, the location information (i.e. commonLocationInfo, see TS 38.331 [15] and WLAN and BT information, if available) is included in SCGFailureInformation message, see TS 36.331 [5].\nFor immediate MDT, the eNB can request the UE to attempt to make GNSS location information available. Standalone GNSS is used as the default baseline. It is desired that the UE provides fresh location information with each immediate MDT measurement report. The details how this is achieved is up to UE implementation.\nThe eNB may use an Enhanced Cell ID mechanism for location. The eNB forwards the raw E-CID specific measurements to the TCE. When E-CID positioning is requested, the eNB may choose to not use E-CID positioning for collected measurement for which the UE provides detailed location information.\n",

Some examples of use cases of coverage problem monitoring and detection are described in the following:\n-\tCoverage hole: A coverage hole is an area where the signal level SNR (or SINR) of both serving and allowed neighbor cells is below the level needed to maintain basic service (SRB & DL common channels), i.e. coverage of PDCCH. Coverage holes are usually caused by physical obstructions such as new buildings, hills, or by unsuitable antenna parameters, or just inadequate RF planning. UE in coverage hole will suffer from call drop and radio link failure. Multi-band and/or Multi-RAT UEs may go to other network layer instead.\n-\tWeak coverage: Weak coverage occurs when the signal level SNR (or SINR) of serving cell is below the level needed to maintain a planned performance requirement (e.g. cell edge bit-rate).\n-\tPilot Pollution: In areas where coverage of different cells overlap a lot, interference levels are high, power levels are high, energy consumption is high and cell performance may be low. This problem phenomenon has been called \"pilot pollution\", and the problem can be addressed by reducing coverage of cells. Typically in this situation UEs may experience high SNR to more than one cell and high interference levels.\n-\tOvershoot coverage: Overshoot occurs when coverage of a cell reaches far beyond what is planned. It can occur as an \"island\" of coverage in the interior of another cell, which may not be a direct neighbor. Reasons for overshoot may be reflections in buildings or across open water, lakes etc. UEs in this area may suffer call drops or high interference. Possible actions to improve the situation include changing the coverage of certain cells and mobility by exclude-listing of certain cells.\n-\tCoverage mapping: There should be knowledge about the signal levels in the cell areas in order to get a complete view for the coverage and be able to assess the signal levels that can be provided in the network. This means that there should be measurements collected in all parts of the network, and not just in the areas where there are potential coverage issues.\n-\tUL coverage: Poor UL coverage might impact user experience in terms of call setup failure / call drop / poor UL voice quality. Therefore, coverage should be balanced between uplink and downlink connections. Possible UL coverage optimization comprises adapting the cellular coverage by changing the site configuration (antennas) but also about adjusting the UL related parameters in the way that they allow optimized usage of UL powers in different environments.\n-\tCell boundary mapping: There should be knowledge about the location of (intra/inter RAT) cell boundaries in order to compare to the expected/planned network setting. Poor handover performance may be caused by changed cell boundaries due to changes in the physical condition of the surrounding area, e.g., construction of new buildings, bridge or tunnel near the handover area.\n-\tCoverage mapping for pico cell in CA scenario: As a realization of CA scenario 4 in TS 36.300 [12], pico cell may be deployed in area where high traffic occurs. The location where a pico cell is available to be added as an SCell may show whether the deployment of pico cell is according to the needs of capacity increase.\n\nThe MDT data reported from UEs and the RAN may be used to verify Quality of Service, assess user experience from RAN perspective, and to assist network capacity extension. Use cases are described in the following:\n-\tTraffic Location: MDT functionality to obtain information of where data traffic is transferred within a cell.\n-\tUser QoS Experience: MDT functionality to assess the QoS experience for a specific UE together with location information.\n-\tData Throughput measurements can be collected, aiming to reflect QoS for bandwidth limited traffic.\n-\tFor E-UTRA, Data Loss and Latency measurements can be collected, aiming to reflect QoS for conversational traffic.\nThis annex provides information on measurements that are used for MDT and are not specified elsewhere.\nThroughput measurement for UMTS. The throughput is measured on PDCP or RLC level. A measurement value for a UE and each RAB of the UE is provided each measurement period, except if the value is zero. The measurement is performed separately for UL and DL, and is performed for PS RABs. Idle periods shall not be taken into account, when there is no data buffered or no data being transmitted.\nData Volume measurement for UMTS. Data Volume is measured on PDCP or RLC (without Layer 2 overhead). A measurement value for a QoS class for a UE is provided each measurement period, except if the value is zero, where the QoS class is one of conversational, interactive, streaming or background. The measurement is performed separately for UL and DL, and is performed for PS RABs.\nThe MDT data reported from UEs may be used to verify signal strength, signal quality and block error rates for MBSFN reception, to support network verification, re-planning of MBSFN areas, and optimization of MBSFN operation parameters.\n\n\n\n",
