                            "text_content": "This solution addresses KI#1 and describes a solution for how to provide differentiated service (e.g. QoS and charging) for Non-3GPP devices connected behind a 5G RG.\nThe N3GPP devices are locally authenticated by the 5G-RG using such as pre-shared secret etc. As such, it is invisible to the 5G network though 5G-RG is subscribed to the 5G-Core. Differentiated QoS can still be provided by using local configuration in the 5G-RG and based on DNN / S-NSSAI for the 5G RG's PDU Sessions.\nThis solution allows for traffic segregation on both PDU session / S-NSSAI and per QoS flow basis. We assume that, when it is per PDU session basis, the default QoS associated with the PDU session can be different based on the DNN and S-NSSAI. 5G-RG can set up distinct PDU Session for each N3GPP device or a group of N3GPP devices based on local configuration in the 5G-RG. For e.g. consider admin settings on the 5G-RG where the admin can group N3GPP devices based on mac addresses and set different QoS levels/priority levels for a group of N3GPP devices. Based on these local configurations the 5G-RG can provide distinct PDU session for each N3GPP device. When these devices have common QoS sessions and DNN / S-NSSAI to be served then, these devices are classified into \"connectivity groups\" where each group connects to the 5G-RG using a separate physical or virtual port. These ports could for e.g. refer to a separate physical Ethernet ports and/or a separate WLAN SSIDs and the groups may also be separated on the LAN behind the RG using VLANs.\nEach physical/virtual port (connectivity group) is then mapped to a separate PDU Session that is established by the 5G-RG based on existing procedures defined in TS 23.316 [5]. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 6.1.1-1. Only the case where 5G-RG connects via wireline access is shown in the Figure. The 5G-RG may also connect via 3GPP access (not shown).\nIn this scenario, non-3GPP devices are behind 5G-RG based on connectivity groups, as depicted in Figure 6.1.1-1. The figure illustrates the network architecture, highlighting the presence of non-3GPP devices and their connectivity groups. The non-3GPP devices are represented by dashed lines, while the connectivity groups are shown in solid lines. The figure also includes a base station (gNB) and a user equipment (UE) to illustrate the network's structure.\nFigure 6.1.1-1: Example scenario for Non-3GPP devices behind 5G-RG based on connectivity groups\nThe 5G-RG is configured with the (virtual) port information (e.g. VLANs and SSIDs) based on TR-69, TR-360 and TR-181. URSP rules can be provided to the RG to indicate what PDU Sessions to establish (DNN, S-NSSAI etc). Alternatively, the 5GRG can be manually configured by the admin to form the connectivity groups.\nThe cross-connect between virtual ports and DNN/S-NSSAI can be configured using URSP and TR-69/TR-181. In case of URSP, VLAN IDs and Connection Capabilities can be used as Traffic Descriptors, assuming that the 5G-RG has a corresponding configuration of virtual ports with the same VLAN IDs or Connection Capabilities. It is also possible for operators to define its own set of Connection Capabilities applicable to 5WWC scenarios using the operator specific value range defined by CT WG1.\nIn addition, it is assumed that the cross-connect between a \"virtual port\" and DNN/S-NSSAI can be configured via TR-69/TR-181 (to be verified with BBF).\nIt is assumed that the non-3GPP devices are manually configured to use a specific SSID or connect to a certain Ethernet port on the 5G-RG. No new 5GS mechanism is added to enforce or authorize a specific non-3GPP device to access a certain SSID or port on the RG. It is assumed that the end-users of the local network provisions only authorized devices with the required Wi-Fi credentials and ensures that only authorized devices connect to physical ports. MAC address filters may be installed on the 5G-RG for each logical port to ensure that only devices with certain MAC addresses can connect to each logical port on the 5G-RG.\nThe connectivity groups are fully separated from each other and differentiation of charging and QoS is provided via existing mechanisms. The solution also allows isolation of the connectivity groups into separate network slices, i.e. with separate N-SSAIs for each PDU Session. Differentiated charging for sectors/departments can be enabled by assigning separate DNNs/N-SSAIs to them.\n",

The solution is based on existing solutions described in TS 23.316 [5] clause 4.10 (UE connecting to TNGF via RG) and TS 23.316 [5] informative Annex A (UE connecting to N3IWG via RG). The solution assumes that the UE is capable of handling the 5G NAS protocol over WLAN.\nAn RG connecting via W-5GAN or NG-RAN access towards 5GC can provide connectivity for a UE behind the RG to access an N3IWF or TNGF. It is assumed that the UE is 5GC capable, i.e. supports untrusted non-3GPP access and/or trusted non-3GPP access. This allows the RG, W-5GAN and the RG's connectivity via 5GC to together act as untrusted/trusted N3GPP access to support UEs behind the RG.\nWhen FN-RG/5G-RG is serving a UE, the control and user plane packets of the UE is transported using a FN-RG/5G-RG IP PDU session and then from PSA UPF of that PDU session to an IWF. A single FN-RG/5G-RG IP PDU session can be used to serve multiple UEs.\nFigure 6.2.1-1 shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a 5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF where the combination of 5G-RG, W-5GAN and UPF serving the 5G-RG/FN-RG is acting as an untrusted Non-3GPP access network.\nFigure 6.2.1-2 shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a 5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via TNGF where the combination of 5G-RG, W-5GAN and UPF serving the 5G-RG is acting as a trusted Non-3GPP access network.\nNOTE  1:\tFN-RG and W-5GAN acting as trusted Non-3GPP access is not considered since it is assumed that FN-RG does not support EAP-based access control (e.g. 802.1X).\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RAN architecture with an untrusted N3GPP access point (UE) behind a 5G-RAN network. The architecture includes a 5G-RAN core, a 5G-RAN radio, and a 5G-RAN radio access network (RAN). The figure illustrates the use of untrusted N3GPP access points, which are used to provide untrusted network access to the 5G-RAN network. The figure also shows the use of untrusted N3GPP access points to provide untrusted network access to the 5G-RAN network.\nFigure 6.2.1-1: Architecture for UE behind 5G-RG using untrusted N3GPP access\nThe 5G-RG can be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN, NG-RAN or via both accesses. The UE can be connected to 5GC via untrusted non-3GPP access (via 5G-RG), NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nThe figure depicts a non- roaming architecture for an UE behind a 5G-RGi using trusted N3GPP access, illustrating the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques to enhance network capacity and reliability.\nFigure 6.2.1-2: Non-roaming architecture for UE behind 5G-RG using trusted N3GPP access\nThe TNGF and Ta reference point are defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 2:\tThe reference architecture in figure 6.2.1-1 and 6.2.1-2 only shows the architecture and the network functions directly connected to W-5GAN or TNGF/N3IWF, and other parts of the architecture are the same as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe salient features of this solutions are the following:\n-\tFor untrusted non-3GPP access:\n-\tUE connects to the overlay 5G network using the untrusted non-3GPP access approach as illustrated in Annex A of TS 23.316 [5].\n-\tFor trusted non-3GPP access:\n-\tUE connects to the overlay 5G network using the trusted non-3GPP access approach as illustrated in clause 4.10 of TS 23.316 [5].\n-\tIn addition to being connected to the underlay 5G network, the 5G-RG also acts as TNAP with respect to the TNGF in the overlay network i.e. it has an established Ta reference point with the TNGF.\n-\tFor NWu scenario, the overlay and the underlay network as described in clause D.7 of TS 23.501 [2] may be administrated by different operator's domain, hence an SLA can be used (as defined clause D.7 of TS 23.501 [2]). If the same operator deploys both overlay and the underlay network, e.g. as in the case for trusted non-3GPP access (NWt), there is no need for SLA but that operator's network configuration determines how to handle the DSCP markings in the underlay network.\n-\tThe N3IWF/TNGF in the overlay network translates the QoS request received over N2 into DSCP marking that is applied to the outer header of the IPsec tunnel encapsulation.\n-\tThe N3IWF/TNGF may inform the UE about the DSCP marking to apply in the uplink as defined in clauses 4.12 and 4.12a of TS 23.502 [3].\nSupport for QoS differentiation can be achieved in a similar way as it is handled when a UE connects to a PLMN via SNPN (clause 5.30.2.7 and clause D.7 of TS 23.501 [2],). Also differentiated charging, both in the RG's PLMN and in the UE's PLMN, can be achieved based on existing mechanisms. This is further described below.\nThe solution allows a differentiation based on whether the UEs PDU Session is established via an RG or not via an RG of a certain PLMN. In addition, in case of trusted non-3GPP access solution is used, the solution supports a differentiation based on individual RG subscriptions, e.g. differentiation between whether a UE connects via one specific RG or another specific RG of the same PLMN. This can be used to determine e.g. whether a UE is considered as host or guest of the local network of 5G-RG. This is supported by using location-based policies where PCF takes the User Location Information into account in the policy decisions. This is further described in the procedure in clause 6.2.2.\nQoS differentiation in the RG's PDU Session can be provided on per-IPsec Child Security Association basis. The UE's N3IWF/TNGF determines the IPsec child SAs as defined in clauses 4.12 and 4.12a of TS 23.502 [3]. The N3IWF/TNGF is preconfigured by the UE's PLMN to allocate different IPsec child SAs for QoS Flows with different QoS profiles.\nTo support QoS differentiation in the W-5GAN, the mapping rules between the RG's 5GC and the UE's 5GC (where N3IWF is located) are assumed to be governed by an SLA (or network configuration in case of single operator) including:\n1)\tmapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs on NWu and the corresponding QoS, and\n2)\tN3IWF/TNGF IP address(es) in the UE's 5GC.\nNOTE 3:\tIf UEs behind RG belong to different PLMNs that may negotiate to RG's PLMN with several SLAs, the QoS differentiation can be still supported by applying the mapping rules.\nThe mapping rules may be provisioned to RG by RG's PLMN during PDU session establishment and network initiated PDU Session Modification based on the RG's subscription. The RG's PCF/SMF may e.g. provide QoS rules for the available mappings as determined by the SLA. In case of the mapping rules of N3IWF/TNGF IP address is not configured at the RG when receiving packets with the N3IWF/TNGF IP address, the RG may buffer the received packets and send the target N3IWF/TNGF IP address and indication of requesting mapping rules to SMF/PCF. The RG can be provisioned with the mapping rules by SMF/PCF.\nWhen RG receives packets from the UE, the mapping of DSCP markings and the corresponding QoS may be determined based on the N3IWF/TNGF IP address(es) carried in the packets. The RG may translate the DSCP marking in the outer header of IPsec tunnel encapsulation into QoS parameters based on the mapping of DSCP markings and the corresponding QoS.\nThe non-alteration of the DSCP field on NWu is also assumed to be governed by an SLA and by transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The packet detection filters in the RG's UPF can be based on the N3IWF IP address and the DSCP markings on NWu.\nIt is assumed that the same set of DSCP values and corresponding QoS are applicable independent of whether UE-requested or network-initiated QoS is used.\nTo enable differentiated charging similar mechanisms are applied. It is assumed that the awareness of N3IWG/TNGF IP addresses as well as RG PDU Session IP addresses are governed by SLA between UE's 5GC and RG's 5GC (or network configuration in case of single operator).\nIn the RG's PLMN, the IP addresses belonging to N3IWF/TNGF in UE's PLMN can be provided in packet filters to the RG's UPF together with a separate Rating Group. In addition, to enable service-based differentiation, packet detection filters in the RG's UPF can also include the DSCP markings on NWu. This is similar to how QoS differentiation is done and would enable differentiated charging in the RG's PDU Session on a per-IPSec Child Security Association basis.\nIn the UE's PLMN, the N6 IP addresses available on the DNN to which the RG establishes its PDU Session are assumed to be known based on SLA (or network configuration in case of single operator). When the UE connects to N3IWF/TNGF, one of these IP addresses will be used as the UE's local IP address (i.e. N6 address of the RG's PDU Session). This local UE IP address will be known to the UE's SMF since it is part of the ULI provided from N3IWF/TNGF to AMF and forwarded to SMF. The ULI is also provided to the UE's PCF. It is thus possible for SMF/PCF to apply differentiated charging (e.g. different Rating Groups) when the UE is accessing N3IWF/TNGF via W-5GAN.\nQoS differentiation in the underlying 5G-RG's PDU Session can be provided on per-IPsec Child Security Association basis by using the network requested PDU Session Modification procedure described in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\nTo support QoS differentiation in the underlying 5G-RG's PDU Session, the PCF can generate separate PCC rules based on the DSCP values and the corresponding QoS. Based on this, the SMF initiates PDU Session modification procedure for an IPSec SA based on mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs and the corresponding QoS in the PLMN. The packet detection filters in the underlying 5G-RG's PDU Session can be based on the N3IWF/TNGF IP address and the DSCP markings.\nIf there is no mapping rules involving the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs when 5G-RG receives the packets from the UE, the 5G-RG may initiate PDU Session modification procedure. The DSCP values and the target IP address on the IP header of the IPsec child SAs may be included in the PDU Session Modification Request. The SMF may establish corresponding QoS flow based on the mapping rules between the RG's 5GC and the UE's 5GC. The SMF may also update the provisioned mapping rules in 5G-RG so as to include the DSCP markings together with the N3IWF/TNGF IP address.\n",

Optionally, non-3GPP indication is also included.\nThe 5G-RG determines to request to establish a QoS flow for the category of non-3GPP devices according to the session policy for non-3GPP devices.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that the 5G-RG already establishes a PDU session.\n3.\tThe AMF sends N11 message to the SMF and forwards the PDU Session Modification Request.\n4.\tThe SMF reports non-3GPP device category identifier to the PCF by initiating the SM Association Modification procedure.\nThe PCF provides QoS rules for the category of non-3GPP devices to the SMF.\n5.\tFor Ethernet PDU Session type, the SMF updates the UPF with N4 Rules by indicating that this PDU session is also used to transfer the traffic related to the non-3GPP device's MAC address.\n6.\tThe SMF generates PDU Session Modification message including the QoS rules for the non-3GPP device.\nThe SMF sends N11 message to the AMF, including the PDU Session Modification message, 5G-RG ID and non-3GPP device category identifier.\n7.\tThe AMF sends NAS message to the 5G-RG, forwarding the PDU Session Modification message to the 5G-RG.\nThe 5G-RG maps the traffic of the non-3GPP device to the QoS flow of this PDU session according to the received QoS rule.\nWhen the 5G-RG detects disconnection of the non-3GPP device, if there is no traffic of other non-3GPP devices maps to the QoS flow, the 5G-RG initiates PDU Session Modification procedure to release such QoS flow.\nThe figure depicts a 5G-RG (Rogers Group) session setup for one category of non-3GPP devices, illustrating the process of establishing a PDU (Point-to-Point) session. The figure includes various components such as the 5G-RG, the PDU, and the non-3GPP devices, all connected to the 5G network.

The figure shows the various components involved, such as the SMF initiator, the PDU session, and the network interface controller (NIC). The figure also includes a diagram of the network topology, highlighting the connections between the devices and the network.\nFigure 6.4.2.2-1 SMF initiated PDU Session Modification for a non-3GPP device category\n0.

In this option, the solution for trusted N3GPP is used as baseline but with the additional property that the service is offered via a wireline access and a 5G-RG. This solution can distinguish the 5GC-capable UE role and apply the different QoS and charging policy for the different categories of devices, for example for 5GC capable UE considered as host or guest of the local network of 5G-RG/HA 5G-RG. The member of the family decides on which 5GC capable UE considered as host (i.e. subscriber of the 5G-RG) and reports these 5GC capable UE IDs (e.g. MSISDN) to the operator via online or offline service. This is out of the scope of 3GPP. After that, the operator may configure the role in the UDM or the application function AF managing the service can send the subscription information to the UDM via NEF. it is the 5GC's responsibility to maintain such information and decides the 5GC capable UE role based on it.\nThe solution is based on the following architecture as defined in clause 4.10 of TS 23.316 [5].

In case of IEEE 802.11 this step corresponds to an 802.11 Association. Optionally, the 5G-RG may send 5G-RG 5G-GUTI to the UE via ANQP message.\nEditor's note:\tSecurity aspects of sending 5G-RG 5G-GUTI in ANQP should be verified by SA WG3.\n1a-1c.\tAn EAP authentication procedure is initiated. EAP messages are encapsulated into layer-2 packets, i.e. into Ethernet-over-LAN packets. The UE provides a NAI in the EAP-Res/Identity message. This EAP-Res/Identity is encapsulated in the AAA message as defined in clause 4.12a.2.2, step 3 of TS 23.502 [3] by 5G-RG. If the 5G-RG does not transport the 5G-GUTI via ANQP message, the 5G-RG also includes 5G-RG 5G-GUTI in this AAA message. The AAA message is encapsulated over IP layer, the source IP address is the 5G-RG's IP address allocated by the 5GC in the PDU session established procedure via wireline or wireless access, the destination IP address is the TNGF IP address configured on the 5G-RG side or queried through the DNS procedure.\n1d.\tAn EAP-5G procedure is executed as specified in TS 23.502 [3] and TS 33.501 [9].

In addition, in the NAS Registration request message, the UE includes the 5G-RG 5G-GUTI received from the EAP-5G start message. The 5G-RG 5G-GUTI is used by AMF to find the 5G-RG context and obtain 5G-RG SUPI.\n2.\tW-5GAN selects the AMF2 for UE as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2] with the UE 5G-GUTI or Requested NSSAI.

In order to obtain the 5G-RG SUPI, the AMF2 finds the 5G-RG context based on the 5G-RG 5G-GUTI. If there is no 5G-RG context in the AMF2, AMF2 requests the 5G-RG SUPI from AMF1. To be more specific, the AMF2 selects the AMF1 based on the 5G-RG 5G-GUTI and sends the request message to the AMF1 including the 5G-RG 5G-GUTI and SUPI requested indication. AMF1 finds the 5G-RG context based on the 5G-RG 5G-GUTI and replies the 5G-RG SUPI to the AMF2.\n7-8.\tThe AMF2 selects the UDM based on 5G-RG SUPI, and requests 5G-RG's subscribed UE ID list from the UDM. The 5G-RG's subscribed UE ID list includes the UE IDs, e.g. UE SUPI or UE MSISDN. If the UE ID sent by AMF2 to UDM belongs to the subscribed UE ID list, the UE is treated as the subscriber of the 5G-RG. If the UE ID does not belong to the subscribed UE ID list and the 5G-RG only allows the subscribed UE, the UDM shall reject the UE. The UDM stores the serving AMF identity and will notify the AMF when the 5G-RG's subscribed UE ID list is updated.\n9.\tThe UDM sends the subscribed UE ID list to the AMF2. AMF2 stored the subscribed UE ID list and decides if the UE is the subscribed UE of the 5G-RG. If the UE is not the subscriber of 5G-RG and the 5G-RG only allows the subscribed UE, the AMF shall reject the UE.\n10-11.\tThe AMF2 requests the policy from PCF.\n12-16.\tThe same steps as defined in clause 4.12a.2, steps 10a to 15b of  TS 23.502 [3].\nDuring the PDU session establishment procedure triggered by the remote UE, the procedure defined in clause 4.12a.5 of TS 23.502 [3] is applied, with the following difference:\nStep 2a: If the AMF2 identifies the UE as the subscribed UE of the 5G-RG, it sends the subscribed UE indication to the SMF2. The SMF2 forwards this information to the PCF, the PCF may create the different QoS or/and charging rules based on the UE role, i.e. subscribed UE or unsubscribed UE. For example, the PCF will apply the higher priority 5QI value for the subscribed UE traffic than the unsubscribed UE. The SMF2 creates the DSCP value based on 5QI and the UE role.\nStep 2b: The SMF2 sends N2 SM information to the TNGF, including the mapping between the QFI and the DSCP value. The TNGF can provide DSCP value to UE for the User Plane IPsec Child SA at PDU Session Establishment as defined in clause 4.12.5, step 4a and 4c.\nIn the UE's PLMN, for the downlink data, the TNGF marks the DSCP in the outer IP header based on the mapping between the QFI and DSCP received from SMF2. For the uplink, the UE marks the DSCP using the DSCP value associated with the Child SA.\nIn the 5G-RG's PLMN, the QoS is controlled per description for the PCF, SMF and UPF in the clause D.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\n",

If it has registered successfully, the AF will store the non-3GPP device information in UDR as Application Data, as currently defined for Nnef_ServiceParameter service in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3]. The information of the non-3GPP device includes the mapping information between the virtual identifier (e.g. the virtual SUCI) and the MAC address of the non-3GPP device, the identifier of 5G-RG, QoS reference information, etc.\n6.\tThe AF responds to the 5G-RG by assigning a virtual identifier (e.g. the virtual SUCI) to the device. The AF saves the timestamp and the mapping information between the virtual identifier (e.g. the virtual SUCI) and the MAC address of the device.\nNOTE 3:\tIn steps 4 and 6, the AF and 5G-RG communicate directly without going through the 5GC. Step 4 and 6 may be out of the 3GPP scope.\n7.\tThe 5G-RG uses the virtual identifier to initial registration procedure on behalf of the device. Registration procedure specified in clause 7.2.1.1 of TS 23.316 [5] apply with the following differences:\nThe 5G-RG initial registration procedure by the transmission of a NAS message containing a registration request. The registration request contains e.g. the virtual identifier (e.g. virtual SUCI). Because the NAS tunnel has already been established in step 1, the 5G-RG can send a NAS message to AMF directly. Over N2 there is a separate NGAP connection per non-3gpp device served by the W-AGF.\nThe virtual information (e.g. virtual SUCI, the corresponding credential) in 5G-RG is used in the authentication procedure to authenticate the device behind the 5G-RG.\n8.\tWhen 5G-RG establish a PDU Session on behalf of the device, the PCF may contact the UDR to subscribe to the notification on the update of Application Data, as per existing procedure for Service specific parameter provisioning in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3]. The PCF thus receives the non-3GPP device information from UDR and can take the information into account for its policy decision. After successful registration, PDU Session establishment procedure specified in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3] apply with the difference as below.\nThe PCF provides QoS rules for the non-3GPP device to the SMF. The 5G-RG receives QoS rules for the non-3GPP devices and the 5G-RG maps the traffic of the non-3GPP device to the QoS flow of this PDU session according to the received QoS rule.\nNOTE 4:\tA distinct PDU Session and QoS flows may be established for each device behind the RG.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution addresses KI # 1; it relates to How to improve the support of L2 Bridge 5G-RG scenario for providing differentiated connectivity to devices behind the RG based on BBF requirements as expressed in their LS BBF-291/S2-1903875.\nThis solution is meant to apply to both 5G-RG (connected over FWA and/or via a Wireline access) and FN-RG. The same solution applies to both 5G RG and FN RG.\nThis solution aims at serving RG working in Bridged and Bridged/Routed mode (at least for some services), where the 5GC may need to:\n-\tprovide an IP service to the Customer premises devices e.g. allocate IPv4/v6 address / Prefix to devices behind the RG.\n-\tidentify each device / terminal behind the RG via its MAC address: for this purpose, Ethernet frames are exchanged between the RG and the 5GC so that the network (UPF) is capable to identify traffic from different individual devices in the Customer Premises. In this solution, a device / terminal behind the RG may be a UE or a non 3GPP device.\nNOTE 1:\tThis is e.g. to apply specific policies related with the terminal (e.g. parental control or Enhanced home office service where a work laptop gets bandwidth and prioritization).\nThis solution is only meant to be used in deployments with RG working in Bridged and Bridged/Routed mode.\nThe Ethernet PDU Session Type does not support an IP service over N6. For example, TS 23.501 [2] states that \"Neither a MAC nor an IP address is allocated by the 5GC to the UE for a PDU Session\". Furthermore, with the Ethernet PDU Session the Layer 2 header received from the access side is copied on the N6 side of the PSA while it is not meant to be copied over N6 in the case of an IP service provided to RG working in Bridged and Bridged/Routed mode. In case of Ethernet PDU Session Type DL forwarding is basically done based on the Destination MAC address of the UE while here DL forwarding is to be made based on the IP address of the target device ; in case an IP PDU Session type would be used to support an RG working in Routed mode with no NAT, as many PDU Sessions as there are devices in the Customer Premises requiring an IP address would be required.\nA dedicated PDU Session Type called \"Combo Ethernet + IP\" is used for that purpose. It basically supports an access Router in the PSA while an Ethernet PDU Session supports a bridge in the PSA;\nIn case of \"combo Ethernet + IP\" PDU Session Type:\n1.\tEthernet frames are exchanged between the RG and the UPF acting as PSA (PDU Session Anchor).\n2.\tEthernet frames exchanged between the RG and the UPF acting as PSA carry IP traffic (and IP auxiliary protocols: ARP, ND).\n3.\tAn IP service is delivered at N6 where for example IP addresses are allocated to individual devices (devices in the Customer Premises) behind the RG. Any IP address delivery mechanism may be used to deliver an IP address to the devices behind the RG i.e. SLACC, DHCPV4 or DHCPV6. The SMF related subscription data associated with the RG apply to a whole PDU Session regardless of whether multiple IP addresses are allocated on this PDU Session.\nNOTE 2:\tIP address(es) allocated to devices can correspond to public or to private addresses.\n4.\tIn the UL direction the UPF acting as PSA receives (as a payload of the GTP-u tunnel coming from the AGF) IP traffic within a Layer 2 framing; This layer 2 framing below IP is called \"access side layer 2 header\" below. The PSA maps between the IPv4/v6 address / Prefix of a device behind the RG and the \" access side layer 2 header\" as follows:\n-\tin UL the \"access side layer 2 header\" framing coming from a device in the Customer Premises is removed by the PSA. The UPF keeps track of the association between the IP address of the device and the corresponding \"access side layer 2 header\".\n-\tin DL the \" access side layer 2 header\" is added by the UPF before sending the traffic towards a device in the Customer Premises. Necessary MAC address swapping (source/destination) is enforced by the PSA on the \"access side layer 2 header\" stored from UL traffic.\nThe \"access side layer 2 header\" handled by the PSA contains the IEEE 802.3 MAC header possibly augmented by IEEE 802.1q header or by a IEEE 802.1ad header (also known as « QinQ »).\nNOTE 3: \tIt is up to BBF access to determine whether this \"access side layer 2 header\" includes any VLAN tagging (possibly multiple levels of VLAN tagging) e.g. VLAN tagging added by the BBF access on top of the UL Ethernet frames received from the RG. The PSA performs the mapping above regardless of whether the \" access side layer 2 header\" contains 0, 1 or 2 level of VLAN tagging. Potential VLAN tagging addition by 5G RG is defined by existing BBF specifications.\nFor a Combo Ethernet and IP PDU session type the RG exchanges with the 5GC IP packets each carried within an Ethernet frame. The 5GC delivers an IP service to the RG and to devices locally connected to the RG while it is able to identify traffic of these devices by the MAC address they are using.\nNOTE 4:\tNo new traffic filters (for N4 PDR or PCC rule or N1 SM QoS related signalling) need to be defined.\nThe figure depicts a protocol stack for the combo PDU Session Type, illustrating the various components and their interactions. The diagram includes a combination of protocols, such as the PDU, Session Type, and Session ID, which are essential for managing and controlling the session. The figure also shows the flow of data between the different protocols, highlighting the importance of proper communication and synchronization in the session management process.\nFigure 6.8.1-1: Protocol stack for the combo PDU Session Type\nFor UL traffic, the Ethernet layer 2 framing depicted in Figure 6.8.1-1 above is subject of following processing:\n-\tThe RG may add a VLAN header (*) to the traffic received from the devices in the customer premises.\n-\tThe BBF access may add a VLAN header (**) (e.g. S-tag) to the traffic received from the RG.\nFor DL traffic, the Ethernet layer 2 framing depicted in Figure 6.8.1-1 above is subject of following processing:\n-\tThe BBF access may strip off a VLAN header (**) (e.g. S-tag) to the traffic received from the network.\n-\tThe RG may strip off a VLAN header (*) to the traffic received from the network.\nIn this release of the specification, SSC mode 3, UL CL and IPV6 multihoming do not apply to a PDU Session of the Combo type.\nIn this release of the specification, the Combo PDU Session type applies only to the Wireline access.\nA RG may use simultaneously a PDU Session with the \"combo Ethernet + IP\"  PDU Session type and PDU Session(s) with another PDU Session type.\nA 5G-RG configured to work in Bridged and Bridged/Routed mode requests PDU Sessions with the PDU Session Type \"combo IP + Ethernet\" or may be associated in its subscription with this default PDU Session Type.\nNOTE 5:\tThis PDU Session Type has many similarities with the Ethernet PDU Session Type but services described in bullets 3 and 4 above are not supported by the Ethernet PDU Session Type.\nThe support of \"combo IP + Ethernet\" PDU Session type assume that multiple devices served by the PDU Session may request an IP address at any time during the lifetime of the PDU Session. The release of an IP address to such device (e.g. when the DHCP lease has expired) does not release the PDU Session. The SMF may allocate multiple IPv4 addresses in one PDU session of \"combo IP + Ethernet\" PDU Session type (when each device has its own IP address). IP address allocation takes place as in R17, i.e. options for SMF and UPF to allocate IP address, SMF handling the DHCP signalling, SLAAC etc are supported\nThere is an unique UDM subscription for the RG regardless of the number of devices in the customer premises that are subject of a specific handling.\nWhen some devices are subject of a specific service, the identity of these devices (MAC address) and the parameters of their specific service (e.g. Access restriction for parental control, dedicated QoS) are configured in the policy (PCF) data related with the subscription (UDR). Other devices benefit of a baseline service and do not require to be individually identified in the policy data related with the subscription (UDR).\n",

The same IP address allocation mechanisms (including deferred IPv4 and DHCPV6 IP address allocation) are supported than in case of RG supported by the IP PDU Session Type.\n-\tThe SMF indicates to the PSA that a PDU Session is of \"Combo Ethernet + IP\" type at the N4 Session Establishment. Based on this the PSA (UPF) acts as the first hop router of the devices in the customer premises with regard to the handling of the layers below IP. The SMF remains responsible of the RA/RS/ND handling. Especially it supports the behaviour described in bullet 4 of clause 6.8.1 related with \" access side layer 2 header\".\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether signaling a new \" 'combo Ethernet + IP' service\"  PDU Session type can be avoided to be signalled by/to the 5G-RG (i.e. Ethernet PDU Session type can still be signaled by/to 5G-RG).\n-\tN4 FAR and PDR are those used for an IP PDU Session Type.\n-\tbased on the PDU Session type, the UPF handles the Ethernet layer towards the UE on its own without instructions from SMF\n-\tThe QER is updated for the SMF to be able to control the Priority Code Point of the VLAN Headers within the \"access side layer 2 header\".\n-\tWhen an IP address/prefix has been allocated to the PDU Session the SMF reports it together with the corresponding MAC address (of the RG or of a device behind the RG) to the PCF and the PCF may use this MAC address to derive policies dedicated to a given device (PCF policy subscription data stored in UDR for the 5G RG subscription may contain a device category that is to be handled in a similar way as Subscriber category already defined in 23.503 [4]). For a \"Combo Ethernet + IP\" PCC rules (sent to the SMF) need only to refer to the IP header. No PCF policy differentiation is defined that would use the VLAN header received by the UPF over a PDU Session.\n-\tPCF binding using BSF is based on the IP address of the devices. Service differentiation upon application (AF) request is also possible using the same mechanisms (e.g. Npcf_authorization service) as in the case of an IP PDU Session type: the AF provides requests identifying the IP flow of a terminal it wants to act upon, session binding with the IP address of the terminal applies as described in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.503 [4] and the PCF provides corresponding updated PCC rule. The BSF need not to be aware of \"access side layer 2 header\".\n-\tThere is no authentication of the devices behind the RG that are identified by their MAC address.\nThe following figure shows the message flow for a PDU Session establishment (copied from Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3]). The changes to existing procedure introduced for the support of the solution are described in the text below the figure while otherwise the PDU Session Establishment proceeds as described in existing specifications.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 6.8.2-1: impacts of Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type to 23.502 [3]\", depicts the impact of the Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type on the 23.502 standard. The figure shows the UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for non-roaming and roaming scenarios, highlighting the importance of this feature in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 6.8.2-1: impacts of Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type to 23.502 [3] Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1: UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout\nStep 1:\tThe 5G RG or in case of FN RG the AGF may be configured (e.g. URSP) to request a PDU Session of the Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type. Other parameters of the PDU Session may be the same than in IP PDU Session Type (E.g. the PDU Session establishment request may contain PCO asking for a P-CSCF address, ACS address, etc.).\nStep 4:\tThe subscription data retrieved from the UDM may contain Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type as allowed PDU Session Type for a subscription.\nStep 6\tis optional (as in Rel-17 TS 23.502 [3]).\nStep 7.\tThe SMF may indicate to the PCF that the PDU Session is of Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type.\nPer PDU Session policies sent by the PCF may contain a control on the Maximum Number of IP address to allocate as part of the PDU Session to devices in the customer premises (MNIP).\nStep 10a.\tThe N4 session between the SMF and an UPF acting as PSA for the PDU Session may be associated by the SMF with a Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type; the SMF controls the UPF to report MAC addresses detected in UL traffic of the PDU Session.\nIf the SMF requests the UPF to forward DHCP/RS (Router Solicitation) traffic from devices using the PDU Session, the SMF may request the UPF to report the \"access side layer 2 header\" on which the DHCP/RS has been received.\nAccess to ACS (Autoconfiguration server used in BBF TR 069 procedures) is supported as for IP or Ethernet PDU Session types (e.g. as described in TS 23.316 [5]).\nThe figure depicts a network diagram with various components, including a router (RG), a switch (SW), and a device (device behind the RG). The diagram illustrates the allocation of an IP address to a device behind the RG, with the device's IP address being assigned to the switch, which then forwards the IP address to the router. This process ensures that the device's IP address is correctly assigned and that it can communicate with the network.\nFigure 6.8.2-2: Allocation of an IP address to a device behind the RG\nFor Combo PDU Session Type, the SMF requests the UPF to forward DHCP / RS signalling over N4; the reporting from UPF shall contain the MAC address of the device.\nWhen during the life time of a PDU Session, an IP address is allocated to a device supported by a PDU Session established with the Combo IP + Ethernet PDU Session Type, the following applies:\n1)\tIn band IP address allocation procedure (RS/RA, DHCPv4, DHCPv6). The SMF / UPF uses policies received in step 7 of Figure 6.8.2-1 (IP index, max number of IP addresses for the PDU Session) to determine whether to grant an IP address to the device and if yes to determine the IP pool / allocation method to use.\nNOTE:\tThe usage of DHCPV4 signalling to allocate IP address to devices behind the RG does not require sending dedicated NAS signalling with a request of deferred IP address allocation. ; it is possible that the IP address allocated to the RG itself is provided via NAS to the RG while in band IP address allocation applies for the devices behind the RG.\n2)\tIf this corresponds to a PCRT (Policy Control Request Trigger) received previously from the PCF, the SMF initiates the SM Policy Association Modification procedure described in clause 4.16.5.1 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe reception of new policies from the PCF in step 2 may trigger the network initiated PDU Session modification procedure in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3] which may include a corresponding N4 session modification procedure to create or update the corresponding PDR/FAR/QER/URR on the UPF and SMF sending updates of QOS rules to the 5G-RG to apply  new QoS flows.\n",

It is FFS whether such a new N2 message is preferable.\n10b.\tThe TNGF Address sent to UE is the TNGF-2 IP address provided by AMF. After receiving this message, the UE does not switch to a different SSID, if the non-3GPP access network supports SSIDs (such as WLAN access networks). It is assumed that the same SSID can support multiple S-NSSAIs.\nEditor's note:\tWhether there is need for the UE to switch to a different SSID after receiving step 10b is FFS.\nA1.\tAfter receiving an EAP-Response/5G-Notification packet from the UE in step 10c, the TNGF-1 shall send message 10d containing the EAP-Success packet.

During the registration via untrusted non-3GPP access, the AMF may trigger N3IWF relocation as defined in the previous clause.\nThe figure depicts a registration process for untrusted non-3GPP access using N3IWF relocation, illustrating the steps involved in ensuring secure communication.\nFigure 6.11.2.1-1: Registration via untrusted non-3GPP access with N3IWF relocation\n1-7.\tSame as figure 4.12.2.2-1, steps 1-8 of TS 23.502 [3], with the following clarification:\n-\tIf the AMF determines that the Registration Request received in step 6b should be served by another AMF (e.g. as defined in clause 5.15.5.2 of TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF initiates AMF re-allocation and forwards the Registration Request to another AMF (see clause 5.15.5.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2]).\n9a.\tThe AMF decides to trigger N3IWF relocation and use N3IWF-2 instead of N3IWF-1. For taking this decision, the AMF may consider the Requested NSSAI provided by the UE, the Subscribed NSSAI for this UE, the S-NSSAIs supported by all N3IWFs connected to AMF, and other information. The AMF knows the slices supported by each N3IWF connected with AMF because (as defined in TS 38.413 [7]) the N2 Setup Request message sent from N3IWF to AMF includes the supported TAI and the supported S-NSSAIs for this TAI.\nThe AMF sends a N3IWF Relocation Command to N3IWF-1 that contains a Security Mode Control (SMC) Request message, in order to establish a NAS security context for this UE and protect further NAS messages. In this message, the AMF also includes the address of N3IWF-2 and an AMF identity, e.g. a Globally Unique AMF Identifier (GUAMI) or an IP address of AMF. The N3IWF-1 forwards to UE the received SMC Request message, the N3IWF-2 address and the AMF identity, inside an EAP 5G-NAS packet.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether the AMF sends a N3IWF Relocation Command or an existing NGAP handover related message is used for this purpose.\n10.\tSince the UE receives an N3IWF address in step 9b, the UE determines that it should select another N3IWF. Therefore, the UE sends an EAP 5G-Stop packet, which (as specified in TS 24.502 [8]) triggers the N3IWF-1 to terminate the ongoing IKE procedure by sending an IKE_INFORMATIONAL request message containing an EAP-Failure and an appropriated error cause.\nAfter this step, the N3IWF-1 could release the N2 connection with the AMF. However, since the release of the N2 connection may affect the ongoing 5G registration procedure, the N3IWF-1 may delay the release of the N2 connection with the AMF and wait for AMF to release the N2 connection.\n11-12.\tThe UE starts the establishment of a new NWu connection with the N3IWF address received in step 9b (i.e. N3IWF-2).\n13.\tThe UE sends an IKE_AUTH request to N3IWF-2, which includes an EAP-Response/5G-NAS packet that contains the AN-Params and a SMC Complete message, which is a response to the SMC Request message received in step 9b. The AN-Params contains a UE identity (e.g. SUCI or 5G-GUTI), an Establishment cause, (optionally) a Requested NSSAI, and the AMF identity received in step 9b. The presence of the AMF identity in this message indicates to N3IWF-2 that this message is sent due to N3IWF relocation. Alternatively, the Establishment cause may contain a value that indicates to N3IWF-2 that this message is sent due to N3IWF relocation.\nNOTE:\tAlthough the UE reconnected to a new N3IWF, the NAS registration procedure between the UE and the AMF is resumed via the new N3IWF. The registration procedure is not interrupted due to the N3IWF relocation.\n14.\tThe N3IWF-2 selects the same AMF based on the received AMF identity and forwards the SMC Complete message to the AMF inside a N3IWF Relocation Notify. This message also contains the UE identity so that the AMF can associate the received SMC Complete message with the appropriate UE context and resume the ongoing registration procedure for this UE. The N3IWF Relocation Notify message creates a new N2 connection associated with the UE. Note that the N3IWF-2 decides to send a N3IWF Relocation Notify message to AMF (and not an Initial UE Message) because it determines that the message in step 13 is sent to due to N3IWF relocation.\nAfter the AMF receives the N3IWF Relocation Notify from N3IWF-2, the AMF may have two different N2 connections associated with the same UE: one with N3IWF-1 setup in step 6b and another with N3IWF-2 setup in step 14b. Therefore, the AMF is expected to release the N2 connection with N3IWF-1, which is not required anymore. The messages exchanged for releasing this N2 connection are not shown in the above figure.\nEditor's note:\tWhether the UE Id is needed in message 14b is FFS. It should be studied whether the SMC Complete message is enough for AMF to associate message 14b with an existing UE context.\n15-21.\tSame as figure 4.12.2.2-1, steps 10-13 of TS 23.502 [3].\nAfter the above signalling flow the UE registration to 5GC is completed and the initially selected N3IWF-1 is relocated to N3IWF-2, which supports the S-NSSAI allowed for the UE.\n",

Other types of non-3GPP access are not covered by this solution.\nCurrent (Rel-17) clause 6.3.12 of TS 23.501 [2] specifies that a non-3GPP access network may advertise \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information, by using the ANQP protocol, defined in the HS2.0 specification [6]. A non-3GPP access network (WLAN) may via ANQP \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information advertise (per Current (Rel-17) clause 6.3.12 of TS 23.501 [2]):\n-\tA PLMN List-3, which includes PLMNs with which \"5G connectivity\" is supported. A non-3GPP access network supports \"5G connectivity\" with a PLMN when it deploys a TNGF function that can connect with an AMF function and an UPF function in this PLMN via N2 and N3 interfaces, respectively.\nThe solution proposes to extend this capability in order for the UE to be able to select a SSID mapping at best capable to support the NSSAI the UE wishes to register to over trusted non-3GPP access. The solution assumes that all TNGFs reachable via the same SSID support the same set of S-NSSAI(s). Hence selecting on a TNAP a SSID that supports the slices targeted by the UE allows.\n-\tTo implicitly select a TNGF that supports the slices targeted by the UE.\n-\tTo possibly benefit from slice related policies configured on the TNAP for this SSID.\nThe ANQP \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information when indicating \"5G connectivity\" may also advertise:\na)\ta list of S-NSSAI(s) that the TNGF(s) reachable by the corresponding SSID support; or\nb)\ta list of Network Slice Non-3GPP Access Groups (NSNAGs that the TNGF(s) reachable by the corresponding SSID support. Each NSNAG is associated with one or more S-NSSAIs. A NSNAG is the equivalent of a NSAG (as defined in clause 9.11.3.87 of TS 24.501 [14] but with an empty TA list) defined for Trusted Non-3GPP access selection.\nEditor's note:\tWhether the ANQP \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information contains a list of S-NSSAIs or a list of NSNAGs will be decided at the TR conclusion phase.\nThe NSNAG Information, that applies for the UE to access via TNGF to the 5GC of a PLMN is provided to the UE by an AMF of that PLMN in NAS registration signalling. Different information may be provided for NG RAN (NSAG) and for TNGF access (NSNAG). The AMF may provide the UE with NSNAG information for TNGF access even though the UE is registering over 3GPP access. NSNAG information for TNGF access is not associated with a TA and is valid to select a TNGF all over a PLMN. The UE stores NSNAG Information after deregistration.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NSAG configuration for NG-RAN may not fit for TNGF selection.\nNOTE 2:\tThe advantage of containing NSNAGs in the \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information, instead of S-NSSAIs, is to avoid disclosing the network slices supported by each PLMN, which can be sensitive information. Note that the \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information is provided to the UE prior to WLAN association and, therefore, is provided without confidentiality protection.\nNOTE 3:\tThe actual format of NSNAG is up to CT WG1.\n",

The process involves identifying and selecting the appropriate slice for the network function, and then using the get command to retrieve the necessary information and resources. This process is crucial for ensuring that network functions can be efficiently and securely managed, and for enabling the efficient allocation of resources to different network functions.\nFigure 6.13.2.1-1:Baseline N3IWF discovery using slice support get\n1.\tUE discovery of candidate N3IWF according to Rel-17 clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.501 [2] (Rel-17), including PLMN selection (possibly taking into account the need to select a N3IWF in the local country) and including choice between N3IWF and EPDG and up to the point where the UE has received from DNS the IP addresses of candidate N3IWF; Using S-NAPTR DNS procedure the UE may discover which N3IWF supports the Slice Support Get request procedure, based on a dedicated S-NAPTR \"Service Parameter\" (equivalent to \"x-3gpp-sgw:x-s5-gtp\" defined in TS 29.303 [13]).\n2 and 4.\tThe UE sends a Slice Support Get request to each N3IWF.\nA Slice Support Get request may optionally contain the set of slices (S-NSSAI) the UE wishes to use (indicating to N3IWF that there is no need to answer with slices outside this set).\n3 and 5.\tThe N3IWF sends a Slice Support Get response that contains the set of slices (S-NSSAI) the N3IWF supports. This set of slices (S-NSSAI) is restricted to contain only a subset of the set of slices (S-NSSAI) the UE has indicated in the Slice Support Get request. It may also contain a caching information telling the UE how long the UE should consider this information (received in a Slice Support Get response) valid for.\nIt is up to UE's policy to determine how many N3IWFs the UE may need to query (sending a sends a Slice Support Get) as part of this procedure. The UE may stop sending a sends a Slice Support Get once it has got a N3IWF that supports the slices it wishes to use.\nThe UE does not need to perform the discovery each time it needs to connect to an N3IWF as it may cache the information received in a Slice Support Get response. The caching timer sent by a N3IWF ensures that the UE does not use stale information. Even if the UE would use stale information the procedure in clause 6.13.2.2 can tell the UE that it used a wrong N3IWF.\nThis procedure is stateless: the N3IWF does not need to store any information related with a Slice Support Get request. The Slice Support Get service is not meant to change the state of the N3IWF (as the UE just gets information).\nThe Slice Support Get service may be designed as a new (HTTPs) API exposed by the N3IWF to the UE and defined by 3GPP.\nTLS connections may be used between the UE and the N3IWF from steps 2 to 5. The N3IWF is assumed to provide a server certificate as it does over IKE within R17 specifications.\nSecurity aspects for this new HTTP API are to be specified by SA WG3.\n6.\tBased on the information received from N3IWF in Slice Support Get response, the UE selects the N3IWF it will contact to access to the 5GC.\n7.\tThe UE connects to 5GC over the selected N3IWF, here N3IWF1, per R17 specifications.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure requires to run, as per R17 specifications, only once the IKE_SA_Init procedure which requires heavy computation\nNOTE 2:\tSelection of a N3IWF also based on tracking area is possible as the UE contacts N3IWF based on currently configured information.\nIf within the set of candidate N3IWF(s) there are N3IWF(s) that support the Slice Support Get procedure and others that don't, the UE selects the N3IWF to use in the following descending order of priority:\n1.\tN3IWF(s) that support the Slice Support Get procedure and that have indicated they support the set of slices (S-NSSAI) the UE wishes to use.\n2.\tN3IWF(s) that don't support the Slice Support Get procedure.\n3.\tN3IWF(s) that support the Slice Support Get procedure and that have indicated they don't support some set of slices (S-NSSAI) the UE wishes to use.\nIt is left implementation specific how UE considers N3IWF(s) that support the Slice Support Get procedure and that have indicated they support only a subset of the slices (S-NSSAI) the UE wishes to use.\nThe figure depicts the rejection of an UE by an AMF (Automatic Multipath Filter) for an invalid N3IWF (Non-3GPP Interference) selection. This is a crucial aspect of 5G network design, as it ensures the efficient use of resources and minimizes interference. The figure illustrates the process of selecting the appropriate AMF based on the N3IWF, which is a key component in 5G network architecture.\nFigure 6.13.2.2-1: UE Rejection by AMF for Invalid N3IWF Selection\nSteps 1-6:\tSame as steps 1-6 defined in 6.13.2.1\nStep 7:\tThe UE connects to 5GC over the selected N3IWF, here N3IWF1, as per Rel-17 steps 2-7 in clause 4.12.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\nStep 8:\tThe AMF may have the UE authenticated by the AUSF.

The figure also shows the UE's connection to the network, represented by the network's infrastructure, such as the base station (BS) and the network's infrastructure.\nFigure 6.14.2-4: UE discovering suitable N3IWF using AN NRF\nThe AN NRF may take into account both the list of target S-NSSAI requested by the UE and the UE IP address (source address of the AN NRF request) to determine a best matching N3IWF that serves the list of target S-NSSAI requested by the UE and whose Nwu N3IWF IP address is IP close to the UE IP address. The AN NRF may also take into account 3GPP TA information provided by the UE.\nThe Discovery of the AN NRF is not meant to change the state of the AN NRF (as the UE just gets information). The AN NRF is assumed to provide a server certificate.\nSecurity aspects for usage of AN NRF are to be specified by SA WG3.\n",

In particular, this solution mainly focuses on how to select a N3IWF that supports the S-NSSAI(s) needed by the UE.\nThe solution provides two methods to select a N3IWF that supports the S-NSSAI(s) needed by the UE:\n-\tUE configuration: Key idea is to enhance the N3IWF identifier configuration and to amend the non-3GPP access node selection information with information about supported S-NSSAI(s) per N3IWF. Access Network Discovery & Selection policy (ANDSP) was designed to be provided to UE by the network for selection of N3IWF. Adding the supported S-NSSAI(s) in ANDSP allows UE to determine an appropriate N3IWF that supports the S-NSSAI(s) needed by the UE during N3IWF selection procedure.\n-\tNAS-based redirection:\tWhen UE connects with a N3IWF that does not support the S-NSSAI(s) needed by the UE, AMF can determine the target N3IWF which supports the S-NSSAI(s) needed by the UE and provides the target N3IWF information to UE via Registration Reject message so that UE can use the target N3IWF information to connect with the target N3IWF in order to meet the requirement of the UE. Redirection can be applied by the AMF based on the slices supported by the N3IWFs in the network .\n",

For example, a non-3GPP authentication method can be used, e.g. no authentication (in the case of a free WLAN), EAP with pre-shared key, username/password, etc. When the UE decides to attach to 5GC network, the UE selects an N3IWF in a 5G PLMN as described in clause 6.15.2.2.\nSteps 2 to 7 do not require specification changes with regard to 3GPP Rel-17.\n2.\tThe UE proceeds with the establishment of an IPsec Security Association (SA) with the selected N3IWF by initiating an IKE initial exchange according to RFC 7296 [3]. After step 2, all subsequent IKE messages are encrypted and integrity protected by using the IKE SA established in this step.\n3.\tThe UE shall initiate an IKE_AUTH exchange by sending an IKE_AUTH request message. The AUTH payload is not included in the IKE_AUTH request message, which indicates that the IKE_AUTH exchange shall use EAP signalling (in this case EAP-5G signalling). If the UE supports MOBIKE, it shall include a Notify payload in the IKE_AUTH request, as specified in RFC 4555 [40], indicating that MOBIKE is supported. In addition, as specified in TS 33.501 [9], if the UE is provisioned with the N3IWF root certificate, it shall include the CERTREQ payload within the IKE_AUTH request message to request the N3IWF's certificate.\n4.\tThe N3IWF responds with an IKE_AUTH response message, which includes an EAP-Request/5G-Start packet. The EAP-Request/5G-Start packet informs the UE to initiate an EAP-5G session, i.e. to start sending NAS messages encapsulated within EAP-5G packets. If the N3IWF has received a CERTREQ payload from the UE, the N3IWF shall include the CERT payload in the IKE_AUTH response message containing the N3IWF's certificate. How the UE uses the N3IWF's certificate is specified in TS 33.501 [9].\n5.\tThe UE shall send an IKE_AUTH request, which includes an EAP-Response/5G-NAS packet that contains the Access Network parameters (AN parameters) and a Registration Request message. The AN parameters contain information that is used by the N3IWF for selecting an AMF in the 5G core network. This information includes e.g. the GUAMI, the Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), the Requested NSSAI and the Establishment cause. The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting a signalling connection with 5GC. Whether and how the UE includes the Requested NSSAI as part of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of the Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 1:\tThe N3IWF does not send an EAP-Identity request because the UE includes its identity in the first IKE_AUTH. This is in line with clause 3.16 of RFC 7296 [3].\n6.\tThe N3IWF shall select an AMF based on the received AN parameters and local policy, as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The N3IWF shall then forward the Registration Request received from the UE to the selected AMF within an N2 message. This message contains N2 parameters that include the Selected PLMN ID and the Establishment cause.\n7.\tAMF initiates authentication and security procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]\n8.\tThe selected AMF determines whether the N3IWF connected with UE currently (named S-N3IWF) should be the serving N3WIF or a different target N3IWF (T-N3IWF) needs to be used. The AMF makes the determination considering the Requested S-NNSAI, the determined Allowed S-NSSAI, local configuration, etc.\nCase a): S-N3IWF is not appropriate:\n9.\tIf the AMF has determined in step 8 that the selected N3IWF is not appropriate, the AMF may initiate the UE Policy Association Establishment procedure, trigger the PCF to provide the UE with updated N3IWF selection policies (described in clause 6.15.2.1) and request the PCF to notify the AMF when the UE has been updated with such policies. The AMF may set a timer (related with the maximum time the UE can wait for a registration accept/reject) at the expiry of which it will send a registration reject to the UE regardless of the policy update status.\nWhen the UE has been updated with N3IWF selection policies, the PCF notifies the AMF, and the AMF sends a Registration Reject message to the UE.\nIf the PCF indicates a failure to update the UE or if the PCF does not notify the AMF when the UE has been updated with such policies, the AMF sends a Registration Reject message to the UE providing target N3IWF information (e.g. FQDN and/or IP address). so that UE can use the target N3IWF information to select the target N3IWF to register to 5GC.\n10a.\tAMF sends a Registration Reject message to the UE. Optionally, if the AMF has determined in step 8 that the selected N3IWF is not appropriate, the AMF may provide target N3IWF information (e.g. FQDN and/or IP address) to UE within Registration Reject message.\nCase b): S-N3IWF is appropriate:\n10.b\tIf the AMF has determined in step 8 that the selected N3IWF is appropriate, AMF continues the registration procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2.2 and sends a Registration Accept to the UE. AMF only includes S-NSSAIs supported by the selected N3IWF in the Accepted NSSAI for the UE. (id the S-N3IWF is appropriate)The N3IWF forwards the NAS Registration Accept message to UE via the established signalling IPsec SA. If the NAS Registration Accept message is received by the N3IWF before the IPsec SA is established, the N3IWF shall store it and forward it to the UE only after the establishment of the signalling IPsec SA.\n11.\tIf UE is rejected, UE connects to T-N3IWF if the UE has been provided with T-N3IWF information in the previous Registration Reject, otherwise the UE performs N3IWF selection again using the updated N3IWF selection information.\n",

WLANSP rule can include PreferredSSIDList which is prioritized list of SSIDs preferred for selection, as described in TS 23.402 [11]. PreferredSSIDList can be used as a selection criteria for the UE to constructs a prioritized list of the available WLANs by discovering the available WLANs and comparing their SSIDs against the PreferredSSIDList. From the prioritized list of the available WLANs, the UE selects the highest priority WLAN network and starts the 5GC registration procedure.

The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 6.20.2.1-1\n1.\tNon-3GPP device connects to 5G-RG with non-3GPP access network (e.g. establishes WiFi association).\nDuring this procedure, 5G-RG obtains non-3GPP device's User ID and Non-3GPP device info. The User ID is an identity of the non-3GPP device (e.g. MAC address, or SUCI which could be acquired by Authentication procedure for NSWOF in TS 33.501 [9] v17.5.0 Annex S, or SUPI). To acquire SUCI/SUPI of non-3GPP device, it is assumed that non-3GPP device and 5G-RG support 5G NSWO where 5G-RG takes the role of \"WLAN AN\". In the case of acquiring SUPI of the non-3GPP device, during the authentication procedure for NSWOF in TS 33.501 [9] the 5G-RG can add an indication in SWa protocol message to NSWOF and an indication in Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request to AUSF for acquiring the SUPI. Then the AUSF can send SUPI as a new parameter in Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response to NSWOFand deliver SUPI as a new parameter in SWa protocol message to the 5G-RG. The non-3GPP device info is used to assist identifying the non-3GPP device in the 5GC. For IP PDU Session Type, the non-3GPP device info is non-3GPP device IP info, e.g. TCP/UDP port ranges assigned to non-3GPP device by 5G-RG as NAT in case of IPV4. For Ethernet PDU Session Type, the non-3GPP device info is non-3GPP device Ethernet address.\n2.\t5G-RG sends Remote UE Report message to the SMF through the AMF. The Remote UE Report message includes Non-3GPP device's User ID and Non-3GPP device info.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that the 5G-RG already establishes a PDU session to simplify the procedures.\n3.\tThe SMF sends non-3GPP device's User ID and Non-3GPP device info to the PCF by initiating the SM Association Modification procedure. The SMF may store the Non-3GPP device's User ID and Non-3GPP device info. Then SMF may get subscription data for Non-3GPP device from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get service.\n4.\tThe PCF stores the Non-3GPP device's User ID and Non-3GPP device info. The PCF can get policy information for Non-3GPP device from local configuration (e.g. common policy for Non-3GPP device) or from UDR using Nudr_DM_Query service.\n5.\tThe PCF shall authorize policy for the non-3GPP device based on policy information at step 4.\n6.\tThe PCF generates and sends the PCC rules related to e.g. QoS or charging for non-3GPP devices connected behind a 5G-RG.\n7.\tThe SMF performs charging and QoS provision for the data traffic of the Non-3GPP device via existing mechanisms. And the SMF provides the charging information with corresponding User ID to the CHF. Same CHF session is proposed to be used to deal with the 5G RG traffic and with the traffic of different devices behind the 5G RG e.g. distinguish different traffic by corresponding User ID. The details of processing will be determined by SA WG5.\nThe figure depicts a network topology with various components such as base stations (BTS), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The fiber-optic backbone architecture is shown, with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. Redundancy paths are depicted in dashed lines, ensuring failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 6.20.2.2-1\nThe solution is based on the architecture as defined in clause 4.10 of TS 23.316 [5] which UE connects to the overlay 5G network using the trusted N3GPP for UE approach.\nIn step 1, UE completes authentication and receives IP configuration during Registration procedure for trusted non-3GPP access in clause 4.12a of TS 23.502 [3]. The 5G-RG obtains UE info which is used to assist identifying the UE in the 5GC. For IPv4, 5G-RG as a NAT shall assign TCP/UDP port ranges to individual UE(s) as UE info.\nIn step 2 and 3, the 5G-RG (acts as a TNAP) performs step 2 and 3 as in clause 6.20.2.1 with the modification where the UE takes the role of \"non-3GPP devices\", to report User ID (e.g. MAC address, or SUCI of the UE) and UE info to 5GC.\nIn step 4, PCF shall authorize QoS to UE, e.g. with the configured default QoS for the UE as described from step 4 to 7 in clause 6.20.2.1. (by configuration) If needed, the 5GC at 5G-RG side can perform differentiated charging for the data flow of this UE following the procedures in 6.20.2.1, although the 5GC at the UE side will perform charging for the UE. This approach can handle the issue of repeat billing at 5G-RG, by excluding the amount of data generated by 5GC-capable UEs behind the 5G-RG.\nIn step 5 and 6, once the TNGF acquires the UE's QoS information e.g. UE-AMBR or session-AMBR from 5GC when UE setup PDU session, it sends the corresponding QoS information to 5G-RG through the Ta interface. Then 5G-RG stores the QoS information for the UE and performs PDU session modification procedure to request the QoS for the UE's data flow identified by UE info. For example, the 5G-RG can request MBR for the data flow of this UE in the PDU session of 5G-RG. The SMF and PCF perform subsequent procedures for PDU Session Modification to authorize and enforce the QoS for the UE's data flow in the PDU session.\nIn addition, when the TNGF acquires the UE's QoS flow level QoS parameters e.g. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR from 5GC, to assist the RG to differentiate QoS flows within UE, TNGF can allocate a DSCP value for the QoS flow associated with the corresponding IPsec Child SA which is over the outer IP address of TNGF and RG. TNGF then sends the UE's QoS flow level QoS parameters, DSCP value and address e.g. TNGF IP address to 5G-RG through the Ta interface. Then 5G-RG can generate the RG's QoS flow information which can be mapped to the UE's QoS flow e.g. 5QI and packet filter for QoS flow (DSCP value, TNGF IP address, RG's address if necessary), and perform PDU session modification procedure to request the QoS flow corresponding to the UE's QoS flow.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution addresses KI#1 for providing differentiated services (e.g. QoS and charging) for Non-3GPP devices behind a 5G-RG.\nThe solution consists of three parts that are used to provide a working e2e solution:\n1.\tExample for how non-3GPP device information can be created in an AF.\n2.\tEnhancements to the NEF exposure services to provide the non-3GPP device information to 5GC.\n3.\tDescription for how the traffic from non-3GPP devices can be identified in the 5GC to provide differentiated charging and QoS.\nThe overall architecture is shown in Figure 6.21.1-1. Only NFs relevant for the solution are shown.\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture of a 5G network, illustrating the various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths for failover reliability.\nFigure 6.21.1-1: Overall architecture\nProviding non-3GPP device information to AF\nIn this solution, the AF is assumed to have access to information about the non-3GPP devices that are or have been connected behind the RG. An example for how this can be done is described here. The details are however out of 3GPP scope\nBased on existing BBF specifications TR-69/369 and TR-181, the Auto-Configuration Server (ACS) can retrieve information about the non-3GPP devices from the 5G-RG. This information can e.g. contain the host table from the DHCP server in the RG, or device list gathered by other means, and typically includes for each device: a host name, the MAC address of the device and the IP address allocated to the device. An example of such a table for IPv6 is shown in Figure 6.21.1-2.\nThe figure depicts an IPv6 host table from an RG, illustrating the structure of the host table and its components. The table includes fields such as the host's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway, as well as the host's MAC address and network interface. The table is organized in a hierarchical manner, with the host's IP address at the top, followed by the subnet mask, and then the host's MAC address and network interface. The table is further divided into subnets, with each subnet having its own host table. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the IPv6 host table, making it easy to understand and interpret.\nFigure 6.21.1-2: Example of IPv6 host table from an RG\nIn the case of IPv4 traffic, the routed RG typically has NAT functionality. The IPv4 addresses in the list of non-3GPP devices received from the RG would thus correspond to the private IPv4 addresses. These private addresses are not useful for traffic detection in the 5GC. In this case the solution assumes that the NAT in the 5G-RG assigns a port range for each device and can provide the external IP address and port range associated with each device to the ACS.\nThe non-3GPP device information is then provided from the ACS to the AF. How this is done is out of scope of 3GPP. For reference, the BBF has specified requirements for such an interface in TR-131 ACS Northbound Interface Requirements – Amendment 1, 2015.  The BBF has also done work on a RESTful API in a TR-369 controller ().\nIt is further assumed that the operator may integrate a web portal with the AF. The end-user (e.g. the person that owns the subscription for the RG) can login to this web portal and manage the list of devices. The end-user could e.g. select a device profile for each device from a drop-down menu. The device profile may e.g. indicate what type of non-3GPP device it is (set top box, printer, tablet, PC etc), or be a reference to a QoS category. How this Device profile ID is to be interpreted is up to operator configuration.\nIn summary:\n1)\tIt is assumed that the AF has a table containing a complete list of non-3GPP devices in the home. The table includes a host name (which may be informative but is not guaranteed to be unique), MAC address, assigned IPv4 address (local to the home LAN) and IPv6 address.  The combination of host name and MAC address is considered to be a unique and persistent identification of a specific device connected to the home LAN.\n2)\tIt is assumed that the AF may be directed by an authorized subscriber by means out of scope of 3GPP to request differentiated service for specific devices in the AF's list of non-3GPP devices.\nIt should be noted that similar systems and procedures are employed in wireline networks today, but these would benefit from the enhanced differentiation capabilities of the 5GS.\nProvisioning of non-3GPP device information to 5GC\nThe existing NEF Service Parameter service is enhanced with a new Service Description to allow an AF to provide the non-3GPP device information to 5GC. This information will be used by 5GC to detect the traffic to/from a non-3GPP device and also to provide differentiated QoS and/or charging.\nThe information provided by the AF via the Nef_ServiceParameter service contains:\n-\tGPSI of the RG.\n-\tList of non-3GPP devices, containing for each device:\n-\tIPv6 address or IPv4 and the port number of the device.\n-\tDevice profile ID.\nThe NEF maps the RG's GPSI to the RG's SUPI and stores the non-3GPP device information in UDR as Application Data, as currently defined for Nnef_ServiceParameter service in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3].\nDifferentiated services per non-3GPP device\nWhen a PDU Session for an RG is established, the PCF contacts the UDR to subscribe to Application Data that may be available, as per existing procedure for Service specific parameter provisioning in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3]. The PCF thus receives the non-3GPP device information from UDR corresponding to the RG's SUPI.\nThe PCF takes the service parameters as well as other information (e.g. RG's subscribed QoS and RG's policy subscription data in UDR) into account for policy decisions, e.g. to determine QoS and charging parameters for the non-3GPP device's traffic. The PCF may provide PCC rules to SMF that are specific for individual non-3GPP devices, containing SDF filter with the IPv6 address or IPv4 and the port number of the device, and corresponding QoS and charging related parameters. The PCF may provide different PCC rules for different services, as per existing standards.\n",

                            "text_content": "The main steps of the solution are illustrated in the following figure and are described below. It is assumed that the SMF supports an SWa interface and can interact with a Non-Seamless WLAN Offload Function (NSWOF) defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, highlighting the multi-path signal path and beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The fiber-optic backbone architecture is shown, with core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. Redundancy paths are depicted in dashed lines, ensuring failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 6.22.2-1\n0.\tThe 5G-RG registers with a 5G core network (PLMN (5G-RG)) using its own 5G credentials and establishes a PDU Session, which can be used by devices operating \"behind\" the 5G-RG, such as, the AUN3 device. This PDU Session typically supports one or more QoS flows, each one providing different QoS handling.\nThe PDU Session of the 5G-RG must be controlled by an SMF that supports the SWa interface and, therefore, it can communicate with one or more NSWOFs. If not all SMFs in the PLMN (5G-RG) support this capability, then, during this PDU Session establishment, the AMF must select an SMF that supports this capability (i.e. the SWa interface). The AMF may decide to select an SMF that supports the SWa interface, either because:\na)\tIt receives a new indication from the 5G-RG, e.g. a new indication in the NAS message sent from the 5G-RG to AMF; or\nb)\tIt receives a new indication in the subscription information of 5G-RG (retrieved from UDM), which indicates that all PDU Sessions of this 5G-RG must use an SMF that support the SWa interface.\nThe alternative a) is preferable because it allows the 5G-RG to send the new indication to AMF only for the PDU Sessions which can be shared by devices \"behind\" the 5G-RG.\n1.\tThe AUN3 device requests to connect to 5G-RG, e.g. it performs a WLAN association with the 5G-RG. This triggers the 5G-RG to initiate an EAP-based authentication procedure, hence, it sends an EAP-Request/Identity to AUN3, which responds with an EAP-Response/Identity containing its Subscriber Concealed Identity (SUCI) in a form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI). The realm part of NAI contains the MCC/MNC of the HPLMN of the AUN3 device.\n2.\tThe 5G-RG requests from SMF to authenticate the AUN3 device and to determine whether the AUN3 device is authorized to connect to the 5G-RG and share its PDU Session. For this purpose, the 5G-RG sends a new 5GSM message to SMF, called PDU Session Third-Party Authentication Request message. The \"Third-Party\" signifies that the authentication request is not for the 5G-RG but for another device operating behind the 5G-RG. The PDU Session Third-Party Authentication Request message includes the EAP-Response/Identity received by the AUN3 device.\nEditor's note:\tThe solution assumes that the SMF supports an SWa interface and interacts with NSWOF. However, it is possible that the SWa interface is supported by the 5G-RG and the 5G-RG interacts directly with NSWOF. In this case, the SMF is not involved in the authentication procedure of AUN3 device and the new 5GSM messages are not needed. The details of this case are FFS.\n3-6.\tA NSWO mutual authentication procedure takes places between the AUN3 device and AUSF, using EAP-AKA' authentication. These steps are the same as those specified in, Annex S of TS 33.501 [9], with the following differences:\na)\tIn step 4a, the UDM provides not only the Subscriber Permanent Identity (SUPI) of the AUN3 device, but also \"QoS Info\" for the data traffic of the AUN3 device. This \"QoS Info\" is part of the subscription data of the AUN3 device and identifies the QoS that should be applied to handle the data traffic of the AUN3 device when carried over the PDU Session of the 5G-RG. All traffic associated with the same AUN3 device has the same QoS treatment.\nFor example, the \"QoS Info\" may contain QoS parameters such as a 5QI value and/or a packet delay budget and/or a packet error rate. The \"QoS Info\" is later used by SMF to determine the QoS flow on which the data traffic of AUN3 device should be sent over the PDU Session of the 5G-RG.\nThe UDM decides to provide the QoS Info based on the information received in step 3c, for example, based on the value of the Access Network Identity, or another parameter. For example, if the Access Network Identity is different from \"5G:NSWO\" (which is specified in Annex S of TS 33.501 [9], for NSWO), then the UDM may decide to provide the QoS Info.\nEditor's note:\tInstead of sending the QoS Info in step 4a, the SMF (after step 6b) may request from UDM subscription data for the AUN3, including the QoS Info. Whether this alternative is better is FFS.\nb)\tIn step 6a, if the authentication procedure is successful, the AUSF provides the QoS Info received from UDM and also the SUPI of the AUN3 device.\nc)\tIn step 6b, the SUPI and the QoS Info are forwarded to SMF. This way the SMF receives both the permanent subscriber identity of the AUN3, which can be used for charging, and information indicating the QoS that should be used to handle the data traffic of the AUN3 device.\nd)\tIn step 6c, the SMF responds to 5G-RG with a PDU Session Third-Party Authentication Result message. If the authentication procedure is successful, this message contains, not only the EAP-Success packet and the Master Session Key (MSK), but also the following parameters:\n-\tA Traffic Identifier, which will be carried in all GTP-U or GRE datagrams exchanged between the 5G-RG and UPF that encapsulate data packets to/from the AUN3 device. Via this identifier, the UPF can identify the traffic of each AUN3 devices behind the 5G-RG.\nEditor's note:\tThe 5G-RG encapsulates all traffic of the AUN3 device into either GTP-U or GRE packets, which carry the Traffic Identifier in their headers. It is FFS whether GTP-U or GRE is used. It is also FFS whether the Traffic Identifier needs to be sent over the user plane.\n-\tThe QoS flow on which the data traffic of AUN3 device should be sent when carried over the PDU Session of the 5G-RG.\n8.\tAfter the EAP-Success message is sent, the AUN3 device and the 5G-RG establish a security context to secure the air-interface traffic. In case of WLAN access, this is typically accomplished by applying the 4-way handshake procedure specified in IEEE 802.11. In addition, the AUN3 device obtains IP configuration data, including an IPv4/IPv6 address/prefix.\n9.\tThe SMF sends to UPF the SUPI of the AUN3 device and the associated Traffic Identifier, so that the UPF can identify and, possibly, charge the data traffic of the AUN3 device.\nEditor's note:\tThe details of how and if the Traffic Identifier can be used for charging the data traffic of the AUN3 device are FFS.\n10.\tIf the QoS flow provided by SMF in step 6c does not exist in the PDU Session of the 5G-RG, the 5G-RG initiates a PDU Session Modification procedure to establish a new QoS flow.\n12.\tThe 5G-RG sends the data traffic received from the AUN3 device to the QoS flow corresponding to this AUN3 device. Similarly, the UPF sends the data traffic received from the data network and is destined to the AUN3 device to the QoS flow corresponding to this AUN3 device. Between the 5G-RG and the UPF, the data traffic of the AUN3 device is encapsulated within GTP-U or GRE datagrams, each one containing the Traffic Identifier that corresponds to this AUN3 device (the one provided by SMF in step 6c).\n",

The compensation is achieved by reducing the PDB for the 3GPP network by the delay that can occur in the non-3GPP network attached to the 5G-RG (referred to as non-3GPP delay hereafter).\nThis solution proposes two enhancements to make 5GS aware of the non-3GPP delay:\n-\tA Default non-3GPP network delay budget is configured in the UDR as part of the PDU Session policy control subscription information. The PCF applies the Default non-3GPP delay budget when taking policy decisions, i.e. the PCF reduces the PDB for a given flow by the Default non-3GPP delay budget.\n-\tIf supported by the 5G-RG and if the 5G-RG wants to change the default non-3GPP delay budget for a specific flow, the 5G-RG may use the UE requested PDU Session Modification procedure to request a non-3GPP delay budget for a set of packet filters. The SMF provides the Requested non-3GPP delay budget received from the 5G-RG to the PCF, which takes it into account for the subsequent policy decision.\nThe solution applies to 5G-RG connected via FWA as defined in TS 23.316 [5]. The solution addresses Non authenticable non-3GPP devices and Authenticable non-3GPP devices.\n",

There are no impacts to 3GPP specifications.\n-\tFor both untrusted and trusted non-3gpp access, QoS differentiation for 5G UE behind an RG will be supported per the principles described in Solution 2 that are endorsed except following aspect:\n-\tthe RG may buffer the received packets and send the target N3IWF/TNGF IP address and indication of requesting mapping rules to SMF/PCF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe RG can with current specifications request PDU Session modification when it detects IP flows for which it has no explicit QoS rules but no specification work will be done in R18 for that feature.\nThis assumes that 3GPP normative work will be based on:\n-\tBBF and/or Cable Labs specifications support of 5G RG acting as a TNAP (the TNAP In the figure below is supported by a 5G RG).\nNOTE 2:\tThis is in the scope of BBF and/or Cable Labs specifications.\n-\tThe RG's PCF is preconfigured with IP address ranges corresponding to TNGF/N3IWF(s) and with DSCP used over NWu and NWt, (this corresponds to the DSCP values used below the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the TNGF/N3IWF).\n-\tThe UE's PCF is preconfigured with IP address ranges corresponding to UE(s) served by wireline access (5G RG) that are to be associated with QoS policies for wireline access.\n-\t(for Trusted access) To determine whether an UE is to be considered as a guest on a wireline access:\n-\tThe TNAP Id of the 5G RG is provided by the 5G RG to the TNGF over Ta and then by the TNGF to the PCF of the UE as ULI carried via AMF and SMF; this is working as currently defined in TS 23.501 [2] / TS 23.502 [3].\n-\tPolicy subscription control data in UDR (as defined in TS 23.503 [4], Table 6.2-2: PDU Session policy control subscription information) may contain the TNAP Id(s) that is/are associated with a UE's subscription.\n-\tAn AF may provide TNAP ID for a subscriber (GPSI) which is stored as Application data in UDR.\n-\tThe PCF may use the TNAP Id of the 5G RG received over ULI and Policy subscription control data and Application data in UDR (as defined above).\nNOTE 3: \tFN-RG is only supported for untrusted access and with no Rel-18 normative work (e.g. clause 6.2.2 of the present document does not apply to FN RG).\nThe following Figure from TS 23.501 [2] is provided for reference for the text above.\nThe figure depicts a user plane via TNGF, illustrating the path taken by a user's data as it traverses the network. The figure shows the user's data path through the network, with the TNGF (Transmission Network Gateway) acting as the central point of control and communication. The figure highlights the importance of TNGF in ensuring the efficient and secure transmission of data within the network.\nFigure 8.3.2-1: User Plane via TNGF\nSolution#9 and Solution#20.2 have been ruled out by CableLabs and BBF.\n",
