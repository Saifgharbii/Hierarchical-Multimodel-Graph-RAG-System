            "description": "The policy framework functionality in 5G is comprised of the functions of the Policy Control Function (PCF), the policy and charging enforcement functionality supported by the SMF and UPF, the access and mobility policy enforcement functionality supported by the AMF, the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF), the Network Exposure Function (NEF), the Charging Function (CHF), the Unified Data Repository (UDR), the Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization Function (TSCTSF), the Application Function (AF) and the 5G Direct Discovery Name Management Function (5G DDNMF).\nThe policy framework functionality for multicast-broadcast services in 5G is comprised of the functions of the Policy Control Function (PCF), the Multicast/Broadcast Service Function (MBSF), the Multicast-Broadcast Session Management Function (MB-SMF), the Network Exposure Function (NEF), the Unified Data Repository (UDR) and the Application Function (AF).\nFor the roaming scenario, the Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) is deployed between the V-PCF and H-PCF. 3GPP TS 23.503 [4] specifies the 5G policy framework stage 2 functionality.\nThe figure depicts the overall non-roaming 5G Policy framework architecture, illustrating the service-based representation of the framework. It includes non-roaming services, roaming services, and roaming policies, with a focus on the role of the 5G network in supporting these services.\nFigure 4.1-1a: Overall non-roaming 5G Policy framework architecture (service based representation)\nThe figure depicts a non-roaming 5G Policy framework architecture, illustrating the overall structure and components. It includes reference points, which are essential for defining the network's coverage and capacity. The figure also highlights the role of the 5G Core Network (C-RAN) in managing the network's resources and ensuring seamless roaming experiences for non-roaming users.\nFigure 4.1-1b: Overall non-roaming 5G Policy framework architecture (reference point representation)\nNOTE 1:\tThe N4, N4mb, Nmb2, Nmb9 and N19mb interfaces are not part of the Policy Framework architecture but shown in the figures for completeness.\nNOTE 2:\tIf an SCP is deployed it can be used for indirect communication between NFs and NF services as described in Annex E of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tMB-SMF, MBSTF, MB-UPF and MBSF apply only when the MBS PCC Architecture as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [54] is deployed. In this case only the entities shown in that architecture are applicable.\nThe AF trusted by the operator interacts with the PCF via the N5 reference point. In the case of an untrusted AF, the AF interacts with the PCF via the NEF. The NEF interacts with the PCF via the N30 reference point in the same way that the AF interacts with the PCF via the N5 reference point.\nThe Nchf service for online and offline charging consumed by the SMF is defined in 3GPP TS 32.240 [28].\nThe Nchf service for Spending Limit Control consumed by the PCF is defined in 3GPP TS 29.594 [23].\nThe PCF providing session management policy control for a UE (i.e. PCF for the PDU Session) and the PCF providing non-session management policy control for that UE (i.e. PCF for the UE) may be different PCF instances and the communication between the PCF for the UE and the PCF for the PDU Session is performed over the N43 reference point.\nNOTE 3:\tThe roaming scenarios for SNPNs are not supported in this Release.\nThe figure depicts the overall roaming policy framework architecture, specifically focusing on the LBO (service-based representation) model. It illustrates the various components and their interactions, such as roaming policies, service-based roaming, and roaming service provisioning. The figure highlights the importance of service-based roaming in enabling seamless roaming experiences for mobile users.\nFigure 4.1-2a: Overall roaming policy framework architecture - LBO (service based representation)\nThe figure depicts the overall roaming policy framework architecture, specifically focusing on the LBO (reference point representation) component. It illustrates the various components and their interactions, such as the reference point, reference point representation, and reference point management. The figure also highlights the importance of reference point management in ensuring efficient roaming policies and maintaining network performance.\nFigure 4.1-2b: Overall roaming policy framework architecture - LBO (reference point representation)\nNOTE 4:\tIn the LBO scenario, the PCF in the VPLMN may interact with the AF in order to generate PCC rules for services delivered via the VPLMN. The PCF in the VPLMN uses locally configured policies according to the roaming agreement with the HPLMN operator as input for PCC rule generation. The PCF in VPLMN has no access to subscriber policy information from the HPLMN nor to session management policy data for the UE in the VPLMN to retrieve input for PCC Rule generation. The interactions between the PCF in the VPLMN and the PCF in the HPLMN through the Npcf service based interface enables the PCF in the HPLMN to provision UE policies to the PCF in the VPLMN, as described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [4] clause 5.2.5.\nNOTE 5:\tIn the LBO scenario, AF requests targeting a DNN (and slice) and / or a group of UEs are stored in the UDR by the NEF. The PCF in the VPLMN subscribes to and get notification from the UDR in the VPLMN for those AF requests. Details are defined in clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 6:\tFor the sake of clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the roaming reference point architecture figures.\nNOTE 7:\tN4 and N32 are not service based interfaces.\nNOTE 8:\tThe Home Routed PDU sessions are not supported for TSC networks in this Release.\nThe figure depicts a 1-3 a: Overall roaming policy framework architecture - home routed scenario, illustrating the service-based representation of roaming policies. It highlights the various components such as roaming policies, roaming profiles, and roaming profiles, which are essential for managing roaming in home networks.\nFigure 4.1-3a: Overall roaming policy framework architecture - home routed scenario (service based representation)\nThe figure depicts the overall roaming policy framework architecture for home-roaming scenarios, illustrating the reference point representation. It includes a home router, a mobile device, and a roaming service provider, all connected through a network infrastructure. The figure illustrates the various policies and procedures that need to be followed to ensure seamless roaming experience for the user.\nFigure 4.1-3b: Overall roaming policy framework architecture - home routed scenario (reference point representation)\nNOTE 9:\tFor the sake of clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the roaming reference point architecture figures.\nNOTE 10:\tN4 and N32 are not service based interfaces.\nNOTE 11:\tAn SCP can be used for indirect communication between NFs and NF services within the VPLMN, within the HPLMN, or in within both VPLMN and HPLMN. For simplicity, the SCP is not shown in the roaming architecture.\nNOTE 12:\tNon-roaming architecture, local breakout roaming architecture and home-routed roaming architecture for interworking between 5GS and EPS are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The signalling flows described in clause 5 apply to this scenario by replacing SMF by the SMF+PGW-C and with the differences applicable to EPC as described in Annex B.3 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].\nTo allow the 5G system to interwork with AFs related to existing services, e.g. IMS based services, Mission Critical Push To Talk services, the PCF shall support the corresponding Rx procedures and requirements defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [18]. This facilitates the migration from EPC to 5GC without requiring these AFs to upgrade to support the N5 interface.\nThe figure depicts the interworking between the 5G Policy framework and the Access Facilitator (AF) supporting the Radio Interface (Rx interface). It illustrates the various interfaces and communication paths between the Policy framework and the AF, highlighting the importance of interoperability and seamless integration in the 5G network.\nFigure 4.1-4: Interworking between 5G Policy framework and AFs supporting Rx interface\nTo support Deterministic Networking, the TSCTSF offers RESTCONF (IETF RFC 8040 [66]) and/or NETCONF (IETF RFC 6241 [65]) interfaces to access to the schema defined by the 3GPP Extended Deterministic Networking (DetNet) YANG Model specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60] (extension of  IETF draft-ietf-detnet-yang [64]), to enable the provisioning of configuration and operation data for DetNet flows. The 5G System is integrated with the Deterministic Network as defined in IETF RFC 8655[63] as a logical DetNet transit router (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 4.4.8.4). The TSCTSF performs mapping in the control plane between the 5GS internal functions and the DetNet controller.\nFigure 4.1-5 illustrates the interworking between TSCTSF and DetNet controller to support Deterministic Networking. TSCTSF is a software-defined network controller that enables deterministic networking by providing a deterministic path for data transmission. DetNet is a network-wide deterministic networking controller that ensures deterministic path selection and forwarding. This figure demonstrates the integration of these controllers to enable deterministic networking in a network.\nFigure 4.1-5: Interworking between TSCTSF and DetNet controller to support Deterministic Networking.\n",

It involves the establishment of a connection between two nodes, ensuring that the nodes are connected to the same network. This is done by establishing a connection between the two nodes and then establishing a connection between the two connections. The figure shows the process in a step-by-step manner, with each step clearly labeled and explained.\nFigure 5.1.1-1: AM Policy Association Establishment procedure\nThis procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.\nIn the non-roaming case the role of the V-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.\nStep 2 - step 5 are not executed in the roaming case.\n1.\tThe AMF receives the registration request from the AN. Based on local policy, the AMF selects to contact the (V-) PCF to create the policy association with the (V-) PCF and to retrieve Access and Mobility control policy. The AMF selects the PCF as described in clause 8.2 and invokes the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"AM Policy Associations\" resource as defined in clause 4.2.2 and clause 5.3.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.507 [7]. The request operation provides, but is not limited to, the SUPI and the allowed NSSAI if applicable, and if received from the UDM, the Service Area Restrictions, RFSP index, UE-AMBR, a list of UE-Slice-MBR (s), GPSI and a list of Internal Group Identifiers, and may provide the applicable access type(s), the PEI if received in the AMF, the User Location Information if available, the UE Time Zone if available, Serving Network, the applicable RAT type(s), GUAMI of AMF, alternative or backup address(es) or FQDNs of AMF, trace control and configuration parameters information, etc., as defined in clause 4.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.507 [7]. The request includes a Notification URI to indicate to the PCF where to send a notification when the policy is updated.\n2.\tIf the PCF does not have the subscription data, it invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to the UDR by sending an HTTP GET request to the \"AccessAndMobilityPolicyData\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12].\n3.\tThe UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response to the PCF with the requested subscription data and/or application data in the response message body.\n4.\tThe PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the subscription information by invoking Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"PolicyDataSubscriptions\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12].\nAdditionally, if the PCF and the UDR support dynamically changing AM policies, the PCF may subscribe to the UDR using the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation for notifications about AM Influence data changes by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"ApplicationDataSubscriptions\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12].\n5.\tThe UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription from the PCF. If the PCF subscribed to notifications about AM Influence data with the immediate reporting indication set to \"true\" and matching AM Influence data exists in the UDR, the UDR includes them in the response as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12].\n6.\tThe (V-)PCF makes the requested policy decision including Access and Mobility control policy information, and may determine applicable Policy Control Request Trigger(s).\n6a.\tIn non-roaming case, if the PCF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the CHF, and such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 5.3.2. If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber, and the PCF determines that the status of additional policy counters is required, the PCF initiates an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 5.3.3.\n7.\tThe (V-)PCF sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to the AMF with the determined policies as described in clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.507 [7], e.g.:\n-\tAccess and Mobility Control Policy including Service Area Restrictions, and/or a RAT Frequency Selection Priority (RFSP) Index; and/or\n-\tPolicy Control Request Triggers and related policy information.;\n7a.\tThe PCF may register to the BSF as the PCF for the UE (i.e. as the PCF that handles the AM Policy Association of this UE) by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"PCF for a UE Bindings\" resource of the Nbsf_Management_Register service as described in clause 4.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].\n7b.\tThe BSF responds with \"201 Created\" if the registration of the PCF for the UE was successful.\n8.\tThe AMF deploys the Access and Mobility control policy information if received which includes, e.g. storing the Service Area Restrictions, provisioning the Service Area Restrictions to the UE and/or choosing the RFSP index in use and provisioning the chosen RFSP index and Service Area Restrictions to the NG-RAN, if applicable, when the UE is registered in the 3GPP access.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AMF can decide that the RFSP Index in use is the same as the RFSP index authorized by the PCF or can also use configured operator policies, the Allowed NSSAI, the Partially Allowed NSSAI and the UE related context information available at the AMF in its derivation.\nWhen the feature \"RFSPValidityTime\" is supported, the PCF provided the RFSP Index value that indicates the EPC/E-UTRAN access is prioritized over 5GS access and a validity time associated to the provided RFSP Index as specified in 3GPP TS 29.507 [7], if the AMF decides to use the RFSP Index received from the PCF, then the AMF provides to the MME both, the received RFSP Index and the received validity time. The validity time indicates the time for which the RFSP Index will be used in the MME after 5GS to EPS mobility.\nNOTE 2:\tThe RFSP validity time indicated by the PCF when the feature \"RFSPValidityTime\" is supported is used by the MME to allow the UE to stay in EPS during the period of time indicated by the \"rfspValTime\" attribute as specified in 3GPP TS 29.507 [7] and avoid the potential ping-pong issue between 5GS and EPS (i.e., 5GS keeps sending the UE to EPS based on authorized RFSP Index from PCF, and the EPS keeps sending the UE back to 5GS immediately based on the subscribed RFSP Index). If due to UE mobility the AMF receives from the MME a validity time associated to the RFSP in use, the AMF shall ignore validity time received from the MME.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCF can reject the AM Policy Association establishment, e.g. the PCF cannot obtain the subscription-related information from the UDR and the PCF cannot make the policy decisions, as described in 3GPP TS 29. 519 [12]. In this case, the AMF deploys the Access and Mobility control policy information based on the policy retrieved from the UDM if available or the local configuration. In order to choose the RFSP Index in use, the Allowed NSSAI, the Partially Allowed NSSAI and the UE related context information available at the AMF can also be used.\n",

The figure shows the process of defining the policies, selecting the appropriate network management protocol, and setting up the necessary network elements. This procedure is essential for ensuring the smooth operation of the network and maintaining its reliability and performance.\nFigure 5.2.1-1: SM Policy Association Establishment procedure\nThis procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.\nIn the LBO roaming case, the PCF acts as the V-PCF, and the V-PCF shall not contact the UDR/CHF. In the home routed roaming case, the PCF acts as the H-PCF and the H-PCF interacts with the H-SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tFor LBO roaming case, session management policy data for the UE is not available in the VPLMN and V-PCF uses locally configured information according to the roaming agreement with the HPLMN operator. Therefore, interactions between PCF and UDR in the following procedures do not apply to this scenario.\n1.\tThe SMF receives a PDU session establishment request from the UE. The SMF selects the PCF as described in clause 8.3 and invokes the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"SM Policies\" resource as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [9]. The request operation provides the needed information within the \"SmPolicyContextData\" as defined in clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].\n2-3.\tIf \"PvsSupport\" feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9] is supported and the Onboarding Indication set to true is received and the combination of the received DNN and S-NSSAI corresponds to a PDU session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning, these steps are skipped. Otherwise, if PCF does not have the subscription data for the SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI and/or based on operator policies, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"SessionManagementPolicyData\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12]. The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response to the PCF with the policy control subscription data.\n4.\tIf the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported or the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is not supported and the \"SamePcf\" feature is supported , and based on operator's policies and retrieved data the PCF determines that the same PCF needs to be used for all the SM Policy associations that match a combination of SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI, and no SM Policy association for the given combination exists, the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Register service operation to check if another PCF exists for the given parameter combination when the conditions as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.2.2 are met.\n5.\tIf the PCF receives an HTTP \"201 Created\" response from the BSF with the created binding information as detailed in clause 8.5.2 and the flow continues in step 6.\nIf the PCF receives an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response from the BSF, the PCF replies the SMF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.2.2and the flow terminates here.\n6-7.\tIf BDT Reference ID(s) is included in the response from the UDR, the PCF shall invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to the UDR to retrieve the Background Data Transfer policy corresponding to the BDT Reference ID(s) by sending the HTTP GET request to the \" IndividualBdtData\" resource or the \"BdtData\" collection resource with the URI query parameter \"bdt-ref-ids\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12], and the UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response to the PCF with the Background Data Transfer policy.\nAdditionally, if the TSC feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9] is supported, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to retrieve the stored AF influence data in the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"Influence Data\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12]. The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the stored AF request.\nAdditionally, if the ATSSS feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9] is supported, and the SDF template of the PCC rule includes an application identifier, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to retrieve the stored OS Id(s) supported by the UE from the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"UePolicySet\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12]. The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the stored UE Policy data. The PCF determines the application descriptors based on the retrieved OS Id(s), if available, and local configuration, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].\nAdditionally, if the WWC feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9] is supported, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to retrieve the stored IPTV configuration from the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"IPTV Configurations\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12]. The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the stored IPTV configuration. The PCF determines Multicast Access Control information (i.e., whether the multicast channel represented by the SDF of the PCC rule is allowed or not) based on the retrieved IPTV configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].\nAdditionally, when network slice data rate related policy control is supported by the PCF, the PCF may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation towards the UDR by sending an HTTP GET request targeting the \"SlicePolicyControlData\" resource as specified in clause 5.2.12 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [12]. The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response to the PCF with the network slice policy control data.\nAdditionally, when location dependent policies for trusted non-3GPP access is supported by the PCF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], the PCF may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to retrieve the stored list of AF-provided TNAP ID(s) within Service Parameter data from the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"Service Parameter Data\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12]. The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the stored Service Parameter Data.\n8-9.\tTo request notifications from the UDR on changes in the policy data information, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"PolicyDataSubscriptions\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\nAdditionally, if the TSC feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9] is supported, to request notifications from the UDR on changes in the AF influence data, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"Influence Data Subscription\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\nAdditionally, if the WWC feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9] is supported, to request notifications from the UDR on changes in the IPTV configuration, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"ApplicationDataSubscriptions\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\nAdditionally, when location dependent policies for trusted non-3GPP access is supported by the PCF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], to request notifications from the UDR on changes in the list of AF-provided TNAP ID(s) within Service Parameter Data, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"ApplicationDataSubscriptions\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\n10.\tIf the PCF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the CHF, and such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 5.3.2. If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber, and the PCF determines that the status of additional policy counters are required, the PCF initiates an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 5.3.3.\n11.\tThe PCF makes the policy decision to determine the information provided to the SMF.\n12-13.\tIf network slice data rate related policy control applies, the (H-)PCF may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation by sending an HTTP PATCH request targeting the \"SlicePolicyControlData\" resource in order to update the Remaining Maximum Slice Data Rate information.\n14.\tWhen the \"SamePcf\" feature is not supported, in the case that the BSF is to be used and that either the IP address/prefix or MAC address is available, the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Register service operation by sending HTTP POST request to create the PDU session binding information for a UE in the BSF as detailed in clause 8.5.2.\nWhen the \"SamePcf\" feature or the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, the PCF determines that the same PCF needs to be used for the SM Policy associations of the same DNN, S-NSSAI and SUPI parameter combination, and a SM Policy association already exists for the given parameter combination (i.e., step 4, 5 did not apply) the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Register service operation by sending HTTP POST request to create the PDU session binding information for a UE in the BSF as detailed in clause 8.5.2.\n15.\tThe PCF receives an HTTP \"201 Created\" response from the BSF with the created binding information as detailed in clause 8.5.2.\n16.\tThe PCF sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to the SMF with the determined policies as described in clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].\n17.\tIf the PCF as a PCF for a PDU session receives the callback URI of the PCF for a UE in step 1, the PCF shall send the event of PDU session established to the AF by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"{notifUri}/pdu-session\" callback URI as defined in clause 4.2.5.22 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\n18.\tThe PCF for a UE sends an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response to the PCF.\n",

Therefore, interactions between PCF and UDR in the following procedures do not apply to this scenario.\nThe SM Policy Association Modification procedure may be initiated either by the SMF or by the PCF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe following procedures cover both Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operations over the N5 reference point and Rx interactions between AF and PCF. It is assumed that for the interactions between one AF and one PCF, only one of those possibilities is used. For details of Rx interface refer to 3GPP TS 29.214 [18] and for details on the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service refer to 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\nThis procedure is performed when the PCF decides to modify policy decisions for a PDU session.\nThe figure depicts the interactions between SMF, PCF, and CHF for PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure, illustrating the steps involved in modifying the SM policy.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.1-1: Interactions between SMF, PCF and CHF for PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure\n1.\tThe PCF receives an internal or external trigger to re-evaluate PCC Rules and policy decision for a PDU Session. Possible external trigger events are described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.\nNOTE:\tIf \"QoSTiming_5G\" feature is supported in Npcf_PolicyAuthorization API, and the AF/NEF request for QoS duration and QoS inactivity interval, the next steps would be repeated until the AF session is terminated as described in clause 5.2.2.2.3.\nIn addition, this procedure is triggered by the following cases:\n-\tThe UDR notifies the PCF about a policy data change (e.g. change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level, MCS Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority, or change in user profile configuration indicating whether supporting application detection and control).\n-\tThe UDR notifies the PCF about application data change (e.g. change in AF influence data or IPTV configuration data).\n-\tThe CHF provides a Spending Limit Report to the PCF as described in clause 5.3.5.\n-\tThe PCF for the UE provides to the PCF for the PDU session a UE policy container and/or the policy control request triggers that apply to the UE policy association as described in clause 5.6.2.2.\n2.\tIf the PCF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the CHF and such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report as defined in clause 5.3.2.

The figure illustrates the steps involved in the procedure, including the initiation of the PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification, the subsequent PCF-initiated SM Policy Association, and the subsequent PCF-initiated SM Policy Association. This process ensures that the network's security is maintained and that any changes to the security policy are properly implemented.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2.1-1: AF Session Establishment triggers PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure\n1.\tWhen the AF receives an internal or external trigger to set-up a new AF session, the AF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation to the PCF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10] by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Application Sessions\" resource.\n1a.\tThe AF provides the Service Information to the PCF by sending a Diameter AAR for a new Rx Diameter session.\n2.\tThe PCF stores the Service Information received in step 1.\n3-4.\tIf the PCF does not have the subscription data for the SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI, it invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"SessionManagementPolicyData\" resource.

The figure includes various components such as the AF Session, PCF, SM Policy Association Modification, and the associated SM Policy, all of which are essential for managing network security and performance.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2.2-1: AF Session Modification triggers PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure\n1.\tWhen the AF receives an internal or external trigger to modify an existing AF session, the AF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to the PCF by sending the HTTP PATCH request to the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource including the modified service information as defined in clause 4.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [10]. The AF may also provide the updated subscription to notifications on user plane events. To invoke/revoke MPS for DTS, the AF includes the MPS Action indication as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\nIf the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported the AF may also update the TSC Assistance Container and QoS related data and/or a UMIC and/or one or more PMIC(s).\n1a.\tThe AF provides the Service Information to the PCF by sending a Diameter AAR for the existing Rx Diameter session corresponding to the modified AF session.\n2.\tThe PCF stores the received Service Information.\n3-4.\tThese steps are the same as steps 3-4 in clause 5.2.2.2.2.1.\n5.\tThe PCF identifies the affected existing PDU Session(s) using the information previously received from the SMF and the Service Information received from the AF.\n6.\tThe PCF sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" or HTTP \"204 No Content\" response to the AF.\n6a.\tThe H-PCF sends a Diameter AAA to the AF.\n7.\tThe AF may decide to (un)subscribe to events for the active AF application session context in relation to the corresponding PDU session.\n-\tIf the AF decides to create a subscription to events or modify the events subscription, it invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation by sending the HTTP PUT request to the \"Events Subscription\" resource. The HTTP request includes the events that subscribes and may also include a Notification URI to indicate to the PCF where to send the notification of the subscribed events.\n-\tIf the AF decides to remove subscription to all subscribed events for the existing application session context, it invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Events Subscription\" resource.\n8.\tThe PCF responses to the AF.\n-\tIf the PCF accept the HTTP PUT request to create a subscription to events, it sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response.\n-\tIf the PCF accept the HTTP PUT request to modify the events subscription, it sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" or HTTP \"204 No Content\" response.\n-\tUpon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request to remove subscription to all subscribed events, the PCF sends an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response.\n9.\tThe PCF interacts with SMF according to Figure 5.2.2.2-1.\nThis procedure is performed when the AF/NEF requests the PCF to delete the AF application session context.\nNOTE:\tThe NEF acts as an AF to support the network exposure functionality for policy/charging capability.\nFor the integration with TSC networks the AF represented in the figures is either the TSN AF (integration with IEEE TSN networks) or the TSCTSF (integration with other TSC networks than IEEE TSN).\nThe figure depicts a complex network scenario, specifically focusing on the AF Session Termination triggers PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure. It illustrates the steps involved in modifying the SM Policy Association in an AF Session Termination, which is a crucial process in network management. The figure includes various components such as PCF (Policy Control Function), SM (Session Management), and the SM Policy Association, all of which are essential for maintaining network stability and performance. The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy in the network, as shown by the dashed lines, to ensure failover reliability. Overall, the figure provides a detailed and technical overview of the AF Session Termination process, highlighting the various components and their roles in network management.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2.3-1: AF Session Termination triggers PCF-initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure\n1.\tThe AF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource to request the removal of the AF application session as defined in clause 4.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].

or\nii.\tthe PCF determines that EPS to 5GS mobility applies, the PCF triggers a UE Policy Association Termination procedure as described in clause 5.6.3.2.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the Home Routed case, the PCF interacts with the H-PCF for the UE and, in the LBO case, the PCF in the V-PLMN interacts with the V-PCF for the UE as described in clause 4.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.525 [31].\n6.\tThe PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation to indicate that an event for which the AF requested a notification has occurred by sending the HTTP POST request with \"{notifUri}/notify\" as the callback URI to the AF or to request to the AF the deletion of the active application session if all the service data flows for the AF session are deleted by sending the HTTP POST request with \"{notifUri}/terminate\" as the callback URI to the AF.\nIf the feature \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported:\n-\tWhen the PCF detects that there is no Individual Application Session Context resource bound to the Individual SM Policy resource the PCF shall provide the new TSC user plane node information received in step 2 to the TSN AF or TSCTSF by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"{notifUri}/new-bridge\" request URI, where the \"{notifUri}\" value is pre-configured in the PCF or, if not pre-configured, discovered by invoking the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.510 [51].\nNOTE 4:\tThe TSCTSF registers in the NRF the notification URI within the default notification subscription for time sensitive communication, time synchronization and deterministic networking notifications as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [51].\n-\tWhen the PCF detects that there is an Individual Application Session Context resource bound to the Individual SM Policy resource, the PCF shall provide the received UMIC and/or PMICs to the AF by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"{notifUri}/notify\" callback URI.\nWhen the PCF as a PCF for a PDU session becomes aware that a SM Policy Association that is being modified is receiving the callback URI of the PCF for a UE in step 2, the PCF shall send the event of PDU session established to the PCF for a UE by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"{notifUri}/pdu-session\" callback URI as defined in subclause 4.2.5.22 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\n6a.\tIf the AF requested a notification of the corresponding event, the PCF sends a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the event that caused the request. If all service data flows for an AF session are deleted, the PCF sends a Diameter ASR to request to the AF the termination of the active session.\n7.\tThe AF sends an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response to the PCF.\nIf the feature \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported and the TSN AF or TSCTSF received the notification of new TSC user plan node information over the \"{notifUri}/new-bridge\" request URI, the TSN AF or TSCTSF shall trigger the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.1, to request the creation of a new Individual Application Session Context resource specific to the PDU session identified by, for Ethernet type of PDU sessions, the received MAC address of the DS-TT port and for IP type of PDU sessions, the received UE IP address.\nNOTE 5:\tFor the time synchronization service, the AF subscription to UE availability for time-synchronization service can occur after the PDU Session establishment has been completed in 5GS. Similarly, for the AF session with required QoS, the indication of the required QoS and TSC Assistance Container information can occur after the completion of the PDU session establishment. In such cases, the PCF sends the notification to the TSCTSF about the detection of a TSC user plane node information during PDU session establishment, but the TSCTSF doesn't have the time synchronization or required QoS available for the PDU session. In this case, the TSCTSF could defer the invocation of the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation till the reception of the subscription to UE availability for time synchronization or the AF session with required QoS occurs.\nIf the PCF for a UE receives the notification of PDU session establishment over the \"{notifUri}/pdu-session\" request URI and if the \"ApplicationDetectionEvents\" feature is supported, the PCF for a UE may trigger the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation described in clause 4.2.6.9 to subscribe to the notification of the application detection;\n7a.\tIf the AF receives an event notification, the AF replies with a Diameter RAA and may provide within it updated service information. If the AF receives an indication that all service data flows for an AF session are deleted, the AF replies with a Diameter ASA.\n8.\tIf the PCF indicates in step 5 that an event for the active application session has occurred, the AF may invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to the PCF by sending the HTTP PATCH request to the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource including the modified service information.\n8a.\tIf the PCF indicates in step 5a that an event for the active application session has occurred, the AF may send a Diameter AAR to the PCF including the modified service information.\n9.\tThe PCF sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" or an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response to the AF.\n8a,\tThe AF responds by sending a Diameter AAA to the PCF.\n10.\tIf the PCF indicates in step 5 that there are no transmission resources for the service, the AF may terminate the AF session by invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource to terminate the AF session. The request may include the events to subscribe to.\n10a.\tThe AF sends a Diameter STR message to the PCF to indicate that the AF session is terminated.\n11.\tThe PCF removes the AF application session context and sends an HTTP \"204 No Content\". If the PCF need to include the notification of event, it sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response.\n11a.\tThe PCF responds by sending a Diameter STA message to the AF and the AF session is terminated.\n12.\tIf the PCF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the CHF and such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report as defined in clause 5.3.2. If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber, and the PCF decides to modify the list of subscribed policy counters, the PCF sends an Intermediate Spending Limit Report as defined in clause 5.3.3. If the PCF decides to unsubscribe any future status notification of policy counters, it sends a Final Spending Limit Report Request to cancel the request for reporting the change of the status of the policy counters available at the CHF as defined in clause 5.3.4.\n13.\tThe PCF makes a policy decision. The PCF may determine that updated or new policy information needs to be sent to the SMF in step 22.\n14-15.\tIf network slice data rate related policy control applies, the (H-)PCF may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation by sending an HTTP PATCH request targeting the \"SlicePolicyControlData\" resource in order to update the Remaining Maximum Slice Data Rate information.\nIf the BindingUpdate feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.521 [22] is supported, the steps 16 to 17 will be performed, otherwise the steps 18 to 21 will be performed.\n16.\tIf the UE address changes and the binding information has been previously registered in the BSF, or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, and the PCF registered binding information without including the UE address and UE address is received in step 2 and required for the retrieval of binding information by any NF (e.g. for PDU session binding), the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Update service operation by sending an HTTP PATCH request to update the binding information in the BSF as detailed in clause 8.5.7.\n17.\tThe PCF receives an HTTP \"200 OK\" response from the BSF.\n18.\tIf the IP address is released for the IP PDU session or the MAC address is not used anymore for the Ethernet PDU session and the binding information has been previously registered in the BSF, the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Deregister service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the BSF to delete binding information as detailed in clause 8.5.3.\n19.\tThe PCF receives an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response from the BSF as detailed in clause 8.5.3.\n20.\tIf a new IP address is allocated for the IP PDU session or a new MAC address is used for the Ethernet PDU session and the BSF is to be used, or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, and the PCF registered binding information without including the UE address and UE address is received in step 2 and required for the retrieval of binding information by any NF, the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Register service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to create the binding information in the BSF as detailed in clause 8.5.2.\n21.\tThe PCF receives an HTTP \"201 Created\" response from the BSF with the created binding information as detailed in clause 8.5.2.\n22.\tThe PCF sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response to the SMF with updated policy information about the PDU Session determined in step 13.\nIf the feature \"EpsUrsp\" is supported, the PCF sends in the HTTP \"200 OK\" response to the SMF the UE policy container and/or the UE policy association triggers received from the PCF for the UE in step 5, if applicable.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in terminating an SM policy association, which is a crucial component of network management and security. The figure shows the SMF initiating the termination process, followed by the SM policy association being terminated, and finally, the association being reestablished. The figure is a visual aid to understand the complex process and its implications in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.2.3.1-1: SMF-initiated SM Policy Association Termination procedure\nThis procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.\nIn the LBO roaming case, the PCF acts as the V-PCF, and the V-PCF shall not contact the UDR/CHF. In the home routed roaming case, the PCF acts as the H-PCF, and the H-PCF interacts only with the H-SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tFor LBO roaming case, session management policy data is not stored in the VPLMN. Therefore, interactions between PCF and UDR in the SM Policy Association Termination procedures do not apply to this scenario.\n1.\tThe SMF invokes the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Individual SM Policy\" resource to request the PCF to delete the context of the SM related policy as defined in clause 4.2.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].

It involves the termination of a policy association between a Service Management Function (SMF) and a Service Management Policy (SMP). This process ensures that the SMF can continue to operate without interference from the SMP, and that the SMP can continue to operate without interference from the SMF.

The NEF determines the HPLMN based on the AF request and its local configuration as described in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24]. If the HPLMN is the PLMN that the NEF belongs to, the procedure continues as described in this clause. Otherwise, the procedure described in clause 5.5.3.4 will be performed instead.\n3-4.\tWhen receiving the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create request, the NEF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Create service operation defined in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12] to store the AF request information in the UDR by sending the HTTP PUT request to the \"Individual Influence Data\" resource, and the UDR sends a \"201 Created\" response.\nWhen receiving the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update request, the NEF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.519 [12] to modify the AF request information in the UDR by sending the HTTP PATCH/PUT request to the resource \"Individual Influence Data\", and the UDR sends a \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" response accordingly.\nWhen receiving the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Delete request, the NEF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Delete service operation to delete the AF requirements from the UDR by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual Influence Data\" resource, and the UDR sends a \"204 No Content\" response.\n5.\tThe NEF sends the HTTP response message to the AF correspondingly.\n6.\tThe PCF retrieves the stored AF request in the UDR by invoking the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation during SM Policy Association Establishment procedure (see clause 5.2.1).\nThe PCF generates the PCC rule(s) based on the AF request and provides it to the SMF as specified in in clause 4.2.6.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [9].\n6a.\tThis step is the same as the step 3a in Figure 5.5.3.2-1.\n7.\tIf the SMF observes PDU Session related event(s) that AF has subscribed to, the SMF invokes the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation to the NEF by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI \"{notifUri}\". If the indication of AF acknowledgement to be expected was included in the PCC rule(s), the SMF may notify with an URI for the AF acknowledgement as described in 3GPP TS 29.508 [8].\n8.\tWhen receiving the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation, the NEF performs information mapping (e.g. Notification Correlation ID to AF Transaction ID), and invokes the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify service operation to forward the notification to the AF by sending the HTTP request to the callback URI \"notificationDestination\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24]. If the notification from the SMF includes an URI for the AF acknowledgement, the NEF also notifies with a URI for the AF acknowledgement as described in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\n9.\tThe AF sends an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response to the NEF.\n10.\tThe NEF sends an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response to the SMF.\n11-12.\tWhen receiving the notification with the URI for AF acknowledgement from the NEF, the AF invokes Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI \"{afAckUri}\" to acknowledge the notification, and the NEF sends a \"204 No Content\" response to the AF. If the \"ULBuffering\" feature is supported, the AF may provide an indication that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is needed to the NEF.\n13-14.\tWhen receiving the AF acknowledgement from the AF, to forward it to the SMF, the NEF invokes Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI \"{ackUri}\", and the SMF sends a \"204 No Content\" response to the NEF. If the NEF receives the indication that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is needed and the NEF determines that the SMF supports the \"ULBuffering\" feature as defined in 3GPP TS 29.508 [8], the NEF provides the indication that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is needed to the SMF.\nIf the AF traffic influence request affects ongoing PDU session, the traffic influence procedure is performed as depicted in Figure 5.5.3.3-2.\n\nThe figure depicts a complex network architecture, illustrating the processing of AF requests to influence traffic routing for Sessions not identified by an UE address, affecting ongoing PDU session.

This step can occur at any time before step 4.\n2.\tThe AF may subscribe to (or unsubscribe from) the BSF using Nbsf_Management_Subscribe (or Nbsf_Management_Unsubscribe) to be informed about PCF for a UE registrations for the target UE, as described in clause 4.2.6 (for subscribing) or clause 4.2.7 (for unsubscribing) of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].\n3.\tThe BSF responds by confirming the received request and, in the case of subscription, including the existing PCF for a UE registration in the response, if found, as described in clause 4.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].\n4.\tThe BSF notifies the AF once there is a PCF for a UE registration for the UE indicated in the subscription as described in clause 4.2.8 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].\n5.\tThe AF confirms the received notification by sending a \"204 No Content\" response as described in clause 4.2.8 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].\n6.\tTo create a new AF request, the AF invokes the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Create service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"Application AM Contexts\" resource as described in clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [50].\nTo update an existing AF request, the AF invokes the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Update service operation by sending an HTTP PATCH request to the \"Individual Application AM Context\" resource as described in clause 4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [50].\nTo remove an existing AF request, the AF invokes the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual Application AM Context\" resource as described in clause 4.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [50].\n7.\tThe PCF responds to the creation, update, or deletion request as described respectively in clauses 4.2.2, 4.2.3, or 4.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [50].\nIf the creation or update request included the subscription to event(s) together with the indication of immediate reporting of the currently available values of the subscribed events, the PCF includes in the response the applicable event(s) information, if available, as specified respectively in clauses 4.2.2 or 4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [50].\n8.\tAM Policy Association modification initiated by the PCF may be performed as described in clause 5.1.2.2.\n9-10.\tWhen an event (e.g. service coverage area change) occurs to which the AF has previously subscribed, the PCF notifies the AF using the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI included in the subscription, and the AF responds by sending a confirmation, as described in clause 4.2.7 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [50].\nNOTE:\tThe subscriptions required for steps 9-10 can have happened either in the Create/Update steps or with a separate Subscribe message which is not shown in the call flow.\nThis procedure concerns non-roaming and LBO roaming scenarios, i.e. to cases where the involved entities serving the UE (i.e. NEF, UDR, PCF, BSF, AMF) belong to the Serving PLMN. The AF may belong to the Serving PLMN (trusted AF) or to a third party with which the Serving PLMN has an agreement (untrusted AF). In LBO roaming, the AF requests target \"any inbound roaming UEs identified by their home PLMN ID(s)\" combined with DNN/S-NSSAI or Application Identifier(s).\nThis procedure is used by the AF to provide its AM policy related request for one or multiple UEs at any time.\nThe figure depicts a flowchart illustrating the process of processing Access and Mobility related policy requests. It includes various stages such as AF request generation, AF request processing, and AF request response. The figure provides a visual representation of the flow and the steps involved in processing these requests, making it easier to understand the overall process.\nFigure 5.5.10.3-1: Processing AF requests to influence Access and Mobility related policy\n1.\tAn AM Policy Association is established as described in clause 5.1.1 (including the retrieval of and subscription to AM Influence data in steps 2 and 4). This step may occur at any time before step 7.\n2.\tTo create a new AF request, the AF invokes the Nnef_AMInfluence_Create service operation to the NEF by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"AM Influence Subscription\" resource. The AF may subscribe to Access and Mobility management related events (e.g. about service area coverage change outcome) as part of this operation.\nTo update an existing AF request, the AF invokes the Nnef_AMInfluence_Update service operation by sending an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to the \"Individual AM Influence Subscription\" resource. The AF may subscribe to or unsubscribe from Access and Mobility management related events (e.g. about service area coverage change outcome) as part of this operation.\nTo remove an existing AF request, the AF invokes the Nnef_AMInfluence_Delete service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual AM Influence Subscription\" resource. The AF may unsubscribe from Access and Mobility management related events (e.g. about service area coverage change outcome) as part of this operation.\n3.\tUpon receipt of the AF request, the NEF authorizes it and then performs the mapping from the information provided by the AF into information needed by the 5GC (e.g. translate a GPSI into a SUPI) as described in clause 4.4.27 of 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\n4-5.\tWhen receiving the Nnef_AMInfluence_Create request, the NEF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Create service operation to store the AF request information in the UDR by sending an HTTP PUT request to the \"Individual AM Influence Data\" resource, and the UDR sends a \"201 Created\" response.\nWhen receiving the Nnef_AMInfluence_Update request, the NEF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation to modify the AF request information in the UDR by sending an HTTP PATCH or PUT request to the resource \"Individual AM Influence Data\", and the UDR sends a \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" response accordingly.\nWhen receiving the Nnef_AMInfluence_Delete request, the NEF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Delete service operation to delete the AF request information from the UDR by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual AM Influence Data\" resource, and the UDR sends a \"204 No Content\" response.\n6.\tThe NEF sends an HTTP response message to the AF correspondingly.\n7-8.\tThe UDR notifies the PCF(s) that have subscriptions (from step 1) which match the received AF request using the Nudr_DataRepository_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI of the PCF that was included in the subscription, and the PCF(s) send a \"204 No Content\" response.\n9.\tIf the received AM Influence data indicated that the AM policy depends on PDU session traffic events (e.g. the application start and application stop for an application Id or PDU session establishment and termination for a DNN and S-NSSAI combination), the PCF for the UE may discover the PCF(s) for a PDU Session that handle(s) the respective UE traffic as described in clause 8.4a.\n10-11.\tIf the received AM Influence data indicated that the request is dependent (or does not depend anymore) on the existence of UE traffic that matches one or more application identifiers and the feature \"ApplicationDetectionEvents\" defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10] is supported, the PCF for the UE may subscribe (or unsubscribe) to the PCF(s) for the PDU Session for notifications about application traffic detection (e.g. start, stop) of the application(s) indicated in the AM Influence data using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation as described in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10] clause 4.2.6.9.\n12.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session creates PCC rule(s) including the application ID(s) in the service data flow description, if they do not already exist, and installs the PCC rule(s) and the Policy Control request trigger(s), also if they do not already exist, to detect the start/stop of application traffic in the SMF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9]. When the SMF detects that the Policy Control Request Trigger is met, the SMF reports to the PCF for the PDU session the start or stop of concerned the application traffic.\n13-14.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session may notify the PCF for the UE about the detected event using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the notification URI received in the subscription, and the PCF for the UE responds with \"204 No Content\", as described in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10] clause 4.2.5.19.\n15.\tAM Policy Association modification initiated by the PCF may be performed as described in clause 5.1.2.2.\n16-19.\tIf the AF had subscribed to an Access and Mobility management related event (e.g. about service area coverage change outcome), the PCF may send respective notification(s) to the NEF using the Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST message as described in clause 4.2.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.523 [49] to the notification URI that was included in the AM Influence data retrieved from the UDR. The NEF forwards such received notifications to the AF using the Nnef_AMInfluence_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST message to the notification URI previously received from the AF. The AF sends a \"204 No Content\" response to the NEF and the NEF sends a \"204 No Content\" response to the PCF.\n",

The AF that is part of the operator's trust domain may invoke the services directly with TSCTSF; in such case, the TSCTSF directly responds/notifies the AF, accordingly.\nThe procedure is used by the AF to subscribe to notifications and to explicitly cancel a previous subscription for UE availability for time synchronization service.\nThe figure depicts the UE's exposure to Time Synchronization service availability and its capabilities for synchronization. It shows the UE's ability to receive and transmit Time Synchronization signals, as well as its readiness to receive and transmit Time Synchronization signals. The figure also highlights the UE's ability to receive and transmit Time Synchronization signals, as well as its readiness to receive and transmit Time Synchronization signals.\nFigure 5.5.11.2-1: Exposure of UE availability and capabilities for Time Synchronization service\n0.\tDuring SM Policy Association establishment, the PCF determines if the PDU Session is potentially impacted by time synchronization service (based on local configuration) and provides the \"TSN_BRIDGE_INFO\" policy control request trigger to the SMF as described in figure 5.2.1-1, step 11. During SM Policy Association modification (triggered during PDU session establishment), the SMF may report it to the PCF to provide TSC user plane node information (device side port number, DS-TT MAC address (to identify the PDU session), if applicable, TSC user plane node Id and UE-DS-TT residence time, if available), and, if available, a UMIC and/or one or more PMIC(s), as described in figure 5.2.2.3-1, step 2. For IP PDU sessions, the PCF uses the UE IP address to identify the PDU session. The PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation to notify to the TSCTSF the received TSC user plane node information for the PDU session, and, if available, the received UMIC/PMIC(s), as described in figure 5.2.2.3-1, step 5.\nThe TSCTSF retrieves the UE SUPI from the BSF using the UE IP address, and may get from UDM Time Synchronization Subscription Data, that may contain either one or more subscribed time synchronization service Id(s) (that map to a PTP instance configuration in the TSCTSF for the DNN/S-NSSAI) or an indication that an AF-requested (g)PTP time synchronization service is allowed for the given UE and DNN/S-NSSAI.\nIf an AF-requested (g)PTP time synchronization service is allowed for the UE and DNN/S-NSSAI, the TSCTSF then invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request message to the PCF as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.1 to create an AF-session. The TSCTSF may subscribe with the PCF to the \"TSN_BRIDGE_INFO\" event, to get notifications abut PMIC/UMIC updates as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10]. For IP PDU sessions, the TSCTSF stores the DNN, S-NSSAI and IP address as received from PCF and SUPI as received from BSF and associates them with the AF-session, as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nThe received PMIC(s)/UMIC, if available, may contain (g)PTP instance configuration for the reported DS-TT/NW-TT.\nIf the TSCTSF retrieves from UDM one or more time synchronization service Id(s) matching PTP instance configuration for the DNN/S-NSSAI, the TSCTSF distributes the PTP instance configuration as described in clause 5.5.11.3.\n1.\tTo subscribe to notifications of the UE availability for time synchronization service, the AF invokes the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe service operation to the NEF by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Time Synchronization Exposure Subscriptions\" resource as defined in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\nTo unsubscribe to the UE availability for time synchronization for a list of UE(s), the AF invokes Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe service operation to the NEF by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource as defined in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\n2.\tThe NEF selects the TSCTSF and maps the received parameters to 5GC parameters, if applicable, as described in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24] and invokes the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Time Synchronization Exposure\" resource as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nIn the case of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe, the NEF interacts with the TSCTSF by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nThe AF that is part of operator's trust domain may invoke the requests directly to the TSCTSF.\n3.\tIf the request includes GPSI(s), an External Group Identifier or an Internal Group Identifier, the TSCTSF uses the Nudm_SDM_Get request as described in 3GPP TS 29.503 [61] to retrieve the subscription information for the target UEs (i.e., to retrieve the SUPI(s)) from the UDM, using each GPSI or the External Group Identifier as received from the NEF, or an Internal Group Identifier as provided directly by the AF).\nFor the retrieved SUPI(s), the TSCTSF requests the Time Synchronization Subscription Data from the UDM if not previously retrieved in step 0, to validate whether the AF request for (g)PTP-based time distribution for the DNN and S-NSSAI is allowed by the UE subscription.\n4.\tThe TSCTSF uses the parameters received in step 2 and step 3 (i.e. DNN, S-NSSAI and SUPI(s)) to find matching AF-session(s) as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nIf the subscription data for the UE indicates that the AF is not allowed to request (g)PTP-based time synchronization for this UE, DNN and S-NSSAI combination, the corresponding AF-session is excluded from the list of matching AF-sessions.\nFor any AF-session in the list of matching AF-session(s), the TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10], to provide/retrieve UMIC/PMIC information, if not available in the TSCTSF, from the NW-TT/DS-TT to read the (g)PTP capabilities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], K.2.2.1\nIn the case of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe, the TSCTSF, for the AF-session(s) in the list of matching AF-session(s), triggers a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10], deletes the corresponding \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource and responds to the NEF (or AF) with a \"204 No Content\" status code. Steps 4-5 and 8-16 are skipped.\n5.\tThe PCF responds with a \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" status code to the received PATCH request.\n6.\tTSCTSF acknowledges the execution of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe to the requester that initiated the request (NEF or AF) by sending a \"201 Created\" status code.\nWhen the request was to unsubscribe to the UE availability for time synchronization, the TSCTSF deletes the corresponding \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource and responds to the NEF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n7.\tNEF acknowledges the execution of Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe to the AF by sending a \"201 Created\" status code.\nWhen the request was to unsubscribe to the UE availability for time synchronization, the NEF deletes the corresponding \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource and responds to the AF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n8\tFor each AF-session for which the TSCTSF triggered the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request as described in step 4, the PCF provides to the SMF the UMIC/PMIC information received from the TSCTSF and for the concerned PDU session as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.2.\n9\tWhen the SMF detects UMIC/PMIC changes for the NW-TT/DS-TT for each concerned PDU sessions, the SMF provides the updated UMIC/PMIC information to the PCF as described in clause 5.2.2.3.\n10.\tThe TSCTSF receives UMIC/PMIC information from NW-TT/DS-TT ports from the PCF, with the notification of BRIDGE_INFO events as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10]. The PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.\n11.\tThe TSCTSF responds to the PCF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n12.\tThe TSCTSF uses the procedures described in clause K.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2] to determine the (g)PTP capabilities from the DS-TT and, if not previously determined, the (g)PTP capabilities from the NW-TT.\nThe TSCTSF composes the time synchronization capabilities for the DS-TT/UE(s) connected to the NW-TT based on the capability information received from the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT for each AF-session. If the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe request included an Event Filter with one or more of the requested PTP instance type, requested transport protocol for PTP, or requested PTP Profile, the TSCTSF considers only the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT(s) with these capabilities as part of the time synchronization capability set that is reported to the NEF (or AF).\nThe TSCTSF maintains, for the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource, the association between the user-plane Node ID, the time synchronization capabilities, the Event Filter(s) (if available), the NEF or AF Notification Target Address and list of the matching AF-sessions with PCFs with this user-plane Node ID.\n13.\tThe TSCTSF sends Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify to the NEF by invoking the HTTP POST request, as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60]. The message includes the time synchronization capabilities as composed for all the matching AF-sessions in step 12. The message contains one or more user-plane Node ID(s), a list of UE identities associated to each user-plane Node ID and time synchronization capabilities for each set of DS-TTs (UEs) connected to given user-plane Node ID. The user-plane Node ID identifies the NW-TT to where the UE/DS-TT(s) are connected to.\n14.\tThe NEF responds to the PCF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n15.\tThe NEF forwards the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify with Time Synchronization capability event to the AF by invoking the HTTP POST request as described in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\n16.\tThe AF responds the NEF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\nAt PDU Session Establishment as defined is step 0, steps 3-5 and steps 8-16 are repeated for the new PDU Session/AF-session and the TSCTSF may notify the NEF (or AF) for the Time Synchronization capability event, optionally with the updated time synchronization capabilities.\nUpon PDU Session release indication from a PCF, the TSCTSF removes the corresponding AF-session from the list of AF-sessions associated with the time synchronization exposure subscription resource, once the corresponding AF-session is removed from the list of AF-sessions associated with the time synchronization configuration, as described in clause 5.5.11.3. The changes in the set of capabilities are notified to the NEF and AF as described in steps 13 to 16.\nThe AF may use Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe service operation as described in clause 5.5.11.2 to learn the UE capabilities for time synchronization service for a list of UE identities. The Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify service operation indicates the list of UE identities per User-plane Node ID that match the provided time synchronization capabilities.\nThe AF can use the user-plane node ID received in the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify service operation as a target of the configuration of a PTP instance in the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a time synchronization service activation, modification, and deactivation process. The figure illustrates the steps involved in managing the service, including the activation, modification, and deactivation of the service. The service is crucial for ensuring accurate time synchronization in telecommunication networks.\nFigure 5.5.11.3-1: Time Synchronization service activation, modification and deactivation\n1.\tTo create a time synchronization service configuration for a PTP instance and user-plane node ID, the AF invokes the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate service operation to the NEF by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Time Synchronization Exposure Configurations\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\nTo update an existing time synchronization service configuration for a PTP instance and user-plane node ID, the AF invokes the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate service operation by sending the HTTP PUT request to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" resource.\nTo remove an existing time synchronization service configuration for a PTP instance and user-plane node ID, the AF invokes the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete service operation by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" resource.\nThe NEF authorizes the AF request. The request contains user-plane node ID as reference to the target of UEs and AF-sessions held in the TSCTSF in the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource for the indicated user-plane node ID.\nThe Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request creates also a subscription to notifications for the changes in the time synchronization service configuration.\nThe AF may also subscribe to time synchronization status report by including (optionally) the clock quality detail level set to \"acceptable/not acceptable indication\" and providing clock quality acceptance criteria.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AF request for PTP service activation, modification cannot indicate that the clock quality detail level to provide is \"metrics\", i.e. if the AF includes the clock quality detail level, its value needs to set to \"acceptable/not acceptable indication\" and accompanied with \"clock quality acceptance criteria\". The UE/DS-TT retrieves detailed information (timing synchronization metrics) from Announce messages sent for (g)PTP services.\n2\tThe NEF authorizes the AF request and translates the received parameters into 5GC parameters as described in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24] before invoking the TSCTSF services (e.g., if the AF request includes a time synchronization coverage area formulated using a geographical description of the area(e.g., civic addresses or shapes), the NEF transforms this information into 3GPP identifiers (e.g. TA(s)) based on pre-configuration).\nWhen the NEF receives the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request, the NEF invokes the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate service operation to create time synchronization service configuration for a PTP instance and a user-plane node ID in an \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource in the TSCTSF by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"Time Synchronization Exposure Configurations\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60]. If the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the NEF may include the coverage area where the indicated service configuration applies.\nWhen the NEF receives the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate request, the NEF invokes the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate service operation to update time synchronization service configuration for a PTP instance and a user-plane node ID in an \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource in the TSCTSF by sending the HTTP PUT request to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60]. If the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the NEF may include the coverage area where the indicated service configuration applies.\nWhen the NEF receives the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete request, the NEF invokes the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete service operation to delete time synchronization service configuration for a PTP instance and a user-plane node ID in an \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource in the TSCTSF by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60]. The TSCTSF sends a \"204 No Content\" response.\nAn AF that is part of operator's trust domain may invoke the TSCTSF services directly with TSCTSF.\n3.\tThe TSCTSF acknowledges the NEF request including:\n-\tFor a creation request response, a \"201 Created\" status code, including a reference to the time synchronization service configuration created (PTP instance created) represented by the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" resource.\n-\tFor an update request response, a \"200 OK\" or a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n-\tFor a delete request response, a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n4.\tThe NEF sends the HTTP response message to the AF correspondingly.\n5.\tThe TSCTSF checks with the UDM if the concerned UE(s) are allowed to receive the time sync service configuration.\nThe TSCTSF uses user-plane node ID and the PTP instance information (PTP instance type, transport protocol and PTP profile) of the request and the related \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource, to determine the target UEs (SUPI(s)) and checks whether the AF requested parameters comply with the stored Time Synchronization Subscription Data retrieved from the UDM as described in clause 5.5.11.2.\nIf the \"AF request Authorization\" in the Time Synchronization Subscription Data for the affected SUPI indicates that the AF is allowed to request PTP instance configuration, the TSCTSF proceeds with the configuration. Otherwise (i.e., the \"AF request Authorization\" is not allowed), steps 4 and steps 7-19 are skipped for this UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AF-sessions that are not associated with a time synchronization configuration (for a user-plane node Id, specific PTP instance information, and the related \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource), are available to be selected as suitable AF-sessions in another Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate/Update request.\nIf the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request contains a temporal validity condition with a start-time and/or the stop-time that is in the future, the TSCTSF maintains the start-time and stop-time for the time synchronization service for the corresponding time synchronization configuration. If the start-time is in the past, the TSCTSF treats the request as if the time synchronization service is activated immediately. When the start-time is reached, the TSCTSF proceeds with the activation of the service. When the stop-time is reached for an active time synchronization service configuration, the TSCTSF proceeds as if an Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete request is received.\n6.\tIf the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the NEF may include in step 2 the coverage area where the indicated service configuration applies. The TSCTSF determines the Time Synchronization Coverage Area by selecting the TA(s) that are part of both, the list of TA(s) provided by the NEF and the list of TA(s) stored in the Time Synchronization Subscription Data. Then, the TSCTSF performs the following operations:\n-\tThe TSCTSF subscribes with the AMF(s) for UE presence in Area of Interest composed by the TA(s) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\n-\tBased on the notification from the AMF, the TSCTSF determines whether to activate time synchronization service for this UE:\na.\tIf the UE presence is within any of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines to activate the received PTP instance configuration for the authorized UE.\nb.\tIf the UE presence is not within any of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines to set to inactive the received PTP instance configuration for the authorized UE.\n7.\tFor each authorized UE (in step 3 and step 4) and matched AF-session, the TSCTSF uses the procedures described in clause K.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] to configure and initialize the PTP instance in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT according to the parameters received in step 2. The TSCTSF constructs a PMIC to each DS-TT/UE to activate the time synchronization service in DS-TT and constructs PMIC(s) and UMIC to NW-TT to activate the time synchronization service in NW-TT.\nIf in step 1 the AF subscribes to time synchronization status report, the TSCTSF may subscribe for notifications about changes in NG-RAN and UPF/NW-TT (if applicable) timing synchronization status as described in clause 5.5.11.5.\n8.\tFor each authorized UE and matched AF-session, the TSCTSF delivers the PMIC(s) and UMIC to NW-TT and the PMIC(s) to DS-TT/UE by invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service procedure as specified in clause 5.2.2.2.2.2.\n9.\tThe PCF acknowledges the request with a \"200 OK\" or a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n10.\tFor each AF-session for which the TSCTSF triggered the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request, the PCF provides the UMIC/PMIC information for the concerned PDU session as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.2.\n11\tThe DS-TT(s) and the NW-TT response is encoded in the corresponding PMIC(s)/UMIC containers which are delivered by the SMF to the PCF in an SM Policy Association modification initiated by the SMF procedure, as described in clause 5.2.2.3.\n12.\tThe TSCTSF receives UMIC/PMIC information from NW-TT/DS-TT ports from the PCF with the notification about BRIDGE_INFO events for each AF-session, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10]. The PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.\n13.\tThe TSCTSF responds to the PCF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n14.\tUpon reception of responses from each DS-TT and the NW-TT (for all affected AF sessions), the TSCTSF determines the state of the time synchronization configuration for the indicated PTP instance and user-plane node ID.\n15.\tThe TSCTSF uses the procedure in clause 5.5.11.4, steps 5-9, to activate or modify the 5G access stratum time distribution for the UEs that are part of the indicated PTP instance.\n16.\tFor an active PTP instance, the TSCTSF notifies the NEF (or AF), with the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdateNotify service operation, by sending to the NEF (or AF) callback URI the HTTP POST request containing notification correlation identifer and the current state of the time synchronization service configuration for the NW-TT and DS-TTs (of the indicated PTP instance and user-plane node ID) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nIf the TSCTSF receives a spatial validity condition as described in step 6, whenever the UE moves in or out of the Area of Interest, the TSCTSF may indicate to the AF whether a PTP port is activated or deactivated due to change of UE presence status in the Area of Interest. If the feature \"NetTimeSynchStatus\" is supported, and the state of the time synchronization service configuration for the NW-TT and/or DS-TT changes, the TSCTSF may indicate to the AF whether the PTP port is activated or deactivated due to a detected failure, degradation, or improvement of the time synchronization service.\n17.\tThe NEF (or AF) acknowledges the notification request by replying with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n18.\tThe NEF forwards to the AF in the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdateNotify service operation the current state of the time synchronization service configuration for the NW-TT and DS-TT (for the active PTP instance and user-plane node ID) by invoking the HTTP POST request to the AF callback URI.\n19.\t The AF acknowledges the notification request by replying with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n20.\tIf TSCTSF received a time synchronization coverage area as part of the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request in step 2, upon the reception of a change in the UE presence in Area of Interest notification, the TSCTSF determines if the time synchronization coverage area condition shall trigger an activation or deactivation of the PTI instance configuration:\n-\tIf the UE moves within any of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, then the TSCTSF adds the UE/DS-TT port to the PTP instance.\n-\tIf the UE moves outside all of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, then the TSCTSF removes the UE/DS-TT port rom the PTP instance.\nThe TSCTSF configures the Grandmaster functionality, as applicable, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60]. The TSCTSF delivers the PMIC and/or UMIC as described in steps 8-15. The TSCTSF updates the state of the time synchronization configuration and may notify the NEF (or AF) as described in step 16-19..\n21.\tFor an active PTP instance, the TSCTSF notifies the NEF (or AF), with the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdateNotify service operation as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\n22.\tThe NEF (or AF) acknowledges the notification request by replying with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n23.\tThe NEF forwards to the AF in the Nnef_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdateNotify service operation.\n24.\t The AF acknowledges the notification request by replying with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the AF receives a clock quality acceptance criteria result (acceptable/not acceptable), the AF decides whether to modify the service configured for the UE of a PTP instance or whether to deactivate it (deleting the PTP instance configuration).\nA change in the PTP instance in the DS-TT or NW-TT triggers a notification of PMIC/UMIC change towards the TSCTSF as described in clause 5.2.2.3 and steps 11-14. The change of PTP instance is notified to the NEF and AF as described in steps 16 to 19.\nUpon PDU Session release indication from a PCF, the TSCTSF removes the corresponding AF-session from the list of AF-sessions associated with the time synchronization configuration. The TSCTSF uses the procedure in clause 5.5.11.4 to remove the 5G access stratum time distribution parameters for the UE that is removed from the impacted PTP instance. The changes in the configured PTP instance are notified to the NEF and AF as described in steps 16 to 19.\nAt PDU Session Establishment step 0, step 5, and steps 8-11 of figure 5.5.11.2-1 are repeated for a new PDU Session and AF-session. The NEF (or AF) may use the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate service operation as described in figure 5.5.11.3-1 to add the DS-TT/UE to the existing PTP instance and corresponding time synchronization service configuration.\nIf the TSCTSF received a temporal validity condition, the TSCTSF checks the activation or deactivation of the time synchronization service as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nThe AF can use the procedure to activate, update or delete the 5G access stratum time distribution for one UE or a group of UE(s). The AF may also use this procedure to indicate a clock quality detail level to provide to the UE or group of UE(s) and to subscribe for time synchronization status reports.\nThe AF may query the status of the 5G access stratum time distribution using Nnef_ASTI_Get service operation. The Nnef_ASTI service is specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nThe figure depicts the management of 5G Access Stratum Time distribution, illustrating the distribution of time slots for different access stratum levels. The figure shows the distribution of time slots for the 5G Access Stratum, with each stratum having its own time slot allocation. This figure is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable 5G network operations.\nFigure 5.5.11.4-1: Management of 5G Access Stratum Time distribution\n0.\tAM Policy Association establishment as described in clause 5.1.1.\n1.\tTo provide access stratum time distribution parameters to the NEF, the AF invokes the Nnef_ASTI_Create service operation to the NEF by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"ASTI Configurations\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\nTo update previously provided access stratum time distribution parameters, the AF invokes an Nnef_ASTI_Update by sending the HTTP PUT request to the \"Individual ASTI Configuration\" resource.\nTo remove previously provided access stratum time distribution parameters, the AF invokes the Nnef_ASTI_Delete service operation by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual ASTI Configuration\" resource.\nTo query the status of the access stratum time distribution, the AF invokes Nnef_ASTI_Get service operation by sending the by sending the \"retrieve\" custom operation (HTTP POST request) to the \"ASTI Configurations\" resource.\nIf the feature \"NetTimeSynchStatus\" is supported, the AF request may indicate the clock quality detail level of the information to provide to the UE and, if required, include the clock quality acceptance criteria for the UE.\nNOTE:\tIf the AF requests clock quality detail level to be \"acceptable/not acceptable indication\", the AF needs to provide the clock quality acceptance criteria.\nBy including the clock quality acceptance criteria in a Nnef_ASTI request, the AF indicates to the TSCTSF (via the NEF) to create a subscription at the TSCTSF to get notified about the changes in 5G access stratum time distribution status.\n2.\tThe NEF authorizes the request and maps the received parameters to 5GC parameters as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24] (e.g., the NEF transforms a geographical area description provided as a spatial validity condition into 3GPP identifiers (e.g. TAIs) based on configuration). After successful authorization, the NEF invokes:\n-\tThe Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the \"ASTI Configurations\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\n-\tThe Ntsctsf_ASTI_Update service operation by sending the HTTP PUT request to the \"Individual ASTI Configuration\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\n-\tThe Ntsctsf_ASTI_Delete service operation by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the \"Individual ASTI Configuration\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\n-\tThe Ntsctsf_ASTI_Get service operation by sending the \"retrieve\" custom operation (HTTP POST request) to the \"ASTI Configurations\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nIf the TSCTSF determines the targeted UE is part of a PTP instance in 5GS (see clause 5.5.11.3), the TSCTSF rejects the request (steps 3-4 and 7-19 are skipped).\nThe AF that is part of operator's trust domain may invoke the services directly with the TSCTSF and identifies the targeted UE(s) using SUPI(s) or an Internal Group Identifier.\nIf the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create request in step 2 contains a temporal validity condition with a start-time and/or the stop-time that is in the future, the TSCTSF maintains the start-time and stop-time for the time synchronization service for the corresponding time synchronization configuration. If the start-time is in the past, the TSCTSF treats the request as if the time synchronization service is activated immediately. When the start-time is reached, the TSCTSF proceeds with the activation of the service. When the stop-time is reached for active time synchronization service configuration, the TSCTSF proceeds as if an Nnef_ASTI_Delete request is received.\n3.\tIf the targeted UE(s) are identified by GPSI(s) or External/Internal Group Identifier, the TSCTSF interacts with UDM by invoking the Nudm_SDM_Get request as specified in 3GPP TS 29.503 [61] to retrieve the Time Synchronization Subscription Data for each affected SUPI.\nIf the \"AF request Authorization\" in the Time Synchronization Subscription Data for the affected SUPI indicates that the AF is allowed to request 5G access stratum-based time distribution, the TSCTSF proceeds with ASTI service configuration. Otherwise, if the AF is not authorized, steps 4 and 7-19 are skipped for this UE.\nThe TSCTSF checks the AF request with the stored Time Synchronization Subscription Data and authorizes the request. If the request is not authorized, steps 5 to 9 are skipped.\n4.\tIf the feature \"CoverageAreaSupport\" is supported, the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create request in step 2 may contain the coverage area where the Access Stratum Time Distribution service applies. The TSCTSF determines the Time Synchronization Coverage Area by selecting the TA(s) that are part of both, the list of TA(s) provided by the NEF and the list of TA(s) stored in the Time Synchronization Subscription Data. Then, the TSCTSF performs the following operations:\n-\tThe TSCTSF subscribes with the AMF(s) for UE presence in Area of Interest composed by the TA(s) in the time synchronization coverage area as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\n-\tBased on the notification from the AMF and the time synchronization coverage area received in step 1, the TSCTSF determines whether to activate time synchronization service for this UE:\n-\tIf the UE location is within any of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines to enable access stratum time distribution for the UE.\n-\tIf the UE location is is not within any of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines to disable access stratum time distribution for the UE.\nIf in step 1 the AF subscribes to time synchronization status report (containing timing synchronization metrics or a clock quality acceptance criteria result), the TSCTSF subscribes for notification about changes in NG-RAN and UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status as described in clause 5.5.11.5.\n5.\tTo search for the PCF for the UE, the TSCTSF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"Binding Subscriptions\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.521 [22] to subscribe to notifications of PCF_UE_BINDING_REGISTRATION event for the indicated SUPI.\n6.\tIf matching entries already existed in the BSF when step 5 is performed, this entry is immediately reported to the TSCTSF in the \"201 created\" response.\n6.b.\tIf the matching entry does not exist, the BSF provides to the TSCTSF the identity of the PCF for the UE for the requested SUPI via an Nbsf_Management_Notify operation once the PCF is registered as described in clause 5.1.1.\n7.\tIf the TSCTSF decides to enable the Access Stratum Time Distribution service for the UE, the TSCTSF calculates the Uu time synchronization error budget as described in clause 5.27.1.9 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen the procedure is triggered by PTP instance activation, modification, or deactivation in the TSCTSF as described in clause 5.5.11.3, the TSCTSF calculates the Uu time synchronization error budget as described in clause 5.27.1.9 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] for the SUPIs that are part of the PTP instance.\nThe TSCTSF sends to the PCF for the UE the access stratum time distribution request using Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Create/Update request as described in 3GPP TS 29.534 [50], containing the 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable) and optionally the calculated Uu time synchronization error budget. If the feature \"NetTimeSynchStatus\" is supported, the TSCTSF provides to the PCF for the UE the AF requested clock quality detail level and clock quality acceptance criteria, if available.\n8.\tIf the PCF receives multiple time synchronization error budgets for a given UE, then the PCF picks the most stringent budget. The PCF may initiate an AM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause 5.1.2.2 to provide the AMF with the 5G access stratum time distribution parameters. If the feature \"NetTimeSynchStatus\" is supported, the PCF for the UE provides the AMF the AF requested clock quality detail level and clock quality acceptance criteria, if available.\nAs part of this procedure, the AMF, if supported, stores the 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable), the Uu time synchronization error budget, the clock quality detail level and the clock quality acceptance criteria, if available, in the UE context in the AMF and sends the 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable), the Uu time synchronization error budget, the clock quality detail level and the clock quality acceptance criteria, when they are available, to NG-RAN (during mobility registration, AM policy modification, Service Request, N2 Handover and Xn handover) as specified in 3GPP TS 38.413 [62]. The NG-RAN node, if supported, stores the information in the UE Context. Based on this information, the NG-RAN node provides the 5GS access stratum time to the UE according to the Uu time synchronization error budget as provided by the TSCTSF (if supported by UE and NG-RAN) and timing synchronization status reports to the UE.\n9.\tThe PCF of the UE replies to the TSCTSF with a \"201 Created\" status code to the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Create service request and with a \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" status code to the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Update service request.\n10.\tThe TSCTSF responds the AF/NEF with the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create/Update/Delete/Get service operation response using the \"201 Created\"/\"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\"/\"204 No Content\"/\"200 OK\" status code respectively.\n11.\tThe NEF informs the AF about the result of the Nnef_ASTI_Create/Update/Delete/Get service operation performed in step 2 using the \"201 Created\"/\"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\"/\"204 No Content\"/\"200 OK\" status code respectively.\n12.\tIf the TSCTSF receives a time synchronization coverage area as part of the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create request in step 2 or as part of the (g)PTP time synchronization service configuration, as described in clause 5.5.11.3, upon the reception of a change in the UE presence in Area of Interest notification, the TSCTSF determines if the time synchronization coverage area condition shall trigger an activation or deactivation of the access stratum time distribution:\n-\tIf the UE moves within any of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, then the TSCTSF determines to enable access stratum time distribution for the UE.\n-\tIf the UE moves outside all of the TAs from the time synchronization coverage area, then the TSCTSF determines to disable access stratum time distribution for the UE.\nThe TSCTSF updates the previously provided 5GS access stratum time distribution parameters as described in steps 7-9.\nIf the TSCTSF receives clock quality acceptance criteria as part of the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create request in step 2, in case the TSCTSF determines a change in the support of the clock quality acceptance criteria for the UE as described in clause 5.5.11.5, the TSCTSF may update the previously provided 5GS access stratum time distribution parameters as described in steps 7-9.\n13.\tIf the TSCTSF determines to update the enable/disable the 5G access stratum time distribution for the UE in step 12, and the TSCTSF received the time synchronization coverage area as part of the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create/Update request in step 2, the TSCTSF notifies the update of the service status to AF/NEF by sending an HTTP POST to the received callback URI as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nIf the TSCTSF determines a change in the fulfillment of the clock quality acceptance criteria for the UE for which the AF has requested the access stratum time distribution as described in clause 5.5.11.5, the TSCTSF includes the clock quality acceptance criteria result (acceptable/not acceptable) to the notification to the AF. Based on this notification, the AF decides whether to modify the ASTI service configured for the UE using Ntsctsf_ASTI_Update service.\n14.\tThe NEF/AF replies with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n15.\tThe NEF forwards the received notification to the AF by sending an HTTP POST to the received callback URI as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].\n16.\tThe NEF/AF replies with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\nThe figure depicts a network timing synchronization status monitoring system, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of network operations. The system includes various components such as network clocks, synchronization servers, and monitoring tools, all of which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the network. The system's design ensures that the clocks are synchronized at regular intervals, which is critical for ensuring that network operations are accurate and reliable. The system also includes a user interface for monitoring the status of the system, allowing network operators to quickly identify any issues and take corrective action. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the network timing synchronization status monitoring system, highlighting its importance and the various components involved.\nFigure 5.5.11.5-1: Management of network timing synchronization status monitoring\n0.\tAn AF requests creation or modification of a (g)PTP-based or an ASTI-based time synchronization service as described in clauses 5.5.11.3 and 5.5.11.4; and to subscribe to time synchronization status report(s), the AF provides clock quality detail level and, if applicable, clock quality acceptance criteria in the request.\nIf network timing synchronization status reports are provisioned using node-level signalling via control plane, the TSCTSF determines the serving AMF(s) and the UPF/NW-TT nodes (in cases where UPF/NW-TT is involved in providing time information to DS-TT) for the UE(s) that needs to initiate network timing synchronization status monitoring.\n1.\tFor 5G access stratum time distribution or PTP instance activation, modification, if the UE/DS-TT obtains time information from NG-RAN and if network timing synchronization status reports are provisioned using node-level signalling via control plane:\n-\tThe TSCTSF subscribes with the determined AMF(s) to NG-RAN timing synchronization status updates at the NG-RAN nodes that may provision 5G access stratum time distribution information to the target UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe provisioning of the NG-RAN timing synchronization status attributes can be configured via OAM or via TSCTSF and AMF with node-level signalling. The RAN node is pre-configured with the thresholds for each timing synchronization status attribute as described in clause 5.27.1.12 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. When the network timing synchronization status exceeds or meets again any of the pre-configured thresholds, the NG-RAN node detects a change of its timing synchronization status (e.g., degradation, failure, improvement) and reports it.\n2.\tFor PTP instance activation, modification, if the UPF/NW-TT is involved in providing time information to DS-TT and if network timing synchronization status reports are provisioned using node-level signalling via control plane:\nThe TSCTSF subscribes to timing synchronization status updates with the UPF/NW-TT that may provision time information via PTP to the target UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status updates provisioning can be configured via OAM or via UMIC.\n3.\tWhen timing synchronization status reporting in NG-RAN is configured by the TSCTSF via the AMF in step 1, if the NG-RAN node detects a change on its timing synchronization, the TSCTSF receives an NG-RAN timing synchronization status update via the AMF. The update contains a scope of the timing synchronization status (as described in clause 5.27.1.12 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]) and some or all of the information elements listed in Table 5.27.1.12-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\n4.\tWhen timing synchronization status reporting in the UPF/NW-TT is configured by the TSCTSF via UMIC in step 2, if the UPF/NW-TT detects a change on its timing synchronization status, the TSCTSF receives a UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status update from the UPF/NW-TT via UMIC. The update contains some or all of the information elements listed in Table 5.28.3.1-2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\n5.\tUpon the reception of an update on the NG-RAN and/or NW-TT timing synchronization status, the TSCTSF determines the impacted UE(s) and, if applicable, whether the clock quality acceptance criteria can still be met.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the status update indicates degradation in the NG-RAN, the TSCTSF subscribes to notifications about UE presence in an Area of Interest for the gNB node ID(s) or Cell IDs that reported the timing synchronization status degradation/improvement in order to determine the affected UE(s).\nNOTE 4:\tNG-RAN and/or UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status update can be configured via OAM instead of node-level signalling via control plane.\nFor each affected UE, if the TSCTSF determines that the clock quality acceptance criteria can still be met, then TSCTSF may update, for (g)PTP, the clockQuality information sent in Announce messages for the PTP instance using PMIC/UMIC reporting, and for ASTI service, the TSCTSF notifies the service status to AF, as described in step 6, which based on this notification decides whether to modify the ASTI service configured for the UE.\nNOTE 5:\tThe handling of Announce messages follows existing procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\n6.\tIf the clock quality acceptance criteria cannot be met or can be met again, then TSCTSF informs the AF about the acceptance criteria result (e.g., acceptable/not acceptable), for PTP based or ASTI time synchronization service as described in clauses 5.5.11.3 and 5.5.11.4.\n",

To enable deterministic networking in 5GS, the DetNet controller collects interface information from the 5GS DetNet node using the 5GS DetNet node information reporting procedure as described in clause 5.5.12.2 and configures the reported interfaces as described in clause 5.5.12.3.\nThe TSCTSF may provide exposure information to the DetNet controller using information collected from the UPF/NW-TT via parameters in PMIC, and for the device side ports, using parameters provided from the SMF to the TSCTSF via PCF, as described in figure 5.5.12.2-1.\n\nThe figure depicts a detailed representation of the DetNet node information reporting system in a 5G network. It shows the various components and their connections, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of SDN principles for network management.\nFigure 5.5.12.2-1: 5GS DetNet node information reporting\n1.\tDuring SM Policy Association establishment, if the feature \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported, the PCF based on local configuration for the DNN and S-NSSAI determines that the SM Policy Association enables Deterministic Networking and provides to the SMF the \"TSN_BRIDGE_INFO\" policy control request trigger as described in figure 5.2.1-1, step 11.\nWhen the trigger is met, the PCF receives the TSC User Plane information from the SMF (for DetNet it represents 5GS Router information) and the device side information: port number, User Plane node ID and, if available and the feature \"MTU_Size\" is supported, MTU size for IPv4 and MTU size for IPv6 as described in figure 5.2.2.3-1, step 2. The PCF may also receive NW-TT PMIC (with network side interface configuration information). The PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation to notify to the TSCTSF the received TSC User Plane information and the device side information, and if available, NW-TT PMIC(s)/UMIC, as described in figure 5.2.2.3-1, step 5 and includes the UE IP address to identify the PDU session.\nDuring SM Policy Association establishment (clause 5.2.1), and when Framed Routes applies, the PCF receives Framed Route information from the SMF during SM Policy Association creation. During SM Policy Association update (figure 5.2.2.3), and when prefix delegation applies, the SMF reports to the PCF the prefix delegated to the UE by IPv6 prefix delegation.\n2.\tThe TSCTSF then invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request message to the PCF as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.1 to create an AF-session. The TSCTSF shall subscribe with the PCF to the \"TSN_BRIDGE_INFO\" event, to get notifications about NW-TT PMIC(s)/UMIC updates as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\nIf the \"ExtraUEaddrReport\" feature is supported, the TSCTSF shall subscribe to the \"EXTRA_UE_ADDR\" event to receive information about the one or more Framed Routes available for the PDU session or about the IPv6 prefixes delegated to the UE by IPv6 Prefix Delegation.\nUsing the User Plane node Id received in step 1, the TSCTSF may subscribe with the NW-TT to receive UMIC information for the indicated User Plane node Id, if not previously received, by provisioning the concerned UMIC container.\n3.\tIf the information is available in the PCF, the PCF returns the event related information in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create response (e.g. framed route information, if the TSCTSF subscribed to notifications on reporting of extra addresses, and frame routes are available).\nThe TSCTSF stores the DNN, S-NSSAI and IP address(es) as received from PCF and associates them with the AF-session, as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nIf the TSCTSF determines the interface configuration information for the created AF-session is complete, the TSCTSF may report to the DetNet controller the collected interface(s) information as described in step 10.\n4.\tThe PCF subscribes to UMIC changes with the SMF:\n4.1\tThe PCF provides to the SMF the UMIC information received from the TSCTSF as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.2, and the SMF sends the received UMIC to the NW-TT/UPF.\n4.2\tWhen the SMF receives the UMIC reported from the UPF/NW-TT, the SMF provides the received UMIC information to the PCF as described in clause 5.2.2.3.\n5.\tThe TSCTSF receives from the PCF the notification of the BRIDGE_INFO event, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10], containing the UMIC information with the NW-TT ports of the indicated User Plane node Id. The PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.\n6.\tThe TSCTSF responds to the PCF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n7.\tThe TSCTSF shall request PMIC information from the NW-TT using the User Plane node Id received in step 1 and the port number(s) received in step 5, to read network interface configuration for the indicated ports, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\n8.\tThe PCF responds with a \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" status code in response to the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization request.\n9.\tThe PCF subscribes to PMIC changes from the SMF:\n9.1.\tThe PCF provides to the SMF the PMIC information received from the TSCTSF as described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.2, which sends the received PMIC to the NW-TT/UPF.\n9.2\tWhen the SMF detects PMIC changes for the NW-TT, the SMF provides the received PMIC information to the PCF as described in clause 5.2.2.3.\n10.\tThe TSCTSF receives the PMIC information from the NW-TT ports via the PCF with the notification of the BRIDGE_INFO event, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10]. The PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.\n11.\tThe TSCTSF responds to the PCF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n12.\tAfter the TSCTSF determines that the interface information for the AF session is complete, the TSCTSF may provide the collected network and device side interface configuration to the DetNet controller as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen both, the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support the 3GPP Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60], the TSCTSF may use the user-plane node ID received in step 1 to generate an identifier of the 5GS DetNet node and provide it to the DetNet controller.\nNOTE:\tThe 5GS node identification can be realized by providing an identifier of the 5GS DetNet node to the DetNet controller using the exposure of 5GS DetNet node identification specified in the 3GPP Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60], or the TSCTSF can provide different termination points (addresses) for the signalling between the DetNet controller and the TSCTSF, each one representing different 5GS nodes.\nThe DetNet controller triggers the 5GS DetNet node configuration procedure to provide Deterministic Networking specific parameters to 5GS as described in figure 5.5.12.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a detailed configuration of a DetNet node, which is a crucial component in the network. It shows the various components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and automation.\nFigure 5.5.12.3-1: DetNet Node configuration\n1.\tThe DetNet controller provides YANG data model configuration to the TSCTSF. The TSCTSF uses the identifier of the incoming and outgoing interfaces, as provided in step 10 of figure 5.5.12.2-1, to determine the affected PDU Session(s) and flow direction, whether it is uplink or downlink. The TSCTSF also determines if the flow is UE to UE in which case two PDU sessions will be affected for the flow and the TSCTSF breaks up the requirements to individual requirements for the PDU Sessions.\n2.\tThe TSCTSF determines the 5GS requirements for the DetNet flow.\nWhen both, the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support the 3GPP Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60], the TSCTSF maps the received 5GS maximum latency and/or 5GS maximum loss to QoS parameters to PCF as specified in clause 5.5.12.4. When the TSCTSF and/or the DetNet controller do not support the 3GPP Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node or the DetNet YANG configuration includes the E2E traffic requirements, the TSCTSF derives 5GS requirements based on pre-configured mapping as described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60]. The TSCTSF also constructs a TSCAC for each flow description.\nThe TSCTSF provides the mapped parameters and the flow description to the PCF(s) on a per AF Session basis for the given UE address.\n3.\tThe TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10], to provide the required QoS for each flow description. The TSCTSF subscribes to the report of successfull/unsuccessful resource allocation outcome as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\n4.\tThe PCF authorizes the request from TSCTSF and responds with a \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" status code to the received PATCH request. If the PCF determines that the requirements can't be authorized, it rejects the request with the appropriate status code and error cause. In case the request is rejected, the TSCTSF informs the DetNet controller about the unsuccessful outcome as described in step 9.\n5.\tOnce the PCF authorizes the request, the PCF updates the SMF with corresponding new PCC rule(s) and policy control request triggers as specified in the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure described in clause 5.2.2.2.2.2. The QoS flow is established according to the 5GS QoS requirements for the DetNet flow.\n6.\tThe SMF reports to the PCF the outcome about the successful/unsuccessful establishment of the QoS flow as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.\n7.\tThe PCF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify request service operation to provide to the TSCTSF the outcome of the QoS provisioning parameters by sending an HTTP POST request to the callback URI as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.\n8. The TSCTSF responds to the PCF with a \"204 No Content\" status code.\n9.\tThe TSCTSF responds to the DetNet controller.\nWhen both, the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node as specified in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60], the TSCTSF may provide 5GS specific status code information on the result of the configuration to the DetNet controller. If the status of the flow changes later for any reason (e.g., service data flow deactivation) or the PDU session is released, the TSCTSF notifies the DetNet controller on the status of the flow with 5GS specific information.\nThe TSCTSF may receive from a DetNet Controller DetNet YANG configuration describing the traffic characteristics and QoS requirements for a DetNet flow(s) as described in IETF draft-ietf-detnet-yang [64] and, if supported, in the 3GPP extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node described in 3GPP TS 29.565 [60].\nThe TSCTSF maps the DetNet configuration as follows before interacting with the PCF:\nTable 5.5.12.4-1: QoS parameter mapping functions at the TSCTSF\n\nThe DetNet flow specification for the application flow(s) is based on the IP source and destination addresses, IPv4 protocol or IPv6 next header, IPv4 type of service or IPv6 traffic class, IPv6 flow label, TCP or UDP source or destination ports, and IPsec SPI header fields as defined in section 5.1 of IETF RFC 8939 [32]. The DetNet flow specification is mapped into the corresponding UL and/or DL fields of the 5GS Flow Description, within the media subcomponent, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].\nBased on the mapping of the received traffic profile and/or 3GPP extended parameters, the  TSCTSF provides the derived TSC Assistance Container and the related QoS information to the PCF as specified in table 5.5.12.4-1.\n",

The UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the stored service parameter data.\nAdditionally, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Query service operation to the UDR by sending the HTTP GET request to the \"5GVnGroupsInternal\" resource to retrieve the group configuration of the received 5G VN Group Id as specified in 3GPP TS 29.505 [47], if not internally available.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PCF can internally store the retrieved 5G VN group configuration data for later use for other SUPIs that belong to the same Internal-Group-Id.\n4-5.\tThe PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the policy data subscription information (e.g, UE Policy Set resource), and in this case, the PCF shall invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"PolicyDataSubscriptions\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\nAdditionally, if the \"EnhancedBackgroundDataTransfer\" feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.504 [27] is supported, to request notifications from the UDR on changes in the applied BDT Policy Data, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"ApplicationDataSubscriptions\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\nAdditionally, if the PCF requests notifications from the UDR on changes in the service parameter data, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"ApplicationDataSubscriptions\" resource. The UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to acknowledge the subscription.\nAdditionally, to request notifications from the UDR on changes in the 5G VN group configuration data associated to each of the Internal-Group-Id provided to the PCF, the PCF invokes the Nudr_DataRepository_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"SubscriptionDataSubscriptions\" resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.505 [47], if not internally available.

This is performed by using the Nbsf_Management_Register operation, providing as inputs the SUPI, the GPSI, if available, and the PCF end points related to the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization service.\n10.\tTo subscribe to notifications of N1 message for UE Policy Delivery Result, or subsequent UE policy requests (e.g. for V2XP and/or A2XP and/or ProSeP and/or RSLPP), the PCF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation to the AMF by sending the HTTP POST method with the URI of the \"N1N2 Subscriptions Collection for Individual UE Contexts\" resource.\n11.\tThe AMF sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response to the PCF.\n12.\tIf the PCF determines to provision or update the UE policy in step 6, the PCF sends the UE policy to the UE via the AMF by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\nIf the \"V2X\" feature is supported and the PCF determines to provision V2XP and V2X N2 PC5 policy in step 6, the PCF sends the V2XP to the UE and the V2X N2 PC5 policy to the NG-RAN via the AMF by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\nIf the \"ProSe\" feature is supported and the PCF determines to provision ProSeP and 5G ProSe N2 PC5 policy in step 6, the PCF sends the ProSeP to the UE and the5G ProSe N2 PC5 policy to the NG-RAN via the AMF by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\nIf the \"A2X\" feature is supported and the PCF determines to provision A2XP and A2X N2 PC5 policy in step 6, the PCF sends the A2XP to the UE and the A2X N2 PC5 policy to the NG-RAN via the AMF by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\nIf the \"Ranging_SL\" feature is supported and the PCF determines to provision RSLPP and Ranging/SL N2 policy in step 6, the PCF sends the RSLPP to the UE and the Ranging/SL N2 policy to the NG-RAN via the AMF by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\nThe PCF can provision the UE policy (including V2XP and/or A2XP and/or ProSeP and/or RSLPP) and V2X N2 PC5 policy and/or A2X N2 PC5 policy and/or 5G ProSe N2 PC5 Policy and/or Ranging/SL N2 Policy in the same message.\n13.\tThe AMF sends a response to the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\n14.\tWhen receiving the UE Policy container, the AMF forwards the response of the UE to the PCF using Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation.\n15.\tThe PCF sends a response to the Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation.\nNOTE 3:\tSteps 7 and 10-15 are triggered by the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create request and can be received by the AMF in any order; e.g., all or some of the steps 10-15 can be received by the AMF prior to step 7. Note that, to ensure the UE Policy delivery response within the N1MessageNotify is received, the PCF should wait for the reception of a successful N1N2MessageSubscribe response (step 11) before sending the N1N2MessageTransfer request (step 12).\n16-17.\tThe PCF maintains the latest list of UE policy sections delivered to the UE (in step 12) and updates the UE policy information for the subscriber including the latest list of UPSIs and its content in the UDR by invoking the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation.\n-\tIf there is no UE policy information retrieved in step 3, the PCF sends an HTTP PUT request to the \"UEPolicySet\" resource, and the UDR sends an HTTP \"201 Created\" response.\n-\tOtherwise, the PCF sends an HTTP PUT/PATCH request to the \"UEPolicySet\" resource, and the UDR sends an HTTP \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" response accordingly.\nIf the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported for the Npcf_UEPolicyControl service and the UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports URSP provisioning in EPS, the PCF shall update the UDR with the received UE support of URSP provisioning in EPS.\nThe figure depicts the UE Policy Association Establishment procedure for roaming in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps taken by the UE to establish a roaming policy with the network, including the establishment of roaming profiles, network access, and roaming termination.

The AMF invokes the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"UE Policy Associations\" resource as defined in clause 4.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.525 [31].\n-\tFor URSP provisioning in EPS, if the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported and a UE Policy Container is received from the UE via SMF+PGW-C, the V-PCF for a PDU session invokes the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"UE Policy Associations\" resource as defined in clause 4.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.525 [31].\n2.\tThe V-PCF invokes the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the \"UE Policy Associations\" resource to forward the information received from AMF to the H-PCF. The request includes the parameters received in step 1. The V-PCF also provides the H-PCF the Notification URI where to send a notification when the policy is updated.\n3-6.\tThese steps are the same as steps 2-5 in clause 5.6.1.2, except the description of \"EnhancedBackgroundDataTransfer\" feature is not applicable.\n7.

                    "text_content": "The Session binding is the association of the AF session information to one and only one PDU session.\nWhen the PCF receives the service information from the AF, the PCF shall perform the session binding and shall associate the described IP and Ethernet data flows within the AF session information (and therefore the applicable PCC rules) to one existing PDU session. This association is done comparing the following parameters received from the AF with the corresponding PDU session parameters. In order to have a successful session binding, all parameters shall match, if provided.\na)\tFor an IP type PDU session, the UE IPv4 address or IPv6 address. If IPv6 address is received from the AF, the association is done by comparing the /128 IPv6 address with the IPv6 prefix of the PDU session using the longest prefix match.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE IP address management is specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.8, and the differences and additions in wireline and wireless convergence scenarios specified in 3GPP TS 23.512 [9], clause C.2.1.6. For IPv6 prefix delegation, the IPv6 network prefix of the PDU session is shorter than /64.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE IPv4 address or IPv6 address received by the PCF from the AF can contain an IP address that belongs to the framed routes that apply to a PDU session. In this case, the association with the PDU session needs to be based on comparing the received UE address is within the one or more framed routes of the PDU session.\nFor an Ethernet type PDU session, the UE MAC address.\nIf the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or the \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature feature is supported, association is done by comparing the value of MAC address in the AF request with the MAC address of the DS-TT port as reported by the SMF within the TSC User Plane Node information.\nb)\tThe UE identity (of the same kind e.g. SUPI), if available.\nNOTE 3:\tIn case the UE identity in the access network and the application level identity for the user are of different kinds, the PCF needs to maintain, or have access to, the mapping between the identities. Such mapping is outside the scope of the present document.\nFor 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay connectivity, the UE identity that the SMF has provided (i.e. 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Identity) and the UE identity provided by the AF (i.e. 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE Identity) may be different. In these scenarios, the PCF shall ignore the UE identity provided the AF, and applies the rest of received parameters, if available, to perform session binding.\nc)\tThe information about the data network (DNN) the user is accessing, if available.\nNOTE 4:\tFor 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay connectivity, to enable the PCF to distinguish the Relay scenario from other scenarios and hence ignore the received UE identify provided by the AF, a dedicated DNN for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay connectivity needs to be configured in the PCF.\nd)\tThe IPv4 address domain identity if available in the \"ipDomain\" attribute.\nNOTE 5:\tThe \"ipDomain\" attribute is helpful when within a network slice instance, there are several separate IP address domains, with SMF/UPF(s) that allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same private address range to UE PDU Sessions. The same IP address can thus be allocated to UE PDU sessions served by SMF/UPF(s) in different address domains. If one PCF controls several SMF/UPF(s) in different IP address domains, the UE IP address is thus not sufficient for the session binding. An AF can serve UEs in different IP address domains, either by having direct IP interfaces to those domains, or by having interconnections via NATs in the user plane between the UPF and the AF. If a NAT is used, the AF obtains the IP address allocated to the UE PDU session via application level signalling and supplies it for the session binding to the PCF in the \"ueIpv4\" attribute. The AF supplies an \"ipDomain\" attribute denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in addition. The AF can derive the appropriate value from the source address (allocated by the NAT) of incoming user plane packets. The value provided in the \"ipDomain\" attribute is operator configurable.\ne)\tThe S-NSSAI if available.\nNOTE 6:\tThe S-NSSAI is helpful in the scenario where multiple network slice instances are deployed in the same DNN, and the same IPv4 address may be allocated to UE PDU sessions in different network slice instances. If one PCF controls several network slices, each network slice in different IP address domains, the UE IP address is not sufficient for the session binding. The AF supplies the S-NSSAI denoting the network slice instance that allocated the IPv4 address of the UE PDU session. How the AF derives S-NSSAI is out of the scope of this specification.\nSession Binding applies for PDU sessions of IP type. It may also apply to Ethernet PDU session type but only when especially allowed by PCC related policy control request trigger. In the case of Ethernet PDU session, session binding does not apply to AF requests sent over Rx.\nNOTE 7:\tFor the Ethernet PDU session, the PCF needs to provision \"UE_MAC_CH\" trigger to the SMF.\nNOTE 8:\tRefer to 3GPP TS 29.213 [30] for the session binding between the IP type PDU session and the AF request sent over Rx.\nThe PCF shall identify the PCC rules affected by the AF session information, including new PCC rules to be installed and existing PCC rules to be modified or removed.\nIf the PCF is not capable of executing the Session binding, the PCF shall reject the AF request.\n",

                    "text_content": "Several QoS parameters mapping functions are needed during PCC interaction.\nThe main purpose of these mapping functions is the conversion of QoS parameters from one format to another. QoS information may be:\n-\tparts of a session description language (SDI), e.g. SDP, MPD;\n-\tQoS parameters; and\n-\taccess specific QoS parameters.\nFor PCC deployments not supporting MBS, QoS parameters mapping functions are located at the AF, PCF, SMF and UE and are described in this clause and the rest of clauses under clause 7.\nWhen PCC is deployed in an MBS architecture as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [54], QoS parameter mapping functions are defined as described in clause 7.5.\nOne QoS mapping function is located at the AF, which maps the application specific information into the appropriate information that are carried over the Rx as specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 [18] or N5 interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [10].\nFor IMS, the AF may pass service information to the PCF over the Rx interface or over the N5 interface if the PCF and the P-CSCF support the \"IMS_SBI\" feature. The AF derives information about the service from the SDI or from other sources. The mapping is application specific. If SDP (IETF RFC 4566 [16]) is used as SDI, the AF should apply the mapping described in clause 7.2. If MPD (3GPP TS 26.247 [17]) is used, the AF may apply the mapping described in Annex I in 3GPP TS 26.247 [17]. Clause 7.2 specifies the QoS parameter mapping functions at the AF. For IMS, the mapping rules in clause 7.2 shall be used at the P-CSCF.\nOne QoS mapping function is located at the PCF, which maps the service information received over the Rx or N5 interface, or if the \"GMEC\" feature is supported, obtained from UDR into QoS parameters (e.g. 5QI, GBR, MBR, and ARP). This mapping is access independent. Clause 7.3 specifies the QoS mapping functions at the PCF applicable for all accesses.\nThe mapping functions located at SMF is specified in clause 7.4. The mapping function in UE is implementation dependent and not specified within this specification.\nThe PCF notes and authorizes the service data flows described within this service information by mapping from service information to Authorized QoS parameters for transfer to the SMF via the N7 interface. The SMF will map from the Authorized QoS parameters to the access specific QoS parameters.\nFor 3GPP 5GS, the network sets up QoS flow(s) with a suitable QoS and indicates to the UE the QoS characteristics of those QoS flow(s). Therefore the flow of QoS related information will be unidirectional as indicated in the figure 7.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with a focus on the fiber-optic backbone, highlighting its key components such as core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, allowing for redundancy and failover reliability.\nNOTE:\tAccess Specific QoS parameters with Authorized Access-Specific QoS parameters comparison.\nFigure 7.1-1: QoS mapping framework\n1.\tThe AF shall perform mapping from an SDI received within the AF session signalling to service information passed to the PCF over the Rx or N5 interface (see clause 7.2 if SDP is used as SDI).\n2.\tThe PCF shall perform mapping from the service information received over the Rx or N5 interface to the Authorized QoS parameters that shall be passed to the SMF via the N7 interface. The mapping is performed for each service data flow. The PCF combines per direction the individual Authorized QoS parameters per flow (see clause 7.3).\n3.\tThe SMF shall perform mapping from the Authorized QoS parameters received from PCF to the access specific QoS parameters.\n",

The AMF uses the PCF services for a UE.\nWhen the AMF performs discovery and selection for a UE, the AMF may utilize the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service of the NRF to discover the candidate PCF instance(s). In addition, PCF information may also be locally configured in the AMF. The AMF selects a PCF instance, or two when roaming, based on the available PCF instances (obtained from the NRF or locally configured in the AMF) and depending on operator's policies.\nIn the non-roaming case, the AMF selects a PCF instance for AM policy association and selects the same PCF instance for UE policy association.

If multiple DNN and S-NSSAI combinations are provided, the AMF selects the DNN, S-NSSAI using local configuration. In case PCF instance Id(s) are not received, e.g. EPS interworking is not supported, the AMF selects the PCF instance by considering other above factors.\nIn the case of delegated discovery and selection in the SCP, the AMF shall include in the first request to the PCF the above factors, if available, within the \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 [5], clause 6.10.3.2.\nIn the following scenarios, information about the PCF instance that has been selected by the AMF (e.g. the selected PCF instance Id, the PCF set ID, and if the PCF set ID is not available, the PCF Group ID, if available) can be forwarded to another NF consumer of the PCF:\n-\tDuring AMF relocation, the target AMF may receive from the source AMF a resource URI of AM Policy association and/or a resource URI of UE Policy association, a PCF instance ID, a PCF set ID, and if the PCF set ID is not available, a PCF Group ID (if available) to enable the target AMF to reuse the same PCF instance (i.e. reuse the AM Policy association resource and/or UE Policy association resource), and the target AMF may decide based on operator policy either to re-use the AM/UE Policy Association in the same PCF instance or select a new PCF instance.\n-\tIn the roaming case, the AMF may, based on operator policies (e.g. roaming agreement), select the H-PCF in addition to the V-PCF for a UE by performing a PCF discovery and selection as described above. The AMF sends the selected H-PCF instance Id to the V-PCF during the UE Policy association establishment procedure.\nIn these scenarios, if the target AMF performs discovery and selection, the target AMF may use the received PCF information instead of performing PCF selection interacting with the NRF as described above (discovery may still be needed depending on what level of information is sent by the AMF, e.g. the address of the PCF instance may not be present)\nIn addition, in the case of delegated discovery and selection in the SCP, the following applies:\na)\tThe selected PCF instance may include the PCF instance ID, the PCF set ID, and if the PCF set ID is not available, the PCF Group ID (if available) in the response to the AMF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe selected (V-)PCF instance can include a binding indication, including the (V-)PCF ID and possibly the PCF Set ID in the response to the AMF.\nb)\tThe AMF first establishes an AM policy association; when forwarding the related request message, the SCP discovers and selects a (V-)PCF instance for AM policy association.

The AMF uses the received (V-)PCF instance Id for the AM policy association and/or the available binding information within the \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers for the request to establish the UE policy association. The SCP selects the corresponding (V-)PCF instance for UE policy association based on the received discovery and selection parameters.\nc)\tDuring AMF relocation, the target AMF may receive a resource URI of AM Policy association and/or a resource URI of UE Policy association, a PCF instance ID, a PCF set ID, and if the PCF set ID is not available, a PCF Group ID (if available) from the source AMF to enable it to reuse the same PCF instance. The AMF may decide based on operator policy either to use the old PCF instance or select another PCF instance (i.e. reuse the AM Policy association resource and/or UE Policy association resource). If the target AMF decides to reuse the old PCF instance, the AMF includes the {apiRoot} of the resource URI within the \"3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot\" request header, the PCF instance ID, the PCF set ID, and if the PCF set ID is not available, the PCF Group ID (if available) within the \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header as received from the source AMF in the AM policy update request and/or the UE policy update request to the PCF via the SCP.\nd)\tIn the roaming case, the AMF performs discovery and selection of the H-PCF from NRF as described in this clause. The AMF may indicate the maximum number of H-PCF instances to be returned from NRF, i.e. H-PCF selection at NRF. The AMF uses the received V-PCF instance Id for AM Policy association and/or the available binding information received during the AM policy association procedure as described in bullet b) above to send the UE policy association establishment request, which also includes the selected H-PCF instance Id, to the V-PCF via the SCP. The SCP discovers and selects the V-PCF instance.

The BSF applies the procedures to identify if there is a PCF handling the binding information and accepts or rejects the request accordingly(see clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22]).\nc)\tFor the retrieval of binding information, any NF, such as NEF or AF, uses the Nbsf_Management service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.521 [22] to discover or subscribe to the notification of the selected PCF address(es), and if available, the associated PCF instance ID, PCF set ID and the level of SBA binding for:\ni.\tthe tuple (UE address, DNN, SUPI, GPSI, S-NSSAI, IPv4 address domain) (or for a subset of this tuple), when the target is the PCF for the PDU session; or\nii.\tthe tuple (SUPI, GPSI) (or for a subset of this tuple), when the target is the PCF for the UE.\nd)\tIf the NF received a PCF set ID or a PCF instance ID with a level of SBA binding as result of the Nbsf management service discovery service operation or in the request of the Nbsf management service notification service operation or in the response of the Nbsf management subscribe service operation, it should use that information as NF set level or NF instance level SBA Binding Indication to route requests to the PCF.\ne)\tFor an ongoing NF service session, the PCF may provide SBA Binding Indication to the NF (see clause 6.3.1.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]). This SBA Binding Indication shall then be used instead of any PCF information received from the BSF.\nf)\tThe BSF is able to proxy or redirect Rx requests based on the IP address of a UE. For any AF using Rx, such as P-CSCF, the BSF determines the selected PCF address according to the information carried by the incoming Rx requests.\nIt shall support the functionality of a proxy agent and a redirect agent as defined in IETF RFC 6733 [29]. The mode in which it operates (i.e. proxy or redirect) shall be based on operator's requirements.\ng)\tThe BSF may be deployed standalone or may be collocated with other network functions such as the PCF, UDR, NRF, and SMF.\nNOTE 3:\tCollocation allows combined implementation.\nh)\tThe NF may discover the BSF via NRF by invoking the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service operation or based on local configuration. In case of via NRF the BSF registers the NF profile in NRF. The IP domain list, the Range(s) of UE IPv4 addresses, Range(s) of UE IPv6 prefixes, Range(s) of SUPIs, the Range(s) of GPSIs or the BSF Group Id supported by the BSF may be provided to NRF, as described in clause 6.1.6.2.21 of TS 29.510 [51].\ni)\tThe BSF verifies whether to provide the address of a PCF for a PDU Session or a PCF for a UE based on the explicit NF service request to the resource collection representing the binding information for the PCF for a PDU Session or the PCF for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].\n",

The PCF utilizes the Nbsf_Management service of the BSF to register, update or remove the stored PCF for an MBS session binding information at the BSF. The PCF ensures that the PCF for an MBS session binding information is updated each time the PCF instance is changed.\nAt the reception of a PCF for an MBS session binding registration request, the BSF checks whether there is already a PCF handling the MBS Session identified by the provided MBS Session ID. If no such PCF is found, the BSF stores the information received in the request, i.e. registers the PCF sending the request as the PCF handling the MBS session; otherwise, the BSF rejects the registration request and includes the information of the existing PCF instance currently handling the MBS session in the response (see clause 4.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [22]).\nc)\tFor the retrieval of binding information, any NF, such as NEF, MBSF or AF, uses the Nbsf_Management service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.521 [22] to discover the PCF instance currently handling the MBS session and the related information (i.e. PCF address(es), and if available, the associated PCF instance ID, PCF set ID and the level of SBA binding for the MBS Session ID).\nd)\tIf the NF received a PCF set ID or a PCF instance ID with a level of SBA binding as result of the Nbsf management service registration or discovery service operations, it should use that information as NF set level or NF instance level SBA Binding Indication to route requests to the PCF.\ne)\tFor an ongoing NF service session, the PCF may provide SBA Binding Indication to the NF (see clause 6.3.1.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]).

                    "text_content": "This clause describes the optional procedures for handling race conditions in a deterministic manner. These procedures apply to the SMF (Npcf_SMPolicyControl service), AMF (Npcf_AMFPolicyControl service and Npcf_UEPolicyControl service), and PCF (Npcf_SMPolicyControl service, Npcf_AMFPolicyControl service and Npcf_UEPolicyControl service).\nIn this clause, the terms NF consumer and NF producer are relative to the service. As an example, for the Npcf_SMPolicyControl service, the NF consumer is the SMF and the NF producer is the PCF. The term NF can refer to either a NF consumer or a NF producer. The term \"transaction\" refers to a HTTP request and its associated response. The term \"ongoing transaction\" refers to a transaction that has an outstanding response.\nA node that supports the procedures defined in this clause and is configured to comply with them, shall advertise such support by including the corresponding \"PendingTransaction\" feature within the attribute of SupportedFeatures data type during the policy association establishment.\nOn receipt of a HTTP request for an existing policy association, the recipient NF shall check if it has an ongoing transaction on that policy association:\n1.\tIf there are no ongoing transactions on the policy association, the NF shall process the incoming request normally.\n2.\tIf there is an ongoing transaction on the policy association and optionally, if the recipient NF cannot determine that the incoming request can be safely handled without creating a state mismatch:\na.\tThe NF consumer shall reject the incoming request and include in an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response message the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails data structure set to \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\".\nb.\tThe NF producer shall either reject the incoming request and include in an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response message the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails data structure set to \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\" or shall wait for one of the following conditions to occur:\ni.\tThe ongoing transaction completes. In this case, the policy association is updated at the NF producer on the completion of the ongoing transaction and afterwards, the incoming request (e.g. HTTP POST) is processed normally based on the updated policy association state.\nii.\tThe waiting period has exceeded its allotted time. In this case, the NF producer shall reject the incoming request and include in an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response message the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails data structure set to \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\".\n3.\tOn receipt of a \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\" error code, an NF consumer shall retry the request. On the other hand, if an NF producer had rejected a request from an NF consumer with a \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\" error code, the NF producer should not retry the failed request until it responds to the re-attempted request from the NF consumer. This is to avoid having both the NF consumer and NF producer concurrently retry their requests. In all other cases, if the policy association on the NF consumer still needs to be updated, the NF producer shall retry the request.\n4.\tThe NF consumer or NF producer should limit the number of times they re-attempt the same request due to receipt of a \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\" error code.\n5.\tThe only exception to the rules above is a policy association termination request initiated by the NF consumer (e.g. HTTP POST with request URI to \"{apiRoot}/npcf-smpolicycontrol/<apiVersion>/sm-policies/{smPolicyId}/delete\") or a request for policy association termination initiated by the NF producer (e.g. HTTP POST with request URI to \"/{notificationUri}/terminate\"). In both cases, the request should be handled as follows:\na.\tWhen receiving a request for a policy association termination initiated by the NF producer that requires new transactions to be initiated or existing transactions to be finished, a NF consumer shall acknowledge the request immediately (e.g. a HTTP POST message with request URI to \"./{NotificationUri}/terminate\" shall be acknowledged with a 204 No Content response). The NF consumer shall wait for the current transaction to complete (either by the NF producer acknowledging the request or rejecting it with the \"PENDING_TRANSACTION\" application error code) before completing the policy association termination procedure (e.g. before sending the HTTP POST with request URI to \"{apiRoot}/npcf-smpolicycontrol/<apiVersion>/sm-policies/{smPolicyId}/delete\").\nNOTE:\tThe client needs to wait for the outcome of the policy association modification to determine if the policy association termination procedure will be used to report information that could not be reported as part of the policy association modification procedure.\nb.\tWhen receiving a request for a policy association termination initiated by the NF consumer, the NF producer shall handle it immediately.\nDuring the network migration, DRA and BSF may coexist in operator's network. When the AF sends Rx request to the DRA, the DRA can utilize the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation to obtain the relevant PCF address as depicted in figure A-1. The DRA only applies this operation if it has no stored binding information derived from an ongoing Gx session for that subscriber.\nNOTE 1:\tFor a UE in the EPC there is a Gx session and the DRA stores the binding information. For a UE in the 5GC the Npcf_SmPolicyControl service is used and the BSF stores the binding information.\nThe figure depicts the PCF (Physical Channel Function) discovery process by DRA (Digital Radio Access Network) through the use of a BSF (Base Station Filter). The figure illustrates the process of identifying the physical channel function of a radio signal, which is crucial for efficient radio resource management in a wireless network.\nFigure A-1: PCF discovery by DRA via BSF\n1.\tThe AF sends a Diameter AAR to the DRA to establish a new Rx diameter session.\n2.\tWhen receiving the request in step 1, if the DRA has no stored binding information derived from an ongoing Gx session for the subscriber, the DRA invokes the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation to the BSF to obtain the selected PCF ID for a certain PDU session.\n3.\tThe BSF replies to the DRA with the PCF ID.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the DRA has no stored binding information derived from an ongoing Gx session for a subscriber, the DRA needs to request new binding information for each Rx session establishment because the information in the BSF could have changed compared to any previous binding information the DRA requested.\nThe signalling flows in clause 5 are also applicable for IMS services provided for a PLMN or an SNPN. This Annex adds flows that show interactions with SIP/SDP signalling of the IMS when the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service is used by the P-CSCF and both, the PCF and the P-CSCF support the \"IMS_SBI\" feature, and when the P-CSCF uses the Rx reference point with the PCF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn PLMNs or SNPNs where both Rx and Npcf_PolicyAuthorization are used it is implementation specific how the P-CSCF determines the applicable interface/protocol to use with the PCF - e.g. Separate P-CSCF's used for Rx and Npcf_PolicyAuthorization, local routing configuration in the P-CSCF.\nNOTE 2: In this Release only IMS voice and emergency services are provided for SNPN.\n",

            "description": "When an overlay network service has specific QoS requirements that need to be fulfilled by the underlay network, an SLA needs to be determined between the two networks.\nThe SLA covers the selective services of the overlay network that require QoS support in the underlay network. The rest of the overlay network traffic could be handled in best effort basis by the underlay network.\nThe SLA includes a mapping between the DSCP value(s) of the User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) and the QoS requirement of the overlay network service(s). The QoS requirement includes the QoS parameters (defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.7.2) that are necessary (e.g. 5QI, ARP, etc.). The SLA also includes the N3IWF IP address of the overlay network.\nBased on the SLA, the N3IWF in the overlay network derives DSCP value(s) of the User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) from the QoS requirements of the service(s), and the SMF/PCF in the underlay network derives the QoS requirements for the User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) from the DSCP value(s) of the traffic. The description of the PCC procedures for the underlay network support of QoS differentiation for User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) for network initiated QoS and UE initiated QoS modification are described in clauses C.4 and C.5 respectively.\nIn order to facilitate the SLA, the clause C.3 below provides a guidance for details of the possible mapping table between DSCP value(s) of the User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) and the QoS parameters of the overlay network service(s). The QoS parameters that the underlay network may need to determine based on the DSCP value (e.g. ARP, 5QI, GBR, MBR, …) should be described in the SLA, and configured in the underlay network SMF and/or PCF and in the N3IWF in the overlay network.\n",

The non-alteration of the DSCP values on NWu interface should be governed and ensured by the SLA and by transport level agreements.\nThe mapping guidelines in the tables below are only examples and are not expected to fit every possible deployment. E.g., a deployment may use DSCP 44 and DSCP EF for conversational voice, 5QI 1, indicating the different DSCP values different GBR UL/DL values while another one may use only DSCP 44 and estimate the GBR/MBR parameters that would best fit with a set of possible different GBR/MBR requirements.

The PCF in the underlay network installs in the SMF PCC rule(s) that contain an application identifier (see 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.2.7) that refer to the N3IWF IP address and the DSCP value(s) of the User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) of the overlay network that require QoS differentiation by the underlay network.\n2.\tThe UE registers (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.12.2) and establishes PDU Session (3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.12.5) in the overlay network via the User Plane connectivity established in the underlay network.\n3.\tWhen the UE is accessing a specific service of the overlay network, the service can e.g. request via the PCF a specific QoS treatment to the overlay network. The PCF then invokes the SM Policy Association Modification procedure (see clause 5.2.2.2), which triggers the creation of the corresponding QoS Flow in the overlay network. The N3IWF is configured to allocate different dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) for each overlay network QoS Flow(s) (3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.12.6).\nThe N3IWF uses the QoS Flow level QoS parameters it receives from SMF in overlay network along with the mapping agreed in the SLA to derive a specific DSCP value for the User Plane IPsec Child SA (e.g. QoS parameters to DSCP mapping table described in clause C.3). The N3IWF can provide to the UE the DSCP value for the User Plane IPsec Child SA (clause 4.12.5, step 4a and 4c of TS 23.502 [3]) mapped to QoS Flow for the specific network service.\nThe UE receives the QoS Flow level QoS parameters (e.g. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR, as specified in TS 24.501 [33]) from SMF/PCF in overlay network for the QoS Flow which is created for the specific overlay network service.\nThe N3IWF (for DL) and the UE (for UL) will set the DSCP marking in the outer IP header of the User Plane IPsec Child SA.\nWhen the service requests the termination of the specific QoS treatment to the overlay network, the PCF invokes the SM Policy Association Modification procedure (see clause 5.2.2.2), which triggers the termination of the corresponding QoS Flow(s) in the overlay network. The N3IWF terminates the dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) for each terminated overlay network QoS Flow(s).\n4.\tThe overlay network traffic between UE and N3IWF using the specific DSCP marking will be detected by the UPF/SMF in the underlay network based on the previously installed PCC rules.\nWhen the N3IWF terminates the dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA(s), the termination of the traffic with the specific DSCP marking will be detected by the UPF/SMF in the underlay network based on the previously installed PCC rules.\n5.\tThe UE and N3IWF detected traffic are reported by the SMF to the PCF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.4.6, using the SM Policy Association Modification procedure described in clause 5.2.2.3.

The SMF in the underlay network may generate a separate QoS Flow, as described in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3], for the traffic of the User Plane IPsec Child SA, which will receive the same QoS treatment as the QoS treatment of the overlay network for the service traffic.\nThe detection of the termination of the UE and N3IWF traffic is reported by the SMF to the PCF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.4.6, using the SM Policy Association Modification procedure described in clause 5.2.2.3.

The packet filter in the UE-requested QoS rule can be based on the N3IWF address and the SPI associated with the IPsec SA.\nThe mapping (DSCP to QoS requirements) agreed in SLA is configured at the SMF/PCF of the underlay network and in the N3IWF of the overlay network.\nThe figure depicts an example of an UE initiating a QoS procedure, illustrating the steps involved in setting up a Quality of Service (QoS) management system within a 5G network. The figure shows the UE initiating the QoS procedure by initiating a call to the network control center (NCC), which then initiates the QoS management process.

The SMF in the overlay network invokes the SM Policy Association Modification procedure (see clause 5.2.2.3) and includes the UE-requested QoS as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.4.17. The PCF in the overlay network responds to the SMF with the PCC rule(s) with the QoS requirements as per the UE-requested QoS. The SMF creates the corresponding QoS Flow in the overlay network (see clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]).\nThe N3IWF is configured to allocate different dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA(s) for each overlay network QoS Flow(s) (3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.12.6) that requires underlay network QoS support.

The Packet Filter in the QoS rule of the request includes the overlay network N3IWF IP address and SPI associated with the User Plane IPsec Child SA.\nThe SMF in the underlay network, after receiving the PDU Session Modification Request, invokes the SM Policy Association Modification procedure (see clause 5.2.2.3) to notify to the PCF that the UE has initiated a resource modification (see 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], clause 4.2.4.17). The PCF in the underlay network determines if the request can be authorized based on UE subscription and local policy which can take into account the SLA between overlay network and underlay network. If the request is authorized, the PCF generates a new PCC rule with the UE-requested QoS, and includes it in the response to the SMF in order to create new QoS Flow in underlay network using the QoS Flow level QoS parameters from the overlay network. The generated SDF refers to the N3IWF IP address and the SPI (provided by the UE in Traffic filter in PDU Session Modification request) to enable filtering and mapping of DL traffic towards the right PDU Session/QoS Flow within the underlay network.\n-\tIf the SLA exists, and the N3IWF in overlay network provides to the UE the DSCP value for the User Plane IPsec Child SA as described in step 3, the UE can include the DSCP value in the Packet Filter of the PDU Session Modification procedure including the UE requested QoS in the underlay network.
