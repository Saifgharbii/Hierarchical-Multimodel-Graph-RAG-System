ECSP management system, as the producer, provides management services enabling ASP and ECSP consumers to orchestrate and manage EDN NFs (e.g., EAS, EES, and ECS). PLMN management system, as the producer, provides management services enabling ECSP management system to interconnect EDN NFs with 5GC NFs (e.g., PCF, UPF, NEF). Both ECSP management system and PLMN management system communicate with ETSI NFV MANO to perform lifecycle management functions.\nThe figure depicts a simplified architecture of an edge computing management framework, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It includes a central server, edge nodes, and a cloud server, all interconnected through a network. The figure illustrates the use of edge computing to offload tasks from the cloud, reducing latency and improving performance.\nFigure 4.1-1: Edge computing management framework\n",

The provisioning MnS producer returns a response indicating the operation is in progress to prevent the consumer from waiting, as the deployment in the edge cloud may take a while. Since, there can be multiple Edge Data Network (EDN) present/serving a particular edge location. This makes it critical for application service provider to have their EAS deployed at appropriate EDN(s) to provide high performance services for the UE. Therefore, provisioning MnS producer analyses the deployment requirements to determine where (i.e. on which EDN) and how many EAS instance(s) should be instantiated, and requests the ETSI NFV NFVO or ETSI MEC MEO or ETSI MEC MEAO to instantiate the EAS instance(s). The provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to ASP indicating the result of instantiation (e.g. success, failure) when a response is received from NFVO or MEO or MEAO indicating the result of instantiation operation.\n",

To support the connection of EAS NF to UPF NF, EcmConnectionInfo IOC should include the following attributes:\n-\tEAS IP address: indicate the UPF IP address.\n-\tEAS and EDN service area requirements: EAS service area (see clause 7.3.3 in TS 23.558 [2]).\n-\tECM connection type: indicate the user plane connection\n-\tN6 traffic routing list: each entry in the list should contain the following attributes (see clause 8.2.4 in TS 23.558 [2]):\n-\tDNAI: DNAI(s) associated with the EAS.\n-\tN6 traffic routing requirements: N6 traffic routing information corresponding to each EAS DNAI.\n-\tUPF Connection information: contains the following attributes:\n-\tUPF IP address: the IP address of the accessing NF.\n-\tUPF DN: the UPF DN to be configured in EASFunction IOC to indicate where the UPF is connected.\n\nThe figure depicts a schematic of an EAS (Emergency Alert System) connection to a UPF (User Peripheral Facility). The EAS is connected to the UPF through a series of cables, including a coaxial cable, a fiber-optic cable, and a power cable. The figure illustrates the various components and connections involved in the EAS-UPF connection, including the EAS transmitter, the UPF receiver, and the power supply. The figure also shows the distribution of the cables and the connectors used to connect the EAS and UPF.\nFigure 7.4.4-1: EAS to connect to UPF\n1. ECSP management system consumes the provisioning MnS with createMOI operation (see clause 11.1.1.1. in TS 28.532 [5]) for EcmConnectionInfo IOC to request PLMN management system to connect the EAS to an UPF. EcmConnectionInfo includes EAS IP address, EAS service area , EDN service area, N6 traffic routing requiremments and ecmConnectionType with value USERPLANE.\n2. PLMN management system finds a UPF based on the EAS and EDN service areas.and N6 traffic routing requirements.\nIf an UPF can be found, then performs the following steps:\n3. PLMN management system creates the EcmConnectionInfo MOI with uPFConnectionInfo, including UPF IP address and UPF DN.\n4. PLMN management system create EP_N6 MOI with UPF IP address in localAddress, and EAS IP address in remoteAddress to connect UPF to EAS.\n5. PLMN management system returns the UPF connection information in the attributeListOut of the output parameter in createMOI operation to ECSP management system.\n6. ECSP management system create EP_N6 MOI with EAS IP address in localAddress, and UPF IP address in remoteAddress.\n\nIf an UPF cannot be found, then performs the following steps:\n7. PLMN management system returns the output parameters for createMOI operation to indicate the UPF instantiation is in progress.\n8. PLMN management system invokes the InstantiateNsRequest operation (see clause 7.3.3 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [6]) to request NFVO via the Os-Ma-nfvo interface to instantiate a NS instance including the UPF VNF instance.\n9. NFVO sends a notification to PLMN management system indicating the result of instantiation procedure (see clause 7.3.3.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [6]).\n10. If the UPF has been instantiated, then performs the following steps:\n10.1. PLMN management system creates the EcmConnectionInfo MOI with UPF connection information, including UPF IP address and UPF DN.\n10.2. PLMN management system create EP_N6 MOI with UPF IP address in localAddress, and EAS IP address in remoteAddress to connect UPF to EAS.\n10.3 PLMN management system sends notifyMOICreation with UPF connection information in attributeList.\n10.4. ECSP management system create EP_N6 MOI with EAS IP address in localAddress, and UPF IP address in remoteAddress.\n\n11. If the UPF has not been instantiated, then performs the following step:\n11.1 PLMN management system sends notifyMOICreation to ECSP management system to indicate no UPF can be found.\n",

It is defined in terms of a geographical area. A Cloudlet [14] is a point of presence for the edge cloud. It is the point where edge applications are deployed. The ECSP do not expose physical location of the cloudlets to the application service providers. The application service provider is not allowed to request deployment of its application on a specific edge cloud. There can be multiple Cloudlet in an Availability Zone. The application service provider can query for the QoS (latency, jitter etc.) available in a particular Availability Zone. The OP requires application service provider to specify target Availability Zone, when requesting for an Application deployment. The virtual resources can be reserved in a particular Availability Zone on request from the application service provider.\nAs ASP queries the available Availability Zones. The ECSP respond with all the available zone and their characteristics including the QoS supported in each of them. The ASP choose one of the Availability Zone to deploy an application on. ASP request ECSP to deploy an application in the selected Availability Zone. ECSP deploy the given application as part of the AZ.\n",

The AZs are interconnected through a network of high-speed fiber-optic cables, ensuring high-speed data transfer between the data centers. The figure also highlights the use of redundant paths to ensure data reliability and failover capabilities.\nFigure B.2-1 Example of Availability Zone\n\nThe Operator Platform (OP) is defined by GSMA OPG [2], it facilitates access to the Edge Cloud capability of an Operator or federation of operators and their partners.\nThe architecture scope under definition is shown below,\nThe figure depicts the various roles and interfaces of the Optical Network Radio (OP Roles) and Interfaces in a 5G network, illustrating the various network functions and their interconnections.\nFigure C-1: OP Roles and Interfaces Reference Architecture\nThe NBI is the interface between the application provider and the Capabilities Exposure Role in the Operator Platform, it allows an OP to advertise the above cloud capabilities that it can provide to application providers. In addition, the NBI allows an application provider to reserve a set of resources or request an Edge Cloud service with the resources and features that they require and for the OP to accept or reject the request.\nThe following table provides the mapping of concepts (not exhaustive) defined in TS 28.538[6] with the concepts defined in GSMA OPG [14].\nTable C-1: Mapping of concepts of TS 28.538 [6] with GSMA [14]\n\n\n",
