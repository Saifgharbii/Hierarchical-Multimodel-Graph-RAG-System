If all PFDs retrieved from the PFDF are removed for an application identifier, the pre-configured PFDs shall be applied again for the application identifier.\nThe PFDF may provide caching time value via the \"cachingTime\" attribute or, if the feature CachingTimer is supported, via the \"cachingTimer\" attribute, together with the PFDs for an application identifier. The caching time value retrieved from the PFDF takes precedence over the default caching time value configured in the NF service consumer. If no caching time value is received from the PFDF, the configured default caching time value shall be applied.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NF service consumer(s) and the PFDF(s) within an operator network are configured with the same default caching time value to be applied for all application identifiers.\nNOTE 2:\tThe configuration of a caching time value per application identifier in the PFDF is based on the SLA between the operator and the ASP.\nThe following procedures using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch service operation are supported:\n-\tRetrieval of PFDs by the full pull.\n-\tRetrieval of PFDs by the partial pull.\nThis service operation enables the NF service consumer to retrieve PFDs for the known Application Identifier(s) from the PFDF.\nThe following procedure using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch service operation is supported:\n-\tRetrieval of PFDs by the full pull.\nThis procedure, as shown in Figure 4.2.2.2-1, is used to retrieve PFDs from the PFDF by the full pull for requested application identifier(s).\nThe figure depicts a retrieval of PFDs (Point-to-Point Data) by the full pull method, which is a technique used in network management to ensure efficient data transmission. The figure shows the PFDs being retrieved from the network, with the full pull method being highlighted as a key feature.\nFigure 4.2.2.2-1: Retrieval of PFDs by the full pull\n1.\tThe NF service consumer (e.g. SMF, NWDAF) shall send a GET request to the resource representing the PFDs for the requested application identifier(s):\n-\tfor PFDs of an individual application identifier, the request URI shall be set to \"{apiRoot}/nnef-pfdmanagement/v1/applications/{appId}\" (as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 1a); and\n-\tfor PFD of a collection of application identifiers, the request URI shall be set to \"{apiRoot}/nnef-pfdmanagement/v1/applications\" (as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 1b) with query parameters indicating the requested application identifier(s).\n2.\tOn success, an HTTP \"200 OK\" response shall be returned, with the content containing a representation of an \"Individual application PFD\" resource or a \"PFD of applications\" resource for the requested application identifier(s). When the NF service consumer is SMF, it shall replace the stored PFD(s) retrieved from the PFDF with the new received PFD(s) for the requested application identifier(s). If the PFD(s) of one or more requested application identifier(s) are not provided in the response, the NF service consumer shall remove the PFD(s) of these requested application identifier(s) and re-apply the pre-configured PFDs.\n\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP GET request, the PFDF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7. For \"404 Not Found\", when the NF service consumer is SMF, it shall remove the PFD(s) of the requested application identifier(s) in the NF service consumer and re-apply the pre-configured PFDs.\nIf the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PFDF determines the received HTTP GET request needs to be redirected, the PFDF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].\nThis procedure, as shown in Figure 4.2.2.3-1, is used to retrieve PFDs from the PFDF by the partial pull for requested application identifier(s) if the \"PartialPull\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported both by NF service consumer and PFDF.\nThe figure depicts a retrieval of PFDs (Point-to-Point Data Links) by the partial pull method, which is a technique used in wireless communication systems to improve the efficiency of data transmission. The figure shows a network with multiple PFDs, each connected to a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE). The PFDs are shown in different colors, indicating their status, such as active or idle. The figure also includes a schematic representation of the network, showing the paths of the PFDs and the connections between them. The partial pull method involves pulling the PFDs from the network, which can be done in a more efficient manner by using a technique called \"pulling\" or \"pulling-up.\" This method can help reduce the number of PFDs that need to be pulled, which can improve the overall efficiency of the network.\nFigure 4.2.2.3-1: Retrieval of PFDs by the partial pull\n1.\tThe NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) shall send an HTTP POST message to the resource \"{apiRoot}/nnef-pfdmanagement/v1/applications/partialpull\". The NF service consumer shall include one or more ApplicationForPfdRequest data structure in the content of the HTTP POST. With the ApplicationForPfdRequest data structure, the NF service consumer shall include the application identifier within the \"applicationId\" attribute and the timestamp of the PFDs received in the last provisioning for the application identifier within the \"pfdTimestamp\" attribute. The NF service consumer may also request full set of PFD(s) of an application identifier without including the timestamp if it is not available.\n2.\tIf the PFDF accepted the HTTP POST request, the PFDF shall send to the NF service consumer:\n-\tthe HTTP \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step 2a) including one or more PfdDataForApp data structure if the NF service consumer requests the PFD(s) for an application identifier(s) without the timestamp or if the NF service consumer requests PFD(s) for an application identifier(s) with timestamp and the PFDF determines that corresponding PFD(s) is changed since the last request based on the timestamp received in the request for the application identifier. Within the PfdDataForApp data type, the PFDF shall include the application identifier within the \"applicationId\" attribute, the new timestamp within the \"pfdTimestamp\" attirbute, the \"partialFlag\" attribute if applicable and create/update/remove the PFDs as follows:\n-\tinclude the full list of the PFD(s) within the \"pfds\" attribute for the application identifier which is requested without the timestamp;\n-\tinclude the full list of the PFD(s) within the \"pfds\" attribute for the application identifier if all the PFD(s) are changed for the application identifier since the last request based on the timestamp;\n-\tfor the application identifier whose PFD(s) are partially changed:\n-\tinclude the new PFD(s) with new PFD identifier(s) within the \"pfds\" attribute if the new PFD(s) is added for the application identifier and the \"partialFlag\" attribute set to true;\n-\tinclude the new PFD(s) with existing PFD identifier(s) within the \"pfds\" attribute if the existing PFD(s) is updated for the application identifier and the \"partialFlag\" attribute set to true;\n-\tinclude the existing PFD identifier(s) without any content within the \"pfds\" attribute if the existing PFD(s) is removed for the application identifier and the \"partialFlag\" attribute set to true;\n-\tnot include the \"pfds\" attribute if the PFD(s) is removed for the application identifier.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PFDF does not include the PfdDataForApp data type for the application identifier whose PFD(s) is not updated since last request.\nNOTE 2\tIf the PFDF determines that the PFDs are changed since the last request but cannot determine what changes have been applied to the individual PFD(s) for an application identifier, the PFDF can include the full list of the PFD(s) in the PfdDataForApp data type.\n-\tthe HTTP \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step 2b) if the PFD(s) for all the requested application identifier(s) are not changed since last request.\nWhen the NF service consumer receives the response with \"200 OK\" status code, the NF service consumer shall\n-\tremove the all existing PFD(s) (if available) and install all the new provided PDF(s) for an application identifier if full list of PFD(s) is received but \"partialFlag\" attribute is not received;\n-\tdelete the existing PFD(s) for an application identifier(s) where no PFD(s) is received;\n-\tfor an application identifier(s) where the PFD(s) is provided and \"partialFlag\" attribute is also provided and set to true:\n-\t\tinstall a new PFD(s) if the new PFD(s) with a new PFD identifier(s) is received;\n-\tupdate an existing PFD(s) if a new PFD(s) with the same PFD identifier(s) is received;\n-\tdelete an existing PFD(s) if the same PFD identifier(s) without any content is received;\n-\treserve an existing PFD(s) if the PFD identifier(s) is not received.\n",

Within the PfdSubscription data type, the NF service consumer shall include:\n-\tan URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notifyUri\" attribute;\nand may include:\n-\tsubscribed application identifier(s) within the \"applicationIds\" attribute.\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"notifUri\" attribute within the PfdSubscription data structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to a new NF service consumer.\n2.\tIf the feature PfdChgSubsUpdate is supported and the request is accepted, the PFDF shall:\n-\tupdate the subscription; and\n-\tsend an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the content containing a representation of the updated subscription.\nOtherwise, if errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the PFDF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7. If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PFDF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the PFDF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].\nNOTE 2:\tThe PFDs that have been provisioned to the PFDF before the NF service consumer performs the subscription are not notified to the NF service consumer as a result of this subscription, but the NF service consumer can retrieve them before performing the subscription by invoking Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch Service Operation.\n",

The PFD stands for Power Factor, and it indicates the efficiency of the electrical power supply. This change is typically communicated to the network to ensure that the power supply is functioning correctly and is not causing any issues. The figure shows the various components involved in the notification process, such as the PFD change notification system, the network interface, and the communication between the system and the network. This figure is essential for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the telecommunication network.\nFigure 4.2.4.2-1: Notification of PFD change\n1.\tThe PFDF shall send a POST request to the NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) targeting the URI \"{notifyUri}, where {notifyUri} is the notification URI provided during the creation or modification of the subscription resource as specified in clause 4.2.3.
