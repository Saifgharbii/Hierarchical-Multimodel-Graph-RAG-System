            "description": "The applicability of each individual test is identified in Table 4-1. This is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the test case was written.\nThe applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of Boolean expression that are based on parameters (ICS) included in annex A of the present document.\nAdditional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well.\nWhen a test case is to be executed against a category M1 UE and with IMS enabled, it is assumed that the UE is compliant to GSMA profile NG.108 [55].\nThe columns in Table 4-1 have the following meaning:\nClause\nThe clause column indicates the clause number in TS 36.523-1 [19] that contains the test body.\nTitle\nThe title column describes the name of the test and contains the clause title of the clause in TS 36.523-1 [19] that contains the test body.\nRelease\nThe release column indicates the earliest release from which the test case is applicable. In some specific cases it may indicate the release(s) for which the TC is only applicable.\nNote:\tSome exceptions to this interpretation may be indicated in Notes in column 'Release' e.g. see Note 3 Table 4-1.\nApplicability - Condition\nThe following notations are used for the applicability column:\nR\trecommended - the test case is recommended\nO\toptional – the test case is optional\nN/A\tnot applicable - in the given context, the test case is not recommended.\nCi\tconditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\") depending on the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying an unique conditional status expression which is defined immediately following the table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ... THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\" is used to avoid ambiguities.\nNOTE 1:\tThe conditions are defined in Table 4-1a.\nApplicability - Comments\nThis column contains a verbal description of the condition.\nAdditional Information - Specific ICS\nThis column contains the mnemonics of ICS(s) affecting the dynamic behaviour of the TC.\nNOTE 1A:\tICS items specified in 3GPP TS 34.123-2 [8] and 3GPP TS 34.229-2 [45] can be referred, to avoid redundant definitions.\nNOTE 1B:\tThe ICS items pc_eFDD and pc_eFDD, as well as pc_NB_FDD and pc_NB_TDD, specified in the present document (Table A.4.1-1) are used to identify that a test case can be run in FDD or/and TDD branch. When none of them is provided it is assumed that the test case requires both FDD and TDD.\nAdditional Information - Specific IXIT\nThis column contains the mnemonics of IXIT(s) affecting the dynamic behaviour of the TC.\nAdditional Information - Number of TC Executions\nThis column contains, wherever applicable, the recommended for certification purposes number of TC executions. It may contain also other information e.g. exceptions to the release applicable to the test. Clarifying notes are listed in Table 4-1b.\nAdditional Information - Release other RAT\nIn regard to a particular test case, this column provides information on the release which is used by the simulated network in the other (i.e. non E-UTRA) RAT(s) where applicable. For each applicable RAT the release shall be indicated in the format 'Rel-X RAT'. When multiple RATs are applicable the entries per RAT shall be separated by a comma. When a value for a 3GPP RAT is not provided but the RAT is in the scope of the test case then for this RAT the release indicated in the Release column applies (per default), a Note extending the release applicability to an earlier version for E-UTRA in the ‘Release’ column is not applicable to the other RATs.\nEXAMPLES:\nRel-9 UTRA FDD, Rel-8 GERAN or simply as Rel-9 UTRA FDD\n(meaning that the UTRA FDD will simulate Rel-9 and the GERAN Rel-8 behaviours)\nRel-9 UTRA TDD\n(meaning that the UTRA LCR TDD network will simulate Rel-9 behaviours)\nNOTE 1C:\tSome exceptions to this interpretation may be indicated in Notes in column 'Release other RAT' e.g. see Note 7A Table 4-1.\n\nNOTE 2:\tTo meet the validation requirements from certification bodies then there is a need to uniquely reference the FDD and TDD branch of common FDD and TDD test cases. The FDD and TDD branches of common FDD and TDD test cases can be referenced by amending a \"FDD\" or \"TDD\" suffix to the test case clause number. For example for AM RLC test case 7.2.3.13 the FDD and TDD branches can be identified by \"7.2.3.13 FDD\" and \"7.2.3.13 TDD\".\nTable 4-1: Applicability of tests and additional rmation for testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4-1a: Applicability of tests Conditions\n\nTable 4-1b: Number of TC Executions - Notes\n\n",

For each FGI (applicable to the Release supported by the UE):\n-\tIf the UE supports E-UTRA FDD and TDD: both FDD and TDD support statuses shall be declared separately (see Note 2).\n-\tIf the UE supports single E-UTRA xDD mode: only the xDD-specific support status needs to be declared.\nNote 1:\tFrom Rel-11 onwards 3GPP TSG RAN has discontinued the usage of FGI bits. Instead it has introduced a different mechanism to accomplish the same purposes based on the principles described in TS 36.306 [13] clause 4. These new principles where applicable should be catered for elsewhere in the present document e.g. in section A.4.4.\nNote 2:\tFor Rel-8 UE, the separate declaration also applies to FGI 1-32.\nNote 3:\t'VoLTE' in the tables A.4.5-1a and A.4.5-1b corresponds to a UE which is IMS voice capable.\nTable A.4.5-1: Void\nTable A.4.5-1a: Feature group indicators 1-32 for FDD\n\nTable A.4.5-1b: Feature group indicators 1-32 for TDD\n\nTable A.4.5-1c: Void\nTable A.4.5-1d: Feature group indicators 33-64 for FDD\n\nTable A.4.5-1e: Feature group indicators 33-64 for TDD\n\nTable A.4.5-2: EUTRA Feature group indicators\n\nTable A.4.5-3: Void\nTable A.4.5-3a: Release 10 AS feature group indicators 101-132 for FDD\n\nTable A.4.5-3b: Release 10 AS feature group indicators 101-132 for TDD\n\n\n",

            "description": "Test Case dynamic behaviour consist of a sequence of actions taken e.g. by the UE or the SS. Depending e.g. on the UE capabilities, configuration or implementation different paths within this sequence may be executed or skipped. For the purpose of the present annex the existence of such pats is denoted as 'branching' and the paths as 'branches'.\nTest Cases consist of a Preamble, a Test body (procedure) and a Postamble. Each of these 3 distinctive parts may contain multiple test branches.\nPreambles will be the same for many (most) TCs. For example UE state Registered, Idle mode (state 2). Similarly Postambles will in their majority contain common actions. It should be noted that the basic Preambles and Postambles are part of the Test body (procedure) in a number of TCs\nThe UE capabilities/configuration options in general are identified by ICS/IXIT defined in TS 36.523-2 and 36.523-3 respectively. Many of these ICS/IXIT have then been used to determine which of a set of branches a TC may go during execution; some have been used to define TC Applicability, and, some have been used for both.\nTable 4-1 'Applicability of tests and additional rmation for testing' contains two columns dedicated to Specific ICS and IXIT which have impact on the TC dynamic behaviour branching and are used in the TC prose and the TTCN implementation. These columns are intended to cover ICS/IXIT which have impact only on the TC body where the TC verdict(s) are assigned and not on the Preamble/Postamble of the TC.\nWhereas most of the TC branches have one or more associated ICS/IXIT, in exceptional cases optional UE behaviour which is handled by the SS \"on the go\", i.e. if the UE does it then the SS will respond accordingly, does not have associated ICS/IXIT.\nNote:\tProviding information which makes the existence of optional behaviour branches more explicit and details on the ICS and IXIT which have impact on the branching of the Preambles/Postambles can be useful e.g. for certification organisations validation purposes.\nInformation on the Specific ICS and IXIT which have impact on the branching of the Preambles/Postambles is provided in B.3. Special ICS to identify optional branches are defined in section B.2.\n",
