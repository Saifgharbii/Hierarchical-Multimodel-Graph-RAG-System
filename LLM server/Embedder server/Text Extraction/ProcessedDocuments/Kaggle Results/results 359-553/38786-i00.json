            "description": "In Rel-16, sidelink communication was developed in RAN mainly to support advanced V2X applications. In Rel-17, SA2 studied and standardized Proximity based service including public safety and commercial related service. As part of Rel-17, power saving solutions (e.g., partial sensing, DRX) and inter-UE coordination have been developed in RAN1 and RAN2 to improve power consumption for battery limited terminals and reliability of sidelink transmissions.\nAlthough NR sidelink was initially developed for V2X applications, there is growing interest in the industry to expand the applicability of NR sidelink to commercial use cases. For commercial sidelink applications, two key requirements have been identified:\n-\tIncreased sidelink data rate\n-\tSupport of new carrier frequencies for sidelink\nIncreased sidelink data rate is motivated by applications such as sensor information (video) sharing between vehicles with high degree of driving automation. Commercial use cases could require data rates in excess of what is possible in Rel-17. Increased data rate can be achieved with the support of sidelink carrier aggregation and sidelink over unlicensed spectrum. Furthermore, by enhancing the FR2 sidelink operation, increased data rate can be more efficiently supported on FR2. While the support of new carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths would also allow to improve its data rate, the main benefit would come from making sidelink more applicable for a wider range of applications. More specifically, with the support of unlicensed spectrum and the enhancement in FR2, sidelink will be in a better position to be implemented in commercial devices since utilization of the ITS band is limited to ITS safety related applications.\nAnother aspect to consider is the V2X deployment scenario where both LTE V2X and NR V2X devices are to coexist in the same frequency channel. For the two different types of devices to coexist while using a common carrier frequency, it is important that there is mechanism to efficiently utilize resource allocation by the two technologies without negatively impacting the operation of each technology. This requirement was also mentioned as part of the input from 5G Automotive Association to the Rel-18 RAN Workshop.\n",

The mask is represented by a series of ON/OFF lines, with the ON line indicating the time when the power supply is on and the OFF line indicating the time when the power supply is off. This mask is essential for ensuring that the power supply is turned off when not in use, and that it is turned on when needed, to maintain the proper functioning of the power supply system.\nFigure 6.1.7-1 General ON/OFF time mask for SL-U PSSCH and PSCCH\n\nThe figure depicts a 16-bit ON/OFF time mask for the SL-U S-SSB, which is used to control the power levels of the signal in the 5G network.

However, the requirement format is different from NR single CC which can be found below, i.e. the ACS is adjusted according to the CBW while the NR single CC is fixed as 33dB for bands above 3.3GHz. The ACS requirement has been extensively discussed in NR-U WI with various views considering the difference of ACLR, ACIR impacts, and comparison with WIFI system, and coexistence with LAA, and the final value is a compromised outcome.\n\n\nACS Requirement for NR-U\nFurthermore, for NR normal requirement, there are two test cases for ACS as case 1 and case 2. During the NR-U discussion, the case 2 was considered not necessary for operation in unlicensed bands. It has been agreed to reuse NR-U ACS requirement for NR SL-U using the NR SL-U RMC, as discussed in general part.\n",

The 10MHz as smallest CBW for NR V2X is used as BWinterferer and corresponding offset frequency is decided. In NR SL-U, 10MHz is not supported and 20MHz is supported as the smallest CBW for single CC.\n\n\nIn this case, the NR-U IBB can be reused for NR SL-U.\nThe NR sidelink OBB requirement is reused from LTE sidelink and hence different power level for the transmission power based on different bandwidth. For NR-U OBB requirement, it is based on the NR normal requirement since there is no Wi-Fi corresponding requirement. Further modification has applied for range 3 considering the shallower frequency response of the band filter at high frequencies. In this case, the NR-U requirement can be reused for NR SL-U.\n\n\nNarrow band blocking was introduced in NR single CC to mimic the potential interference coming from narrow band systems, but such system is not existing in the targeting unlicensed spectrum and therefore the Narrow Band Blocking requirements are not defined for NR-U.\nIt has been agreed not to define Narrow Band Blocking requirements for NR SL-U.\n\n",

The reference slot is the 1st slot overlapping with LTE SL subframe and target slot is the subsequent NR SL slot overlapping with the LTE SL subframe. The measurement period is one NR SL slot with guard symbol omitted.\nThe power of the target slot must not exceed the power of the reference slot by more than relative slot power tolerance of +1 dB.\n\n\n\n\n",
