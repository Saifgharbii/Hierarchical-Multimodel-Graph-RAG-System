                    "text_content": "\nSummary based on the input provided by Vodafone in SP-180883.\nThe 5G requirements have been defined in terms of new services and markets by SA1, under the \"SMARTER\" work item. These are defined mostly in TS 22.261 [1], which describes different types of requirements for different 5G usage:\n-\tEnhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB): the new requirements -higher than for 4G- are specified for data-rates, traffic/connection density, user mobility, etc. Various deployment and coverage scenarios are considered, addressing different service areas (e.g., indoor/outdoor, urban and rural areas, office and home, local and wide areas connectivity), and special deployments (e.g., massive gatherings, broadcast, residential, and high-speed vehicles). The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.1-1 of TS 22.261 [1]. For instance, for the downlink, data rate of up to 50 Mbps are expected when outdoor and 1 Gbps when indoor (5GLAN), and half of these values for the uplink. For services to an airplane, a bitrate of 1,2 Gbps is expected per plane.\n-\tCritical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC): Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services. The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.2.2-1 of TS 22.261 [1]. For instance, in the context of remote control for process automation, a reliability of 99,9999% is expected, with a user experienced data rate up to 100 Mbps and an end-to-end latency of 50 ms. This is provided in particular through the Edge Computing capability described below.\n-\tMassive Internet of Things (mIoT). Several scenarios require the 5G system to support very high traffic densities of devices. The Massive Internet of Things requirements include the operational aspects that apply to the wide range of IoT devices and services anticipated in the 5G timeframe.\n-\tFlexible network operations. These are a set of specificities offered by the 5G system, as detailed in the following sections. It covers aspects such as network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility, security, efficient content delivery, and migration and interworking.\nThis diversity of requirements, associated to the different categories of usage described above, enables the use of the 5GS by different sectors of the industry, referred to as \"verticals\". Some of these verticals are mentioned in the annexes of TS 22.261 [1]:\n-\tAutomotive and other transport (trains, maritime communications),\n-\tTransport, logistics, IoT,\n-\tDiscrete automation,\n-\tElectricity distribution,\n-\tPublic Safety,\n-\tHealth and wellness,\n-\tSmart cities,\n-\tMedia and entertainment.\nSome of these aspects are further described in corresponding clauses of this document: e.g. Railways, eV2X and its associated requirements as defined in TS 22.186 [10], etc.\nAs for the migration path, the 5G system supports, in addition to the new 5G-specific services, all the former EPS (4G) capabilities that were defined in TS 22.278 [2] and in TSs 22.011 [3], 22.101 [4], 22.185 [5], 22.071 [6], 22.115 [7], 22.153 [8], 22.173 [9]. There are some exceptions, i.e. some 4G services are not supported in 5G: they relate to the interworking with legacy systems, as specified in clause 5.1.2.2 of TS 22.261. Finally, mobility between a 5G core network and an EPC (4G) is supported, with minimum impact to the user experience.\nNOTE: \tIn this document, EPS and all the other concepts related to LTE, such as \"LTE Advanced Pro\", will be referred to as \"4G\", although this is not an official 3GPP terminology.\nReferences\n[1]\tTS 22.261, \"Service requirements for the 5G system\".\n[2]\tTS 22.278, \"Service requirements for the Evolved Packet System (EPS)\".\n[3]\tTS 22.011, \"Service accessibility\".\n[4]\tTS 22.101, \"Service aspects; Service principles\".\n[5]\tTS 22.185, \"Service requirements for V2X services\".\n[6]\tTS 22.071, \"Location Services (LCS); Service description\".\n[7]\tTS 22.115, \"Service aspects; Charging and billing\".\n[8]\tTS 22.153, \"Multimedia priority service\".\n[9]\tTS 22.173, \"IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) Multimedia Telephony Service and supplementary services\".\n[10]\tTS 22.186, \"Service requirements for enhanced V2X scenarios\".\n\n",

Various PDU session types are supported including IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet and Unstructured.\nThe 5G's main characteristic is the introduction of a new radio interface, the New Radio (NR), which offers the flexibility needed to support these very different types of services.\nAnother key characteristic of 5G is that the 5G Access Network can connect not only to a new 5G Core Network but also to the 4G (LTE) Core Network. This is known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called the SA architecture.\nOn the Core Network side, the 5G System offers also a wide array of new characteristics, such as a deeper use of Network Slicing, Mobile Edge Computing or Network Capability Exposure.

In this configuration, only the 4G services are supported, but enjoying the capacities offered by the 5G New Radio (lower latency, etc). The NSA is also known as \"E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC)\" or \"Architecture Option 3\". See also the clause on EDCE5.\n-\tthe \"Stand-Alone\" (SA) architecture, where the NR is connected to the 5G CN. Only in this configuration, the full set of 5G Phase 1 services are supported.\nThe NSA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.\nThe figure depicts the NSA architecture, which is a key component of the 5G network. It illustrates the various layers and components involved in the network, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 5.3.2-1: The NSA Architecture\nThe NSA architecture can be seen as a temporary step towards \"full 5G\" deployment, where the 5G Access Network is connected to the 4G Core Network. In the NSA architecture, the (5G) NR base station (logical node \"en-gNB\") connects to the (4G) LTE base station (logical node \"eNB\") via the X2 interface. The X2 interface was introduced prior to Release 15 to connect two eNBs. In Release 15, it also supports connecting an eNB and en-gNB as to provide NSA.\nThe NSA offers dual connectivity, via both the 4G AN (E-UTRA) and the 5G AN (NR). It is thus also called \"EN-DC\", for \"E-UTRAN and NR Dual Connectivity\".\nIn EN-DC, the 4G's eNB is the Master Node (MN) while the 5G's en-gNB is the Secondary Node (SN).\nThis is explained in detail on the dedicated section on NSA of this present document.\nThe SA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.\nThe figure depicts the SA (Service Access) architecture, which is a key component of a 5G network. It illustrates the various layers and components involved in the service access process, including the core network, service access network, and service access control. The figure highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing policy in managing network resources and ensuring efficient service delivery.\nFigure 5.3.3-1: The SA Architecture\nThe SA architecture can be seen as the \"full 5G deployment\", not needing any part of a 4G network to operate.\nThe NR base station (logical node \"gNB\") connects with each other via the Xn interface, and the Access Network (called the \"NG-RAN for SA architecture\") connects to the 5GC network using the NG interface.\nThe continuation of this section refers to the SA architecture, the NSA being addressed in a subsequent, dedicated, section.\n",

The architecture specification (a.k.a. Stage 2) started with a preliminary study in TR 23.799 [4], also called \"NextGen TR\", before being fully specified in TS 23.501 [1], TS 23.502 [2] and TS 23.503 [3].\nThe 5GC architecture relies on a so-called \"Service-Based Architecture\" (SBA) framework, where the architecture elements are defined in terms of \"Network Functions\" (NFs) rather than by \"traditional\" Network Entities. Via interfaces of a common framework, any given NF offers its services to all the other authorized NFs and/or to any \"consumers\" that are permitted to make use of these provided services. Such an SBA approach offers modularity and reusability.\nThe basic (SA, non-roaming) 5G System architecture is shown below (figure introduced by the editor):\nThe 5G system architecture, as depicted in Figure 5.3.3-1, is a complex network that combines various technologies to deliver high-speed, low-latency communication services. The figure illustrates the multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network, showing how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 5.3.3-1: Overview of the 5G System architecture\nAt this stage, only the following essential Network Functions and elements are highlighted here:\n-\tThe User Equipment (UE);\n-\tThe (Radio) Access Network [(R)AN];\n-\tThe User Plane Function (UPF), handling the user data;\n-\tThe (external) Data Network (DN);\n-\tSome remarkable Network Functions (NFs):\n-\tThe Application Function (AF), handling the application(s);\n-\tThe Access and Mobility management Function (AMF), that accesses the UE and the (R)AN;\n- \tThe Session Management Function (SMF), that accesses the UPF.\nThe other NFs are introduced later.\nThe SBA approach enables a virtualized deployment. Indeed, a Network Function instance can be deployed as fully distributed, fully redundant, stateless and/or fully scalable. Several Network Function instances can be present within a same NF set. Conversely, the services can be provided from several locations.\nIn other words, when the services of a specific NF are invoked, this virtualization enables to route the UE's messages to any capable entity (within a pre-defined set of equivalent NFs).\nThis provides resiliency: any specific instance of the NF can e.g. be turned off for planned maintenance, and there will be auto-recovery without any service disruption.\n",

                            "text_content": "Further to the overall architecture provided above, this clause goes deeper in the functionalities provided by the Core Network (AMF, SMF, etc.) and the ones in the Access Network, i.e. provided by the gNB.\nFigure 2-1 of TS 23.501 [1] shows some of the different NFs:\nThe 5G System architecture, as depicted in Figure 5.1-1, showcases a layered design with a focus on network slicing and network slicing management. The architecture includes a core network, a mobile network, and a cloud network, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Key components include base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and network slicing, which enable efficient resource allocation and flexible network management. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing in enabling network slicing management, which is a key feature of 5G networks.\nFigure 5.5.1-1: The 5G System architecture\nSome NFs are specific to some network aspects and will be presented below, such as the Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF), the Authentication Server Function (AUSF) or the Policy Control Function (PCF). The security-related NFs, i.e. SEAF, AUSF, ARPF, SEPP, are (also) presented in the section on 5G Security.\nThe NFs exchanging information on the AN/CN interface are, on the Core Network side, the AMF, UPF and SMF, and, on the Access Network side, the gNB. These NFs are shown in the figure below in yellow boxes while the white boxes depict the main tasks they perform.\nThe figure depicts a functional split between the Next Generation RAN (5G Core) and 5G Giga-Core (5GC) networks. The 5G Core network is responsible for the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, while the 5GC network is responsible for the core functions of the network, including the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, including the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, including the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (RAN) functions, and the core functions of the network, such as radio access network (\nFigure 5.5.1-2: Functional Split between NG-RAN and 5GC\nOn the Core Network side, the AMF (\"Access and Mobility management Function\") oversees all the signalling which is not specific to User Data, such as mobility or security. The SMF (\"Session Management Function\"), takes care of the signalling related to User Data traffic, such as session establishment. Finally, The UPF (\"User Plane Function\") represents the handling of user data.\nOn the Access Network side, the gNB (5G Node B) performs all the main AN-related tasks, including Radio Resource Management: Radio Bearer Control, Radio Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic allocation of resources to UEs, etc.\n",

                            "text_content": "The AMF (Access and Mobility management Function) support UEs with different mobility management needs. It performs the following main tasks:\n-\tThe Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signalling termination;\n-\tThe NAS signalling security;\n-\tThe Access Stratum (AS) Security control;\n-\tInter CN node signalling for mobility between 3GPP access networks;\n-\tIdle mode UE Reachability (including control and execution of paging retransmission);\n-\tRegistration Area management;\n-\tSupport of intra-system and inter-system mobility;\n-\tAccess Authentication;\n-\tAccess Authorization including check of roaming rights;\n-\tMobility management control (subscription and policies);\n-\tSupport of Network Slicing;\n-\tSMF selection.\nThe SMF (Session Management Function) can support, together with the AMF, customized mobility management schemes such as \"Mobile Initiated Connection Only\" (MICO) or RAN enhancements like \"RRC Inactive\" state. It performs the following main tasks:\n-\tSession Management;\n-\tUE IP address allocation and management;\n-\tSelection and control of UPF;\n-\tConfigures traffic steering at UPF to route traffic to proper destination;\n-\tControl part of policy enforcement and QoS;\n-\tDownlink Data Notification.\nThe UPF (User Plane Function) performs the following main tasks:\n-\tAnchor point for Intra-/Inter-RAT mobility (when applicable);\n-\tExternal PDU session point of interconnect to Data Network;\n-\tPacket routing & forwarding;\n-\tPacket inspection and User plane part of Policy rule enforcement;\n-\tTraffic usage reporting;\n-\tUplink classifier to support routing traffic flows to a data network;\n-\tBranching point to support multi-homed PDU session;\n-\tQoS handling for user plane, e.g. packet filtering, gating, UL/DL rate enforcement;\n-\tUplink Traffic verification (SDF to QoS flow mapping);\n-\tDownlink packet buffering and downlink data notification triggering.\nThe other main Network Functions are:\n-\tThe \"Network Repository Function\" (NRF): it provides support for NF services management including registration, deregistration, authorization and discovery.\n-\tThe \"Network Exposure Function\" (NEF): it provides external exposure of the capabilities of the network functions. External exposure can be categorized as Monitoring capability, Provisioning capability, Application influence of traffic routing and Policy/Charging capability.\n-\tThe \"Unified Data Management\" (UDM): the 5GC supports Data Storage architecture for Compute and Storage separation. The Unified Data Repository (UDR) is the master database. The Unstructured Data Storage Function (UDSF) is introduced to store dynamic state data.\nAs to support the very different types of services, 5G uses \"Service Hosting Environment\", which is a service platform located inside of an operator's network. It offers Hosted Services closer to the end user to meet specific requirement like low latency, low bandwidth pressure. These Hosted Services contain applications provided by operators and/or trusted third parties. It also supports flexible user plane routing, so that user plane paths can be selected or changed to improve the user experience or balance the network load, when a UE or application changes location during an active communication.\nLocal hosting of services is provided in particular through the Edge Computing capability. Edge computing is the possibility for an operator and/or a 3rd party to execute the services close to the UE's access point of attachment. This reduces the end-to-end latency and the load on the transport network.\nTo enable this, the 5GCN selects a UPF close to the UE and executes the traffic steering from the UPF to the local Data Network via a N6 interface. Some of the Edge computing related features are:\n-\tSupport concurrent (e.g. local and central) access to a data network, an architectural enabler for low-latency services.\n-\tApplication influence on traffic routing.\n-\tSupport of URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low-Latency) services.\n-\tSupport for different Session and Service Continuity modes.\n-\tSupport of Local Area Data Network.\nA network slice is a (set of) element(s) of the network specialised in the provisioning of a certain (type of) service(s). For example, there can be one network slice for IoT, another one for supporting \"classic\" UEs and another one for V2X. More generally, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), differences in performance requirements (e.g., latency, mobility and data rates), or they can serve only specific types of users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO). The different slices can be used simultaneously.\nEnd-to-end Network slicing is a major characteristic of the 5G System. It is supported by every deployed PLMN to the extent necessary to interoperate with other PLMNs, e.g. the IoT slice from operator A can interconnect directly with the IoT slice of operator B. Based on business scenario, the operator can decide how many network slices to deploy and what functions/features to share across multiple slices.\nThe characteristics of each slice are defined in terms of QoS, bit rate, latency, etc. For a given slice, these characteristics are either predefined in the 3GPP Standard or are operator-defined. There are three types of predefined slices: type 1 is dedicated to the support of eMBB, type 2 is for URLLC and type 3 is for MIoT support. These predefinitions allow inter-PLMN operation with reduced coordination effort between operators. As for the operator-defined slices, they enable more differentiation among network slices.\nA dedicated NF is introduced for slices handling: the \"Network Slice Selection Function\" (NSSF), which enables the selection of the appropriate slice(s). The UEs may use multiple Network Slices simultaneously. The Network Slice Selection policies in the UE links applications to Network slices.\nNetwork slicing also supports roaming scenarios. Finally, Network Slicing Interworking with EPS (with or without 4G's Dedicated Core Networks Selection Mechanism (e)DECOR) is possible.\nWhen congestion occurs in the 5G System, different criteria are used to determine which access attempt should be allowed or blocked. These criteria depend on operator policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and available services. The 5G system provides a single Unified Access Control, where operators control access attempts based on these criteria associated with the so-called \"Access Identities and Access Categories\".\nThe Unified Access Control allows for categorizing each UE access attempt into one Access Category. The network can restrict the UE access on a per-access category basis.\nThe 5GS also offers Mobility Management Congestion Control, DNN-based Congestion Control and network slice-based Congestion Control.\nThe 5G system supports the 3GPP access technologies, including one or more of 5G's NR and 4G's E-UTRA. It can also support non-3GPP access technologies, even non-trusted ones.\nFor optimization and resource efficiency, the 5G system can select the most appropriate 3GPP or non-3GPP access technology for a service, potentially allowing multiple access technologies to be used simultaneously for one or more services active on a UE. Seamless mobility among different access is also supported.\nThe NF called \"Authentication Server Function \"(AUSF) enables a unified framework for 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses.\nWhen it is registered via both 3GPP and non-3GPP access, the UE is identified by a single 5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (5G-GUTI).\nA policy framework is supported for Session, Access and Mobility control, QoS and charging enforcement, as well as policy provisioning in the UE.\nThe UE uses two mechanisms linked to QoS and policy:\n-\tThe UE Route Selection Policy (URSP), as to determine if a detected application can be associated with an established PDU Session, can be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU Session, or can trigger the establishment of a new PDU Session.\n-\tThe Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP), to select non-3GPP accesses.\nURSP and ANDSP are delivered from the network's Policy Control Function (PCF) to the UE through signalling.\nIn the network, the NF \"Network Data Analytics Function\" (NWDAF) is introduced to provide data analytics support, i.e. to provide the load of each network slice.\nAs for QoS, the system defines a flow-based QoS framework, with two basic modes: with or without QoS-dedicated signalling. For the option without any specific QoS signalling flows, the standardized packet marking is applied, which informs the QoS enforcement functions what QoS to provide. The option with QoS-dedicated negotiation offers more flexibility and QoS support for finer granularity. Also, a new QoS type is introduced: \"Reflective QoS\", where the UE requests for the uplink traffic the same QoS rules as the ones it received for the downlink. In this mode, symmetric QoS differentiation over downlink and uplink is supported with minimal control plane signalling.\nThe Service Exposure and Enablement Support (SEES) and (enhanced) Flexible Mobile Service Steering ((e)FMSS) features allow the operator to expose network capabilities (e.g. QoS policy) to third party ISPs/ICPs.\nIn 5G, new network capabilities are exposed to the third-party e.g. to allow the third-party to customize a dedicated network slice for diverse use cases; to allow the third-party to manage a trusted third-party application in a Service Hosting Environment to improve user experience, and efficiently utilize backhaul and application resources.\nAbout Network capability exposure, see also the clause on \"Northbound APIs\".\nThe following services are also supported by 5GS:\n-\tShort Message Service (SMS). This is supported by \"SMS over NAS\" (including over non-3GPP access).\n-\tIP-Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and its services, although, this might not be available in all initial 5G deployments. If IMS services are invoked by a UE connected to an IMS-less 5GS, this triggers a network-based handover towards an appropriate RAT and related EPS. This applies also to the support of IMS emergency services.\n-\tMulti-Operator Core Network (MOCN), in which a RAN is shared by multiple core networks.\n-\tPublic Warning System (PWS). This is supported by either using Service-based interfaces between the Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC) Function (CBCF) and the AMF, or using an interworking function between the CBC and the AMF.\n-\tMultimedia Priority Services (MPS). They are supported by MPS-specific exemptions for 5GS mobility management and 5GS session management.\n-\tMission Critical Services (MCS). They are supported by having a subscription in place for both 5G QoS profile and the necessary policies. Some standardized QoS characteristics are defined for MCS.\n-\tPS Data Off. The 5G's \"PS data off\" functionality is backward-compatible and provides Control Plane Load Control, Congestion and Overload control. This includes AMF Load balancing, AMF Load-rebalancing, TNL (Transport Network Layer between 5GC and 5G-AN) Load (re-)balancing, as well as AMF Overload Control, SMF Overload Control.\nIt has to be noted that, in 5GS Phase 1, Location Services are optional and restricted to regulatory (emergency) services.\nSteering of roaming of UEs in a VPLMN allows the HPLMN to provide and update a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations to the UE when roaming in a VPLMN. This is achieved using the configuration in the USIM or providing it via NAS signalling.\nInterworking between the 5GS and 4G is supported, where 4G is an E-UTRAN connected to the EPC. This is enabled by evolved Packet Data Gateways (ePDGs) connected to the EPC and the 5G System.\nSecurity Edge Protection Proxies (SEPP) are used to secure and hide the topology for inter-PLMN interconnection.\n\nSummary based on the inputs provided by China Mobile, Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei in SP-180595.\nThe services provided by 5G NFs are designed as a set of APIs based on the following protocol stack:\n-\tthe transport layer protocol is TCP as specified in IETF RFC 793;\n-\ttransport layer security protection is supported with TLS;\n-\tthe application layer protocol is HTTP/2 as specified in IETF RFC 7540;\n-\tthe serialization protocol is JSON as specified in IETF RFC 8259;\n-\tthe OpenAPI 3.0.0 is adopted as the Interface Definition Language.\nThe figure depicts a service-based interface protocol stack, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It includes the Service Interface Protocol (SIP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and Session Control Protocol (SIP), which are essential for establishing and maintaining communication sessions. The stack also includes the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Session Control Protocol (SIP), and Session Control Protocol (SIP), which are essential for establishing and maintaining communication sessions.\nFigure 5.4.6-1: Service Based Interface Protocol Stack\nTo reduce the coupling between clients and servers, the RESTful framework is applied for the APIs design as follows:\n1)\tthe REST-style service operations implement the Level 2 of the Richardson maturity model;\n2)\tLevel 3 (HATEOAS) of the Richardson maturity model is optional.\nOAuth2 (as specified in IETF RFC 6749) is used for authorization of NF service access, with the NRF acting as the Authorization Server.\nThe Service Based Interfaces also support procedures for overload control and message prioritisation.\nPFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) is used over the N4 interface for the separation of Control Plane and User Plane in the 5GC. This is the same protocol as supported for CUPS in EPC, with a few extensions to support all the 5GC requirements (e.g. Ethernet traffic, QoS flows).\nGTPv2 is used over the N26 interface for mobility between EPC and the 5GC. This is the same protocol as supported over S10 in EPC, with minimal extensions to support 5GS requirements (e.g. 5GS TAI, gNB ID).\nFor 5G network interworking with external DNs (i.e. N6 interface), those protocols specified in TS 29.061 (IP, non-IP, DHCP, RADIUS and Diameter protocols) are still applicable between the SMF/UPF and the external DNs with possible adaptation. In addition, the Ethernet traffic is also supported by the SMF/UPF for interworking with external DN.\nReferences\nThe main protocols of the 5G Core Network are specified in:\nTS 24.501\tNon-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3\nTS 24.502\tAccess to the 5G Core Network (5GCN) via non-3GPP access networks; Stage 3\nTS 24.526\t5G System -Phase 1, UE policy; CT WG1 Aspects\nTS 23.527\t5G System; Restoration Procedures; Stage 2\nTS 29.500\t5G System; Technical Realization of Service Based Architecture; Stage 3\nTS 29.501\t5G System; Principles and Guidelines for Services Definition; Stage 3\nTS 29.502\t5G System; Session Management Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.503\t5G System; Unified Data Management Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.504\t5G System; Unified Data Repository Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.505\t5G System; Usage of the Unified Data Repository services for Subscription Data; Stage 3\nTS 29.507\t5G System; Access and Mobility Policy Control Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.508\t5G System; Session Management Event Exposure Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.509\t5G System; Authentication Server Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.510\t5G System; Network Function Repository Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.511\t5G System; Equipment Identity Register Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.512\t5G System; Session Management Policy Control Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.513\t5G System; Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and QoS parameter mapping; Stage 3\nTS 29.514\t5G System; Policy Authorization Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.518\t5G System; Access and Mobility Management Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.519\t5G System; Usage of the Unified Data Repository Service for Policy Data, Application Data and Structured Data for Exposure; Stage 3\nTS 29.520\t5G System; Network Data Analytics Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.521\t5G System; Binding Support Management Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.522\t5G System; Network Exposure Function Northbound APIs; Stage 3\nTS 29.531\t5G System; Network Slice Selection Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.540\t5G System; SMS Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.551\t5G System; Packet Flow Description Management Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.554\t5G System; Background Data Transfer Policy Control Service; Stage 3\nTS 29.561\t5G System; Interworking between 5G Network and external Data Networks; Stage 3\nTS 29.571\t5G System; Common Data Types for Service Based Interfaces; Stage 3\nTS 29.572\t5G System; Location Management Services; Stage 3\nTS 29.594\t5G System; Spending Limit Control Service; Stage 3\n\nThe corresponding Security aspects of 5G System are defined by SA3 (UID: 750016).

The figure includes the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and distributed nodes, with redundancy paths highlighted for failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network slicing and network function virtualization.\nFigure 5.5.3.1-1: Overall NG-RAN architecture\nThe NG-RAN consists of a set of gNBs connected to the 5GC through the NG interface, based on (and very similar to) the LTE's S1 interface.\nThe gNB (5G Node B) can be connected to another gNB through the Xn interface, based on (and very similar to) the LTE's X2 interface.

The diagram includes the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 5.5.3.3-1: User Plane Protocol Stack\nThe main services and functions of the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer include:\n-\tMapping between logical channels and transport channels;\n-\tMultiplexing/demultiplexing of MAC SDUs belonging to one or different logical channels into/from Transport Blocks (TB) delivered to/from the physical layer on transport channels;\n-\tScheduling information reporting;\n-\tError correction through Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ), one HARQ entity per cell in case of Carrier Aggregation;\n-\tPriority handling between UEs by means of dynamic scheduling;\n-\tPriority handling between logical channels of one UE by means of logical channel prioritisation;\n-\tPadding.\nThe main services and functions of the RLC (Radio Link Control) sublayer depend on the transmission mode and include:\n-\tTransfer of upper layer PDUs;\n-\tSequence numbering independent of the one in PDCP [only for Unacknowledged Mode (UM) and Acknowledged Mode (AM), not for Transparent Mode (TM)];\n-\tError Correction through ARQ (AM only);\n-\tSegmentation (AM and UM) and re-segmentation (AM only) of RLC SDUs;\n-\tReassembly of SDU (AM and UM);\n-\tDuplicate Detection (AM only);\n-\tRLC SDU discard (AM and UM);\n-\tRLC re-establishment;\n-\tProtocol error detection (AM only).\nThe main services and functions of the PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) sublayer for the user plane include:\n-\tSequence Numbering;\n-\tHeader compression and decompression: ROHC only;\n-\tTransfer of user data;\n-\tReordering and duplicate detection;\n-\tPDCP PDU routing (in case of split bearers);\n-\tRetransmission of PDCP SDUs;\n-\tCiphering, deciphering;\n-\tPDCP SDU discard;\n-\tPDCP re-establishment and data recovery for RLC AM;\n-\tDuplication of PDCP PDUs.\nThe main services and functions of the PDCP sublayer for the control plane include:\n-\tSequence Numbering;\n-\tCiphering, deciphering and integrity protection;\n-\tTransfer of control plane data;\n-\tReordering and duplicate detection;\n-\tDuplication of PDCP PDUs.\nThe main services and functions of SDAP (Service Data Adaptation Protocol) include:\n-\tMapping between a QoS flow and a data radio bearer;\n-\tMarking QoS flow ID (QFI) in both DL and UL packets.\nThe main services and functions of the RRC (Radio Resource Control) sublayer include:\n-\tBroadcast of System Information related to AS and NAS;\n-\tPaging initiated by 5GC or NG-RAN\n-\tEstablishment, maintenance and release of an RRC connection between the UE and NG-RAN including:\n-\tAddition, modification and release of carrier aggregation;\n-\tAddition, modification and release of Dual Connectivity in NR or between E-UTRA and NR.\n-\tSecurity functions including key management;\n-\tEstablishment, configuration, maintenance and release of Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs) and Data Radio Bearers (DRBs);\n-\tMobility functions including:\n-\tHandover and context transfer;\n-\tUE cell selection and reselection and control of cell selection and reselection;\n-\tInter-RAT mobility.\n-\tQoS management functions;\n-\tUE measurement reporting and control of the reporting;\n-\tDetection of and recovery from radio link failure;\n-\tNAS message transfer to/from NAS from/to UE.\nThe different AN interfaces are depicted above. These are Xn, NG and F1.\nEach interface includes its own management handling: setup, reset, error indication, removal (for Xn only).\nThe other functions transiting on each interface are detailed below.\nThe 5G's Xn interface is strongly related to its equivalent 4G interface, the X2 interface. The X2 is updated to include the following added functions:\n-\tThe E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity function. This function allows the eNB to request another en-gNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that UE.\n-\tSecondary RAT Data Usage Report function. This function allows eNB to get the uplink and downlink data volumes for the Secondary RAT on a per E-RAB basis.\nThe XnAP protocol provides the following functions:\n-\tXn configuration data update function. This function allows two NG-RAN nodes to update application level data at any time.\n-\tHandover preparation function. This function allows the exchange of information between source and target NG-RAN nodes in order to initiate the handover of a certain UE to the target.\n-\tHandover cancellation function. This function allows informing an already prepared target NG-RAN node that a prepared handover will not take place. It allows releasing the resources allocated during a preparation.\n-\tRetrieve UE Context function. The Retrieve UE context function is used for a NG-RAN node to retrieve UE context from another one.\n-\tRAN Paging function. The RAN paging function allows a NG-RAN node to initiate the paging for a UE in the inactive state.\n-\tData Forwarding control function. The data forwarding control function allows establishing and releasing transport bearers between source and target NG-RAN nodes for data forwarding.\n-\tEnergy saving function. This function enables decreasing energy consumption by indication of cell activation/deactivation over the Xn interface.\nThe 5G's NG interface is strongly related to its equivalent 4G interface, the S1 interface. The S1 is updated to include the following added function: the Report of Secondary RAT data volumes function. The functionality enables the eNB to report Secondary RAT data usage information in case of EN-DC.\nThe NGAP protocol provides the following functions:\n-\tPaging function. The paging function supports the sending of paging requests to the NG-RAN nodes involved in the paging area e.g. the NG-RAN nodes of the TA(s) the UE is registered.\n-\tUE Context Management function. The UE Context management function allows the AMF to establish, modify or release a UE Context in the AMF and the NG-RAN node e.g. to support user individual signalling on NG.\n-\tMobility Management function. The mobility function for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED includes the intra-system handover function to support mobility within NG-RAN and inter-system handover function to support mobility from/to EPS system. It comprises the preparation, execution and completion of handover via the NG interface.\n-\tPDU Session Management function. The PDU Session function is responsible for establishing, modifying and releasing the involved PDU sessions NG-RAN resources for user data transport once a UE context is available in the NG-RAN node.\n-\tNAS Transport function. The NAS Signalling Transport function provides means to transport or reroute a NAS message (e.g. for NAS mobility management) for a specific UE over the NG interface.\n-\tNAS Node Selection function. The interconnection of NG-RAN nodes to multiple AMFs is supported in the 5GS architecture. Therefore, a NAS node selection function is located in the NG-RAN node to determine the AMF association of the UE, based on the UE's temporary identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the AMF. When the UE's temporary identifier has not been yet assigned or is no longer valid the NG-RAN node may instead take into account slicing information to determine the AMF. This functionality is located in the NG-RAN node and enables proper routing via the NG interface. On NG, no specific procedure corresponds to the NAS Node Selection Function.\n-\tWarning Message Transmission function. The warning message transmission function provides means to transfer warning messages via NG interface or cancel ongoing broadcast of warning messages. It also provides the capability for the NG-RAN to inform the AMF that ongoing PWS operation has failed for one or more areas, or that one or more areas may be reloaded by the CBC.\n-\tConfiguration Transfer function. The Configuration Transfer function is a generic mechanism that allows the request and transfer of RAN configuration information (e.g. SON information) between two RAN nodes via the core network.\n-\tTrace function. Trace function provides means to control trace sessions in the NG-RAN node.\n-\tAMF Management function. The AMF management function supports AMF planned removal and AMF auto-recovery.\n-\tMultiple TNL Associations Support Function. When there are multiple TNL associations between a NG-RAN node and an AMF, the NG-RAN node selects the TNL association for NGAP signalling based on the usage and the weight factor of each TNL association received from the AMF, and uses the TNL association. If an AMF releases a TNL association, the NG-RAN node selects a new one\n-\tAMF Load Balancing function. The NG interface supports the indication by the AMF of its relative capacity to the NG-RAN node in order to achieve load-balanced AMFs within the pool area.\n-\tLocation Reporting function. This function enables the AMF to request the NG-RAN node to report the UE's current location, or the UE's last known location with timestamp, or the UE's presence in a configured area of interest.\n-\tAMF Re-allocation function. This function allows to redirect an initial connection request issued by an NG-RAN node from an initial AMF towards a target AMF selected by 5GC. In this case the NG-RAN node initiates an Initial UE Message procedure over one NG interface instance and receives the first downlink message to close the UE-associated logical connection over a different NG interface instance.\nThe F1 interface is specified for the case where the en-gNB is further subdivided into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU logical nodes. In this case, the gNB-CU hosts the RRC and PDCP protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the RLC, MAC and PHY functions.\nThe F1AP protocol provides the following functions:\n-\tSystem Information management function;\n-\tF1 UE context management function;\n-\tRRC message transfer function;\n-\tPaging function.\n",

                            "text_content": "Similar to LTE, OFDM with Cyclic Prefix (CP) is used as the downlink (DL) waveform for NR. In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\nTable 5.5.4.1-1: NR channel bandwidth\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nThe figure depicts the frame structure in NR, which is a crucial component of the network's data transmission. It illustrates the different types of frames, such as the frame structure 1-1, which is used for data transmission. The figure also shows the frame structure 1-2, which is used for data transmission in the presence of noise. The frame structure 1-3 is used for data transmission in the presence of interference. The figure is important for understanding the network's data transmission process and for designing and implementing NR-based networks.\nFigure 5.5.4.1-1: Frame structure in NR\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\nTable 5.5.4.1-2: Multiple numerologies in NR\nNote: \tAdditional specific numerologies are defined for PRACH, as described in Section 5.5.4.3.\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as ‘downlink’, ‘uplink’ or ‘flexible’ (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.\nTable 5.5.4.2-1 shows the physical channels defined in NR and the corresponding modulation and channel coding schemes.\nTable 5.5.4.2-1: Physical channels in NR\n*: see Section 5.5.4.3.\n**: DFT-s-OFDM is used to further reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the UL transmission\nThe way these different channels are accessed and used is presented in the following sections.\nThe different physical signals defined in NR are:\nTable 5.5.4.2-2: Physical signals in NR\nThe way these different Reference Signals are used is also presented below.\nThe mobile phones synchronise to the mobile network by \"listening\" to the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), shown in respectively blue and orange on the figure below (note that the figure shows an \"NR-\" prefix which is omitted in the text). The vertical separations are the Ressource Blocks (RB), as defined in the previous section, i.e. a group of 12 subcarriers. The horizontal separations are the OFDM symbols. Four OFDM symbols together with 20 RBs form a so-called \"SS/PBCH (Synchronization Signals/ Physical Broadcast Channel) block\".\nThe figure depicts a SS/PBCH block, which is a crucial component in a 5G network. It illustrates the structure of the signal processing unit, including the signal source, signal processing, and the output. The figure is a visual representation of the complex network architecture, highlighting the importance of signal processing in 5G networks.\nFigure 5.5.4.3-1: a SS/PBCH block\nThe PSS and NSS are transmitted over 127 subcarriers, i.e. about 10.5 RBs. (They are designed to carry the Physical Cell ID (PCID) selected from 1008 candidates.)\nOnce synchronised with the PSS and NSS, the mobiles can retrieve the full SS/PBCH structure, and thus \"listen\" to the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) and its associated Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS).\nThe PBCH carries only the minimum system information necessary for initial access, such as system frame number (SFN), initial configurations for PDCCH, PDSCH and DM-RS, and information required to determine the frame timing such as SS/PBCH block index and half-frame index. These are referred to as \"System Information Block 1 (SIB1)\".\nOne or multiple SS/PBCH blocks can be transmitted by using transmission beamforming within a half frame, with configurable periodicity from 5 ms to 160 ms. The maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks and the applicable subcarrier spacing for SS/PBCH block transmission are dependent on the frequency range, as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-1. They can be identical or different from the subcarrier spacing used for other DL transmissions.\nTable 5.5.4.3-1: Maximum number of SS/PBCH block transmissions and applicable subcarrier spacing\n\nSIB1 and other system information (SIB2 and onwards) are carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. SIB1 contains necessary information to perform random access procedure for initial access.\nNote: \tPDCCH/PDSCH for SIB1 can be received by the UE before RRC connection since they are based on default configuration (predefined and based on MIB).\nPaging message is carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. Numerology used for SIB1 transmission on a NR cell is indicated in master information block (MIB) carried by PBCH and is commonly applied to transmissions for other system information (SIB2 and onwards), Paging, Msg.2 (\"Message 2\", as explained below) and Msg.4 transmissions on the same cell.\nFor random access in NR, a four-step procedure consisting of Msg.1, Msg.2, Msg.3 and Msg.4 is defined. For Msg.1 i.e., PRACH transmission in random access, NR supports two types of PRACH sequences as the preamble sequence:\n-\tone is based on long Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences of length 839 only applicable to FR1 and\n-\tanother is based on short ZC sequences of length 139 applicable to both FR1 and FR2.\nFour different PRACH preamble formats based on the long ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-2.\nIn addition, nine different PRACH preamble formats based on the short ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-3.\nMsg.2 and Msg.4 for random access are carried by PDSCH that are scheduled by PDCCH.\nMsg.3 for random access is carried by PUSCH which is scheduled by random access response (RAR) in Msg.2 or PDCCH in case of retransmission.\nTable 5.5.4.3-2: PRACH preamble formats based on long ZC sequence\nTable 5.5.4.3-3: PRACH preamble formats based on short ZC sequence\n\nFor mobility measurement, SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized in NR. SS/PBCH block based reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ) and signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) are defined, and CSI-RS based RSRP, RSRQ and SINR are also defined. For radio link monitoring (RLM), SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized as RLM reference signal in NR. One or multiple SS/PBCH blocks and/or CSI-RS resources are configured to be monitored to evaluate whether the radio link is in-sync status (i.e., in good quality) or out-of-sync status.\nMultiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology to improve the throughput. It uses multiple antenna both on the transmitter and on the receiver sides, as to enable multi-layer data transmission. NR supports multi-layer data transmission for a single UE (single-user MIMO) with a maximum of eight transmission layers for DL and four for UL. NR also supports multi-layer data transmission with multiple UEs on different layers (multi-user MIMO) with a maximum of twelve transmission layers for DL and UL transmission.\nReference Signals (RSs) are specified assuming multi-layer transmissions. For demodulation of date / control information for both uplink and downlink, demodulation RS (DM-RS) is supported. For measurement of channel state information of downlink, channel state information RS (CSI-RS) is supported. CSI-RS is also used for mobility measurement, measurement of gNB transmission beamforming, and frequency/time tracking. The CSI- RS used for the frequency/time tracking is named as tracking RS (TRS). In high frequency range, phase noise is a problem that degrades the transmission performance. Phase tracking reference signal (PT-RS) is supported for PDSCH and PUSCH to enable receiver to track the phase and mitigate the performance loss due to the phase noise. For uplink channel sounding, sounding RS (SRS) is supported.\nFor UL multi-layer data transmission, both codebook based and non-codebook based precoding is supported. In codebook based UL transmission, precoding matrix applied for PUSCH transmission is selected by gNB. In non-codebook based UL transmission, precoded multiple SRS are transmitted and then gNB selects the desired transmission layers for PUSCH based on the reception of the SRS.\nSince NR supports multi beam operation where every signal/channel is transmitted on directional beam, beamforming is an important technique for achieving higher throughput and sufficient coverage especially in high frequency range. For DL transmission beamforming, a gNB applies transmission beamforming to SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS transmissions, and a UE measures reference signal received power on physical layer (L1-RSRP) on the configured SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS resource. The UE reports the SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS resource with the maximum L1-RSRP value as a L1-RSRP beam reporting. The gNB can decide gNB transmission beamforming for the UE based on the reported L1-RSRP. For PDCCH/PDSCH transmission, gNB informs UE that gNB transmission beamforming applied to a certain SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS resource is applied to the PDCCH/PDSCH transmission so that UE can apply a reception beamforming which fits into the gNB transmission beamforming. For UL transmission beamforming, two mechanisms are supported. In one of the mechanisms, UE transmits multiple SRS symbols with different UE transmission beamforming so that gNB can measure them and can identify the best UE transmission beamforming. In another mechanism, UE generates the UL transmission beamforming which is same as the DL reception beamforming used for SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS resource reception. In addition, beam failure recovery (BFR) is supported to achieve quick recovery from the beam failure. UE can identify the beam failure and informs gNB about the index of SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS resource as new candidate beam.\nFor DL channel state information (CSI) acquisition, NR supports two precoding matrix indicator (PMI) definitions, the type I and II codebooks providing different levels of CSI granularity.\nPDCCH is used to carry Downlink Control Information (DCI), and following types of DCI are supported in NR.\n-\tPDSCH assignments to convey TB(s) to a certain UE, including time/frequency-domain resource information\n-\tPUSCH grants for a certain UE to transmit a TB, including time/frequency-domain resource information\n-\tSlot format indication, where how each of symbols within a slot is indicated\n-\tPre-emption indication, which is used to inform UEs that there is no DL transmissions on the informed time/frequency-domain resources\n-\tUL transmit power control (TPC)\nEach device monitors a number of PDCCHs, typically once per slot although it is possible to configure more frequent monitoring to support traffic requiring very low latency. Upon detection of a valid PDCCH, the device follows downlink control information contained in the PDCCH, e.g., the scheduling decision so that the device receives PDSCH (or transmits PUSCH) accordingly.\nThe PDCCHs are transmitted in one or more control resource sets (CORESETs). A CORESET spans overone, two or three OFDM symbol(s) in time domain and over a configurable bandwidth in the frequency domain. This is needed in order to handle devices with different bandwidth capabilities and also beneficial from a forward-compatibility perspective. One control channel element (CCE) is defined as 6 resource element groups (REGs), where 1 REG is composed of 12 resource elements (REs). In a CORESET, a PDCCH with DM-RS can be mapped on one or more CCEs as shown in Figure 5.5.4.5-1. Different number of CCEs (aggregation level) provides different coding rate for the control channels.\nThere are different formats for DCI transmitted on a PDCCH as shown in Table 5.5.4.5-1. A UE monitors one or more PDCCH candidates for DCI with CRC scrambled by a certain RNTI in PDCCH common search space (CSS) set and/or UE-specific search space (USS) set. DCI format is distinguished by the PDCCH payload size and the RNTI scrambling the CRC.\nThe figure depicts a general description of NR PDCCH, which stands for Non-Line-of-Sight Channel. It illustrates the channel characteristics and parameters used in NR (New Radio) systems, such as the number of channels, the number of users, and the number of antennas. The figure provides a visual representation of the channel model, allowing for a better understanding of the system's performance and design.\nFigure 5.5.4.5-1: General description of NR PDCCH\nTable 5.5.4.5-1: NR DCI formats\n\nPDSCH is used to transmit one or two transport blocks (TBs). A DCI in a PDCCH can assign a PDSCH transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PDSCH is decoded based on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-domain resource, modulation, and layer. PDSCH transmissions are processed with durations from 2 to 14 symbols. The number of layers for PDSCH transmissions is 8. HARQ feedback/retransmission is supported for PDSCH transmissions as mentioned in Section 5.5.4.7.\nPUCCH is used to carry Uplink Control Information (UCI), and following types of UCI are supported in NR:\nHybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK): information to report whether the DL transmission of a TB is successful or not\nScheduling request (SR): signal to request UL grant to gNB\nChannel state information (CSI): information represents channel condition between gNB and UE\nThe UCI can be carried by PUCCH or PUSCH. The channel coding schemes for different UCI sizes are shown in Table 5.5.4.2-2.\nTable 5.5.4.6-1: Channel coding for uplink control information (UCI)\n\nFor HARQ-ACK feedback of PDSCH with corresponding DCI, PUCCH resource set(s) containing one or more PUCCH resources are configured. One PUCCH resource is determined based on the UCI payload size and the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DL assignment. For HARQ-ACK feedback of PDSCH without corresponding DCI, SR, and CSI report, a PUCCH resource is configured for each. When multiple PUCCHs are overlapped fully or partially in time, the UCIs are multiplexed in a PUCCH. When a PUCCH is overlapped with a PUSCH fully or partially in time, the UCI is multiplexed (i.e. piggybacked) on the PUSCH.\nEach PUCCH resource is configured with a PUCCH format. Various PUCCH formats are specified as in Figure 5.5.4.6-1. Each PUCCH format supports either durations of 1 to 2 symbols, or durations of 4 to 14 symbols. PUCCH formats 0/2 are called as short-PUCCH, which can deliver UCI by 1 or 2 symbols. PUCCH formats 0/2 are beneficial to reduce latency. PUCCH formats 1/3/4 are called as long-PUCCH, which can deliver UCI with any of 4 to 14 symbols. PUCCH formats 1/3/4 are adopted to improve coverage. The frequency/time-domain resources for PUCCH transmissions in NR are flexibly configurable. In PUCCH format 0/1/4, multiple PUCCH resources can be CDMed on the same time/frequency resource. A short-PUCCH can be TDMed with a long-PUCCH or a short PUCCH within a slot.\nThe figure depicts various NR P U CCH (Physical User Channel) formats used in 5G networks, including 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. These formats are essential for efficient communication and data transmission in 5G networks.\nFigure 5.5.4.6-1: NR PUCCH formats\nPUSCH is used to transmit one TB. A DCI in a PDCCH can schedule a PUSCH transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PUSCH is transmitted based on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-domain resource including frequency-hopping, modulation, and layer. The number of layers for PDSCH transmissions is 4. HARQ retransmission is supported for PUSCH transmissions as mentioned in Section 5.5.4.7.\nDCI formats 0_0/0_1 and 1_0/1_1 schedule PUSCH and PDSCH, respectively. For each DCI format, frequency-domain and time-domain resource allocation fields are included. For frequency-domain resource allocation, resource block group (RBG)-level bit-map resource allocation (resource allocation Type 0) and contiguous resource allocation (resource allocation Type1) are supported. A UE can be configured with either or both of them. For time-domain resource allocation, the time-domain resource allocation field in the DCI jointly indicates scheduled slot, starting symbol, and the duration (number of consecutive symbols to use for the channel).\nFor PUSCH and PDSCH, other than DCI-based scheduling, configured grant for PUSCH and semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for PDSCH are supported. For configured grant PUSCH, once PUSCH resource is configured and activated, the UE can transmit a PUSCH without DCI format 0_0/0_1. There are two types of configured grant PUSCH; with the configured grant Type1, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant resource once RRC configuration is available, while with the configured grant Type2, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant resource after a DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI activates the configured grant resource. SPS for PDSCH also requires activation DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI.\nFor NR, only asynchronous and adaptive HARQ is supported for both PDSCH and PUSCH. A PDSCH or PUSCH can be re-transmitted at any timing and with any transmission configuration. For re-transmission of a PDSCH or PUSCH, DCI formats 0_0/0_1 or 1_0/1_1 is used. HARQ process number and redundancy version are indicated in the DCI scheduling the re-transmission. Initial transmission/retransmission of a TB and soft-buffer store/flush are controlled per HARQ process number. Redundancy version is used to control redundancy of channel coded bits.\nUE reports HARQ-ACK feedback for a decoded PDSCH. UE can be configured with reporting one HARQ-ACK bit for each transport block (TB), while if a UE is configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the UE reports one HARQ-ACK bit for each code block group (CBG). A CBG is a group of code-blocks consisting of a TB, where channel coding is applied for each code block. If a UE is configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the DCI scheduling PDSCH includes CBG transmission information (CBGTI) field which indicates which CBG(s) is/are re-transmitted, and the DCI can also include CBG flushing out information (CBGFI) field, which indicates the CBGs being retransmitted can be combined with the earlier received instances of the same CBGs. For PUSCH, CBG-based transmission using CBGTI is also supported.\nFor reporting multiple HARQ-ACK bits at one time, two types of HARQ-ACK codebook construction are supported; Type 1 HARQ-ACK codebook constructs the codebook based on semi-static configuration only, where HARQ-ACK bits corresponding to all of the possible PDSCHs based on the configuration are contained. Type 2 HARQ-ACK codebook constructs the codebook based on both semi-static configuration and DCI field named downlink assignment index (DAI), where HARQ-ACK bits corresponding to PDSCHs assumed to be assigned are contained.\nIn NR, the maximum bandwidth of a NR carrier is 100MHz for FR1 and 400MHz for FR2, respectively. In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation (CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved. In addition, BWP adaptation based on switching between BWPs having different bandwidths and/or numerologies is supported.\nFor EN-DC operation, simultaneous UL transmissions across LTE and NR are supported. However, for some band combinations, e.g., band combinations where simultaneous UL transmissions are difficult due to inter-modulation issue, an operation based on single UL transmission i.e., either LTE or NR UL transmission at a time is supported.\nNR is designed to support flexible operation taking co-existence with legacy RAT especially LTE into account. Since some NR frequency bands in FR1 have been used for LTE carriers, mechanisms for NR-LTE coexistence, e.g., NR DL/UL transmission within the bandwidth of an LTE carrier without impact on the legacy LTE devices, are supported. For the design of NR-LTE coexistence mechanisms, following two scenarios are considered.\nFor both DL and UL, NR carrier and LTE carrier coexist in the same bandwidth\nOnly for UL, NR carrier and LTE carrier coexist in the same bandwidth\nTo achieve NR-LTE coexistence in the same bandwidth, higher-layer signalling is supported in NR to configure reserved resources to be used by LTE.  It enables not only the coexistence between NR and normal LTE but also the coexistence between NR and LTE for machine type communication (MTC) and/or narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT).\nIn NR, DL and UL subcarrier positions are aligned while they are different in LTE. For the coexistence between NR UL and LTE UL in the same bandwidth, it is possible to configure a 7.5 kHz shift for NR UL subcarrier positions so that LTE and NR UL subcarriers are aligned to avoid interference due to non-orthogonal subcarriers between NR and LTE.\nSimilar as within LTE the concept of supplementary downlink (SDL) is supported wherein a carrier is pure DL carrier without any associated UL carrier. An SDL carrier can be aggregated with CA together with another DL and UL carrier.\nThe UE can be configured with 2 ULs as normal uplink and supplementary uplink (SUL) for one DL of the same cell. Uplink transmissions on those two ULs are controlled by the network to avoid overlapping PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions in time. Overlapping transmissions on PUSCH are avoided through scheduling while overlapping transmissions on PUCCH are avoided through configuration (PUCCH can only be configured for only one of the 2 ULs of the cell). In addition, initial access is supported in each of the uplink, i.e., random access can be performed on either normal uplink or SUL.\nNR UL transmit power control (TPC) is designed to allow dynamic power adjustment for PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, and PRACH. The UE calculates the path loss value based on the RSRP then determines UL transmission power based on several parameters configured by gNB. The reference signal for path loss calculation can be SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS. For PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission, multiple parameter sets can be configured and multiple power control adjustment states can be managed for beam switching purpose. For PRACH, only one parameter set is configured. A parameter set consists of target received power and path loss coefficient. The UE can be configured the linkage between an SRS resource and several parameters about reference signal for path loss calculation, a power control parameter set, and a power control adjustment state. When the linkage is configured, the UE determines UL TPC parameters according to an SRS resource index indicated by DCI. In addition, for FR1 LTE-NR dual connectivity including both EN-DC and NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity (NE-DC), power sharing mechanism between RATs was introduced. When UE supports dynamic power sharing, power allocation for NR is dynamically adjusted on condition that the total transmission power never exceeds allowed value. Dynamic power sharing mechanism is shown in Figure 5.5.4.12-1. When UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the total power is semi-statically split for the two RATs by gNB configuration in order not to exceed the total transmission power, otherwise the UE does not expect to transmit in a slot on the NR when a corresponding subframe on the LTE is an UL subframe.\nThe figure depicts a dynamic power sharing mechanism between LTE and NR (New Radio) in a 5G network. It illustrates the distribution of power between the two technologies, highlighting the importance of efficient power management in ensuring network reliability and performance.\nFigure 5.5.4.12-1: Dynamic power sharing between LTE and NR\n",

                            "text_content": "While the physical and higher layers are designed as frequency agnostic, two separate radio performance requirements are specified for two frequency ranges (FRs), namely FR1 and FR2. FR1 is below the 7 GHz range (450 - 7125 MHz) and FR2 is millimetres-wave range (24250 - 52600 MHz).\nThe RF and RRM requirements are defined for each FR. One big difference between the requirements in FR1 and FR2 is testing methodology. Both so-called \"conducted\" and \"over-the-air (OTA)\" methodologies can be utilized in FR1, but only OTA methodology can be utilized in FR2. \"Conducted\" is a passive method, useable when antenna connectors are still accessible, whereas \"OTA\" is the be used when the antenna connectors are not accessible, such as in a massive MIMO context.\nFour types of bands are specified for NR (note that all the NR bands are defined with a prefix \"n\" to distinguish them from the bands for the other RATs):\n1)\tLTE \"refarming\" band: The bands have the corresponding LTE bands. For example, NR band n7 corresponds to LTE band 7. Hence, the bands would be likely to be used by \"refarming\" (i.e. re-using) the exiting LTE bands.\n2)\tNR new bands in FR1: Completely new frequency bands for NR in FR1 whose corresponding LTE bands do not exist.\n3)\tNR new bands in FR2: new frequency band for NR in FR2.\n4)\tSupplemental uplink (SUL) / downlink (SDL) band: these bands have only uplink/downlink frequency, and they can be deployed with other type of NR bands.\nNOTE:\tThe ranges {65 - 256} and {257 - 512} are reserved as band number for NR new bands in FR1 and FR2, respectively. A band number will be assigned to a new frequency range on a \"first come first served\" basis from the reserved frequency range. During Release 15 definition time frame, 3 bands in FR1 and 4 bands in FR2 were defined as NR new bands considering the spectrum allocation plan in each region/country as shown in figure 5.5.5-1. In addition, some LTE bands were defined as LTE refarming band, and uplink frequencies of some LTE bands were defined as SUL/SDL band. All NR bands specified in this WI are summarized in Table 5.5.5-1. Especially for above new NR bands which have wider bandwidth than LTE, wider channel bandwidths, i.e. 100MHz in FR1 and 400MHz in FR2 at maximum, were defined to improve the spectrum efficiency and reduce the number of component carriers in case of NR CA operation. In addition, the RF requirements for NR bands and band combinations of NR CA were developed based on the market demands.\nThe figure depicts the new NR bands in the 5th and 15th bands of the Rel.15 NR standard, which are essential for enhancing the quality of service in the 5G network. The bands are highlighted in red, indicating their importance in the network's performance.\nFigure 5.5.5-1: New NR bands in FR1 and FR2 in Rel.15 NR\nTable 5.5.5-1: NR bands specified in the Rel-15 time frame\n\n",

                            "text_content": "In addition of being connectable to the 5G Core Network, the 5G Access Network has been designed so that it can connect also to a 4G (LTE) Core Network, as seen earlier in the NSA-SA presentation.\nWhile section 5.4 focusses on the 5G CN with 5G AN (the SA solution), this section deals with the 5G AN connected to the 4G CN (the NSA solution).\nAlthough limited, the impacts on 4G CN to make it support a 5G AN are not null. These have been studied and covered in the EDCE5 work item, \"EPC enhancements to support 5G New Radio via Dual Connectivity\".\nThe NSA is described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 37.340 on \" NR; Multi-connectivity; Overall description; Stage-2\".\nSince the 5G AN is deployed in addition to the (already-deployed) LTE system, both 4G and 5G connectivity are available, so NSA is also referred to as \"EN-DC\", standing for \"4G and 5G Dual Connectivity\" (more precisely: \"E\" for 4G (from eNB, the 4G AN node), \"N\" for 5G (from NR, the 5G radio) and \"DC\" for Dual Connectivity).\nNSA is also referred to as \"Architecture option 3\" for \"historical reasons\": this was the 3rd option when a longer list of different options were discussed for 5G architecture.\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Vodafone in SP-190217.\nThis section describes the System aspects of the Non-StandAlone option that uses Dual Connectivity with the Evolved Packet Core. The architecture and radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.\n\nThe figure depicts the NSA architecture, which is a key component of the 5G network. It illustrates the various layers and components involved in the network, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability.\nFigure 5.6.1.2-1: The NSA Architecture\nThe eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA Access Network.\nFor example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the \"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G \"robust coverage layer\" aspect.\nThe following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.\nThe figure depicts a split bearer in use for one EPS bearer of one UE, which is a key component of the MCG architecture. MCG stands for Multi-Cell Giga-RAN, a technology designed to support high-capacity, low-latency communication in 5G networks. The split bearer allows for the efficient use of resources by splitting the EPS bearer into two separate paths, one for each UE. This design choice is crucial for achieving high data rates and low latency in 5G networks.\nFigure 5.6.1.2-2: MCG split bearer in use for one EPS bearer of one UE (aka \" architecture option 3\")\nThe figure depicts a split bearer SCG (Single Carrier Giga-BPS) in use for one EPS (Enhanced Power Saving) bearer of one UE (User Equipment). This architecture option is designed to provide enhanced power efficiency and reduce the number of EPS bearers required, which can be beneficial in reducing the overall power consumption and cost of the network. The figure shows the split bearer SCG in use, with the EPS bearer being split into two separate paths, one for each carrier. This design allows for better power management and reduces the number of bearers required, which can lead to improved network performance and reduced energy consumption.\nFigure 5.6.1.2-3: SCG split bearer in use for one EPS bearer of one UE (aka \"architecture option 3x\")\nNote that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15 EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.\nSeveral features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC for use with NR:\nSupport is provided for the HSS or the MME to instruct the RAN to not give access to \"NR as a secondary RAT\" for that UE.\nUE core network capability signalling allows the MME (via its DNS) to select the SGW and PGWs that are appropriate for the UE’s high data rate. Additional signalling allows the SGW-C and PGW-C to take the UE’s NR capability into account when selecting the SGW-U and PGW-U.\nStorage of very large UE Radio Access Capability Information Elements in the MME is specified (and associated RAN requirements).\nHigher AMBR (maximum bit rate) values were specified and a new QCI 80 added for e.g. low latency Mobile BroadBand, Two other new QCIs (82, 83) were added for low latency GBR services in which the Packet Error Loss Rate calculation includes those packets that are not delivered within the Packet Delay Budget.\nThe amount of data sent on the Secondary NR RAT can be counted by the RAN and sent to the EPC for inclusion in the SGW CDRs and, optionally, in the PGW-CDRs\nWithin SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.\nSummary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO on the Radio interface.\nIn EN-DC, the UE has a single RRC state, based on the Master Node (MN) RRC and a single Control plane (C-plane) connection towards the Core Network. Figure 5.6.1.3.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for EN-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE. RRC PDUs generated by the Secondary Node (SN) can be transported via the MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via the Master Cell Group (MCG) Signalling Radio Bearers (SRB), a.k.a. SRB1, but subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via the MN or the SN. When transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration provided by the SN.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with two main components: the Master eNodeB (MeNB) and the secondary gNodeB (SgNB). The MeNB is responsible for managing the network's resources and coordinating the communication between the eNodeBs (SgNBs). The SgNBs, on the other hand, are responsible for the actual communication between the eNodeBs and the users. The figure also includes key components such as the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, which are essential for the network's functionality and reliability.\nMeNB= Master eNodeB; SgNB = secondary gNode B\nFigure 5.6.1.3.1-1: Control plane architecture for EN-DC (NSA architecture)\nIn EN-DC, from a UE perspective, three bearer types exist: MCG bearer, Secondary Cell Group (SCG) bearer and split bearer. These three bearer types are depicted in Figure 5.6.1.3.2-1. For EN-DC, the network can configure either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP for MCG bearers while NR PDCP is always used for SCG and split bearers.\nThe figure depicts the radio protocol architecture for MCG, SCG, and split bearers from a UE perspective in EN-DC. It illustrates the various layers and components involved in the radio communication process, including the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and the radio frequency (RF) signal. The figure highlights the use of frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques to ensure efficient communication. The diagram also shows the use of frequency hopping and frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) techniques to improve the signal quality and reliability.\nFigure 5.6.1.3.2-1: Radio Protocol Architecture for MCG, SCG and split bearers from a UE perspective in EN-DC\n",

However, here, the term \"eNB\" is used for both cases unless there is a specific need to disambiguate between eNB and ng-eNB.\nThe LTE connectivity to 5G-CN feature includes the following key functionalities:\n-\t5G NAS message transport\n-\t5G security framework, except that data integrity protection is not supported;\n-\tUnified Access Control\n-\tFlow-based QoS\n-\tNetwork slicing\n-\tSDAP\n-\tNR PDCP\n-\tSupport of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state.\nGenerally, the above functionalities are introduced based on similar functionalities as in NR.\nFor the user plane, the protocol stack is shown in Figure 5.6.2-1, where SDAP and NR PDCP sublayers perform the functions listed in TS 38.300, and RLC and MAC sublayers perform the functions listed in TS 36.300.\nThe figure depicts the User Plane Protocol Stack (UPPS) in a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interactions. The diagram includes the User Plane (UP) and the Physical Layer (PHY) protocols, as well as the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network. The UPPS is crucial for managing the flow of data and ensuring efficient communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 5.6.2-1: User Plane Protocol Stack\nFor the control plane, the protocol stack is shown in Figure 5.6.2-2.\nThe figure depicts the control plane protocol stack in a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interactions. Key elements include the control plane, network slicing, and network slicing management.

                            "text_content": "\nSummary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO in SP-180861.\nThis work item defines the security aspects of the 5G system. The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\nNon-Standalone NR Security\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\nEvolution of the trust model\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\nThe figure depicts a trust model for non-roaming scenarios in a 5G network, illustrating the various levels of trust required for different types of users. The model includes the following components:\n\n1. **User-to-Network Trust**: This trust level is based on the user's previous interactions with the network, such as the number of successful authentication attempts.\n\n2. **Network-to-Network Trust**: This trust level is based on the network's reputation, such as the number of successful authentication attempts.\n\n3. **Device-to-Network Trust**: This trust level is based on the device's previous interactions with the network, such as the number of successful authentication attempts.\n\n4. **Device-to-Device Trust**: This trust level is based on the device's previous interactions with the network, such as the number of successful authentication attempts.\n\n5. **Device-to-Device Trust**: This trust level is based on the device's previous interactions with the network, such as the number of successful authentication attempts.\n\n6. **Device-to-Network Trust**: This trust level is based on the device's previous interactions with the network, such as the number of successful authentication attempts\nFigure 5.6.3-1: Trust model of non-roaming scenario\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\nThe figure depicts a trust model of roaming scenario, illustrating the various levels of trust required for a mobile user to access a network. The model includes the following levels:\n\n1. **Level 1**: The user is fully trusted, and the network is fully trusted.\n2. **Level 2**: The user is partially trusted, and the network is partially trusted.\n3. **Level 3**: The user is not fully trusted, and the network is not fully trusted.\n4. **Level 4**: The user is not fully trusted, and the network is not fully trusted.\n\nThe figure also includes a visual representation of the trust levels, with different colors and symbols representing the different levels of trust. This helps to clearly communicate the trust model and its implications for network management and security.\nFigure 5.6.3-2: Trust model of roaming scenario\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\nThe figure depicts the security enhancements in 5G Phase 1, highlighting the use of encryption, authentication, and access control measures to protect the network from potential threats.\nFigure 5.6.3-3: 5G Phase 1 security enhancements\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\nReferences\n[1]\tTS 33.501, \"Security architecture and procedures for 5G system\".\n\n",

The solutions that have been specified include:\n-\tSemi-static CFI configuration\n-\tPDSCH repetition\n-\tUL SPS repetition\n-\tPDCP packet duplication\n-\tGranular time reference provision.\nThese solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as existing LTE latency reduction techniques.\nAn overview of the specified solutions is provided in the following.\nSemi-static CFI\nControl Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.\nPDSCH repetition\nTo improve the reliability of the DL data channel, PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) repetition can be configured to a UE for a given TTI length. If configured, the PDSCH DCI format 1A or 7-1x monitored by the UE on the user specific search space indicates K consecutive PDSCH transmissions with the same Resource Block (RB) allocation, Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and HARQ process, where K takes a value in {1, 2, 3, 4 or 6}. Thus, the number of PDSCH transmissions for a given transport block is changed dynamically as shown in the figure below. The HARQ-ACK feedback for the transport block is sent only once with the timing given by the Kth PDSCH transmission. Only the Redundancy Version (RV) can be different within the window of K transmissions, if configured accordingly. A maximum rank of 2 is supported with slot/subslot PDSCH repetition and DMRS sharing cannot be used with subslot PDSCH repetition.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a DCI (Digital Circuit Interconnect) and PDSCH (Passive Optical Short-Channel) network, highlighting the key components such as the DCI, PDSCH, and optical line terminals (OLTs). The figure illustrates the layered architecture of the network, with redundant paths to ensure failover reliability. The use of dashed lines for redundancy paths emphasizes the importance of network redundancy in ensuring the reliability of the network.\nNOTE:\tThe figure does not intend to capture the exact resource mapping of DCI and rate-matching rules of PDSCH).\n\nFigure 6.2-1: Illustration of PDSCH repetition and dynamic signalling of the number of PDSCH transmissions\nAs one method to increase the probability of successful decoding of the DL assignment, further DL assignments can be transmitted in the (s)TTIs following the (s)TTI where a DL assignment for K PDSCH transmissions has been transmitted. The specification clarifies the UE behaviour for this case. The UE discards any further DL assignment scrambled with C-RNTI in a (s)TTI where a PDSCH that is part of a window of K transmissions is being received.\nThe specification defines how subframes/slots/subslots are counted as part of the K PDSCH transmissions in case consecutive PDSCH transmissions are not possible. The specification also clarifies rate-matching rules around SPDCCH resources for the last K-1 slot/subslot PDSCH transmissions of a transmission window.\nRRC configuration enables to set fixed values to some bits in the DCI, enabling thereby the possibility to reduce the false alarm probability.\nUL SPS (uplink Semi-Persistent Scheduling) repetition\nIn addition to PDSCH repetition, the specifications support UL SPS repetition where K >1 UL transmissions of the same transport block can be configured as part of the SPS configuration for subframe/slot/subslot PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel). The number of UL transmissions, K, is to be chosen so that the aggregated time of K UL transmissions does not exceed the configured SPS periodicity, P. The initial transmission of the transport block can only occur on the first transmission occasion of the transmission window. This guarantees that K transmissions are performed for a given transport block. There is only one exception. In case a dynamic UL grant is sent for a PUSCH transmission in a subframe/slot/subslot where a SPS PUSCH transmission part of a repetition was prepared, the colliding PUSCH SPS transmission may be dropped. The exact dropping rules for such collision cases were defined following the principles applied for UL SPS without repetition. If dropped, only the colliding SPS PUSCH transmission is dropped, while the remaining PUSCH transmissions within the transmission window are performed.\nThe figure depicts a two-stage repetition scheme for Ultra-Low Power (ULP) SPS (Single-Photon Sensing) on one SPS (Single-Photon Sensing) configuration. The first stage involves a single SPS, while the second stage involves two SPSs. The figure illustrates the repetition scheme, showing the number of repetitions and the number of SPSs involved.\nFigure 6.2-2: UL SPS repetition on one SPS configuration\nIn case of new data arrival, a UE has to wait for the next first (s)TTI of the transmission window before being able to transmit new data (as depicted in Figure 2). With a single UL SPS configuration, this induces a maximum delay of P (s)TTIs. To shorten this delay, the specifications allow multiple SPS configurations for the same TTI length to be activated on the same serving cell. By appropriate setting of P, K and the number of SPS configurations for a given TTI length, it is possible to reduce the maximum delay for the UE to be able to transmit UL data to 1 (s)TTI. Different HARQ processes are associated with different SPS configurations for a given (s)TTI length and the cyclic shift for the UL Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) can be configured independently for each SPS configuration.\nThe figure depicts two SPS repetition schemes, with one configuration featuring a single SPS and the other utilizing two SPSs. The SPS repetition is crucial for enhancing the capacity of the network, as it allows for the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals. The figure also highlights the importance of proper SPS configuration to ensure optimal performance.\nFigure 6.2-3: UL SPS repetition with two SPS configurations\nPDCP packet duplication\nIn case of Carrier Aggregation (CA) or in case of Dual Connectivity (DC), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) packet duplication can be applied to improve the overall reliability for downlink and possibly for uplink depending on UE power limitation. PDCP packet duplication is configured for a radio bearer by RRC where two logical channels are configured for the radio bearer. The two logical channels can either belong to the same MAC entity (CA case) or different MAC entities (DC case). When activated, PDCP packet duplication allows sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths: via the primary RLC entity and a secondary RLC entity, thereby increasing reliability.\nPDCP packet duplication is supported in the following cases:\n-\tfor Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs) using RLC AM.\n-\tfor Data Radio Bearers (DRBs) using RLC UM or AM.\nFor DRBs, PDCP packet duplication is first RRC configured and then activated and deactivated by a MAC CE. In addition, for DRBs, PDCP packet duplication can also be immediately activated upon configuration by RRC signalling. For SRBs, once duplication is configured, it is always activated.\nWhen PDCP packet duplication is activated, both the original logical channel and the duplicated logical channel are RRC configured with a cell restriction list. The data from one logical channel is not allowed to be sent on the cells in the cell restriction list. The cell restriction lists associated with the original and the duplicated logical channel are mutually-exclusive so that duplicates are sent on different cells. The restriction is lifted when PDCP packet duplication is deactivated.\nAt the receiver, PDCP enables reordering and duplication detection when PDCP packet duplication is configured.\nGranular time reference provision\nThe specifications support granular time reference provision from the network to end user equipment. The time reference provided by the network to users has a granularity of 0.25 us and uses the GPS/UTC time format (like in SIB16). In addition, an inaccuracy indication of the time reference is optionally sent. If the inaccuracy indication is absent, then the inaccuracy is not specified.\nThe time reference can be broadcasted (via SIB16) and be unicasted (via dedicated RRC signalling). For broadcast solution, the time refers to the same reference point in SIB16, i.e., the system frame number (SFN) boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the system information (SI)-window in which SystemInformationBlockType16 is transmitted. For unicast solution, the time refers to the ending boundary of one system frame number whose value is indicated in the RRC message.\n\n",

                    "text_content": "\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180851 revised in RP-181838.\nThis work item is a collection of additions and enhancements of functionalities related to NB-IoT, primarily focusing on reducing UE power consumption and on enhancing the parts of the Rel-13/14 NB-IoT air interface and protocol layers to respond to feedback from early deployments.\nAdditional new features include support for small cells, extensions to NB-IoT standalone operation mode, and TDD.\nWake-up signalling for IDLE mode (FDD)\nWhen a UE is in DRX or eDRX, it has to regularly check if a paging message is arriving from the core network. At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\nScheduling request (FDD)\nIn Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\nQuick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)\nA NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\nRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)\nThis feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\nRLC UM (FDD and TDD)\nRel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.\nNarrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)\nThe narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel (NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.\nNPRACH range enhancement (FDD)\nNB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km. Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE's range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and a cyclic prefix of 800 μs, together with frequency hopping, which is sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.\nSmall cell support (FDD and TDD)\neNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power than macro eNBs.\nReduced system acquisition time (FDD)\nIn FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE's power consumption during cell access. Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows 16 repetitions.\nUE differentiation (FDD and TDD)\nThe network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it tends to have traffic to transmit.\nAccess barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)\nIn Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive, UEs.\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\nTDD\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.\n",

EC-GSM-IoT improves the coverage performance of Cellular IoT devices by 20 dB compared to EGPRS along and enables long battery life time achieved by energy efficient methods over the radio interface. The extended coverage is achieved by a high number of blind physical layer transmissions along with modified channel coding schemes.\nIn Release 13, the base station supporting EC-GSM-IoT requires minimum 4 consecutive timeslot resources reserved for packet data operation to support extended coverage operation. Furthermore, the coverage improvement for low power EC-GSM-IoT devices with 23 dBm output power is limited to 10 dB in this release.\nIn Release 14, as part of radio interface enhancements, EC operation with a reduced number of 2 consecutive timeslot resources both on DL and UL specified. In addition, a new uplink coverage class CC5 is added to improve the MCL performance in uplink by 4 dB compared to Release 13, which can be mapped both to 4 and 2 consecutive time slot resources.\nIn Release 15, as part of further enhancements, a paging indication channel for EC operation is introduced as well as the deferred system information acquisition procedure for EC operation both targeting the improvement of energy consumption of the device in idle mode. The deferred system information acquisition procedure was also specified for Power Efficient Operation (PEO) devices that operate in normal coverage with increased power consumption efficiency in idle mode due to adoption of Extended DRX and relaxed mobility requirements.\n",

An EC-PICH block for CC4 contains the paging indication for single paging block of CC4 within four 51 multiframes (see Figure 7.2-1), whereas an EC-PICH block for CC3 serves for indicating a page to one or two CC3 mobile stations per two 51-multiframes (see Figure 7.2-2). The mobile stations in CC3 or CC4 coverage condition checks the EC-PICH block corresponding to its paging block whether containing a wake-up indication, and if yes, listens to the paging block. If the EC-PICH block indicates that no paging message is scheduled in its paging block, the mobile stations enters into sleep mode until the next paging occasion after completion of current (e)DRX cycle thus reducing energy consumption by up to around 15% due to avoiding reading the long paging block for these higher coverage classes which may or not contain a matching page, i.e. require the mobile station to send a paging response. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2-1 and Figure7.2-2 below.\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of the EC-PICH (Enhanced Channel-Paging Interference Cancellation) mechanism in the first 51 MF (Multipath Forwarding) of a mobile station. The diagram illustrates the process of determining whether the mobile station should wake up or sleep for the CC4 paging block. The EC-PICH block is highlighted in red, indicating its importance in the system.\nFigure 7.2-1: EC-PICH block in first 51 MF indicates whether mobile station should wake up or sleep for CC4 paging block\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of the EC-PICH (Enhanced Channel-Paging Interference Cancellation) mechanism in the first 51 MF (Multipath Forwarding) of a mobile station. The diagram illustrates the process of determining whether a mobile station should wake up or sleep for the CC3 (Channel Control 3) paging block. The EC-PICH block is crucial for ensuring efficient communication in the mobile network, as it helps to mitigate interference and optimize the use of resources.\nFigure 7.2-2: EC-PICH block in first 51 MF indicates whether mobile station should wake up or sleep for CC3 paging block\nThe message sent on EC-PICH to convey wake-up or sleep indications is designed such that it can be received by legacy EC-GSM-IoT mobile stations in CC1 condition, expecting an EC-AGCH, without decoding failure, i.e. the legacy EC-GSM-IoT mobile station detects an unknown message type.\n",

                            "text_content": "In order to reduce energy consumption in packet idle mode, the network may broadcast information to assist the MS to apply deferred system information acquisition.\nTo this purpose it reconfigures EC System Information type 2 for a cell to include an Idle Mode Mobility cell group description comprising cells, geographically adjacent or close to each other, with shared cell parameters related to cell (re)selection, Routing Area assignment, paging monitoring, DL Coverage class selection, mobility support and cell barring and assigns it a broadcast frequency list containing BCCH carriers allocated in these cells. To better match cell deployments, some cell parameters may deviate from the common values and are separately indicated on a per cell basis.\nTo allow for different settings of shared cell parameters in geographic adjacent areas, different Idle Mode Mobility cell groups are defined with an identifier to distinguish one from the other, thus providing a spatially definite assignment of cells to Idle Mode Mobility cell groups. Since values of shared or non-shared cell parameters in a particular Idle Mode Mobility cell group are subject to change in time, a change mark is assigned to the Idle Mode Mobility cell group. An increment of the change mark for a particular Idle Mode Mobility cell group hence indicates to the MS to acquire the complete EC SI in the serving cell.\nTo enable fast detection if a cell is part of a specific Idle Mode Mobility cell group or not, the MS identifies from EC-SCH reception the Idle Mode Mobility cell group identifier and the related change mark. Thus, an MS reselecting to a cell in the same IMM cell group as the last serving cell has read the EC-SCH and decoded both the IMM cell group identifier and the IMM cell group change mark. If both values match with those of the last serving cell, it will not need to read the EC-BCCH for this cell prior to the decision for cell reselection, neither after cell reselection to this cell for subsequent cell reselections and for paging monitoring in packet idle mode. Only in case a valid page is received, that requires to send a paging response, or the MS needs to perform an uplink data transmission, or a timeout since the last reading of the complete EC SI in a different than the current serving cell is expired, the MS is required to read the complete EC System Information in the current serving cell.\nThe network may choose to deactivate deferred SI acquisition in network deployments for which EC System Information needs to be reconfigured more frequently or for which adjacent cells' idle mode mobility parameters differ too much. The support of deferred system information acquisition is broadcasted in EC System Information.\nFor PEO devices, that operate in normal coverage, a similar concept was designed, that includes the PEO IMM Cell Group definition in the System Information type 13 (SI 13) message and reuses cell parameters broadcasted in SI 2 and SI 3. For fast detection if a neighbour cell belongs to the same PEO IMM Cell Group or not, the MS monitors paging request and immediate assignment messages on downlink CCCH, where the PEO IMM cell group identifier and the PEO IMM change mark are sent and evaluates whether they are identical to those of the current serving cell. In this case it defers reading of system information for that cell, similar to a device in EC operation. Power savings up to around 20% related to the radio module power consumption of the device have been estimated.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-180541, \"New WID on Further Enhanced EC-GSM-IoT\", source Nokia et al., RAN#79\n[2]\tRP-181886, \"Status Report for WI Further enhancements for EC-GSM-IoT\", source Nokia (rapporteur), RAN#81\n\n",

This work item introduces the following additional enhancements for support of new use cases.\n-\tSupport for higher UE velocity: To enable support of use cases associated with potentially relatively high velocity (e.g. logistics), enhanced performance requirements are introduced for CE mode A. These requirements are defined for 200 Hz Doppler spread, corresponding to around 240 km/h at 1 GHz and 120 km/h at 2 GHz.\n-\tLower UE power class: To enable support of use cases associated with small device form factor and low power consumption (e.g. wearables), a new lower UE power class with a maximum transmission power of 14 dBm is introduced for Cat-M1 and Cat-M2, together with signaling support for the lower maximum transmit power with appropriate coverage relaxations.\n-\tNew gaps for dense PRS configurations: Downlink transmission of dense positioning reference signals (PRS) was introduced already in Rel-14, and this work item introduces new gap patterns that will enable the UE to perform measurements in connected mode when the duration of said PRS is longer than 6 subframes.\n",

This typically means that the UE can save time and energy since it does not need to re-acquire SIB1 as often.

Furthermore, note that the features for reduced system acquisition time listed in the previous clause and the uplink sub-PRB allocation feature mentioned in the next clause may also help reduce power consumption.\n-\tWake-up signals (WUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode is enabled by the introduction of WUS, a compact signal transmitted a configurable time before the paging occasion (PO) when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to maximize its sleep time during periods when there is no paging. The configurable time can be as large as 2 seconds, which facilitates UE implementations with a wake-up receiver (WUR).\n-\tEarly data transmission (EDT): For scenarios where the UE only needs to transmit a small amount of data, the EDT feature enables the UE to transmit up to (slightly more than) 100 bytes of data already in message 3 during the random-access procedure, and to receive data already in message 4. In this release, only mobile-originated (MO) EDT access is supported. If needed, eNB can order fallback to legacy random-access procedure during the EDT procedure.\n-\tHARQ feedback for UL data: A possibility to carry a positive HARQ-ACK in an UL DCI over MPDCCH is introduced. This allows eNB to indicate to a UE that UL data has been successfully received and may enable early termination of downlink (MPDCCH) monitoring or (in case of FD-FDD or TDD but not HD-FDD) early termination of uplink (PUSCH) transmission.\n-\tRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection: When this feature is enabled and the criteria for relaxed monitoring are fulfilled, the UE can reduce its neighbor cell measurements to as seldom as every 24 hours.

Furthermore, note that the EDT feature described in the previous clause may also help increase spectral efficiency.\n-\tDownlink 64QAM support: Support for 64QAM modulation is introduced for PDSCH unicast transmission without repetition in CE mode A to increase the downlink spectral efficiency. The UE peak rate is not increased.\n-\tCQI table with large range: An alternative CQI table spanning a larger range is introduced. Downlink 64QAM can only be used together with the new CQI table, but the new CQI table can also be used by UEs not configured with 64QAM support and even by UEs not supporting 64QAM. In the latter case, the large range of the CQI table can help reduce the need for RRC reconfigurations when the UE experiences varying channel conditions.\n-\tUplink sub-PRB allocation: Uplink spectral efficiency is improved by the introduction of PUSCH sub-PRB resource allocation in connected mode. New allocation sizes are ½ PRB (6 subcarriers) or ¼ PRB (3 subcarriers). In the latter case, a new π/2-BPSK modulation using 1 at a time out of 2 of the 3 allocated subcarriers can be used to achieve near 0 dB baseband peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which may be beneficial for uplink data coverage and for UE power consumption.\n-\tFlexible starting PRB: To facilitate efficient scheduling of MTC-related data transmissions side by side with other transmissions (e.g. MBB-related PDSCH transmissions in downlink and PUCCH/PRACH in uplink), PDSCH/PUSCH resource allocation with a more flexible starting PRB (not restricted by 6-PRB narrowbands) is introduced for UEs that are configured in CE mode with max 1.4 MHz PDSCH/PUSCH channel bandwidth.\n-\tFrequency-domain CRS muting: Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 UEs can indicate support of CRS muting outside their 6-PRB narrowband or 24-PRB wideband, respectively, so that the network can take this information into account when deciding whether and how to perform CRS muting to reduce downlink inter-cell interference in the network.\n",

The target of Rel-14 work to support V2X service is mostly to provide data transport service for basic road safety service such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM), Decentralised Environmental Notification Messages (DENM), Basic Safety Message (BSM) and so on.\nOn top of the work done in Rel-14 to support V2X services based on LTE, the Rel-15 work eV2X further specifies service requirements to enhance 3GPP support for V2X scenarios. Requirements for the following areas are covered in this work and specified in TS 22.186 [1]:\n-\tVehicle Platooning: Vehicles platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a group travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon receive periodic data from the leading vehicle, in order to carry on platoon operations. This information allows the distance between vehicles to become extremely small, i.e., the gap distance translated to time can be very low (sub second). Platooning applications may allow the vehicles following to be autonomously driven.\n-\tAdvanced Driving: Advanced Driving enables semi-automated or fully-automated driving. Longer inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity, thus allowing vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. In addition, each vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in proximity. The benefits of this use case group are safer travelling, collision avoidance, and improved traffic efficiency.\n-\tExtended Sensors: Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, RSUs, devices of pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles can enhance the perception of their environment beyond what their own sensors can detect and have a more holistic view of the local situation.\n-\tRemote Driving: Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive themselves or a remote vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a case where variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as public transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used. In addition, access to cloud-based back-end service platform can be considered for this use case group.\n-\tGeneral aspects\nReference\n[1]\tTS 22.186: \"Enhancement of 3GPP support for V2X scenarios; Stage 1\".\n\n",

With these the completion of these two WIs, TSG RAN had specified V2X communication in order to provide basic safety services.\nIn Rel-15, the LTE_eV2X work item enhances the Cellular-based V2X services (V2V, V2I/N, and V2P) to support advanced V2X services as identified in TR 22.886 in a holistic and complementary manner to Release 14 V2X. This work item specifies 3GPP V2X Phase 2 to support advanced V2X services in a fully backward compatible manner with Rel-14 V2X.\nThese studies concluded to specify and introduce the following key functionalities:\n-\tSupport of Carrier Aggregation (CA) for mode-4. CA was already supported for mode-3 in Rel-14. In Rel-15, CA for mode-4 was specified. The resource allocation procedure of Rel-14, which was based on sensing, was expanded to support multi-carrier transmission, while relying on the same core principles. Rules for power sharing, and to include priority were derived. A synchronization procedure for multiple carriers was derived. It includes priority rules for determining the synchronization resources. Sidelink packet duplication was introduced in the case of CA to improve the transmission reliability.\n-\tSupport for 64-QAM. New transport block sizes and transport block size scaling were introduced to support 64-QAM. In addition, transmission uses rate-matching instead of the Rel-14 procedure where the last symbol was punctured.\n-\tReduction of the maximum time between packet arrival at Layer 1 and resource selected for transmission. This value was reduced to 10ms, compared to 20ms for Rel-14 V2X.\n-\tRadio resource pool sharing between mode-3 and mode-4 UEs. Changes in the SCI content for mode-3 UEs were introduced to improve performance when resource pools are shared. Sensing and reporting for mode-3 UEs is supported.\n-\tTransmit diversity. After studies, it was concluded that transmit diversity was a valuable feature to have. The transmit diversity technique used is Small Delay Cyclic Delay Diversity.\n-\tRF requirements for new CA scenarios, 64QAM and transmit diversity were introduced in TS 36.101.\n-\tRRM requirements. The delay/interruption requirements due to V2X CC addition/release and V2X synchronization reference source selection/reselection requirements for V2X CA was introduced.\nFinally, it can be noted that the introduction of a short Transmission Time Interval (TTI) was studied but was not standardized in Rel-15.\nReferences\nLast approved work item description: RP-171740, \"Revision of WID:V2X phase 2 based on LTE\"\nLast status report: RP-180856\n\n\n",

Those features that have been completed are described below.\nEnhancements to the MCPTT service impact the following areas of the architecture and protocols: call control and media handling, configuration, and security.\nThe following features have been introduced:\nA)\tRemotely initiated MCPTT call request: This feature gives the ability for an authorized MCPTT user to target another MCPTT user's client and have the target client initiate an MCPTT call. The target MCPTT client can be instructed to initiate a private call (to a single MCPTT user), or the target MCPTT client can be instructed to initiate a group call (to a set of MCPTT users).

The MCData user may request the list and retrieve the deferred data communications at a later time. This is an on-network procedure.\nB)\tCommunication release with prior indication: This feature enables an authorized MCData user to send a release indication to the MCData service to terminate an ongoing MCData communication. This action can be accomplished for an ongoing MCData communication over the media plane, or over HTTP. The authorized MCData user may have been monitoring the ongoing MCData communication. Prior to the communication release, the target MCData user is given a notification that ongoing MCData communication release is pending. The target MCData user may request an extension from the authorized MCData user before release. If the extension is granted the MCData communication will continue. If no extension is given, the MCData communication is released. This is an on-network procedure.\nC)\tCommunication release without prior indication: This feature is similar to the feature described in (B) above, except that no notification is given to the target MCData user before the release which terminates the MCData communication is executed by the MCData system. An authorized MCData user can initiate the communication release. No extension can be requested or granted in this case. This is an on-network procedure.\nD)\tMCData server initiated release: This feature allows the MCData system to release an ongoing MCData communication after some triggering criteria (e.g. lack of bearer capacity, limit for the maximum amount of data or time that a MCData participant may transmit in a single request is exceeded) has been met. Similar to (B) and (C) above the release of MCData communication can be preceded by a notification or not.

The enhanced status captures a status specific to the activities performed by the MCData users during their normal course of operation (e.g. available, on site, in route to the site, unavailable). The enhanced status can be shared by the MCData user with an MCData group using the Short Data Service (SDS) capability.\nF)\tEnhanced status (off-network): This feature extends the enhanced status feature in (E) above for off-network SDS communication.\nG)\tExtension of the MCData application identifier: The application identifier field used in the MCData service has been extend to include an additional formats: text and URI. This gives greater flexibility for configuration of the application identifier within the MCData service.\nThe architecture, protocol, and security aspects of the MCData service related to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:\n1.\tThe architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.282 and TS 23.280;\n2.\tThe security aspects are specified in TS 33.180;\n3.\tThe protocol aspects for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.282 and TS 24.582 respectively;\n4.\tThe protocol aspects for group configuration, identity management, and general configuration are specified in TS 24.481, TS 24.482, TS 24.483, and TS 24.484 respectively;\n5.\tThe protocol aspects for policy and charging control are specified in TS 29.213 and TS 29.214;\n6.\tThe protocol aspects for data management related to MC service user profile are specified in TS 29.283;\n7.\tThe stage 2 aspects of the Proximity-based services (ProSe) enabler are specified in TS 23.303.\nReferences\n[1]\tTS 22.282 Mission Critical Data services; Stage 1;\n[2]\tTS 22.280 Mission Critical Services Common Requirements (MCCoRe); Stage 1;\n[3]\tTS 23.282 Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Data (MCData); Stage 2;\n[4]\tTS 23.280 Common functional architecture to support mission critical services; Stage 2;\n[5]\tTS 23.303 Proximity-based services (ProSe); Stage 2;\n[6]\tTS 23.468 Group Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE); Stage 2;\n[7]\tTS 24.282 Mission Critical Data (MCData) signalling control; Protocol specification;\n[8]\tTS 24.582 Mission Critical Data (MCData) media plane control; Protocol specification;\n[9]\tTS 24.481 Mission Critical Services (MCS) group management; Protocol specification;\n[10]\tTS 24.482 Mission Critical Services (MCS) identity management; Protocol specification;\n[11]\tTS 24.483 Mission Critical Services (MCS) Management Object (MO);\n[12]\tTS 24.484 Mission Critical Services (MCS) configuration management; Protocol specification;\n[13]\tTS 29.213 Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and Quality of Service (QoS) parameter mapping;\n[14]\tTS 29.214: Policy and Charging Control over Rx reference point;\n[15]\tTS 29.283: Diameter data management applications;\n[16]\tTS 33.180: Security of the mission critical service.\n\n",

For that, two procedures have been introduced. The first one is the MBMS bearer coordination independent on broadcasted media procedure to be used when there are multiple MC service servers serving users in one specific area covered with one MBMS bearer, but the servers broadcast media independent of each other. The second procedure is the MBMS bearer coordination within one group call. This one is used when multiple MC service servers of the same kind participate in the same group communication. The MC service servers could be different MC service servers assigned the participating role within one MC system. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280.\nB)\tMBMS bearer event notification: This feature includes an activation of an MBMS bearer and different types of events that may occur during the lifetime of the MBMS bearer. The different events notified to the MC service server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 23.468, 3GPP TS 23.246 and 3GPP TS 36.300.\nC)\tUse of FEC to protect MBMS transmissions: Application layer FEC (Forward Error Correction) has been introduced as an optional feature to recover the packet losses when delivering a MC service over MBMS. Hence, the required level of QoS can be reached. For that, two procedures on how FEC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 23.246.\nD)\tHeader compression over MBMS with ROHC: Header compression can decrease the required bandwidth for service communications. Therefore, the support of ROHC (RObust Header Compression) over MBMS has been introduced as an optional feature for the MC service servers and MC service clients. If header compression and FEC are both applied to a communication over MBMS, the header compression has to be performed after the FEC encoding. For that, two procedures on how ROHC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 24.380, 3GPP TS 23.246, 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 36.300.\nReferences\n[1] \t3GPP TS 23.280 Common functional architecture to support mission critical services; Stage 2 (Release 15);\n[2]\t 3GPP TS 23.468 Group Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE); Stage 2 (Release 15);\n[3] \t3GPP TS 23.246 Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Architecture and functional description (Release 15);\n[4] \t3GPP TS 24.380 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) media plane control; Protocol specification (Release 15);\n[5] \t3GPP TS 36.300 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 (Release 15).\n",

While the overall ProSe framework is largely independent from the actual technology used on the direct UE-to-UE interface (i.e. on PC5), up to and including Rel-14 the ProSe Direct Discovery could only be performed using PC5 interface based on the E-UTRA technology.\nTo extend the reach of the ProSe framework to a larger consumer population, and given that WLAN support is already available in devices, this feature proposes to integrate selected WLAN direct discovery technologies as an alternative technology for ProSe Direct Discovery. An example of WLAN technologies is the Wi-Fi Neighbour Awareness Networking (NAN) [2] that provides a low-power consumption discovery alternative for discovery of adjacent devices.\nStage 2 work (TS 23.303 [1]) focused on the following:\n-\tClarification of scope, PC5 definition and ProSe Direct Discovery definition to include WLAN-based PC5.\n-\tChanges to authorisation and provisioning for ProSe to include WLAN-based PC5 and to clarify that some existing provisioning information is only relevant for E-UTRA based PC5.\n-\tAddition of Informative Annex(es) describing how specific WLAN technologies are used for transport of the ProSe Protocol message and/or information elements. In this release of the specification the only WLAN technology that has been specified for use with ProSe Direct Discovery is Wi-Fi NAN (Neighbour Awareness Networking) [2].\nThe procedural impact on PC5 (UE to UE) and PC3 (UE to ProSe function) interfaces defined in TS 24.334 [3] has been kept to the minimum. Where necessary, a new parameter PC5_tech has been introduced indicating whether ProSe Direct Discovery is performed via E-UTRA-based PC5 or WLAN-based PC5 or both.\nStage 3 aspects of WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery are defined in TS 24.334 [3] (addition of PC5_tech in PC3 procedures), TS 24.333 [4] (addition of a new branch to the ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO), TS 29.345 [5] (addition of PC5_tech in PC6/PC7 procedures), TS 29.230 [6] (new AVP due to PC5_tech) and TS 23.008 [7] (storage of PC5_tech).\nCharging aspects of WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery are defined in TS 32.277 [8] (enhancement to charging description), TS 32.298 [9] (enhancement to the Charging Data Record (CDR), and TS 32.299 [10] (enhancement to the Diameter charging application).\nReferences\n[1]\tTS 23.303: \"Proximity-based services (ProSe); Stage 2\".\n[2]\tWi-Fi Alliance Technical Task Group: \"Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking Technical Specification\", Version 1.0.\n[3]\tTS 24.334: \"Proximity-services (ProSe) User Equipment (UE) to ProSe function protocol aspects; Stage 3\".\n[4]\tTS 24.333: \"Proximity-services (ProSe) Management Objects (MO)\".\n[5]\tTS 29.345: \"Inter-Proximity-services (Prose) function signalling aspects; Stage 3\".\n[6]\tTS 29.230: \"Diameter applications; 3GPP specific codes and identifiers\".\n[7]\tTS 23.008: \"Organization of subscriber data\".\n[8]\tTS 32.277: \"Telecommunication management; Charging management; Proximity-based Services (ProSe) charging\".\n[9]\tTS 32.298: \"Telecommunication management; Charging management; Charging Data Record (CDR) parameter description\".\n[10]\tTS 32.299: \"Telecommunication management; Charging management; Diameter charging applications\".\n\n",

MCCore now supports a limited functional alias functionality, a role based addressing for railways. MCPTT now supports multi user talker control, an additional way of floor control allowing a defined number of talkers talking at the same time in a group communication rather than just one talker at a time.\nThis work initially started off in 2014 in the International Railway Union (UIC) by an activity to collect the user scenarios to be supported by a Future Railway Communication System (FRMCS). As those user scenarios could not be mapped easily onto use cases in 3GPP based on the input of the UIC a Technical Report (TR22.889) was written summarising 3GPP style use cases, to come up with requirements for introduction in normative specifications.\nThe term FRMCS is used in UIC still and includes more than just the Mobile Communication System for Railways standardised by 3GPP, see figure below, the light gray dotted boxes are in scope of 3GPP. The darker gray cross hatched boxes are also taken care of by 3GPP in maintaining the GSM legacy.\nThe figure depicts a high-level relation of the Mobile Communication System for Railways (FRMCS) and legacy systems, illustrating the integration of various components such as mobile base stations (MBS), mobile edge computing (MEC), and network slicing. The figure highlights the importance of network slicing in enabling flexible and efficient use of resources, while also highlighting the need for efficient network slicing to support the growing demand for mobile services in rail transportation.\nFigure 11.1-1: High-level relation of the Mobile Communication System for Railways / FRMCS and legacy systems\nThe work item to introduce the findings of TR 22.889 into normative is called \"Mobile Communication System for Railways\" (MONASTERY) an adapts 3GPP to provide communication to railway users. The Mobile Communication System for Railways eventually will resemble GSM-R and other legacy system in use nowadays and will additionally provide communication capabilities beyond what those systems support. It will provide higher data rates, lower data latencies, multimedia communication, and improved communication reliability.\nTo facilitate smooth migration from legacy communication systems to the Mobile Communication System for Railways, interworking requirements between legacy communication systems and the Mobile Communication System for Railways are provided.\nAmongst others, Mobile Communication System for Railways provides emergency group communication, low latency and high reliable data and video service in high speed train environment. Amongst others it has the following important features:\n-\tPrioritized emergency group communication, train control data and video service\n-\tSeamless connectivity in high speed railway moving environments\n-\tLow latency and high reliable data and video service\n-\tReal time train monitoring and management for safe train operation\n-\tReliable location tracking including tunnel condition\n-\tLegacy railway communication interworking to GSM-R system\n-\tSpecialised forms of addressing used for railway communication\nBasically, railway communication services can be categorized into:\n-\tTrain control services\n-\tMaintenance services\n-\tRailway specific services (such as Railway Emergency Call, functional addressing, and location-based addressing)\n-\tOther services (providing train crews or train Drivers with information of train operation and interworking with the existing railway communication systems)\nIn Rel-15 only two additions have been introduced to the Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) and the Mission Critical Core (MCCore) functionality. MCCore now supports a limited functional alias functionality, a role based addressing for railways. MCPTT now supports multi user talker control, an additional way of floor control allowing a defined number of talkers talking at the same time in a group communication rather than just one talker at a time.\n",

This will enable broader range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\nTR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\nTS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\nTS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.\nThe CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e. API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions and the API invoker/consumer.\nThe figure depicts a functional model for the CAPIF, which stands for Centralized Access Point Infrastructure. It illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the access point (AP), the central office (CO), and the network elements such as the access network (AN), the core network (CN), and the access network (AN). The figure provides a clear visual representation of the network's architecture, allowing for better understanding and management of the network's performance and security.\nFigure 11.2-1: Functional model for the CAPIF\nThe functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs, discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, monitoring, and topology hiding.\nIt further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and 5GS).\nThe detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function services and 1 API exposing function service):\n1.\tCAPIF_Discover_Service_API - for an API invoker to discover APIs published on the CAPIF core function.\n2.\tCAPIF_Publish_Service_API - for an API publishing function to publish and manage published APIs on CAPIF core function.\n3.\tCAPIF_Events_API - for API invoker and API provider domain functions to subscribe and get notified of CAPIF core function events.\n4.\tCAPIF_API_Invoker_Management_API - for an API invoker to on-board to or off-board from a CAPIF core function.\n5.\tCAPIF_Security_API - for API invoker and API provider domain functions to manage authentication and authorizations of an API invoker for CAPIF core function and service APIs.\n6.\tCAPIF_Logging_API_Invocation_API - for an API exposing function to log service API invocations on CAPIF core function.\n7.\tCAPIF_Auditing_API - for an API management function to retrieve service API invocation logs stored on CAPIF core function\n8.\tCAPIF_Access_Control_Policy_API - for an API exposing function to retrieve access control policies stored on CAPIF core function.\n9.\tAEF_Authentication_API - for an API invoker to intiate authentication by triggering retrieval of authentication credentials from the CAPIF core function by the API exposing function\nReferences\n[1]\tTS 29.122: \"T8 reference point for northbound Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\".\n[2]\tTR 26.981: \"MBMS Extensions for Provisioning and Content Ingestion\".\n[3]\tTS 23.722: \"Study on Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs\".\n[4]\tTS 23.222: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs; Stage 2\".\n[5]\tTS 29.222: \"Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs\".\n\n",

                            "text_content": "\nSummary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-181149.\nThe WI specified a new interface, namely E1, that enables interconnecting a gNB-CU-CP (control plane part of the gNB central unit) and a gNB-CU-UP (user plane part of the gNB central unit) [1]. The split of control plane and user plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit) and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the possibility of:\n(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing, (3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.\nIn the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane, while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.\nThe architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios [2]:\n-\tCentralized gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP: The gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP are deployed in a centralized location, either as one or separate entities. The gNB-CU-CP coordinates the operation of several gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU-UP provides a central termination point for UP traffic in dual-connectivity (DC) configurations.\n-\tDistributed gNB-CU-CP and centralized gNB-CU-UP: The gNB-CU-CP is deployed in a distributed manner and co-located with the gNB-DU. The gNB-CU-CP supervises the operation of a single gNB-DU or of a local cluster of gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU-UP is centralized to provide a central termination point for UP traffic in DC configurations. In this scenario, the latency of the control signalling toward the UE is reduced as the gNB-CU-CP is co-located with the gNB-DU.\n-\tCentralized gNB-CU-CP and distributed gNB-CU-UP: The gNB-CU-CP is centralized to coordinate the operation of several gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU-UP is distributed and co-located with a single gNB-DU or with a local cluster of gNB-DUs and provides low UP latency to support latency-critical services.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network architecture with a split between the base station (gNB-CU-CP) and the base station (gNB-CU-UP). The architecture includes a split between the core switches (OLTs) and distributed nodes, which are shown in dashed lines. This design aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and failover.\nFigure 12.1-1: Architecture with gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP split\nThe call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface (e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are captured in TS 38.401 [3].

In a previous Rel-14 work item IQoE [1], this QoE functionality was enhanced for the DASH streaming specification TS 26.247 [2], giving the operator better possibilities to control such metrics feedback. The current Rel-15 work item EQoE_MTSI [3] introduced the same enhancements also to the MTSI specification TS 26.114 [4], keeping the QoE functionalities for DASH and MTSI services aligned.\nThe enhancements introduced by EQoE_MTSI in TS 26.114 are:\n-\tEnable QoE configuration and reporting over the control plane.\n-\tEnable geographical filtering of QoE reporting.\n-\tEnhance the content of the QoE reports for the EVS and H.265 codecs.\nReferences\n[1]\tSP-160082, \"Work Item Improved Streaming QoE Reporting in 3GPP Services and Networks\", 3GPP SA#71, Gothenburg, Sweden, 9-11 March, 2016\n[2]\tTS 26.247, \"Progressive Download and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (3GP-DASH)\"\n[3]\tSP-170333, \"Work Item Enhanced QoE Reporting for MTSI\", 3GPP SA#76, Busan, Korea, 7-9 June, 2017\n[4]\tTS 26.114, \"Multimedia Telephony; Media handling and interaction\"\n\n\n\nSummary based on the input provided by China Unicom, Huawei, China Telecom in RP-172192 revised in RP-181821.\nThe benefit of understanding customers' experience, e.g. throughput, data loss, latency, for streaming services has attracted operators' attention. ITU-T P.NATS has released the standards on the model and evaluation of MOS models for streaming services in December 2016. SA4 has specified information about Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, DASH, services to be collected from the DASH application on the UE and agreed to support MDT enhancement option for both QoE metrics configuration and QoE metrics reporting [1].A WI on QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services in UTRAN was approved at RAN#73 and a 'container based solution' has been specified [2]. SA5 has studied the management solution for collection of QoE information and proposed use cases, potential requirements and possible solutions. A WI was approved to specify the function Management of QoE measurement collection [3].\nBased on the work above, the operators can collect and utilize the QoE measurement information of streaming services to better understand the user experience and optimize their network in E-UTRAN. This work item specified the core requirement for Quality of Experience (QoE) Measurement Collection for streaming services in E-UTRAN [4].\nThis feature enables the network to collect QoE measurement information from the UE. The feature is activated by Trace Function from the MDT framework. Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\nThe QoE measurement configuration from OAM or CN in E-UTRAN is included in a container of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message and forwarded to the UE similar to in UTRAN. For transferring the QoE measurement report, a new SRB4 and a new uplink RRC message \"application layer measurement report\" are introduced. SRB4 is configured via RRCConnectionReconfiguration meassage. A container in the new message is defined to send the QoE measurement report.\nThe QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting are supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. E-UTRAN can release the QoE measurement configuration towards the UE at any time. If not explicitly released by the eNB, QoE measurement will be continued in case of intra-eNB HO and inter-eNB HO and both source and target cell belong to defined same measurement reporting area.\nReferences\n[1]\tSP-160082, WID of Improved Streaming QoE Reporting in 3GPP Services and Networks.\n[2]\tRP-161917, New WI proposal: Quality of Experience (QoE) Measurement Collection for streaming services in UTRAN.\n[3]\tSP-170483, New WID on Management of QoE measurement collection\n[4]\tlast approved WID: RP-170956.\n[5]\tCRs:\nRAN2:\tTS 36.300 CR1073, TS 36.306 CR1519, TS 36.331 CR3144\nRAN3:\tTS 36.413 CR1543r2, TS 36.423 CR1045r1\n\n",

Primarily, the TV Video Profile specification in TS.26.116 [2] was updated to support High Dynamic Range (HDR) video. In addition, the media capabilities are enabled in PSS and MBMS by updates of the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively.\nHDR is one of the biggest movements in mobile devices recently. It's following a trend that's been tearing through the TV industry over the past few years. While it is still early days for this emerging technology, it is also making a difference for mobile video and it requires consistent standardized technologies. HDR stands for high dynamic range and it's been a buzzword in TV for the past couple of years. HDR is often assigned to display capabilities, i.e. that the display is able to produce a wider range of colours, bringing greater authenticity, but also about brightness and contrast. In order to feed such new display technologies, consistent and efficient delivery formats have been established in the TV world. The work item supports the move of such experience to mobile devices to create the same stunning experience: richer colors, better contrast and brighter highlights.\nThe work item addresses the definition of consistent and efficient HDR video signals and receiver capabilities for TV centric services in 3GPP. To this end, the experiences and technologies in the TV centric markets have been reviewed and adapted to 3GPP Video. The work item defines the relevant extensions to support High Dynamic Range in 3GPP TV Video Profiles. Specifically, an HDR video profile based on the Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) is defined, following the recommendations in ITU-R BT.2100. This includes the use of H.265 (HEVC) for compression, the definition of transfer functions and color primaries, the definition of relevant metadata as well as the integration into PSS and MBMS services. The completion of the work brings the 3GPP TV Video Profile specification on par with other TV Video standards, e.g. the ones defined for example by DVB and ATSC.\nReferences\n[1]\tTdoc SP-170610, \"Addition of HDR to TV Video Profiles (HDR)\"\n[2]\tTS 26.116, \"Television (TV) over 3GPP services; Video profiles\"\n[3]\tTS 26.234, \"Transparent end-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS); Protocols and codecs\"\n[4]\tTS 26.346, \"Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Protocols and codecs\"\n\n",

Primarily, the \"Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media\" specification in TS.26.118 [2] was developed to support Virtual Reality (VR) in streaming applications. In addition, the media capabilities are enabled in Packet Switched Streaming (PSS) Services and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) by updates of the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively. The characterization results for audio media profile proponents are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\nBased on the findings in TR 26.918 [6], the work item developed the first set of Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media. Virtual Reality (VR) is the ability to be virtually present in a space created by the rendering of natural and/or synthetic image and sound correlated by the movements of the immersed user allowing interacting with that world. Virtual reality typically assumes a user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the user's field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying audio. In the first set of technologies defined in TS 26.118, VR users are expected to be able to look around from a single observation point in 3D space, also referred to as three degrees of freedom (3DoF). It allows the user to (i) tilt side to side (Rolling), (ii) tilt forward and backward (Pitching), and (iii) turning left and right (Yawing). The specification defines a 3GPP 3DOF reference and coordinate system as well as an end-to-end architecture. In the reference client, it is assumed that pose information, i.e. the position derived by the head tracking sensor expressed by (azimuth; elevation; tilt angle), is continuously available to the VR renderer in order to render the viewport. Based on the system model, video and audio technologies are defined including system technologies (DASH and file format), suitable codecs and rendering technologies.\nSpecifically on video, three operation points (combination of elementary stream and rendering metadata) and three corresponding media profiles are defined, namely:\n-\tBasic Video: Based on H.264/AVC High Profile Level 5.1 for mono only, single stream, and reuse of single stream DASH streaming. This profile addresses legacy service and devices. This profile allows reuse of existing file format and DASH implementations also for VR Streaming.\n-\tMain Video: Based on H.265/HEVC High Profile Level 5.1 allowing mono and stereo, single stream, but either a single or multiple independent Adaptation Sets may be offered, such that a client can choose based on its current pose. This profile allows reuse of existing file format and DASH implementations also for VR Streaming.\n-\tAdvanced Video: based on H.265/HEVC High Profile Level 5.1, but in addition to the Main Video features, it permits to stream and combine multiple tiles at the receiver for improved quality.\nFor PSS, all three profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one recommended ('should') and the third one allowed ('may'). For MBMS, the first two profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one is recommended ( 'should') and constrained to non-viewport adaptive streaming.\nFor audio, one solution was selected and is documented in TS 26.118, namely MPEG-H 3D Audio Baseline profile. This technology enables the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio. Additional interesting technologies enabling the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio were considered, and the characterization results of all proposed technologies are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\nIn addition to media specific metadata, system metadata is added to TS 26.118 to support rendering of 360 experiences on 2D screens, including the aspects of rendering without pose information. Basic requirements for a full audio-visual experience are documented under the umbrella of VR Presentations.\nThe completion of the work item provides a set of consistent technologies for Virtual Reality in Rel-15 for 5G Phase 1. It is providing a response to the demand identified during the successful joint 3GPP/VR-IF Workshop on Virtual Reality that took place in December 2017 [7], which was an integral part of the development of 3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Applications.\nReferences\n[1]\tTdoc SP-170612, \"3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media\"\n[2]\tTS 26.118, \"3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Applications\"\n[3]\tTS 26.234, \"Transparent end-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS); Protocols and codecs\"\n[4]\tTS 26.346, \"Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Protocols and codecs\"\n[5]\tTR 26.818, \"Virtual Reality (VR) streaming audio; Characterization test results\"\n[6]\tTR 26.918, \"Virtual Reality (VR) media services over 3GPP\"\n[7]\thttp://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1903-virtual-reality-ws\n\n\n",

MPEG SAND defines message formats and interfaces among server, client, edge proxy and network elements toward enhancing streaming quality of experience (QoE). During Rel-14, 3GPP SA4 conducted the study item FS_SAND toward identifying enhancements offered by MPEG SAND in the 3GPP environment, and recommend necessary modifications to the 3GPP specifications including DASH to enable these enhancements. Relevant architectures, use cases, gap analysis and potential solutions pertaining to 3GPP enhancements based on MPEG SAND have been documented in TR 26.957.\nAligned with the conclusions of the FS_SAND study item documented in clause 11 of TR 26.957, the Rel-15 work item on SAND was conducted and the following functionality based on MPEG SAND in ISO/IEC 23009-5 was introduced into 3GPP DASH:\n-\tStreaming enhancements via intelligent caching, processing and delivery optimizations on the server and/or network side, based on feedback from clients on anticipated DASH Segments, accepted alternative DASH Representations and Adaptation Sets, client buffer level and requested bandwidth.\n-\tImproved adaptation on the client side, based on network/server-side information such as cached Segments, alternative Segment availability, recommended media rate and network throughput/QoS.\nIn particular, normative work on TS 26.247 was completed to introduce SAND support with the definition of three SAND modes, namely 'Proxy Caching', 'Network Assistance' and 'Consistent QoE/QoS'. SAND messages and protocols to use with 3GPP DASH were defined for each of these SAND modes, and normative behaviours for SAND message handling for the 3GP DASH client and DASH-aware network element (DANE) were specified. Procedures for DANE discovery have also been described in TS 26.247. In addition, use of SAND functionality for enabling network assistance, proxy caching and consistent QoE/QoS have been described in detail in TS 26.247, with the specification of relevant SAND message usage and extensions where necessary, and the inclusion of example workflows. Finally, TS 26.233 has also been updated to describe SAND support in PSS and the impacts on related system architecture functions.

Primarily, a SAND mode was defined in TS 26.247 [2] to support SAND for multiple network access (SAND4M). In addition, consistent support of hybrid MBMS services in TS 26.346 [3] was added, supporting also unicast-supplemented services. The interface/API between MBMS client and DASH client in TS 26.347 [4] was updated to add the SAND4M mode to the MBMS client and DASH client. The now outdated MBMS User Service Guidelines in TR 26.946 [5] are updated as well.\nFor the operation of the DASH client on top of an MBMS client, in particular for the case of MBMS Operation on Demand (MooD) and for MBMS/unicast service continuity, a need was identified to have API level communication between the MBMS client and the DASH client. Based on the 3GPP requirements, initially documented in TR 26.946 [5], MPEG initiated and completed the work on Server and Network Assisted DASH (SAND) in ISO/IEC 23009-5, which provides enablers for a consistent network assistance for DASH. With completion of the work in MPEG, the guidelines in TR26.946 are migrated to normative specification in 3GP-DASH in TS 26.247 [2] and TS 26.347 [4] to support of MBMS Operation on Demand (MooD) and for MBMS/unicast service continuity.\nIn addition, unicast-supplemented service offerings in MBMS, for which certain resources are only available on unicast and these resources provide an additional user experience, are added in addition to the already existing unicast fallback mode to support consistent support for these services. This for example permits to offer an MBMS service for which a second language is only available over unicast and therefore needs to be made available to the DASH client even if the DASH client is in broadcast coverage.\nIn order to provide a consistent support for the above features a SAND mode for multiple network support is defined in TS 26.247 [2] and the relevant enablers for the MBMS client and the interface between DASH client and the MBMS client are defined. In addition, consistent support of hybrid MBMS services in TS 26.346 [3] was added, supporting also unicast-supplemented services.\nReferences\n[1]\tTdoc SP-170608, \"SAND for MBMS (SAND4M)\"\n[2]\tTS 26.247, \"Transparent end-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS); Progressive Download and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (3GP-DASH)\"\n[3]\tTS 26.346, \"Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Protocols and codecs\"\n[4]\tTS 26.347, \"Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); Application Programming Interface and URL\"\n[5]\tTR 26.946, \"Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS); User Service Guidelines\"\n\n",

Since a single OTA AAS BS is comparable to a non-AAS BS with multiple transceivers, the eAAS requirements aim to ensure that the same protection and performance is provided as a non-AAS BS with 8 transceivers for E-UTRA and MSR and with 4 transceivers for UTRA.\nThe previous AAS WI produced an AAS BS specification for an AAS BS which provided access to a conducted interface. Requirements were applied at both the conducted interface (the Transceiver Array Boundary) and the radiated interface. An AAS BS conforming to the release 13/14 AAS BS requirements is now referred to as a hybrid AAS BS in the release 15 specification. To enable AAS BS with larger number of transceiver units and higher frequencies, where maintaining a conducted interface may limit implementation, all OTA requirements have been developed enabling the OTA AAS BS to be treated as a black box that is tested externally using radiated test signals.\n",

                            "text_content": "Transmitter requirements\nTransmitter requirements can be classified into 3 types:\n1.\tDirectional requirements\nDirectional requirements are specified over the OTA peak directions set (for power accuracy requirement) or the OTA coverage range (for signal quality requirements). Multiple OTA peak directions sets may be declared by the BS manufacturer for the widest and narrowest possible beam widths along with the associated EIRP values. There is only a single OTA coverage range declared, all the OTA peak directional sets have to be within the OTA coverage range.\nExamples of the directional requirements are: EIRP accuracy, power dynamics, control signal power accuracy, signal quality (EVM, frequency accuracy, TAE).\n2.\tTRP emissions\nEmissions limits are specified as TRP as in the dynamic cellular environment where UE's can be considered as randomly located it is the Total Radiated Power (TRP) which dominated the average level of interference to adjacent networks rather than the instantaneous peak power.\nExamples of the TRP requirements are: Wanted signal power, unwanted emissions (ACLR, UEM, SEM) and Tx spurious emissions.\n3.\tCo-location requirements\nCo-location requirements are a new type of OTA requirements introduced in Rel-15 RAN4 BS specifications, which specify performance in co-location scenarios. OTA co-location requirements define the BS co-location scenario and specify power levels into and out of a Co-location Reference Antenna (CRA) placed next to the AAS BS.\nExamples of co-location requirements are: Tx OFF power, protection of RX, co-location emissions, TX IMD.\nReceiver requirements\nWith the exception of the receiver spurious emissions (which is TRP like the transmitter spurious emissions) all the receiver requirements are based on receiving a wanted signal at a specified power level, either on its own or in the presence of an interferer.\nThe OTA receiver requirements have 2 types of OTA sensitivity defined:\n1.\tOTA sensitivity - highest gain assumed hence lowest EIS.\nThe Rel-13/14 specification included OTA sensitivity requirement which was based on a declared range of angle of arrivals (RoAoA) for the UL signal. The OTA sensitivity requirement is by BS manufacturer declaration and was intended to capture the effects of the antenna (such as scan loss). Multiple declarations can be made with different EIS values and RoAoA's. One of the declarations will be based on the maximum antenna gain and hence will represent the best case EIS, this value is defined as OTA minimum sensitivity.\n2.\tOTA reference sensitivity - lowest gain assumed hence highest interferer levels.\nThe OTA reference sensitivity is the minimum level of sensitivity to be achieved over the OTA REFSEN RoAoA which is defined as the RoAoA determined by the contour defined by the points at which the achieved EIS is 3dB higher than the achieved EIS in the reference direction. It is equivalent to the sensitivity a passive system would achieve over the same RoAoA. The level is also used to specify the maximum interferers to be seen by each receiver unit input.\nEach of the interference requirements are specified with respect to:\n-\tthe OTA sensitivity, or\n-\tthe OTA reference sensitivity, or\n-\tBoth, depending on the nature of the requirement.\nFor in-band interference requirements (i.e. dynamic range, ACS ICS, in-band blocking, RX IMD) wanted and interferer signal are specified as having the same angle of arrival. The relative difference between the wanted signal and the interferer is the same as the conducted requirement in all cases.\nOut of band blocking requirement is specified as field strength (in V/m) and is the same for all frequencies. The wanted signal is an offset from EISminSENS.\nFor co-location blocking tests a radiated wanted signal, based on an offset from EISminSENS, is specified in the same way as the other interference requirements. The interferer is applied via CRA, the level of the interferer is specified at the conducted input to the CRA.\nEMC requirements\nEMC radiated emission requirements are already OTA and are hence merged into the RF radiated spurious emission requirements. As the RF requirements are dominant, the OTA emissions are captured in the BS RF specification and this is referenced from the RAN4 BS EMC specification.\nThe EMC radiated immunity requirements generate much higher interferer levels than the RF blocking requirements and hence the two aspects have to be separated. As the OTA AAS BS has an intentional radiator and its wanted performance is specified by the declared RoAoA, these 2 types of RAN4 requirements are separated by a spatial mask (i.e. so called spatial exclusion) with radiated immunity requirement only specified outside the declared RoAoA.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-171745\tWID -Enhancements of Base Station (BS) RF and EMC requirements for Active Antenna System (AAS)\n[2]\tRP-172344\teAAS Status Report to TSG (RAN#78)\n[3]\tTR 37.840\tStudy of Radio Frequency (RF) and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) requirements for Active Antenna Array System (AAS) base station\n[4]\tTR 37.842\tEvolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) Radio Frequency (RF) requirement background for Active Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS)\n[5]\tTR 37.843\tE-UTRA and UTRA Radio Frequency (RF) requirement background for Active Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS) radiated requirements\n[6]\tTS 37.105\tTechnical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Active Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS) transmission and reception\n[7]\tR4-1714387\tCR to TS 37.105: eAAS technical specification v.15.0.0\n[8]\tTS 37.114\tActive Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS) Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)\n[9]\tR4-1714386\tBig CR to TS 37.114: eAAS EMC specification, v15.0.0\n\n",

                            "text_content": "\nSummary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-172306.\nThe HS-SCCH is a downlink control channel used for scheduling HS-DSCH transmissions as well as for instructing the UE to perform specific actions via HS-SCCH orders. The HS-SCCH is monitored by the UE at all path-loss conditions within the cell, and according to current observations the HS-SCCH can become limiting and costly in bad radio conditions since the power invested in the HS-SCCH limits the available power for the HS-PDSCH.\nThe decoding of the HS-SCCH is performed by testing against all the codewords that can be carried over the HS-SCCH, since any of those codewords could have been transmitted in downlink. Nonetheless under bad radio conditions only a small subset of those codewords can occur in practice. In addition, the detection/decoding of the HS-SCCH part I (slot 0) needs to succeed before proceeding to decode the HS-SCCH part II (slot 1 & 2), meaning that the detection and decoding of slot 0 is a key aspect of the performance of the HS-SCCH.\nAccounting for the above technical aspects, and the investigations performed during the study item phase, it was concluded that the simplification on the HS-SCCH type 1 should consist of making \"known in advance\" the bits corresponding to the \"Modulation Scheme\" and the \"Number of codes\" (code group indicator bits).\nThe simplification of the HS-SCCH type 1 brings benefits in terms of BLER, an improved false detection, an improved miss detection, power savings in downlink (could be translated to coverage improvements), and backward compatibility.\nThe Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation enables the UE to determine when to expect HS-SCCH type 1 transmissions indicating one HS-PDSCH code and QPSK modulation scheme.\nThe legacy CQI reports are used as triggering mechanism when low CQI values (from 1 to 6) are reported from the UE to the network. In addition to the CQI based triggering mechanism, HS-SCCH orders can be used to create an interval where the HS-SCCH type 1 is received carrying one HS-PDSCH code and QPSK modulation scheme to extend the usage of the simplified HS-SCCH type 1 transmission independently of the radio conditions.\nFor both triggering mechanisms, once the UE has transmitted a CQI report over the HS-DPCCH, the UE may expect a HS-SCCH type 1 transmission carrying control information corresponding to one HS-PDSCH code and QPSK modulation scheme in the first available HS-SCCH subframe, once four sub-frames have passed after the end of the sub-frame where the HS-DPCCH was transmitted.\nWhen the network has transmitted a HS-SCCH order for stopping the transmission interval created by the HS-SCCH orders, a fall back to the CQI based triggering mechanism occurs.\nThe Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation is applicable for Cell_DCH state.\nThe UE indicates its capability support for Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation to the network. The network signals its support in RRC messages to the UE.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-171443, New Work Item proposal: on a Simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS, RAN #76\n[2]\tRP-171211, Status Report to TSG: Work Item on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS, RAN #77\n[3]\tTR-25709, Study on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS,\nRAN6#5\n[4]\tR6-170350, \"Introduction of Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation for UMTS,\" Ericsson.\n[5]\tR6-170420, Revision of R6-170350.\n[6]\tR6-170352, \"Introduction of Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation for UMTS, \" Ericsson.\n[7]\tR6-170419, Revision of R6-170352.\n[8]\tR6-170353, \"Introduction of Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation for UMTS,\" Ericsson.\n[9]\tR6-170354, \"On the simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation,\" Ericsson.\n[10]\tR6-170355, \"On the triggering mechanism for the simplified HS-SCCH based on legacy CQI reports,\" Ericsson.\n[11]\tR6-170356, \"Introduction of the triggering mechanism for the simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation,\" Ericsson.\n[12]\tR6-170407, Revision of R6-170356.\n[13]\tR6-170436, Revision of R6-170407.\n[14]\tR6-170357, \"On the triggering mechanism for the simplified HS-SCCH based on HS-SCCH orders, \" Ericsson.\n[15]\tR6-170358, \"Work plan for the WI on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS,\" Ericsson.\n[16]\tR6-170406, Revision of R6-170358.\n[17]\tR6-170363, \"Impacts on layer 2 and 3 specifications,\" Ericsson.\n[18]\tR6-170418, Revision of R6-170363.\n[19]\tR6-170364, \"Introduction of Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation for UMTS, \" Ericsson.\n[20]\tR6-170421, Revision of R6-170364.\n[21]\tR6-170424, \"LS on the WI of a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS,\" TSG RAN WG6.\n[22]\tR6-170409, \"Introduction of the HS-SCCH orders for the additional triggering mechanism based on HS-SCCH orders,\" TSG RAN WG6.\nRAN6#6\n[23]\tR6-170477, CR on \"Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation using HSDPA code offset reservation,\" Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell.\n[24]\tR6-170476, CR on \"Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation with HSDPACH code offset reservation,\" Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell.\n[25]\tR6-170475, CR on \"Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation with HSDPA code offset reservation,\" Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell.\n[26]\tR6-170474, CR on \"Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation with HSDPA code offset reservation,\" Nokia.\n[27]\tR6-170473, \"Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation using HSDPA code offset reservation, \" Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell.TSG RAN WG3\nRAN3#97\tNo TU.\nRAN3#97bis\n[28]\tR3-173988, \"RAN3 Impact: Work Item on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS,\" Ericsson.\n[29]\tR3-173989, \"Support on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS,\" Ericsson.\n[30]\tR3-173990, \"Support on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS,\" Ericsson.\nRAN3#98\n[31]\tR3-174820 RAN3 Impact: Enhancement proposal to UMTS WI simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation, Nokia Solutions & Networks (I).\n[32]\tR3-174824 Support on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS, Ericsson\n[33]\tR3-174825 Support on a simplified HS-SCCH for UMTS, Ericsson.\n",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.\n",

(This applies also for dual connectivity using E-UTRAN access.)\nAs mentioned in the summary for INOBEARRAN, the maximum number of EPS bearers has previously been limited to 8 since Rel-8 but it has become apparent that more than 8 radio bearers are needed to simultaneously support all the services that operators have been introducing. TSG SA agreed to work on a Rel-15 Work Item [1], which is a counterpart of INOBEARRAN, to ensure that 15 EPS bearers can be supported by the core network.\nE-UTRAN idle mode mobility and handover procedures are updated to support the additional EPS bearers. In networks that are only partly upgraded, mobility procedures to target nodes that do not support 15 EPS bearers result in bearers being released based on existing error handling procedures. Bearers will also be released if a UE that supports 15 bearers moves to UTRAN or GERAN, as GPRS core network and Radio Access networks do not support 15 PDP contexts.\nTo minimize the impact of releasing bearers as a result of mobility to non-supporting target nodes the MME should be able to allocate EPS bearer IDs in such way that the bearers with higher operator preference will be preserved in case of mobility involving legacy target nodes.\nIt is necessary for all PDN GWs in a PLMN to support 15 EPS bearers, and MME's can be configured to take into account whether the HPLMN supports 15 EPS bearers when selecting a PDN GW for a supporting UE. Inter-PLMN handover is also based on MME configuration.\n\n",

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.\nBased on the above provided background and depending on network dimensioning, which typically targets at data services, the VoLTE coverage may be a function of the selected codec and its configuration, its rate adaptation, and potentially the applied application layer redundancy, as well as the required QoS of the VoLTE bearer. It is adopted that a new QoS parameter Maximum Packet Loss Rate in UL and DL directions is defined and sent from PCRF to eNB. At reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the IMS service information e.g. codec and sends it to PCEF along with the PCC rule for the voice media. This parameter is transferred to the eNB to support it for handover threshold decision.\nBased on the analysis/evaluation of this eVoLP WID, the existing 3GPP 4G specifications TS 23.401, 23.203 and 5G specifications TS 23.501, 23.502, 23.503 have been modified according to it.\nReferences\n[1]\t\tSP-170935\t\"New WID for enhanced VoLTE performance\" (S2 aspects)\n[2] \tCP-173109 \"CT aspects on enhanced VoLTE performance\" (CT aspects)\n",

The untruncated name and some of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the terminating service provider.\nDescription\nThe eCNAM environment and functionality are depicted in Figure 1 2.8 .7 -1, showcasing the various components and functionalities of the eCNAM system. The figure illustrates the eCNAM environment, which includes the eCNAM server, eCNAM client, and eCNAM network. The eCNAM server is responsible for managing the eCNAM environment, while the eCNAM client is used to interact with the eCNAM environment. The eCNAM network is the backbone of the eCNAM system, connecting the eCNAM server and client. The figure also highlights the eCNAM network's architecture, including the eCNAM network core, eCNAM network switch, and eCNAM network router. The eCNAM network core is responsible for routing and forwarding the eCNAM packets, while the eCNAM network switch is responsible for switching the eCNAM packets between different network paths. The eCNAM network router is responsible for forwarding the eCNAM packets to the appropriate network path.

The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\nReferences\n[1]\tTS 22.173: \"IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) Multimedia Telephony Service and supplementary services\".\n[2]\tTS 24.196: \"Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals; Enhanced Calling Name (eCNAM)\".\n\n",

To facilitate proper time and frequency offset tracking and consistent channel estimation at the UE for the MIMO layer(s) transmitted by different TPs, the control signalling has been enhanced to support indication of up to two reference signals set (one per each set of MIMO layers) that can be used by the UE to obtain the correct reference for synchronization. Similarly, due to different reference signals configurations (e.g. CRS) at the TPs, physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) resources may not be the same for two sets of MIMO layers. The control signalling enhancement also specifies mechanism to indicate for the UE up to two sets of physical resource elements for PDSCH reception (one per each set of MIMO layers).\n-\tSupport of CSI feedback enhancement:\n-\tTo facilitate accurate link adaption in non-coherent joint transmission, enhancement to channel state information (CSI) reporting was introduced. The CSI enhancement facilitates reporting information on the preferred number of the MIMO layers, precoding information and channel quality information per each TPs under assumption of non-coherent joint transmission.

One scenario is a small cell setting with higher SINR, where LTE eNB communicate with stationary laptop or docked smartphone. Another scenario is that LTE eNB communicate with an outdoor above-rooftop or indoor customer premises equipment (CPE) which then delivers traffic to indoor users via other links.\nThis work item [1] specifies enhancements for unicast physical channels and related procedures and signalling to exploit the characteristics of stationary wireless links, specifically the support of 1024QAM and DMRS overhead reduction [2]. In addition, new UE categories are also specified supporting DL 1024QAM.\n1024QAM for DL channels.\nTo further improve spectral efficiency, 1024QAM can be configured for PDSCH to DL 1024QAM capable UEs. The constellation mapping is extended as following for bits.\n\n\nNew TBS indexes 34A, 35, 36, 37 and 37A and new MCS table corresponding to 1024QAM have been specified. When configured, the UE will monitor DL DCI assignments with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SPS-C-RNTI of DCI formats other than 1A and 1C to use the newly introduced MCS table and TBS indexes to support 1024QAM. New CQI table has also been introduced with entries supporting 1024QAM. This allows configured UEs to feedback CQI with spectral efficiency supported by 1024QAM. In addition, UE capability for support of 1024QAM is reported per band/band combination.\nRF EVM for DL 1024QAM\nTo achieve the benefits of high order modulation, the EVM requirement needs to be fulfilled at eNB side. EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) is a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the transmitted symbols after equalization, which is critical to the performance of data channels. The required EVM at LTE eNB is 2.5% for 1024QAM.\nDMRS overhead reduction\nThe DMRS overhead for TM9/10 is reduced by using OCC4 for DL SU-MIMO rank 3 or 4. With the introduced DMRS overhead reduction, the DMRS overhead is reduced by a half and the spectral efficiency is increased. New entries are added to the DMRS table (the table for Antenna port(s), scrambling identity and number of layers indication) to support the scheduling of PDSCH with reduced DMRS.\nRel-15 UE DL Categories\nDL UE category 20 is updated to support DL 1024QAM. New DL UE categories have been specified with support of 1024QAM as below:\n-\tDL Category 22 with peak data rate 2.3-2.5Gbps\n-\tDL Category 23 with peak data rate 2.7-2.8Gbps\n-\tDL Category 24 with peak data rate 2.9-3Gbps\n-\tDL Category 25 with peak data rate 3.1-3.3Gbps\n-\tDL Category 26 with peak data rate 3.4-3.5Gbps\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-171738, \"Revised WID: Enhancements for high capacity stationary wireless link and introduction of 1024 QAM for LTE DL\", Huawei, HiSilicon, Qualcomm Incorporated, China Telecom, RAN#77, Sapporo, Japan, September 2017.\n[2]\tRP-180852, \"Status report for WI: Enhancements for high capacity stationary wireless link and introduction of 1024 QAM for LTE DL\", Huawei, HiSilicon, RAN#80.\n\n",

During T2 time periods, the UE reduces its CRS (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) to 1 Mbps, ensuring efficient use of the available bandwidth.\nFigure 13.3-1: A UE assumes full-bandwidth CRS in T1, N1, and N2 periods, and reduced CRS during T2 time periods.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-181315, WID for LTE Work Item on UE requirements for network-based CRS mitigation, June 2018.\n[2]\tR4-1707709, Time plan for network-based CRS interference mitigation WI, Ericsson, Aug. 2018.\n[3]\tR4-1709102, WF on network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, Nokia, Aug. 2018.\n[4]\tR4-1708732, WF for performance part for network-based CRS-IM, Ericsson, Aug. 2018.\n[5]\tR4-1714498, Way Forward on RRM with network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, Nov. 2018.\n[6]\tR4-1714495, Way forward for CRS-IM related advanced receiver impact analysis for network-based CRS-IM, Ericsson, Nov. 2018.\n[7]\tR4-1803172, WF on UE demodulation for network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, Feb. 2018.\n[8]\tR4-1805558, LS on network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, April 2018.\n[9]\tR4-1806016, WF on network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, April 2018.\n[10]\tR4-1808479, RAN4 LS to RAN2, LS on UE capability for network-based CRS-IM, May 2018.\n[11]\tR4-1808528, CR to TS 36.133, Introduction of network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, May 2018.\n[12]\tR4-1811735, CR to TS 36.133, Applicability requirement for network-based CRS-IM, Qualcomm, Aug. 2018.\n[13]\tR4-1811864, WF for demodulation performance requirements for network-based CRS interference mitigation, Ericsson, Aug. 2018.\n\n",

The eNB can configure the UE to use UDC or not. If UDC is configured for a DRB, ROHC is not used for that DRB. One byte UDC header is introduced to indicate whether the PDCP PDU is compressed by UDC or not, whether the compression buffer is reset or not, and 4 validation bits of checksum to check whether the compression and decompression buffers are synchronous. For each DRB, at most 8192 bytes compression buffer is used. If there are some errors or failure due to buffer mismatching, the eNB can send an error notification control PDU to the UE, the UE may reset the compression buffer.\nTo improve compression efficiency of the first few packets, two types of pre-defined dictionary can be used for UDC. One is standard dictionary for SIP and SDP signalling as defined in RFC 3485, and another is operator defined dictionary. The eNB could configure whether or which dictionary is used for a UDC DRB.\nUDC related capabilities are also defined in UE capability. There are three capabilities: supporting basic UDC function; supporting standard dictionary and supporting operator defined capability. If the UE supporting operator defined capability, it should also report the version of the dictionary and the associated PLMN ID to assist the eNB to identify the dictionary stored by the UE. The eNB should configure UDC according to UE capabilities.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-180914\tRevised WID on UL data compression in LTE\tCATT, CMCC\n[2]\tRP-180911\tStatus Report for WI: UL data compression in LTE\tCATT\n[3]\tR2-1806964\tIntroduction of DEFLATE based UDC Solution (36.323 CR)\tCATT\n[4]\tR2-1813089\tIntroduction of DEFLATE based UDC Solution (36.331 CR)\tCATT\n[5]\tR2-1806966\tIntroduction of DEFLATE based UDC Solution (36.306 CR)\tCATT\n[6]\tR2-1806963\tIntroduction of DEFLATE based UDC Solution (36.300 CR)\tCATT\n\n",

                            "text_content": "With a reduced processing time for 1 ms TTI, the processing time from DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission is reduced from the currently assumed n+4 timing (meaning three subframe processing time) to n+3.\nThe reduction in the specifications are referred to short processing time and applies to all frame structure types, i.e. FS1, FS2 and FS3.\nThe short processing time is illustrated in Figure 13.8-1 for FS1.\nThe figure depicts a short processing time for FS1, which is a key component in the 3.8-1 system. FS1 is responsible for processing the input data and determining the appropriate action to be taken. The figure shows the processing time in milliseconds, which is a crucial metric for evaluating the efficiency of the system.\nFigure 13.8-1: Short processing time for FS1\nAlso for FS2, the minimum processing time is reduced, although restrictions on the DL/UL configuration limits the processing time reduction achievable.\nFor scheduling, only PDCCH based scheduling is supported, i.e. SPS is not supported with n+3 timing for UL and DL. A fallback operation to the legacy timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space (CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\nShort processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission.\nShort processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous (n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the same time.\nSimilar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to 3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy value -1).\nSRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being configured for SRS transmission.\nWhen the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE. A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.\n",

                            "text_content": "In addition to reducing the processing time, the WI also included the work to reduce the TTI from 1 ms to what is referred to as either a subslot, or slot transmission, also referred to as short TTI, sTTI. A slot transmission is simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission duration.\nThe subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot operation is not defined for lDataStart=4.\nThe figure depicts the subslot division in a 13.8-2 system, illustrating the division of subframes into DL and UL subslots. The DL subslots are numbered from 0 to 5, while the UL subslots are numbered from 6 to 12. The figure shows the division of subframes into DL and UL subslots, with the DL subslots being numbered from 0 to 5 and the UL subslots being numbered from 6 to 12.\nFigure 13.8-2: DL and UL subslot subframe division (subslot number 0,..,5)\nThe slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.\nThe combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table 1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.\nIn a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH. However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for sTTI.\nTable 13.8-2: DL/UL combinations of subslot/slot operation\n\nThe physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table 13.8-3.\nTable 13.8-3: Physical channels for slot and subslot operation\n\nAs can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels (PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration (including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated in Figure 13.8-3.\nA fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control. Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\nThe figure depicts a schematic illustration of a subslot operation in a 3.8-3 GHz optical system, illustrating the operation of the subslot channel (SPDCCH) and the use of sub-wavelength division multiplexing (SPDM) for efficient data transmission.\nFigure 13.8-3: 1 os SPDCCH illustration for subslot operation\nBoth CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3 symbols).\nTo efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data, illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).\nThe figure depicts a re-use of SPDCCH (Single-Photon-Demonstrated Channel) for PDSCH (Passive Optical Short-Channel) in a 4x4 MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) system. This re-use allows for efficient use of the channel and reduces the need for additional hardware. The figure shows the re-use of SPDCCH in the 4x4 MIMO configuration, with the re-use of the same SPDCCH for both PDSCH and PDCCH (Passive Optical Channel) in the same system. This re-use reduces the number of hardware components and simplifies the system design.\nFigure 13.8-4: SPDCCH re-use for PDSCH\nTo further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario where the use of Ultra-Low-Band (ULB) sharing is demonstrated. This is achieved through the use of Dynamic Multiplexing and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology. The figure illustrates the various components involved in the network, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the distributed nodes. The figure also highlights the use of redundancy paths to ensure reliability and failover.\nFigure 13.8-5: UL sharing of DMRS\nThe specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining orthogonality between UEs.\nThe figure depicts a 6-port DMRS (Digital Multiplex Relay System) with a UL (Unified Layer) multiplexing scheme. The DMRS is designed to support multiple digital signals, with each port being dedicated to a specific digital signal. The figure illustrates the multiplexing process, where each port is used to transmit a different digital signal. The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different digital signals and their corresponding ports.\nFigure 13.8-6: UL multiplexing of DMRS\nAs with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC (depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).\nTable 13.8-4: Processing timelines for slot and subslot operation with associated maximum timing advance\n\nThe number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).\nA new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-171468, Revised WI on shortened TTI and processing time for LTE, source Ericsson.

This could result in interference and issues with mobility. This WI aimed to address such issues. Below is a description of the enhancements introduced as part of this WI.\nTS 36.331 was extended with two reporting events H1 and H2. With these two new events, the UE triggers a height report when the UE's altitude is above(H1) or below(H2) of an eNB-configured threshold. Further, the RRM measurement framework was extended such that the UE can be configured to trigger a measurement report if an event condition is met for a configurable number of cells. Events applicable for this enhancement are A3, A4 and A5. These enhancements help the eNB to determine that a UE is flying and/or allow to detect that the UE may be causing or experiencing interference.\nTo improve mobility performance, RRC signalling was added to allow the UE to indicate to the eNB the planned flight path. More specifically, the UE can indicate where the UE is planned to be in the future which could be taken into account by the eNB for mobility purposes, e.g. the eNB may be able to use this information to know in advance which cell would be suitable for the UE to be handed over to and if a new X2 connection is beneficial to be established.\nIn some countries it may not be allowed to fly drones which are connected to LTE network without authorization. In order for the network to know if the user of the UE has a suitable subscription, a signalling from the CN to the eNB was introduced with information about whether the subscription supports Aerial UE function. How the eNB uses this information was left for implementation.\nTo reduce possible uplink interference, UL power control enhancements were specified allowing for UE-specific fractional pathloss compensation factor, and the range of the UE specific P0 parameter was also extended.\nFor more details please refer to the status report [3] and associated CRs [4-5].\nReferences\n[1]\tTR 36.777 Study on Enhanced LTE Support for Aerial Vehicles\n[2]\tRP-172826 New WID on Enhanced LTE Support for Aerial Vehicles\n[3]\tRP-181643 Status report for Enhanced LTE Support for Aerial Vehicles\n[4]\tR2-1813412 Introduction of Release-15 Aerial functionality\n[5]\tR2-1813487 Introduction of capabilities for Rel-15 Aerial WI\n\n",

This is addressed by IDLE mode measurements for CA, allowing SCell state configuration by RRC, allowing separate CQI reporting configuration, introducing a dormant Scell state for faster Scell state transitions and allowing common Scell configuration to reduce signalling overhead. Changes triggered by the work item are captured into TS 36-series specifications in [3][4][5][6]\nThe key functionalities introduced in this work item include the following:\n-\tUE measurements during IDLE mode: the eNB may assign UE to do measurements during IDLE that the network can use for when the UE enters CONNECTED mode.\n-\tThis may include limitations on which cells are measured, how long the measurements are done and in which cells the measurements are applicable.\n-\tUE indicates the availability of the measurements at connection setup, and network decides whether to query them via RRC reporting.\n-\tDormant Scell state: A new Scell state called dormant state is introduced. While in dormant state, UE measures and reports CQI/RRM measurements but doesn't decode PDCCH.\n-\tNew MAC CE is introduced to control the dormant state transitions.\n-\tDirect Scell state configuration: The Scell state may be configured to be activated or dormant via RRC.\n-\tThis means e.g. that the SCell state may be indicated in handover or at reconfiguration, allowing the SCell to be used\n-\tShort CQI reporting: After Scell activation, UE may be configured to have an alternative (short) CQI reporting cycle to allow UEs to indicate faster when Scell is activated.\n-\tAfter a fixed period of time, UE switches back to using the regular CQI configuration.\n-\tCommon Scell configuration: A common configuration applying to multiple SCells may be provided to UE to allow signalling optimizations.\n-\tThis is done via SCell configuration groups that allow to define common Scell parameters specific to all Scells belonging to the group. SCell dedicated configuration can be used to override the common parameters in the group configuration to allow changing some parameters only to some SCells.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-180561, Revised WID on Enhancing CA Utilization, Nokia, RAN#79\n[2]\tR2-1809245, UE capability definitions for euCA, Nokia, RAN2#102\n[3]\tR2-1809246, Stage-2 description of euCA, Nokia, RAN2#102\n[4]\tR2-1809269, MAC functionality for euCA, Nokia, RAN2#102\n[5]\tR2-1813087, RRC signalling for euCA, Nokia, RAN2#103\n\n\n",

These WIs are shown in the table below.\nStructure of the \"Management and orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing\" Feature\n\nManagement and orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing\nThe basic concepts for Management Services (defined in TS 28.533) are:\n-\tA management service combines elements of management service component type A, B and C. Where\n-\tcomponent type A is a group of management operations and/or notifications agnostic of managed entities.\n-\tcomponent type B is the management information represented by information model of managed entities (e.g. NRM).\n-\tcomponent type C is performance information of the managed entity and fault information of the managed entity.\n-\tA management service offers management capabilities. These management capabilities are accessed by management service consumers via standardized service interface composed of individually specified management service components.\n-\tThe management services can be consumed by another entity, which may in turn produce (expose) the service to other entities.\n-\tInteractions between management service producer and management service consumer use following paradigms:\n-\t\"Request-response\": A management service producer is requested by a management service consumer to invoke an operation, which either performs an action or provides information or both. The management service producer provides response based on the request by management service consumer.\n-\t\"Subscribe-notify\": A management service consumer requests a management service producer to establish a subscription to receive network events via notifications, under the filter constraint specified in this operation.\nThe generic management services concept, defined in TS 28.530, follows the management service concepts as defined in TS 28.533. The specification includes the following information:\n-\tGeneric provisioning management service (operations and notifications),\n-\tGeneric fault supervision management service (operations and notifications).\n-\tGeneric performance assurance management service (operations and notifications),\n-\tRESTful HTTP-based solution set of provisioning.\n-\tRESTful HTTP-based solution set of fault supervision.\nProvisioning of 5G networks and network slicing\nThe following functionalities related to provisioning are defined in TS 28.531, TS 28.532 and TS 28.541:\n-\tProvisioning procedures for networks and network slicing.\n-\tProtocol-independent information model of network slice and network slice subnet.\n-\tManagement services for provisioning of networks and network slicing.\n-\tRESTful HTTP-based solution set of provisioning.\n-\tThe stage 3 NRM solution sets (XML, JSON, YANG) for network slicing.\nFault Supervision for 5G networks and network slicing\nFault Supervision is one of the fundamental functions for the management of a 5G network and its communication services. This work item specifies the following aspects of fault supervision for 5G networks and network slicing:\n1)\tFault Supervision (FS); Stage 1, which includes:\n-\tThe definitions of fault supervision related management services\n-\tThe use cases and requirements for fault supervision of 5G networks and network slicing.\n2)\tFault Supervision (FS); Stage 2 and stage 3, which includes:\n-\tThe definition of interfaces of the fault supervision related management services; (Stage 2)\n-\tThe definition of notifications; (Stage 2)\n-\tThe definition of alarm related information models (e.g. alarmInformation, alarmList, etc.); (Stage 2)\n-\tThe definition of solution set(s) (e.g. RESTful HTTP-based solution set for Fault Supervision); (Stage 3)\nThe stage 1 part is documented in TS 28.545 [13] and the stage 2 and stage 3 parts are documented in clause 6 and clause 9 of TS 28.532 [10].\nPerformance assurance for 5G networks including network slicing\nThe performance assurance of 5G networks and network slicing relies on a set of management services with the relevant management data (e.g. performance measurements and KPIs).\nThe management services in terms of performance assurance include the measurement job control service, performance data file reporting service, performance data streaming service, and management data analytics service (MDAS). The performance data includes performance measurements and KPIs for NFs, NSSIs and NSIs. The performance data of NSSI are generated based on the aggregation and calculation of performance data of NFs, and the performance data of NSIs are produced based on the aggregation and calculation of performance of data of NSSIs and NFs.\nThe performance assurance related management services are defined in TS 28.550 [14].\nThe performance measurements and KPIs for 5G networks are defined in TS 28.552 [15] and TS 28.554 [16] respectively.\nNetwork Resource Model (NRM) for 5G networks and network slicing\nTo support management and orchestration of 5G network and network slicing, several Network Resource Model (NRM) related specifications were added or enhanced including TS 28.540 [17], TS 28.541 [18], TS 28.622 [19], TS 28.623 [20], TS 28.626 [21] and TS 28.658 [22]. The specifications include the following information:\n-\t5G Network Resource Model use cases and requirements\n-\tGeneric NRM information service and solution set\n-\t5G RAN NRM information service and solution set\n-\t5G Core NRM information service and solution set\n-\tNetwork Slice NRM information service and solution set\n5G Trace management\nThe work item introduced 5G system (including both NG-RAN and 5GC) Trace in following aspects:\n-\t5G Trace use case and requirements in TS 32.421 [23].\n-\t5G Trace session activation and deactivation mechanism (including both management based and signalling based Trace activation and deactivation) in TS 32.422 [24].\n-\t5G Trace control and configuration parameter definitions in TS 32.422 [24].\n-\t5G Trace record data definitions in TS 32.423 [25].\nThe objective of this WI is to enhance the interactions between 3GPP management system and supporting external management systems (e.g., ETSI NFV MANO) to support the management of 5GC and NG-RAN where a gNB is split into a CU (Centralized Unit) that can be implemented as VNF, and a DU (Distributed Unit) that can be implemented as PNF, with the F1 interface between CU and DU.\nReferences\nTS 28.530:\t\"Management and orchestration; Concepts, use cases and requirements\"\nTS 28.532:\t\"Management and orchestration; Generic management services\"\nTS 28.533:\t\"Management and orchestration; Architecture framework\"\nTS 28.531:\t\"Management and orchestration; Provisioning\"\nTS 28.545:\t\"Management and orchestration; Fault supervision\"\nTS 28.550:\t\"Management and orchestration; Performance assurance\"\nTS 28.552:\t\"Management and orchestration; 5G performance measurements and assurance data\"\nTS 28.554:\t\"Management and orchestration; 5G end to end Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\"\nTS 28.540:\t\"Management and orchestration; 5G Network Resource Model (NRM); Stage 1\"\nTS 28.541:\t\"Management and orchestration; 5G Network Resource Model (NRM); Stage 2 and stage 3\"\nTS 28.623:\t\"Telecommunication management; Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions\"\nTS 28.622:\t\"Telecommunication management; Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)\"\nTS 28.626:\t\"Telecommunication management; State management data definition Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions\"\nTS 28.658:\t\"Telecommunication management; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)\"\nTS 32.421:\t\"Telecommunication management; Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace concepts and requirements\"\nTS 32.422:\t\"Telecommunication management; Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace control and configuration management\"\nTS 32.423:\t\"Telecommunication management; Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace data definition and management\"\n",

It can be found in the table located just below the clause's header. The table has the following format:\nTable B-1: table format\n\nFor readability reasons, the table headers are omitted in the continuation of the present document.\nFor instance, for the \"Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment\", the table has to be understood as:\nTable B-2: Example of table at the introduction of each Feature\n\nThus, the UID for this Work Item is 700029.\nTwo methods are now possible to retrieve more information on a given feature: the \"Step by step method\" and the \"Direct method\".
