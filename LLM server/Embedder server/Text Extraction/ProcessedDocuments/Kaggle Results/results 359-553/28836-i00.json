                    "text_content": "Intent-driven management solution tries to relieve the consumer of the management system from (artificial) complexity. In the end the consumer of a management system is not interested in instances of IOC like NetworkSlice, which are concepts introduced to manage slices by classical configuration management. Instead, the consumer of a management system wants to request mobile communication for UE -without the need to know about details of the management system.\nThe management system needs to offer the flexibility as provided by the network architecture described in TS 23.501 [6], while at the same time any request needs to obey to the limitations of the architecture. The following paragraphs give a brief summary of the basic concepts of QoS and slicing which are the basis for intent-driven management of network slices.\nThe QoS framework (clause 5.7) and network slicing (clause 5.15) are two independent key features of the 3GPP mobile network architecture [6]. According to TS 23.501 [6]:\n-\tOne network slice (identified by its S-NSSAI) supports one or more PDU Connectivity Service (\"PDU sessions”) i.e. services that provide exchange of PDUs between a UE and a data network identified by a DNN.\n-\tEach PDU connectivity service contains one or more QoS flows, which might be of different QoS characteristics and which all terminate at the same DNN via the same UPF.\n-\tEach QoS flow is associated to one \"requested” QoS profile and additionally might be associated to \"alternative” QoS profiles. Depending on the experienced network conditions the network can switch between these QoS profiles.\nOn one hand this concept is the basis to use network slices as internal means for the network operator to partition the network in a way, that QoS flows of similar QoS characteristics are grouped to PDU connectivity services that are tagged by the same S-NSSAI. This specific combination of QoS and network slicing results in that network slices as a whole might be optimized for certain traffic, i.e. to optimize certain NF specifically for the assigned traffic and to assign these NF in NRF to the S-NSSAI. An operator might prepare several of such network slices for traffic of different QoS characteristics; Once a customer requests a PDU connectivity service that matches the QoS characteristics of such prepared network slice, the operator assigns the PDU connectivity services to the correspondingly optimized network slice.\nOn the other hand, the concept offers the flexibility for CSP and NOP to offer to CSCs a dedicated network slice as a product, that carries all PDU connectivity services as the CSC requires, potentially towards different DNNs (e.g., local breakout in the tenants computing centre, public voice to IMS, and towards public internet), while each PDU connectivity service might carry multiple QoS flows of different QoS.\nThis flexibility enables the CSC to request PDU connectivity services that are terminating at DNN as required by the CSC (e.g. breakout at local UPF) and that carry QoS flows of specific QoS characteristics. Depending on technical bordering conditions of the requested PDU connectivity services and by the business model of CSP and NOP, CSP or NOP might use the S-NSSAI to group PDU connectivity services to network slices.\n",

                    "text_content": "One of the drivers of adoption of 5G in the Telecoms industry is support for network slicing. The management solution for network slicing enables an operator to provision a network slice, to do fault supervision and performance assurance of a network slice. Over time more features have been specified to make network slice management more efficient and effective, one example is the ability to create and monitor closed control loops that automatically adjust the network resources to assure that the goals specified in a service profile or slice profile are continuously met without manual intervention. The granularity of this solution is that of ServiceProfile/NetworkSlice and SliceProfile/NetworkSliceSubnet, the fulfilment information is reported on the granularity of a ServiceProfile/SliceProfile.\n- \tCurrently the standards support an MnS consumer to request provision of a NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet using the mechanism in TS 28.531 [3], and to assure the performance using the mechanism in TS 28.536 [8], see reference [8], this means that a consumer handles two separate requests to provision and to assure a NetworkSlice as the consumer does not know the ServiceProfile Id and may not know the NetworkSlice Id both of which are needed as input to closed loop assurance (fulfilment). With the introduction of intent, the consumer can combine the provisioning and assurance requirements in a single request for an intent which contains a combination of a network slice provisioning expectation and a network slice assurance expectation.\n-\tAllows decoupling the lifecycle management of network slice requirements from the lifecycle management of the actual network slice. This enables MnS consumer to focus on expressing network slicing requirements (and obtain fulfilment information for those requirements), without knowing how to deal with the detailed management of a network slice. The latter is on MnS producer side.\n-\tWith an intent driven management solution, the consumer automatically receives information about the intent fulfilment status which simplifies the interaction with the producer.\n-\tSimplified approach, allows using one single unified solution to support the wide variety of slice management functionalities which can be fulfilled by different solutions with the existing slicing management approach, including;\n-\tNetwork Slice provisioning allocation/deallocation functionality. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by (de-)allocateNSI operation or CRUD operations defined in TS 28.531[3].\n-\tNetwork Slice modification, query functionality. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by CRUD operation with Network slicing NRM fragment defined in TS 28.532 [9] and TS 28.541[4].\n-\tNetwork Slice SLS assurance functionality. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by CRUD operation with Assurance closed control loop NRM fragment defined in TS 28.532 [9] and TS 28.536 [8].\n-\tNetwork Slice Feasibility check. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by CRUD operation with feasibility check NRM fragment defined in TS 28.532 [9] and TS 28.541[4].\n-\tIn current TS 28.531[3] solutions, when the consumer needs to be more aware of concerns such as the timing and sequencing of CM changes required to modify the NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet requirements.  For example, the consumer needs to issue requests to the MnS producer, monitor the results and issue subsequent requests carefully as the producer will initiate each provisioning procedure upon receiving each request.\n-\tWith an intent driven management solution, the consumer does not need to be aware of the underlying provisioning procedures.  The consumer simply modifies their requirements, and the producer decides whether and when a provisioning procedure will be initiated.  This can provide the convenience and benefit for Intent driven MnS consumer to express and modify the network slice expectations and its interactions provided by a more MnS consumer friendly management capability.\n- \tThe object in case of using the intent interface is the intent's object type, the fulfilment information can be reported at the level that matches the requirements of the MnS consumer at the intent level. This is independent of the internal object type(s) used by the producer to fulfil the intent.\n- \tFor an MnS consumer it is easier to express the network slice expectations including requirements, goals and constraints using the data structures used for intent.\n-\tAn MnS consumer does not have to have the knowledge about the relations between NetworkSlice provisioning and assurance, or between NetworkSliceSubnet provisioning and assurance.\n",

For further details on the different intent categories, see TS 28.312 [5], clause 4.1.2.\nThe figure depicts a potential solution for intent-driven management to deliver a network slice, illustrating the steps involved in managing network slices. It includes a network slice, a network slice management system, and a network slice management tool. The figure shows the network slice as a small, isolated area within the network, and the network slice management system as a centralized system that manages the network slices. The network slice management tool is a user interface that allows network operators to manage and control network slices.

The intent is initially validated by the Intent Validation module, which verifies:\ni) \tthe compliance of the intent format with the information model defined in TS 28.312 [5]; and\nii) \tthe consistency among the intent expectations that constitute the whole intent.\nThe intent asks for the accommodation of the requirements of one or more communication services.\nOnce validated, the intent is sent over to the Intent Translation module, which is in charge of translating the intent semantics into a number of executable actions. In this case, the executable actions consist of provisioning and activation of one or more network slice instances, re-using one or more existing network slice instances, re-configuring one or more existing network slice instances or a combination of them. To trigger the resulting executable actions, the Intent Translation module consumes management services produced by the network slice provisioning service [3].\nNOTE: \tIn case of new or updated network slices, the ServiceProfile [4] is also elaborated by the Intent Translation module on the basis of the intent expectations.\nFinally, after the enforcement of executable actions, there is a need to verify whether the intent is fulfilled or not. In this vein, the Intent Fulfilment Evaluation module is defined. This module makes use of information retrieved from network slice provisioning service, and computes a validation result. This result is included in the intent report which is sent back to the intent owner.\n",

Based on the definition for service profile, it is obvious that service profile represents MnS consumer's expectations for network slice, which is aligned with intent definition (expectations including requirements, goals and constraints given to a 3GPP system, without specifying how to achieve them).\nFollowing are some benefits to introduce the intent driven approach for network slice compared to existing slice solution:\n- \tSimplified approach, allows using one single unified solution (CRUD operation with intent NRM fragment) to support the wide variety of slice management functionalities which fulfilled by different solutions in the existing slicing management approach, including\n-\tNetwork Slice provisioning allocation/deallocation functionality. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by (de-)allocateNSI operation defined in TS 28.531[3].\n-\tNetwork Slice modification, query functionality. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by CRUD operation with Network slicing NRM fragment defined in TS 28.532 [9] and TS 28.541[4].\n-\tNetwork Slice SLS assurance functionality. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by CRUD operation with Assurance closed control loop NRM fragment defined in TS 28.532 [9] and TS 28.536 [8].\n-\tNetwork Slice Feasibility check. In existing slicing management approach, this is implemented by CURD operation with feasibility check NRM fragment defined in TS 28.532 [9] and TS 28.541[4].\n-\tAllows decoupling the lifecycle management of network slice requirements from the lifecycle management of the actual network slice. This enables MnS consumer to focus on expressing network slicing requirements (and obtain fulfilment information for those requirements), without knowing how to deal with the detailed management of a network slice. The latter is on MnS producer side.\nCurrently the ServiceProfile is modelled as a set of properties, while IntentExpectation is composed of expectationObject, expectationTargets and expectationContexts, so it is necessary to investigate each attribute in ServiceProfile to identify which attribute can be represented by which intent expectation components (including expectationObject, expectationTargets and expectationContexts).\nFollowing subclauses give the detailed solution for how to model service profile as intent expectation and how to model slice subnet profiles for RAN and CN as intent expectations.\nNOTE: Whether the exact mapping between the ServiceProfile attributes and IntentExpectation components is to be standardised is not adressed in the present document.\n",
