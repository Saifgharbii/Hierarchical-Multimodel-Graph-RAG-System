This implies that each packet in a QoS flow is treated according to the same QoS requirements.\nFor XR/media services, a group of packets are used to carry payloads of a PDU Set (e.g. a frame, video slice/tile).\nIn media layer, packets in such a PDU Set are decoded/handled as a whole. For example, the frame/video slice may only be decoded in case all or certain amount of the packets carrying the frame/video slice are successfully delivered. For example, a frame within a GOP (Group of Pictures) can only be decoded by the client in case all frames on which that frame depends are successfully received. Hence the groups of packets within the PDU Set have inherent dependency on each other in media layer. Without considering such dependencies between the packets within the PDU set, 5GS may perform a scheduling with low efficiency. For example, the 5GS may randomly drop packet (s) but try to deliver other packets of the same PDU set which are useless to the client and thus waste radio resources.\nAlso audio samples, haptics applications or remote control operations may benefit if the 5GS considers the PDU Set characteristics.\nIf such dependency between packets of a PDU Set (e.g. a frame/video slice) can be considered, it's possible to enhance the efficiency and promote user experience.\nThis key issue proposes to study PDU Set integrated packet handling in 5G network, in which the group of packets belongs to a same PDU Set will be handled in an integrated manner.

The Requested 5G Delay Difference can be added in policy rule.\nIn order to guarantee the delay difference no larger than the delay difference threshold, the PCF may trigger the QoS monitoring for the specific couple of flows, in order to get the real-time end-to-end delays, and calculate the delay difference. If the PCF finds the delay difference is larger than the AF required delay difference threshold, the PCF may notify such information to AF as well as the real-time delay values for the couple of flows.\nIf the AF requires that the 5GS should keep the delay difference less than the threshold, the PCF may adjust the PCC rules for one or each of the couple of flows e.g. using alternative QoS profile, or adjust QoS parameters e.g. using a standardized 5QI with minimize the delay difference value,.

The step 4 and step 5 can be triggered for multiple times according to the number of UE IP address in AF request in step 2.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NEF triggers the BSF discovery twice with the UE 1 IP address and UE 2 IP address respectively. Based on the NRF response in which contains the available lists of BSFs, the NEF decides the available BSF that can serve both of the UE 1 and UE 2. After that, the NEF can provide the BSF IP address towards the PCF 1 and PCF 2 in step 6 or step 8, that help the both PCFs to determine to use the same BSF as AF.\n5.\tThe BSF provide the PCF address(es), PCF instance ID which related to each UE respectively to NEF.

The more efficient decoding means the less data throughput but the more power consumption. Hence, the data transmission rate can help the server to do the decision more efficient. The server has supported monitoring the E2E service data rate, but it is still beneficial to report the UE data rate in 5GS link, since it can help the server to judge the bottle neck is in 5GS or the other transport network between the server and the client.\n<The normal data transmission interruption event>\nAdditionally, due to UE mobility, the UE handover/redirection may cause the data transmission interrupt for a while, i.e. the data rate=0 event. After the handover/redirection finished, the data rate will be resumed. For this event, it is not necessary for the server to decrease its service data throughput or increase the decoding efficiency. Otherwise, as the log figure shown, T1 is the start time of UE handover/redirection, T2 is the end time of handover/redirection, during the period between T2 and T3, there is no data transmission. The reason is Application server stop the service data transmission when it monitors the link data rate decreases to 0. Actually, the server doesn't need to stop the data transmission, since it is the normal data transmission interruption and will recover soon.\nThe figure depicts a log for the UE redirection procedure, which is a crucial step in ensuring the proper routing of data packets in a 5G network. The log includes details such as the time of the redirection, the destination IP address, and the reason for the redirection. This information is crucial for troubleshooting and maintaining the network's performance.\nFigure 6.5.2-1: Log for UE redirection procedure\n<The congestion information>\nThe congestion information could reflect the degree of RAN congestion and performance of the NG-RAN for the service. This information could be obtained by the NG-RAN. It could help the application server to take certain actions, e.g. adjust the codec method, timely to better fit the network conditions.\nNOTE:\tThe definition of congestion needs coordination with RAN WGs.\nHence, exposure of the UE data rate for the XRM and the normal data transmission interruption event, and the congestion information is beneficial for the server to adjust its codec and data throughput.\nAt release#17, the UPF has already supported to exposure the UE data rate for a QoS flow granularity but the procedure is not defined. The solution proposes to allocate QoS monitoring rule for the UPF to measure and report the data rate for a QoS flow.\nThe normal data transmission interruption is due to UE handover, redirection. In general, during UE handover/redirection procedure, the data transmission is interrupted. But when UE and RAN support DAPS handover as defined in TS 38.300 [8], the data transmission is not interrupted. Furthermore, intra RAN handover/redirection is transparent to the CN. Hence, only the NG RAN can suitable detect the normal data transmission interruption event.\nThe solution is based on the existing Network Exposure functionality with the following enhancement:\n-\tThe AF subscribes the data rate for the service flow, the normal data transmission interruption event of the UE, and the congestion information.\n-\tThe PCF generates the QoS monitoring policies for the data rate measurement, the normal data transmission interruption event measurement, the congestion information measurement.\n-\tThe SMF generates the QoS Monitoring configuration for UPF: data rate measurement indication, data rate measure frequency, date rate report threshold.\n-\tThe SMF generates the QoS Monitoring configuration for RAN: normal data transmission interruption event measurement indication, congestion information measurement indication.\n-\tThe UPF enables the data rate measurement and report the measured data rate. The UPF also detects and reports the normal data transmission interruption and the congestion information.\n-\tThe RAN reports the congestion information and the normal data transmission interruption event ( i.e. the data transmission interruption due to handover or redirection) to the UPF.\n",

The available mean bit rate is the bitrate with a time windows, e.g. averaging windows, i.e. the (default) averaging windows (e.g. 2000ms in the Table 5.7.4-1 of TS 23.501 [2]) is also applicable to the Non-GBR 5QI. The available mean bitrate is the bitrate that can be provided by the non-GBR QoS Flow based on the available scheduling radio resource to the non-GBR QoS Flow, The available mean bitrate can be treated as the near-future bitrate and is not the measured value of the current bitrate in the radio interface for the non-GBR QoS Flow. Since the APN-AMBR are shared by the non-GBR QoS Flows, the available mean bitrate for a non-GBR QoS Flow can be (near) to the APN-AMBR. If the change of the available mean bitrate is over a threshold based on the available scheduling radio resources for the non-GBR QoS Flow, the RAN will provide a non-GBR QoS Notification Control Report message that \"The available mean bitrate has changed to x kbps\" to the SMF, PCF and AF (via NEF), the AF can change the codec based on the report available x kbps bitrates.\nTo control the reporting rates, there are two possible way. First one is that the SMF can provide different bitrate span to the RAN, e.g. the three level bitrate span are 0~500kbps, 500~2500kbps, above 2500kpb ~ Ͼ. Only after the available mean bitrate is changed from one bitrate level to another bitrate level, the RAN can generate the non-GBR QoS Notification Control Report Message. The second on is that the SMF can provide different bitrate changes percentage to RAN, only after the available mean bitrate is changed UP/Down above the change percentage, the RAN will generate the non-GBR QoS Notification Control Report message. One example of 3 level bitrate change percentage can be 50%, 100%, 200%.\nLike the alternative QoS, AF can additionally provide Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Sets (including the desired mean bitrate value, PDB/RTT, PER, Priority Level and Averaging Window) to the PCF, and PCF generates an 5QI, ARP with additional desired Alternative QoS Parameters Set(s) to the SMF, then the SMF provides the QoS profile to the RAN with an 5QI, ARP with additional Alternative QoS Profile (including the different desired mean bitrates, PDB, PER, Priority Level and Average Window. When the available mean bitrate is changed to desired mean bitrate, the RAN generates the non-GBR QoS Notification Control as described above.\nNOTE:\tThe Alternative QoS Parameter Sets requested by AF could be applied for the GBR flows and non-GBR flows.\n",

This report is essential for maintaining a high-quality network experience for users, and it helps to ensure that the network is able to meet the QoS requirements of its users.\nFigure 6.6.3.1-1: Non-GBR QoS Notification Control Report\n0.\tThe PDU Session for the XRM service is established, and a non-GBR QoS Flow is established for the XRM service stream.\n1.\tThe RAN detects the available mean bitrate of the non-GBR QoS Flow to be changed to another level and sends a N2 QoS Notification Message \"the available mean bitrate of the Non-GBR QoS Flow changes to x kbps\" or \"the available mean bitrate of the non-GBR QoS Flow increases or decreases x%\" to the AMF. The multiple levels of mean bitrate can be provisioned to the RAN by the SMF during the Non-GBR QoS Flow Establishment procedure or during the Non-GBR QoS Flow Modification procedure. The multiple levels of mean bitrate can be bitrate value in kbps or can be bitrate change percentage.\n2.\tThe AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSM Context request (\"the available mean bitrate of the Non-GBR QoS Flow changes to x kbps\" or \"the available mean bitrate of the non-GBR QoS Flow increases or decreases x%\") to the SMF.\n3.\tThe SMF sends Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update request (\"the available mean bitrate of the SDF changes to x kbps\" or \"the mean bitrate of the SDF increases or decreases x %\") to the PCF.\n4.\tIf NEF is used, the PCF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify (\"the available mean bitrate of the SDF changes to x kbps\" or \"the available mean bitrate of the SDF increases or decreases x %\") to the NEF.\nIf the AF locates the trusted domain and the NEF is not used, the PCF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify (\"the available mean bitrate of the SDF changes to x kbps\" or \"the available mean bitrate of the SDF increases or decreases x %\") to the AF.\n5.\tAfter receiving the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify from the PCF, the NEF sends the Nnef_EventExposure (\"the available mean bitrate of the stream changes to x kbps\" or \"the available mean bitrate of the stream increases or decreases x %\") to the AF.\n6.\tAfter receiving the information from PCF/NEF, the AF can determine to change the codec with indicated bitrate.\nThe figure depicts a non-GBR QoS Notification Control system, which is a crucial component in ensuring high-quality service delivery in a telecommunications network. The system is designed to monitor and manage the quality of service (QoS) of data packets, ensuring that they are delivered in a timely and reliable manner. The figure shows the various components involved in the system, such as the network interface controller (NIC), the Quality of Service (QoS) Manager, and the Quality of Experience (QoE) Manager. The system is designed to provide a seamless user experience, with the ability to prioritize and manage different types of traffic, such as voice, video, and data. The figure also highlights the importance of network management and the role of the network operator in ensuring the smooth operation of the network.\nFigure 6.6.3.2-1: Non-GBR QoS Notification Control\n0.\tThe PDU Session for the XRM service is established.\n1.\tIf the XRM AF does not locate at trusted domain, the AF sends the Nnef_AFsessionwithQoS_Create Request (XRM stream information and request QoS and additional Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set (s)) to the NEF. The request QoS and additional Requested Alternative QoS Parameter set(s) share the same 5QI, ARP and each additional Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set includes a mean bitrate indicate the different possibilities for the codec and a PER, PDB, Priority Level and Averaging Window for the 5QI).\n2.\tIf the XRM AF locates at trusted domain, the AF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create Request (XRM stream information and request QoS and additional Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set (s)) to the PCF.\n3.\tIf the NEF is used, the NEF sends The AMF sends ends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create Request (XRM stream information and request QoS and additional Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set (s)) to the PCF as described in step 1b.\n4.\tThe PCF sends Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request (SDF PCC rule) to the SMF. The SDF PCC rule also includes the additional desired Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) (e.g.multiple mean bitrate(s), PER(s), PDB(s), Priority Level(s) and Averaging Window(s) for the associated 5QI).\n5.\tThe SMF creates a new non-GBR QoS Flow based on received PCC rule and sends the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request (N1 Message, N2 Message (QFI, non-GBR QoS profile with the 5QI , ARP , additional desired Alternative QoS Profiles (e.g. mean bitrate(s) , PER(s), PDB(s), Priority Level(s) and Averaging Window(s) for the associated 5QI))).\n6.\tAMF sends the N2 Message (QFI, non-GBR QoS profiles with the same 5QI, ARP, and additional desired Alternative QoS Profile (s)) to the RAN to create a non-GBR QoS Flow. After the Non-GBR QoS Flow is established, the RAN will generate the current available mean bitrate and report the desired mean bitrate that is closest to it to the AMF as described in clause 6.6.3.1 and the AF may change its codec based on the desired mean bitrate reported from the 5GS.\nWhen the available mean bitrate changes in such a way that a different desired mean bitrate is closest to it, the RAN generates the non-GBR QoS Flow Notification message with the new desired mean bitrate as described in clause 6.6.3.1 and the AF can change its codec based on the desired mean bitrate reported from the 5GS.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution is based on the usage of the RFC 3550 [9] RTP and HTTP [41] [42] [43] protocol to exchange data with the Application Server.\nNetwork/user plane resources for media applications tend to be overprovisioned to guarantee a near real-time experience due to the rate variability inherent in these flows. However, the network can utilize scarce network resources better and defer packet forwarding or handle congestion better if it is aware of the importance of the coded media information and mark the packets of a PDU set accordingly. QoS handling also benefits from distinguishing a PDU set from adjacent ones.\nXR media consists of audio, video, haptic and other data that has significant rate variability. It is conveyed between media application end points over a 5G core and radio network that experiences congestion, delay, and jitter. Media applications partition data into coding layers (e.g. video coding layer - VCL) that efficiently code the data into base layers and enhanced temporal, spatial and quality layers. The layered media data is mapped to network adaptation layers (NAL) that are suitable to be packetized and transported across the network. Each NAL unit transported in a data packet carries an indication of the priority and dependencies to other coding layers/NAL units.\nThe media payload with the NAL header is transported by RFC 3550 [9] RTP or RFC 3711 [10] SRTP. The RTP header contains sequence number, timestamp and M bit that are used to identify packets that belong to a PDU set. Payload information in NAL unit (NRI and Type) or experimental RTP extended header, draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11] provides information on the type of payload data and is used to determine the importance of the packet. For RTP transport with unencrypted header and payload, the payload header/NAL unit information can be used. SRTP transport where the payload is encrypted must rely on the extended header RFC 3550 [9] if available or on the application using different IP header fields (IPv6 flow labels, DSCPs, sending ports) that correspond to the level of importance of the encoded media.\nMedia payload for web based media applications is transported over HTTP/1.1[41], HTTP/2[42] or HTTP/3[43]. HTTP/1.1 may be inspected and packets may be identified as belonging to a PDU set. Payload information conveys the type of media encoded and can be used to classify its importance. However, HTTP/1.1 is inefficient (needs multiple TCP connections), insecure and has poor latency.\nHTTP/2 on the other hand is relatively well suited for XR applications due to supports for dynamically multiplexed and prioritized streams (e.g. 6DoF media streams) in a single TCP connection. HTTP/2 also has and lower latency since there is no HTTP head of line blocking. However, the HTTP/2 connection payload carries dynamically multiplexed streams and may be encrypted, thus it is not practical to inspect at line-speed. The proposal here is to carry new meta-data in a new TCP option [44] in the packet along with the HTTP/2 media payload. The meta-data carried characterizes the HTTP/2 media payload in the packet.\nHTTP/2 relies on TCP transport and its congestion control mechanisms result in variable delays. Meanwhile, HTTP/3 uses a QUIC/UDP transport layer which is not in kernel and can have more flexibility with congestion control, but is otherwise like HTTP/2 for the purposes of this discussion. Since the QUIC transport is UDP based, this solution proposes to carry the new meta-data on the media payload in a new UDP option [45]. Another option is to use meta-data extension headers in QUIC to carry media packet information that can be used for packet QoS classification (based on IETF Media over QUIC (MOQ) [63]).\nNOTE 1:\tThe definition of new TCP or UDP options should be coordinated with the IETF.\nNOTE 21:\tDefinition or extension of meta-data in QUIC headers should be coordinated with the IETF.\nThis solution assumes the following:\n-\tQoS handlers are presented with the same set of importance information and PDU set boundaries regardless of the format of the media transport or media codecs used.\n-\tShallow packet inspection /meta-information from headers is preferable to minimize classification time.\n-\tInformation in RTP headers, payload headers (NAL), extended RTP header and IP headers are sufficient to characterize importance and PDU set boundaries.\n-\tThis solution does not depend on SDP, HTTP or other session signalling as they do not provide per packet information.\n-\tTCP or UDP options are sent between the transport endpoints (server and UE). The UPF only inspects the meta-data in TCP/UDP option.\nA high level sequence and related clauses with procedure extensions:\n1)\tAF -> 5GC procedures to provision application preferences for filtering, PDU classification (clause 6.7.3.2.2)\n2)\tSMF provisions PFDs for media handling in UPF (clauses 4.18, 4.4.3.5 of TS 23.502 [3])\n3)\tDuring session establishment SMF provisions PDR in UPF (clause 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3])\n4)\tUPF classifies importance, packets of PDU set using rules provisioned (clauses 6.7.3.1, 6.7.3.2)\n5)\tUPF encodes importance, packets of PDU sequence mark in GTP-U extension header (clause 6.7.3.3).\nQoS handlers can use network resources more efficiently and deliver better e2e media transport.\nThe procedures in clause 6.7.3.1 describe how to identify media packets of a PDU set and differentiate packets of one PDU set from another. Clause 6.7.3.2 describes how to classify media packets of a PDU set by the level of importance and the information configured between the application (AF) and 5GC to support a customized importance by application (e.g. some applications may prioritize motion over quality). Clause 6.7.3.3 describes how to transport the QoS meta-information (importance, PDU sequence mark) across network entities in 5GS.\n",

                            "text_content": "Packets belonging to a PDU set can be identified by inspecting a combination of fields in the RTP header (sequence number, timestamp, M bit) and RTP header extensions (e.g. IETF Frame Marking RTP Extension header, draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11]) and the media payload header (e.g. RTP payload NAL Unit Type field).\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a PDU set, illustrating the start and end points of the PDU set. The PDU set is a crucial component in a network, responsible for transmitting data between devices. The figure shows the PDU set with a clear and concise layout, making it easy to understand the structure and components of a PDU set.\nFigure 6.7.3.1.1-1: Identifying start and end of a PDU set\nThe first packet of a PDU set has an RTP header with new timestamp, a new Type field in NAL unit header and follows the sequence number of the packet with the RTP header M-bit set to 1 (i.e. sequence number is 1 greater than the packet with M-bit set to 1). Detection of the first packet may need a combination of fields since timestamp may not be incremented for enhanced layers (PDU set). If an RTP experimental extension header is present, the S-bit is set to 1. These fields can identify the start of a PDU set.\nThe last packet of a PDU set has the RTP header M-bit set to 1, or precedes packet /sequence number with new timestamp. If an RTP experimental extension header is present, the E-bit is set to 1.\nHTTP/1.1 packets belonging to a PDU set can be identified by inspecting the HTTP payload to determine start, the packets in between and the end. HTTP payload with the same timestamp and content type belong to a PDU set. Enhanced layers can be detected by the change in content type (while the timestamp may not be incremented). Out-of-order packet arrivals can be managed by tracking the TCP sequence number along with the content type of the packet.\nHTTP/2 and HTTP/3 packets carry multiple streams that are dynamically ordered (i.e. their ordering is based on application priorities, network delays, etc.). The combination of dynamically ordered streams or possible encryption make it processing intensive to identify and characterize PDU sets at line-rate without additional meta-data.\nMethods for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:\n1.\tCombination of IP header fields and stream fingerprint\nUPF uses IP header fields (flow label, DSCP) to differentiate streams since a flow (single transport connection) has multiple dynamically ordered streams. Within an identified HTTP/2 stream, stream fingerprints (including packet size, burst, inter arrival time) is used to identify PDU set boundaries. Stream fingerprints are configured as described in clause 6.7.3.2.3.\n2.\tNew TCP / UDP option with media meta-data\nMedia aware application server on N6 adds new TCP option [44] for HTTP/2 or UDP option [45] for HTTP/3 to carry meta-data on the codec (audio, video, haptics), media encoding in the packet (base layer, enhanced layers), timestamp and PDU set information (start/end of frame). For HTTP/3 QUIC/UDP meta-data to prioritize media with priority/importance [64] and extensions to support other PDU set characteristics may be an option to be considered in coordination with the IETF.\nSince the meta-data is in a TCP/UDP option of the packet, no new routing/destination information is needed (unlike using a tunnel in N6).\nA PDU Set is identified by a sequence number \"PDU sequence mark\" that is appended to all the packets of a PDU set (start to end packet). More than one bit may be used for the PDU sequence mark field if e.g. out-of-order packets span multiple PDU sets. For example, a 2-bit counter would cycle incrementally through 4 distinct PDU sequence marks using modulo arithmetic (i.e. mod-4 in this case) for each subsequent PDU set. This allows the QoS handler to make decisions based on the PDU set as a whole and differentiate from previous or subsequent PDU sets. The PDU sequence mark (PSM) is carried in GTP extension and further described in clause 6.7.3.3.\nSince packets may arrive out-of-order, a packet with out-of-order sequence number may be part of a new PDU set. If the packet has a new timestamp and new media header fields, the packet belongs to a new PDU set and a higher PDU sequence mark (i.e. (current PSM +1) mod-n) is used to indicate that it belongs to a different PDU set.\nThis clause describes how packets of a PDU set are classified based on the importance of the media payload it carries. Media payload header NAL (e.g. RFC 3711 [10], Frame Marking RTP Header Extension, draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11]) or RFC 3550 [9] RTP extended headers contain information on media priority and dependence and is further defined in clause 6.7.3.2.1 Media classification with HTTP payload is covered in 6.7.3.2.2.\nSome PDU sets have a well understood importance (e.g. an independent frame has high importance, or a discardable frame has low importance) but in other cases applications may indicate a preference (e.g. an application that contains high speed motion may give higher importance to temporal enhancement PDU sets over spatial or quality data). PDU sets of enhancement layers (e.g. spatial, temporal) have a dependence on base layer PDU sets and are relatively less important than the base layer PDU sets that carry essential data. Applications can configure these preferences as defined in clause 6.7.3.2.2.\nQoS handlers are provided with a PDU Priority Mark (PPM) that represents importance and dependence of PDU Set in terms of a linear priority value (e.g. high/medium/low, 0-7) PPM is related to PDU set delay budget, error rate and other parameters associated to each priority value. A QoS handler may use PPM along with PDU set boundaries to handle packets of PDU set in a flow without the need to understand the specifics of various coded media. The PPM can thus be extensible for new types of media.\nThe QoS model in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2], is extended for media PDU handling as shown in Figure 6.7.3.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a QoS model with an extension for Media PDU Classification, illustrating the various types of media PDU (Physical Media Unit) and their corresponding QoS attributes. The model includes a set of QoS attributes such as delay, jitter, and packet loss, which are used to assess the quality of service (QoS) of media PDU. The extension provides a more detailed representation of the media PDU classification, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the QoS of media PDU.\nFigure 6.7.3.2-1: QoS Model with extension for Media PDU Classification\nProtocol data units that arrive at a UPF with media classification functionality are filtered and classified based on origin (3-tuple) or 5-tuple flow information as defined in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. Media PDU filtering information is provisioned in 5GC by the application (AF) and further details are in clause 6.7.3.2.2. If it is not a media PDU, the PDU bypasses the media filter and flow based QoS is handled as defined in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. Media PDUs (that are filtered) are classified using RTP header/payload header information that identifies the importance of the packet payload and details are in clause 6.7.3.2.1. The importance information in PPM and sequence of PDU sets is carried in GTP extension header as outlined in clause 6.7.3.3.\nThe mapping from meta-information available in media transport is presented to the QoS handler as a scale of increasing/decreasing priorities in PPM (e.g. high/medium/low, scale 0-7). The PPM is only applicable for selective handling (e.g. deferring, dropping) of packets of PDU set within a flow. The actions that the QoS handler takes based on PPM is based on network conditions or other factors and implementation of the QoS handler and are not further defined here.\nA UPF with media classification functionality follows the extended QoS handling below:\n1.\tPDU Set Marking:\nIf an incoming packet matches media filter criteria and is not classified (i.e. does not have PPM), the media packet classifier uses rules configured in clause 6.7.3.2.2 to select PPM value by matching on RTP/payload header fields of incoming packet.\nIf there is no match, packet is marked with PPM of lowest priority.\n2.\tFlow based QoS in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2] is applied.\nThe flow is processed using QoS defined in 23.501, 5.7. The PDB, PER, GBR, MBR remain the same and the rules are based on existing PDR for the PDU session.\n3.\tExtended QoS Handling for Media packets:\nWithin the QoS rules for a flow, if PPM is available the QoS handler may use it to optimize handling of the packet (e.g. deferring, or selectively dropping when congestion exceeds threshold level). PDU set delay budget, error rate and other parameters associated to each priority value in PPM is used.\nFor classification of upstream packets, the UE is provisioned with PPM during PDU session establishment/modification based on S-NSSAI/DNN for the PDU session. The PPM rules are sent from 5GC to the UE in N1 SM Container defined in session management procedure in clause 4.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. PPM is used in the UE for mapping to the appropriate MAC transmission buffers. The handling of UL PDU sets in the UE is implementation specific.\nPackets of a PDU set have a set of headers in IP, RTP transport and payload headers that can be used to assign an importance and dependence to other PDU sets. After the start of a new PDU set is detected, various header information can be used in each of the following cases:\n1.\tRTP (unencrypted header and payload).\nThe RTP payload / NAL unit header with information on media coding priority, dependence (e.g. H.264 [19], SVC, draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11]) are used to map to per packet QoS priority values in PPM. Independent frames/PDU sets with no dependence are marked with the highest priority while PDU sets that carry temporal, spatial or quality enhancements are configured on a per application basis on the level of importance. This is further defined in clause 6.7.3.2.3.\n2.\tSRTP (unencrypted extended experimental header, encrypted payload).\nThe experimental IETF draft with extended header (Frame Marking RTP Header Extension, draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11]) contains coded media information that can be used to map to a PPM value. For example, an \"I\" (independent/IDR frame with temporal independence) may be marked important, while selected LID/TID values (spatial/quality/temporal frames with dependence indicated by the value) may be of medium PPM priority and the others marked low.\n3.\tSRTP (unencrypted header, encrypted payload).\nThe RTP unencrypted header does not provide meta-information to determine the coded media that is carried in the packet and the NAL unit header is part of the encrypted payload. Since the unencrypted headers don't convey enough information on the media carried, the application supplements by conveying different desired QoS handling priority by using different IPv6 flow labels, DSCP, sender ports. The values are configurable per application and is specified further in clause 6.7.3.2.3.\nThe methods described in 6.7.3.1.2 include both identification of PDU sets and classification of packets with HTTP media transport.\n1.\tHTTP/1.1 (unencrypted header and payload)\nContent type, base and enhanced layers are detected by inspection of the media payload and mapped to per packet QoS priority values in PPM. Independent frames/PDU sets with no dependence are marked with the highest priority while PDU sets that carry temporal, spatial or quality enhancements are configured on a per application basis on the level of importance. This is further defined in 6.7.3.2.3\n2.\tHTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (dynamically ordered streams and possible encryption)\nThe HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 headers do not provide meta-information to determine the coded media.\nIP header fields (flow label, DSCP) are used to differentiate streams since a flow (single transport connection) has multiple dynamically ordered streams.\nIf meta-data on the codec (audio, video, haptics), media encoding in the packet (base layer, enhanced layers), timestamp and PDU set information (start/end of frame)is available in TCP option [44] for HTTP/2 or UDP option [45] for HTTP/3, this information is used to classify and map to per packet QoS priority values. For HTTP/3, an option may be to use QUIC/UDP meta-data to prioritize media with priority/importance [64] and extend in coordination with IETF to support other PDU set characteristics.\nThis clause describes the provisioning necessary to filter the media PDUs and apply the QoS classification based on the importance that applications need for different media encoding. For example, a video stream that encodes significant motion may wish to prioritize PDU that have enhancement layers with temporal information over PDUs that carry quality.\nMedia Packet Filtering:\nApplication function (AF) signals the 5GC and provides details on the criteria by which to filter traffic carrying media traffic and then to the criteria by which to determine importance of a packet/PDU. Media traffic is identified using 3-tuple (server address/end user address, port protocol) or 5-tuple flow as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] (Application Function Influence on Traffic Routing).\nMedia Packet Classification:\nThe media traffic is then classified using the rules configured based the application priorities for the corresponding fields in RTP/SRTP transport or payload header. Some PDU sets have a well understood importance (e.g. an independent frame has high importance, or a discardable frame has low importance) but in other cases applications may indicate a preference (e.g. an application that contains high speed motion may give higher importance to temporal enhancement PDU sets over spatial or quality data).\nThe AF sends information to 5GC to configure default and application specific information:|\n1.\tClassification for RTP (unencrypted header and payload).\nThe parameters configured include the following:\n-\tif NAL I flag set to 1, then PPM = high importance.\n-\tNAL priority field values set for enhanced layers are mapped to PPM based on application preference for motion or quality.\n-\tif no configuration applies, default is PPM = low importance.\n2.\tClassification for SRTP (unencrypted extended experimental header, encrypted payload).\nThe parameters configured are based on RFC 3550 [9] RTP extension header:\n-\tif I flag is set to 1, PPM = high importance.\n-\tif D flag is set to 1, PPM = low importance.\n-\tTID/LID/TL0PICIDX values mapped to PPM based on application preference for motion or quality.\n-\tif no configuration applies, default is PPM = low importance.\n3.\tClassification for SRTP (unencrypted header, encrypted payload).\nThe parameters configured include (one or more of) the following:\n-\tIPv6 flow label [12] values corresponding to application preference for importance of the PDU.\n-\tDSCP corresponding to application preference for importance of the PDU:\n(e.g. if DSCP = d1, PPM = high importance).\n-\tsending IP port and corresponding importance in PPM:\n(e.g. if sending port = p1, PPM = medium importance).\n-\tif no configuration applies, default is PPM = low importance.\n4. Classification for HTTP\nThe parameters configured include the following:\n-\tparameters that fingerprint a stream including packet size, burst rate, inter arrival time.\n-\tIPv6 flow label [12] values corresponding to application preference for importance of the PDU.\n-\tDSCP corresponding to application preference for importance of the PDU:\n(e.g. if DSCP = d1, PPM = high importance.\n-\tif no configuration applies, default is PPM = low importance.\nThese parameters are configured using PFD (Packet Flow Description) procedures in clause 4.18 of TS 23.502 [3] and clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.503 [4] as basis (AF -> NEF (PFDF) -> UDR). The SMF subscribes to PFDManagement services from NEF to retrieve the configuration as specified in clause 5.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3] (NEF Services). The SMF uses N4 PFD management procedure in clause 4.4.3.5 of TS 23.502 [3] to provision these PFDs in the UPF.\nThe classification of media PDU with PPM described in clause 6.7.3.2 and sequence of PDU sets described in clause 6.7.3.1 is carried to QoS handlers in RAN /other UPFs using GTP-U extension headers (clause 8.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2], TS 29.281 [16]). New GTP extension header fields are required for PPM /importance information and for boundaries/sequence of PDU sets.\nAn example of GTP-U encapsulation carrying the QoS media classification result is shown in Figure 6.7.3.3-1.\nThe figure depicts a QoS media classification in GTP-U extension, illustrating the use of QoS media classification in a GTP-U extension network. The diagram shows the various media types, their respective QoS parameters, and the corresponding QoS labels. This helps in prioritizing and managing the transmission of data packets, ensuring that only the most critical or valuable information is transmitted.\nFigure 6.7.3.3-1: Example of QoS media classification in GTP-U extension\nFigure 6.7.3.3-1 shows a sequence of PDU sets (I-frame followed by B-frames and P-frame). There are two sets of classification results that are carried in the GTP-U extension. The field with importance of each PDU defined as PPM contains the level of importance of each PDU set as described in clause 6.7.3.2. In the example here, 3 levels of importance are conveyed for a QoS handler to act on.\nPDU set boundaries are identified as described in clause 6.7.3.1 and each of the PDU sets are marked with a sequence number i.e. PDU sequence mark (PSM) here shown as a single alternating bit in the figure. (A larger PSM may be used).\n",

                            "text_content": "In this solution the application layer has the capabilities to provide new information describing characteristics of a 'PDU-Set'. The characteristics are encoded in a generic, media-type-agnostic manner. This to relieve the 5GS from the burden of having media knowledge of applications that are not under 3GPP control.\nTo make use of the PDU-Set concept in 5GS, it is needed to provide means for the 5GS to identify the packets constituting a PDU-Set at N6 interface/UPF. Given that the number of PDUs constituting a PDU Set changes dynamically, this solution uses an in-band signalling for that purpose. In this solution a 3GPP specified content of an extension header to carry PDU Set specific information is introduced. This extension header is separated from privacy protected payloads.\nThe solution is outlined below:\nIt is a design principle that the application layer provides the relevant information about the Information Unit to the lower layers that will enable lower layers to insert information aiding at identification of the PDU-Set at N6.\nTo ensure that UPF only attempts to detect PDU-Sets in packet flows where such are known to be present, the 'PDU-Set' presence indication can be provided to UPF from the SMF. The SMF receives it as new information in the PCC rule. PCF can receive it, if available, from AF using existing procedures enhanced with that new information.\nTwo implementation variants are proposed in this solution:\nA)\tSolution based on RTP extension header.\nBased on the understanding that segmentation into PDU-Set is applicable for real-time media, it is assumed that RTP is used. Consequently, in this solution RTP extension header (see clause 3.5.1 of RFC 3550 [9] and RFC 8285 [15]) is used to convey PDU-Set specific information to 5GS. This RTP extension header is not encrypted.\nUPF is enabled to inspect the RTP extension header. To reduce the UPF from packet inspection complexity, it is required to standardize an RTP configuration that enables a fixed starting position of the PDU-Set RTP extension header. RTP header extension inspection is a step following the PDR matching process and therefore does not impact the PDR matching process.\nNOTE:\tThe content of the RTP extension header will be defined by SA2 in collaboration with SA4. Formally the definition of the RTP extension header does not require any action in the IETF, but for broader adoption of the header in RTP implementations, SA2 and SA4 may consider coordinating the definition with the IETF.\nB)\tVariant based on MASQUE tunnel metadata:\nThis variant is based on establishing a MASQUE tunnel between the UPF and the Application Server, based on draft-ietf-masque-connect-udp [54].\nAt reception of the first UL packet, the UPF sends an HTTP/3 request to a MASQUE proxy co-located in the Application Server, to create a MASQUE tunnel in the N6 interface. The tunnel can then be secured using QUIC.\nThe first and subsequent packets are sent within the MASQUE tunnel as HTTP Datagrams using the capsule protocol and are decapsulated by the co-located proxy and forwarded to the Application.\nPackets sent from the application to the UE go through the co-located MASQUE proxy, which encapsulates them as HTTP datagrams using the capsule protocol and sends them to the UPF through the MASQUE tunnel. The MASQUE client at the UPF then decapsulates the HTTP Datagrams before further processing.\nThe AS can send PDU Set information as metadata to the UPF, which has the following advantages:\n-\tIt does not require CP involvement for tunnel management.\n-\tIt works regardless of the protocol used for real-time media and the level of encryption.\n-\tIt provides integrity protection and encryption of both the payload and the metadata.\n-\tIt provides the means to insert metadata once per PDU Set, by means of registering the metadata for a MASQUE context corresponding to that PDU Set and referencing the context for subsequent PDUs in the set, therefore optimizing signalling.\n-\tIt also provides the possibility of sending per PDU extension headers, by defining the header structure for the MASQUE context.\nThe parameters to be included in the metadata for PDU Set identification are specified in clause 6.8.2.2.\nEstablishing of the MASQUE tunnel to the AS is a step following the PDR matching process in the UL direction, only when PDU set handling indication is set for the matched application ID.\nEditor's note:\tA new PDU Set extension to CONNECT-UDP and CONNECT-IP needs to be standardized, similar to draft-schinazi-masque-connect-udp-ecn-02 [65].\nThe concept of a PDU-Set enables enhancements to efficient resource management in 5GS, e.g. in NG-RAN.\nOne such example enables cell capacity increase. In this example NG-RAN may take a decision to not deliver any PDU of a given PDU-Set when NG-RAN can assess that not all PDUs constituting that PDU set are feasible to be delivered within a required time while it is known that only if PDUs are delivered the PDU-Set is used by the receiving application layer entity. To enable such enhancement following PDU-Set associated information is provided:\n(a)\tin the RTP or MASQUE extension header:\n1.\tPDU-Set Sequence number\nRationale: enables NG-RAN to identify PDU(s) that belong to a new/different/particular PDU Set and to evaluate the associated information.\n2.\tSize of the PDU-Set (number of bytes) enabling NG-RAN to assess whether delivery of the PDU-Set is feasible. If re-ordering of PDUs prior to N6 is assumed as possible, the 'size of the PDU-Set information' needs to be included in the RTP extension header of each packet. Each RTP packet carries the PDU Set size of the entire PDU Set.\n3.\tPDU-Set inter-dependencies, e.g. Late PDU-Set delivery indication.\nRationale : Dependent on the type of content carried by a PDU-Set within a QoS Flow, a late PDU-Set delivery, i.e. delivery non-compliant with the required latency may be still beneficial from the application perspective. Hence it enables NG-RAN to improve the resource usage while considering benefits for the QoE.\n4.\tBurst size (number of bytes), i.e. size of the 'data burst' that a PDU Set a part of.\nRationale: It is generally beneficial for NG-RAN to be aware of the amount of data that needs to be transferred up-front as it aids the RRM and can be used to improve the capacity.\n(b)\tin the CP (AF->PCF-SMF-NG-RAN):\n5.\tIndication whether a PDU-Set is only used by receiving application layer entity if all PDUs constituting that PDU-Set are successfully received within the PDU-Set Delay Budget ('All PDUs in PDU Set Required indication') (for definition of PDU-Set Delay Budget please see clause 6.7.2.3).\nRationale for (2) & (5): NG-RAN may take a decision to not deliver any PDU of a given PDU-Set when NG-RAN can assess that not all PDUs constituting that PDU set are feasible to be delivered within a required time while it is known that only if PDUs are delivered the PDU-Set is used by the receiving application layer entity.\nGiven that the new PDU-Set associated information described in bullets 1.4 above is PDU-Set specific and can dynamically change between consecutive PDU-Sets, it is not feasible to provide it as a (semi-)static information type in NGAP, e.g. in a QoS profile of the QoS Flow on which the packet flows consisting of PDU-Sets is mapped on. Hence in this solution this new PDU-Set associated information is provided to NG-RAN in-band, i.e. encoded in the GTP-U extension header by the UPF. On the other hand, the new PDU-Set information in bullet 5 is assumed to be static on a per AF-session/QoS Flow basis and therefore provided to 5GS in CP and from SMF to NG-RAN in NGAP.\nAn application layer instance can produce units of information that can be used by another application layer instance, e.g. to construct a usable information and one example of such information unit can be a video frame. Dependent on its size and the MTU of the transport network, that information unit may need to be segmented and transferred in multiple transport units, e.g. multiple IP packets. When all segments are received, the receiving application layer instance uses the information unit. Hence the QoE is dependent on the reception of the information unit rather than individual segments constituting it. Therefore, the forwarding treatment described by the QoS parameters needs to be associated with the information unit.\nFollowing the discussion above, SA2#149E agreed (subject to confirmation by SA WG4) a concept corresponding to information unit:\nPDU Set: A PDU Set is composed of one or more PDUs carrying the payload of one unit of information generated at the application level (e.g. a frame or video slice for XRM Services), which are of same importance at application layer. All PDUs in a PDU Set are needed by the application layer to use the corresponding unit of information. In some cases, the application layer can still recover parts of the information unit, when some PDUs are missing.\nBased on the discussion above, we first introduce new 'PDU-Set' level QoS parameters (edited in text below in bold format).\nPDU-Set Delay Budget (PSDB)\nThe PDU-Set Delay Budget (PSDB) defines an upper bound for the time that a PDU-Set may be delayed between the UE and the N6 termination point at the UPF. PSDB applies to the DL PDU-Set received by the UPF over the N6 interface, and to the UL PDU-Set sent by the UE. For a certain 5QI the value of the PSDB is the same in UL and DL. In the case of 3GPP access, the PSDB is used to support the configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points). For GBR QoS Flows using the Delay-critical resource type, a PDU-Set delayed more than PSDB is counted as lost if the QoS Flow is not exceeding the GFBR. For GBR QoS Flows with GBR resource type not exceeding GFBR, of the PDU-Sets shall commonly not experience a delay exceeding the 5QI's PSDB to a very high percentage.\nThe 5G Access Network PDU-Set Delay Budget (5G-AN PSDB) is determined by subtracting a static value for the Core Network PDU-Set Delay Budget (CN PSDB), which represents the delay between any N6 termination point at the UPF (for any UPF that may possibly be selected for the PDU Session) and the 5G-AN from a given PSDB.\nNOTE 1:\tFor a standardized 5QI, a static value for the CN PSDB can be specified.\nNOTE 2:\tFor a non-standardized 5QI, the static value for the CN PSDB is homogeneously configured in the network.\nFor GBR QoS Flows using the Delay-critical resource type, in order to obtain a more accurate delay budget PSDB available for the NG-RAN, a dynamic value for the CN PSDB, which represents the delay between the UPF terminating N6 for the QoS Flow and the 5G-AN, can be used. If used for a QoS Flow, the NG-RAN shall apply the dynamic value for the CN PSDB instead of the static value for the CN PSDB (which is only related to the 5QI). Different dynamic value for CN PSDB may be configured per uplink and downlink direction.\nNOTE 3:\tThe configuration of transport network on CN tunnel can be different per UL and DL, which can be different value for CN PSDB per UL and DL.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is expected that the UPF deployment ensures that the dynamic value for the CN PSDB is not larger than the static value for the CN PSDB. This avoids that the functionality that is based on the 5G-AN PSDB (e.g. NG-RAN scheduler) has to handle an unexpected value.\nThe dynamic value for the CN PSDB of a Delay-critical GBR 5QI may be configured in the network in two ways:\n-\tConfigured in each NG-RAN node, based on a variety of inputs such as different IP address(es) or TEID range of UPF terminating the N3 tunnel and based on different combinations of PSA UPF to NG-RAN under consideration of any potential I-UPF, etc.;\n-\tConfigured in the SMF, based on different combinations of PSA UPF to NG-RAN under consideration of any potential I-UPF. The dynamic value for the CN PSDB for a particular QoS Flow shall be signalled to NG-RAN (during PDU Session Establishment, PDU Session Modification, Xn/N2 handover and the Service Request procedures) when the QoS Flow is established or the dynamic value for the CN PSDB of a QoS Flow changes, e.g. when an I-UPF is inserted by the SMF.\nIf the NG-RAN node is configured locally with a dynamic value for the CN PSDB for a Delay-critical GBR 5QI, and receives a different value via N2 signalling for a QoS Flow with the same 5QI, local configuration in RAN node determines which value takes precedence.\nServices using a GBR QoS Flow and sending at a rate smaller than or equal to the GFBR can in general assume that congestion related packet drops will not occur.\nNOTE 5:\tExceptions (e.g. transient link outages) can always occur in a radio access system which may then lead to congestion related packet drops. Packets surviving congestion related packet dropping may still be subject to non-congestion related packet losses (see PSER below).\nServices using Non-GBR QoS Flows should be prepared to experience congestion-related PDU-Set drops and delays. In uncongested scenarios, PDU-Sets should not experience a delay exceeding the 5QI's PSDB to a very high percentage.\nThe PSDB for Non-GBR and GBR resource types denotes a \"soft upper bound\" in the sense that an \"expired\" PDU-Set that has exceeded the PSDB, does not need to be discarded and is not added to the PSER. However, for a Delay-critical GBR resource type, PDU-Set delayed more than the PSDB are added to the PSER and can be discarded or delivered depending on local decision.\nPDU-Set Error Rate (PSER)\nThe PDU-Set Error Rate (PSER) defines an upper bound for the rate of PDU-Sets (e.g. set of IP packets constituting a PDU-Set) that have been processed by the sender of a link layer protocol (e.g. RLC in RAN of a 3GPP access) but where all of the PDUs in the PDU-Set are not successfully delivered by the corresponding receiver to the upper layer (e.g. PDCP in RAN of a 3GPP access). Thus, the PSER defines an upper bound for a rate of non-congestion related packet losses. The purpose of the PSER is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in RAN of a 3GPP access). For every 5QI the value of the PSER is the same in UL and DL. For GBR QoS Flows with Delay-critical GBR resource type, a PDU-Set which is delayed more than PSDB is counted as lost, and included in the PSER unless the QoS Flow is exceeding the GFBR. Congestion related packet drops should be avoided by means of an application layer rate adaptation scheme.\nThe QoS parameters PSDB and PSER are provided to NG-RAN as part of the QoS profile.\n",

New GTP-U extension header(s) carry the PDU Set Sequence Number, and the \"Number of PDUs in the PDU Set\" from the XR Server/UPF through any (and all) intermediate UPFs to the gNB.\nd)\tPart of the GTP-U extension header can be used to inform the RAN whether it is essential for all PDUs of the PDU Set to be received by the UE in order for any of the information of that PDU Set to be of use to the UE.\nThis enables the gNB to know whether it can locally discard PDUs of a PDU Set if it knows that it will fail to properly deliver the complete PDU Set.\ne)\tThe GTP-U extension header type can be encoded so that intermediate UPFs/GTP-U entities pass the header on to the final GTP-U endpoint even if the intermediate GTP-U entities do not understand that GTP-U extension header).\nTo enable smooth operation with legacy RAN nodes, it is anticipated that the GTP-U extension header would be encoded as 'comprehension not required'.\nThe relevant extract from the GTP-U specification, clause 5.2.1 of TS 29.281 [16] is copied below:\nBits 7 and 8 of the Next Extension Header Type have the following meaning:\nTable 6.9.3-1\n\nFigure 5.2.1-2: Definition of bits 7 and 8 of the Extension Header Type\nf)\tIn a real system, it can be expected that the delay budget relates to the transmission of the entire PDU Set and not to each individual IP packet. In such a situation, the PDU Set Sequence Number enables the gNB to estimate the amount of time that it has for the delivery of each PDU from the time that the first PDU of that PDU Set arrives at the gNB.\nThis enables the jitter in the delay with which the complete PDU Set is delivered to the recipient's application to be reduced. It does however imply a slight redefinition of the current Packet Delay Budget attribute, or, the introduction of a new QoS attribute.\nNote that even in an otherwise unloaded system, the backhaul to the gNB can insert a non-negligible delay for typical XR PDU Sets, e.g. a PDU set of 50 kbytes occupies at least 0.4 ms on a 1 Gbit/s link. When the system is moderately loaded, queuing delays can occur even in wider bandwidth backhaul links.\n",

Considering the frame/video slice can only be decoded in case all packets (or most of the packets, if FEC is used during encoding) are successfully received. 5G system should be aware of the PDU set and handle packets of one PDU Set in an integrated manner.

It illustrates the steps involved in managing packets, including the creation of a PDU set, the selection of a PDU, and the execution of the PDU set. The figure also includes a flow chart to illustrate the sequence of events, ensuring a clear understanding of the process.\nFigure 6.12.3.1-1: High-level Procedure of PDU Set integrated packet handling\nAs shown in Figure 6.12.3.1-1, a schematic diagram of the modification process of the PDU session for the XR service is given. The process includes the following steps:\n0.\tThe UE establishes a PDU Session as defined in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]. A network slice type for XR service can be used for such a PDU Session.\n1.\tOptionally, as defined in clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3], the AF may invoke the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request to set up an AF session with required QoS. In the step 1, the AF may send the following information to PCF:\nFlow description of the target media service data flows for PDU Set handling.\nBurst periodicity.\nThe PDU Set level packet handling/treatment requirements. The PDU Set level packet handling/treatment requirements are optional and may include e.g. PDU Set Error Rate, PDU Set Delay Budget, Maximum PDU Set Loss Rate/Number, Media protocol info (e.g. which RFC is used in user data) etc.\n2.\tPCF may initiate the PDU Session modification procedure as defined in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The PCF generates appropriate PCC rules based on the information from AF as mentioned in step 1, e.g. 5QI, PER and PDB. The PDU Set level packet handling/treatment requirements may be considered during the PCC rule generation. The PCC rules may also include the detection rules of service data flow, PDU Set level packet handling/treatment policy, PDU Set identification rules. The PDU Set identification rules may contain RTP header identification method as shown in clause 6.12.3.2.1, and/or RTP payload identification method as shown in clause 6.12.3.2.2 (H.264), clause 6.12.3.2.4 (H.265) and clause 6.12.3.2.5 (H.266). The PCF sends the PCC rules to SMF.\n3.\tSMF generates the QoS profiles and N4 rules based on the PCC rules from PCF, which may include the packet handling/treatment policy. SMF sends the N4 rules to UPF via the N4 rule, which may include the identification and marking rule for PDU Set. Besides, SMF also sends the QoS profiles to the RAN node via AMF, and instructs RAN to perform PDU Set integrated QoS handling.\nNOTE 1:\tBased on Media protocol info included in the PDU Set level packet handling/treatment requirements or based on pre-configuration, SMF generates N4 rules accordingly to instruct UPF to identify the PDU Sets of corresponding protocols as shown in clause 6.12.3.2.\n4.\tBased on received N4 rules or locally configuration on the UPF, the UPF identifies the PDU Set and marks PDU Set info in the GTP-U layer in the DL packets, including start/end indication of the PDU Set and the PDU Set ID. Details of how to identify the PDU Set are in clause 6.12.3.2.\n5.\tThe RAN identifies the PDU Set based on the PDU Set info in GTP-U header and transmits PDUs within the PDU Set in an integrated manner, e.g. The RAN may drop the PDU Set as a whole in case of poor network condition, and execute packet handling/treatment policy.\nNOTE 2:\tThe details of RAN behaviour is up to RAN WGs.\nUPF can identify the PDUs of one PDU Set via different ways, e.g. the RTP headers/payloads in case RTP is used, the traffic periodicity. The UPF then add marks in the GTP-U headers of DL packets to assist RAN for the PDU Set identification, e.g. the start/end indication of the PDU Set and PDU Set ID. The identification of PDU Set depends on what the PDU Set represents, e.g. a video frame or a video slice.\nIf the PDU Set represents a video frame, the identification of the video frame can be realized via following options\nOption#1 Identification based on RTP header\nThe format of RTP header is defined in RFC 3550 [9] as shown below:\n\n\nFigure 6.12.3.2-1: RTP header format defined in RFC 3550 [9]\nIn RTP headers, Marker (M) bit is set for the very last packet of the frame indicated by the RTP timestamp. Therefore, UPF can be based on the M bit to identify the start and end of a PDU Set/frame.\nOption#2 Identification based on the RTP header extension\nBased on the draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11], the extended RTP header format is shown as below. The \"S\" bit and \"E\" bit in the Frame Marking RTP header extension respectively represent the start and the end of a video frame. UPF can identify the start and end of a PDU Set/frame according to the \"S\" and \"E\" bits.\n\n\nFigure 6.12.3.2-2: RTP header extension format\nNOTE 1:\tThe identification of a video frame based on the \"S\" and \"E\" bits in the RTP header extension also applies for scalable video streams.\nOption#3 Identification based on the periodicity via UPF.\nAlternatively, the UPF can also use the periodicity information as frame traffic pattern to identify the PDU Set/frame. The traffic pattern may also be detected by UPF. For example, the DL media traffic may be 60 PDU Sets per second, i.e. 60 FPS. Then the UPF can determine that it receives a PDU Set every 16.67 ms.\nNOTE 2:\tThis assumes the service data flow only contains the video stream, or if both video and audio streams are included in the same service data flow, the UPF can use other ways to separate the video stream, e.g. PT field in the RTP header.\nIf the PDU Set represents a video slice, the identification of PDU Set can be realized by following approach.\nAccording to RFC 6184 [12], within the RTP packet, the payload starts from a one-byte header structured for a Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) Unit encapsulating the slice output of encoded stream and the following is the encoded video content for one, part of or multiple video slices.\nThe figure depicts the NAL unit header format for H.264 video compression, which is used in the MPEG-4 video compression standard. The header includes information about the video stream, such as the video frame rate, bit rate, and video resolution. The format is designed to be compact and efficient, allowing for efficient compression of high-quality video.\nFigure 6.12.3.2-3: NAL unit header format for H.264\nThe 5-bit NAL unit type in the NAL unit header can indicate the content of NAL unit, e.g. coded slice of an I frame, coded slice of a P frame. Besides, it can also indicate the possible structures of the RTP payload, e.g. single NAL unit packet, aggregation packet and fragmentation unit (FU). The NAL unit type for different RTP packet structure is shown below.\nThe figure depicts various H.264 NAL unit types and their corresponding packet types, illustrating the different types of video compression algorithms used in the H.264 standard.\nFigure 6.12.3.2-4: H.264 NAL unit types and corresponding packet types\nFor single NAL unit packet, that means one RTP packet can carry one NAL unit.\nFor aggregation packet, it means one RTP packets can carry multiple NAL unit, especially when the sizes of NAL units are quite small.\nFor fragmentation unit, that means multiple RTP packets are used to carry one NAL unit.\nFor single NAL unit packet and aggregation packet, it can be easily detected that each RTP packet carries one NAL unit when the NAL unit type is less than 28.\nWhen NAL unit type is 28 or 29, one NAL unit is carried over multiple RTP packets. In this case, the first byte of RTP payload is also named the fragmented unit (FU) indicator and the following byte is the FU header as shown in Figure 6.12.3.2-3. In the FU header, the \"S\" bit and \"E\" bit separately represents the start and end of the NAL unit. Therefore, based on the NAL unit type (also known as FU indicator for fragmented unit) and the FU header, the start/end of the same NAL unit can be identified.\nTherefore, with the RTP payload (i.e. NAL unit header and optionally FU header), the UPF can identify the PDU Set for one video slice.\nNOTE 1:\tThe mechanism described in this clause does not work with SRTP-based payload encryption.\nNOTE 2:\tOption 1 and 2 in clause 6.12.3.2.1 and methods in clause 6.12.3.2.2 rely on the usage of corresponding RTP protocols.\nWhen UPF receives a media packet, UPF firstly finds a PDR based on IP 5-tuple.Then a PSDR (PDU Set Packet Detection Rule) can be used to identify the RTP payload using any option described in clauses 6.12.3.2.1 and 6.12.3.2.2, the UPF FAR adds PDU Set info into the GTP-U headers of DL packets in order to assist RAN for PDU Set integrated QoS handling. The PDU Set info may include the start/end indication of the PDU Set, the PDU Set ID, etc. A new FAR rule with enhanced Outer header creation is defined to add PDU Set info in the GTP-U header.\nNOTE:\tThe details of GTP-U header extension for carrying PDU Set info is up to stage 3.\nIf the PDU Set represents a H.265 video slice, the identification of PDU Set can be realized by following approach.\nAccording to RFC 7798 [21], within the RTP packet, the payload starts from 2 byte header structured for a NAL Unit encapsulating the slice output of encoded stream and the following is the encoded video content for one, part of or multiple video slices.\nThe figure depicts the NAL unit header format for H.265, which is a video compression standard used in 5G networks. The header includes information about the video stream, such as the video frame rate, bit rate, and video resolution. The format is designed to be compact and efficient, allowing for efficient transmission of high-quality video over long distances.\nFigure 6.12.3.2.4-1: NAL unit header format for H.265\nThe 6-bit Type in the NAL unit header can indicate the content of NAL unit. Besides, it can also indicate the possible structures of the RTP payload, e.g. single NAL unit packet, aggregation packet (APs), fragmentation unit (FUs) and Payload Content Information (PACI) carrying RTP packet. The NAL unit type for different RTP packet structure is shown below.\nTable 6.12.3.2-1: H.265 NAL unit types and corresponding packet types [46]\n\n-\tFor single NAL unit packet, that means one RTP packet can carry one NAL unit.\n-\tFor aggregation packet, it means one RTP packets can carry multiple NAL unit, especially when the sizes of NAL units are quite small.\n-\tFor fragmentation unit, that means multiple RTP packets are used to carry one NAL unit.\n-\tFor PACI packet, that contains a payload header (that differs from other payload headers for efficiency), a Payload Header Extension Structure (PHES), and a PACI payload.\nFor single NAL unit packet and aggregation packet, it can be easily detected that each RTP packet carries one NAL unit when the NAL unit type is less than 49.\nWhen NAL unit type is 49, one NAL unit is carried over multiple RTP packets. In this case, the first two-byte of RTP payload is also named the payload header (denoted as NAL U header) and the following byte is the FU header as shown in Figure 6.12.3.2.4-1. In the FU header, the \"S\" bit and \"E\" bit separately represents the start and end of the NAL unit. Therefore, based on the NAL unit type (also known as FU indicator for fragmented unit) and the FU header, the start/end of the same NAL unit can be identified.\nWhen NAL unit type is 50, this is a PACI packet which may carry a single NAL unit packet or FU. In this case, the first two-byte of RTP payload is also named as the PACI header (denoted as NAL U header). During the following two bytes, the \"A\" bit is the copy of \"F\" bit and cType field is the copy of Type field in the PACI payload NAL unit. Then the following is the PHES field, whose length is determined by the PHSize. Finally, the following is the PACI payload NAL unit, during which the first byte is FU header when cType is 49. Therefore, based on the PACI header and PACI payload NAL unit, the start/end of the same NAL unit can be identified.\nNOTE 1:\tThe mechanism described in this clause does not work with SRTP-based payload encryption.\nNOTE 2:\tOption 1 and 2 in clause 6.12.3.2.1 and methods in clause 6.12.3.2.4 rely on the usage of corresponding RTP protocols.\nIf the PDU Set represents a H.266 video slice, the identification of PDU Set can be realized by following approach.\nAccording to draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-vvc-14 [48], within the RTP packet, the payload starts from 2 byte header structured for a NAL Unit encapsulating the slice output of encoded stream and the following is the encoded video content for one, part of or multiple video slices.\nThe figure depicts the header format for the NAL unit in the H.266 video compression standard. It includes the unit number, the type of compression, the bit rate, and the number of channels. The format is used to specify the compression algorithm and parameters for the NAL unit.\nFigure 6.12.3.2.5-1: NAL unit header format for H.266\nThe 5-bit NAL unit type in the NAL unit header can indicate the content of NAL unit. Besides, it can also indicate the possible structures of the RTP payload, e.g. single NAL unit packet, aggregation packet (APs) and fragmentation unit (FUs). The NAL unit type for different RTP packet structure is shown below.\nTable 6.12.3.2.5-1: H.266 NAL unit types and corresponding packet types [47]\n\n-\tFor single NAL unit packet, that means one RTP packet can carry one NAL unit.\n-\tFor aggregation packet, it means one RTP packets can carry multiple NAL unit, especially when the sizes of NAL units are quite small.\n-\tFor fragmentation unit, that means multiple RTP packets are used to carry one NAL unit.\nFor single NAL unit packet and aggregation packet, it can be easily detected that each RTP packet carries one NAL unit when the NAL unit type is less than 29.\nWhen NAL unit type is 29, one NAL unit is carried over multiple RTP packets. In this case, the first two-byte of RTP payload is also named the payload header (denoted as NAL U header) and the following byte is the FU header as shown in Figure 6.12.3.2.5-1 In the FU header, the \"S\" bit and \"E\" bit separately represents the start and end of the NAL unit. Therefore, based on the NAL unit type (also known as FU indicator for fragmented unit) and the FU header, the start/end of the same NAL unit can be identified.\nNOTE 1:\tThe mechanism described in this clause does not work with SRTP-based payload encryption.\nNOTE 2:\tOption 1 and 2 in clause 6.12.3.2.1 and methods in clause 6.12.3.2.5 rely on the usage of corresponding RTP protocols.\nBased on the PDU Set info carried in the GTP-U header, RAN can identify the PDUs belongs to one PDU Set. RAN shall process the PDU Set together accordingly. With the optional PDU Set level packet handling/treatment policy, RAN performs corresponding QoS handlings with the granularity of PDU Set as well.\nNOTE:\tDetails of performing PDU Set processing and QoS handling in RAN node is up to studies in RAN WGs.\n",

During the congestion period, the continuous less importance data from the UPF to the RAN may cause the RAN more congested and waste the transport layer resource between the RAN and the UPF. The UPF can also drop some less important data to the RAN when RAN is congested. Besides, the existing FAR has supported to block or buffer chose data at the UPF.\nHence, the solution proposes to make UPF not to transmit the less important DL data to the RAN when the RAN congestion happens.\nBesides, in some XRM service, P frame and B frame are also important as I frame to construct the fluent video, dropping of those P frame and B frame causes jitter to the QoE which is not better than giving up the whole service. In some other XRM service, P frame and B frame are used to enhance the high definition, e.g. from 720p to 1080p. dropping of those P frame and B frame makes sense to keep the service when the network resource cannot transmit all of the service data.\nHence, the data allowed to be intended dropped shall be authorized by the application server, i.e. from the AF.\nThe solution is based on the existing QoS policy control and FAR with the following enhancement:\n-\tThe AF provides description of data allowed to be dropped and description of data requiring prioritized transmission.

                            "text_content": "To support PDU Set integrated packet handling, this solution proposes the decomposition and mapping of functionality show in Figure 6.14.1-1. As specified in clause 4.2, the solution builds on the Release 17 5G System architecture, including existing signalling for PCC Rules, QoS Profile, and QoS Flow Level QoS parameters (see clause 6.2.5.1.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nThis solution assumes the following definition:\n-\tMedia Unit Identification. Media Unit Identification detectsmedia specific properties of packets according to the PDU Familiesto which it belongs. Media Unit Identification may utilize techniques such as DPI, and examination of RTP headers to determine the media units associated with a packet. Media Unit Identification may be performed at the UE (for uplink) or the UPF (for downlink). Media Unit identification may be implemented differently in the UE and UPF. At the UE it may be integrated with functionality described by SA4 in TR 29.998 [26] (e.g. for 5G STAR UE or EDGAR UE). Information needed to detect the Media Units is configured on the SMF/UPF, or in the case of RTP headers, the AF may provide information regarding the RTP header to be detected. When RTP is not used, media unit detection may not be possible for encrypted traffic.\n-\tPacket Classification. Packet Classification uses Media Unit identification information to associate packets with a PDU Set in one or more PDU Families. Classification captures media layer attributes that can impact QoS treatment. This may include dependence of packet treatment on the successful handling other packets (e.g. treatment of a packet carrying a P-Frame fragment is dependent on the successful handling of packets carrying I-Frame fragments) or treatment of a packet carrying an enhancement layer is dependent on the successful handling of packets carrying a base layer. Classification is conveyed from the UPF to the NG-RAN via markings added to a GTP-U header extension, and hence 3GPP standardization of classification is required.\nIn addition, optionally, assistance information describing media and traffic characteristics not required per-packet such as RTP header type (for media where an RTP header is used), number of temporal and spatial media layers, Group of Pictures (GOP) structure, temporal and spatiallayer periodicities and inter-dependencies, etc. may be provided by an AF or configured in the 5GS.\n-\tEnhanced QoS Policy - In the 5GS, how packets are treated is based on QoS policy determined at the PCF. While packet classification markings indicate PDU Set associations and media unit properties (for example, indicating that the packet carries a fragment of an I-Frame from a spatial enhancement layer that is dependent on a base layer for an H.26x video stream) they do not specify how the packet is treated in the 5GS. To align with the current 5GS QoS framework, QoS policy is enhanced to provide PDU Set granularity QoS information indicating how packets should be treated. The enhanced policy information is sent to the SMF in a PCC rule and sent to the NG-RAN and, UE using existing mechanisms as shown in figure 6.14.1-1.\nEnhanced policy sent from the SMF to the NG-RAN (via the QoS Profile) and/or UE may comprise of the following:\n1\tChanges to the QoS Flow Priority Level according to the classification of a PDU as belonging to a PDU Set in one or more PDU Families (see example in Table 2 of clause 6.14.2.2)\n2\tChanges to QoS Flow PER according to the classification of a PDU as belonging to a PDU Set in one or more PDU Families\n3\tChanges to QoS Flow PDB according to the classification of a PDU as belonging to a PDU Set in one or more PDU Families\n4\tPDU Set Validity Time, which indicates for each PDU set type, the maximum delay for a given PDU Set instance to be delivered to the recipient. Beyond the validity time, the PDU Set instance is not considered valid, and thus all packets of the PDU Set that were not transmitted can be discarded at the RAN. The PDU Set Validity Time defines an upper bound time limit that the combined set of packets in a PDU Set instance may be delayed between the UE and the N6 termination point at the UPF.\nNote for example that for an I-Frame PDU set, the Validity Time may take into account the usefulness of I-Frames for subsequent P-Frame decoding, which may occur at a later time than is required to render the I-Frame. Similar scenarios apply for PDU Sets in the Temporal and Spatial Layer PDU Families where an Enhancement Layer PDU Set may be dependent on a Base Layer PDU Set. When there is one packet in the PDU Set, the Validity Time may be greater than the PDB to reflect the usefulness of the PDU Set for this purpose.\nNOTE:\tNeither the RAN nor UE are aware of media layer details. RAN behaviour to enforce policy is up to RAN WGs. The details of UE behaviour is up to UE implementation.\n-\tPolicy Enforcement PDU Set level packet treatment in the NG-RAN and UE is achieved by matching all PDU Set packet classification markings with the enhanced QoS policy information provided in the QoS Profile and PDU SetLevel QoS parameters.\nThe figure depicts a 5G support for PDU family integrated packet handling, illustrating the various packet types and their respective handling mechanisms. The figure includes a 5G signal, a PDU, and a packet, all depicted in a simplified manner. The figure highlights the importance of packet handling in 5G networks, as it enables efficient data transmission and ensures reliable communication.\nFigure 6.14.1-1: 5GS Support for PDU Family integrated packet handling\n",

                            "text_content": "As described in the KI, a \"group of packets (that) belongs to a same PDU Setwill be handled in an integrated manner\". In media streams, groups of packets handled in an integrated manner occur at different levels. These levels include:\n-\tLevel 1 PDU Family- Media Frame or Media Frame Slice: Packets that comprise fragments of a media frame (e.g. an I-Frame/Slice or a P-Frame/Slice where a Slice is an independently encoded region of a Frame and is also the minimum media unit of transmission over the network) may be handled in an integrated manner since, for example only by sending all packets of a frame or a frame slice can the frame/slice be successfully decoded. Hence the set of PDUs that comprise a specific Media Frame or Media Frame Slice should be considered a PDU Set in the Media Frame or Media Frame Slice PDU Family. Differentiated QoS handling may be provided for PDUs that are members of different PDU Sets in this Families (e.g. a packet that is a member of I-Frame PDU Set is given priorityover a packet that is a member of a P-Frame PDU Set).\n-\tLevel 2 to Level N PDU Family - Additional Media Frame Sets: Groups of packets can comprise higher level Media Units that are processed in an integrated manner (as a PDU Set), particularly for scalable / layered media. For example, packets that comprise a temporal base layer may be processed in an integrated manner and hence be members of a Temporal Base Layer PDU Set in the Temporal Layer Family while different packets that comprise a temporal enhancement layer-1 may be considered as members of a Temporal Enhancement Layer-1 PDU Set in the same PDU Family. Similarly packets that comprise a spatial base layer may be processed in an integrated manner and hence be members of a Spatial Base Layer PDU Set in the Spatial Layer Family while different packets that comprise a spatial enhancement layer-1 may be considered as members of a Spatial Enhancement Layer-1 PDU Set in that same PDU Family .In addition to having different layers, a video frame may further be divided into tiles that represent different regions of the overall wide (e.g. full 360 degree) view, where tiles belonging to or close to the current user viewport may be sent with a different quality than the other tiles. Additional PDU Families may be considered for this type of media.\n-\tLevel N+1 PDU Family- Application Type/ Media Stream / Sub-Flow - 5GS QoS Flows can carry multiple application flow instances of the same type (e.g. two H.26x video streams) as well as application flow instances of different types (e.g. H.26x video and AAC Audio). To distinguish between these application flows within a QoS Flow, packets associated with an application instance may comprise a PDU Set in the Application Type / Media Stream /Sub-Flow PDU Family.Differentiated QoS handling may be provided to PDUs according to the Application Type / Media Stream / Sub-Flow PDU Set to which they belong (e.g. audio has higher priority than video). Alternatively application flow instances may be mapped to separate QoS Flows, in which case Application Type QoS differentiation can be provided by existing QoS.\nA PDU may be classified as belonging to a PDU Set in just one PDU Family (e.g. an I-Frame PDU Set in a Media Frame/Slice Family), or as belonging to a PDU Set in each of several PDU Families (particularly for scalable/layered media).\nA GTP-U extension header field is defined for each PDU Family. Note that since an individual PDU may be a member of multiple PDU Families, a field for each may be included in the extension header. Proposed PDU Families are:\n1.\tFrame /Slice\n2.\tTemporal Layer\n3.\tSpatial Layer\n4.\tApplication / Media Stream / Sub-Flow\nFor each PDU Family / GTP-U field, sub-fields contain the following information:\n-\tThe PDU Set Type\n-\tA rolling counter to sequentially number each PDU Set instance within a PDU Family (one counter for all PDU Sets within the PDU Family)\n-\tDependency, which is the rolling-counter value previously assigned to the PDU Set instance on which the PDU Set is dependent.\nIn addition a sub-field with a PDU Set Start / End Indicator is provided for the Frame / Slice PDU family so the RAN can take advantage of time between frames for power saving.\nThe rolling counter distinguishes between PDUs belonging to two instances of the same PDU Set Type (e.g. two sequential P-Frames) and is used to indicate dependency of a PDU Set instance on another PDU Set Instance (e.g. a P-Frame's dependency on a specific I-Frame instance, or an enhancement Layer's dependency on a specific base layer instance).\nFor example, for Packets classified in PDU Family #1 (Media Frame/Slice), all packets carrying fragments of a particular I-Frame instance may be assigned a rolling counter value=3. Packets carrying P-Frames that are dependent on that I-Frame instance would have \"3\" indicated in their \"Dependency\" field. In another example, for packets classified in PDU Family #2 (Temporal Layer), all packets carrying fragments of a particular Temporal Base Layer instance may be assigned a rolling counter value=7. Packets carrying Temporal Enhancement Layers that are dependent on that base layer instance would have \"7\" indicated in their \"Dependency\" field.\nPackets can belong to a PDU Set in one or more of the PDU Families as described above. The PDU Set Typesrepresented at each level are defined via configuration. For example, for H.26x video one may have levels PDU Families and PDU Set Types defined as:\nLevel 1: PDU Family #1 = Media Frame/Slice, with Media Types.\n-\tNot Assigned\n-\tIndependent or Random-access Frame or Slice (\"I-Frame\")\n-\tReferenced Frame or Slice (\"P-Frame\" with forward references)\n-\tNon-referenced Frame or Slice (\"P-Frame\" with no forward references)\nLevel 2: PDU Family #2 = Temporal Media Layers, with PDU Set Types\n-\tNot Assigned\n-\tBase Layer\n-\tEnhancement Layer 1\n-\tEnhancement Layer 2\n….\nLevel 3: PDU Family #4 = Spatial Media Layers, with PDU Set Types\n-\tNot Assigned\n-\tBase Layer\n-\tEnhancement Layer 1\n-\tEnhancement Layer 2\n….\nLevel 4: PDU Family #4 = Application/ Media Stream / Sub-Flow, with PDU Set Types\nNot Assigned\nH.26x video\nAAC Audio\n……\nValues for the \"PDU Set Type\" portion of the GTP-U extension header for each PDU Family fields and an example packet marking is shown in Table 6.14.2.1-1. packet from an H.264 video flow identified as carrying an I-Frame fragment in Temporal Enhancement Layer 2 and a Spatial Base layer would be marked in the \"PDU Set Type\" GTP-U sub-header fields defined for the levels as shown in the 4th column of the table 1:\nTable 6.14.2.1-1: Example PDU Set Type GTP-U Extension Header with PDU Family Classification Marking for a Packet\n\nThis structure provides flexibility for cases where Media Unit Identification is available for only a sub-set of PDU Families. For example, if Media Detection can only distinguish packets associated an I-Frame and a P-Frame, or alternatively as associated with a base layer and an enhancement layer, the UPF may classify and mark those Packets accordingly and leave the other fields \"not assigned\". Policy that differentiates packet handling , for example of packets associated with a \"base layer\" vs \"enhancement layer\" may then be applied even if for example the frame-type / slice remains unidentified.\n\nThe resultant, complete classification header markings for each packet would be as shown in figure 6.14.2.1-2.\nThe figure depicts a packet header in the context of a 14.2.1-2 GTP-U protocol, which is used for network layer signaling in the 14.2.1-2 protocol suite. The header includes information about the protocol version, the type of packet, the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol version, and the sequence number. The figure provides a visual representation of the header's structure and helps in understanding the protocol's structure and functionality.\nFigure 6.14.2.1-2: GTP-U Packet Header\nExample entries are shown in parentheses in each sub-field in the figure. The markings are for a PDU carrying an I-Frame for Temporal Enhancement Layer #1 and Spatial Enhancement Layer #1 of an H.264 video stream. Here both enhancement layers are dependent on base layer instances as indicated by the Level 2 and Level 3 dependency fields.\nPackets are classified according to the PDU Sets in PDU Families to which they belong so differentiated QoS that considers PDU Family and PDU Set classification can be applied according to policy provisioned on the SMF or conveyed from the PCF. As per clause 5.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2], currently Priority Level indicates a priority in scheduling resources among QoS Flows. PER and PDB are also assigned per QoS Flow. In this solution it is assumed that each QoS Flow is still assigned a pre-configured or standardized Priority Level, PER and PDB as in standardized 5QI characteristics table (see clause 5.7.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), or a priority level, PER or PDB for the QoS Flow is signalled over NGAP. This is the Reference Priority level, PER and PDB for all the packets within the QoS Flow.\nTo vary Priority Level, PER and PDB according to how a packet is classified, a per-packet adjustment to the Reference Priority Level can be determined according to new Parameteradjustment information provided in QoS information that is pre-configured, associated with a standardized 5QI or sent from the PCF to the NG-RAN, and/or UE. The Parameteradjustment information contains per PDU Family /PDU Set Type adjustments to the Reference ParameterLevels. For each PDU Family and PDU Set type to which a packet belongs, the ParameterAdjustment information provides a value that is added to the Reference Parameter. The resultant sum for all adjustments to the Reference Priority determines the priority of the packet.\nTo illustrate using the Priority Level QoS parameter, as per Table 5.7.4-1 of TS 23.501 [2], a standardized 5QI=89 (Visual content for cloud/edge/split rendering) with a default (Reference) Priority=25 could be selected to transport H.26x video. The priority level adjustment information provided to the NG-RAN corresponding to the packet classification illustrated in Table 6.14.2.1-1 could be as shown in Table 6.14.2-2 (note a reduced priority level means higher priority).\nPackets received at the NG-RAN with GTP-U markings as described above in clause 6.14.2.1 would have their reference parametersadjusted according to the PDU Family and PDU Set Type to which they are associated. For instance, if the reference Priority Level is 25, packets classified as belonging to PDU Set Type #1 (I-Frame) in PDU Family #1 (Media Frame / Slice) would have their priority level decreased by \"2\"\nTable 6.14.2-2: Priority Level Adjustment for H.26x Video for PDU Sets shown in Table 6.14.2.1-1\n\nTo further illustrate, the QoS Flow Reference Priority Level=25 would be decreased by 2 if the packet carries an I-Frame (PDU Family #1, Media Type #1), increased by 1 if the packet carries a Temporal Enhancement Layer 2 (PDU Family #2, Type #3), decreased by 1 if it is in the base Spatial Layer (PDU Family #4, Type #1), and increased by 1 because it is an H.264 video application (PDU Family #5, Type #1) so the resultant priority for the example packet is 24.\nSimilar tables may provide adjustments to the reference level for PER and PDB. These tables would be provided to the, NG-RAN, and/or UE, for example to the NG-RAN in an expanded QoS Profile so the, RAN, and/or UE can treat packets with corresponding classification markings with the appropriate priority.\nIn addition, for each PDU Set Type in each PDU Family, a PDU Set Validity Time as described in clause 6.14.1 may be provided. The PDU Set Validity Time may be used by the NG-RAN to decide whether to transmit or drop the PDUs of a PDU Set instance.\nAdditional QoS differentiation may be provided with additional policy information similar to Table 2 for other QoS Parameters. For example, ARP may be varied depending on whether a packet belongs to a base vs an enhancement layer.\n",

It illustrates the steps involved in managing packets, including the creation of a PDU set, the selection of a PDU, and the execution of the PDU set. The figure also includes a flow chart to illustrate the sequence of events, ensuring a clear understanding of the process.\nFigure 6.14.3.1-1: High-level Procedure of PDU Set integrated packet handling\nAs shown in Figure 6.14.3.1-1, a schematic diagram of the modification process of the PDU session for the XR service is given. The process includes the following steps:\n0.\tThe UE establishes a PDU Session as defined in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3] for a given DNN/S-NSSAI.\n1.\tOptionally, as defined in clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502, the AF may invoke the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request to set up an AF session with required QoS. In the step 1, the AF may send the following information to PCF:\na)\tFlow description of the target media service data flows for PDU Set handling.\nb)\tAssistance information describing media and media characteristics such as Burst periodicity, number of temporal and spatial media layers and their periodicities and dependencies, and Media Detection Rules that specify the RTP header type (for media where RTP header is used).\nc)\tThe PDU Set level packet handling/treatment requirements. The PDU Set level packet handling/treatment requirements are optional and may include e.g. PDU Set Level Priority, PDB and PER.\n2.\tPCF may initiate the PDU Session modification procedure as defined in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The PCF generates appropriate PCC rules based on configuration and the information from AF if supplied in step 1,. The PDU Set/PDU Family level packet handling/treatment requirements may be considered during the PCC rule generation. The PCC rules may also include the detection rules of service data flow, PDU Set level packet handling/treatment policy and PDU Set Media Detection and Classification rules. The PCF sends the PCC rules to SMF.\n3.\tSMF generates the QoS profiles and N4 rules based on the PCC rules from PCF, which may include the packet handling/treatment policy. SMF sends the N4 rules to UPF, which may include the Media Detection and Classification rules for PDU Set(s) in one or more PDU Families. The SMF also sends the QoS profiles to the RAN node via AMF, instructing the RAN to perform PDU Set integrated QoS handling and Media Detection and Classification rules and PDU Set level parameters to the UE\n4.\tBased on received N4 rules or local configuration on the UPF, the UPF identifies media units associated with a downlink PDU, classifies the PDU according to the QoS Flows and PDU Set(s) to which it belongs and marks PDU Set info in the GTP-U layer header in the DL packets, including for each PDU Family, the QoS Flow ID, PDU Set ID (e.g. P-Frame), the instance of the PDU Set (e.g. frame instance number), and optionally a PDU Start/End flag and the instance number of a PDU Set on which this PDU Set instance depends (e.g. I-Frame instance number).\n5.\tFor downlink PDUs, the RAN identifies the PDU Set(s) to which a PDU belongs based on the PDU Set info in the GTP-U header and transmits the PDUs in an integrated manner according to per-PDU Set parameters provided in the QoS Profile (Priority Level, PER and PDB adjustment and PDU Set Validity Time as described in clause 6.14.2.2) and the PDU's membership in the PDU sets. The RAN may drop all PDUs in a PDU Set in case of poor network conditions, when the Validity Time for the PDU Set has expired or when a PDU Set on which a PDU depends is not successfully sent.\n6.\tBased on Media Detection and Classification rules received from the SMF or local configuration, the UE identifies the media units associated with an uplink PDU and classifies the PDU according to the PDU Set(s) to which it belongs. The UE transmits the PDUs in an integrated manner according to per-PDU Set level parameters provided by the SMF (e.g. Priority Level adjustment and PDU Set Validity Time, and the PDU's membership in the PDU sets.\nNOTE:\tThe details of RAN behaviour to enforce policy is up to RAN WGs.\n",

An RTP packet has fixed RTP header format, and the RTP payload could be different media data e.g. H.264 encoded video. A particular kind of payload data has its RTP Payload Format, e.g. for H.264, the RTP payload header format is specified in RFC 6184 [12]. The info carried in RTP header e.g. Marker bit (M), Timestamp, and the info carried in RTP payload header e.g. NRI, S bit, E bit, NAL unit payload type could be used by 5GS to identify the PDUs of one PDU Set, or to differentiate the importance of PDU Sets. For example, as described in RFC 3550 [9], the Marker bit (M) is intended to allow significant events such as frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream. And for H.264 encoded video, as described in RFC 6184 [12], NRI with the value of [0,3] indicates the relative transport priority of the RTP packet, 0 indicates the NAL unit can be discarded without risking the integrity of the reference pictures, while the RTP packets of an I frame should have the NRI value of 3. S bit and E bit indicate the start and end of a NAL unit which is fragmented into several RTP packets. The RTP header also contains sequence number which indicates the packet sequence at RTP layer. With the RTP layer sequence number, 5GS can identify the sequence of PDU Set and the packet sequence within a PDU Set, thus can allocate \"PDU Set Sequence number (SN)\" and \"PDU SN within a PDU Set\".\n-\tPDU Set SN: All PDUs corresponding to the same PDU Set have the same PDU Set SN. PDU Set SN is increased monotonously for each PDU Set.\n-\tPDU SN within a PDU Set: indicates the sequence number of the PDU within a PDU Set.\nFor DL packets, this solution proposes to extend UPF capability to read the RTP layer info i.e. info carried in RTP header and RTP payload header for the XR traffic. With the RTP layer info, UPF can identify the PDUs of one PDU Set, PDU Set sequence, packet sequence within a PDU Set, and to differentiate the importance of PDU Sets. UPF then marks the start packet and end packet of the PDU set, \"PDU Set Sequence number (SN)\", \"PDU SN within a PDU Set\", and marks the importance info to the N3 encapsulation header. When gNB receives DL packets from UPF, with the DL data header marked by UPF, gNB can identify the PDUs of one PDU Set, PDU Set sequence, packet sequence within a PDU Set, and get the importance info of each PDU Set.\nFor UL packets, UE's AS layer can get the PDU Set related info from its upper layer, and requests the radio resource of each PDU Set from gNB by AS layer interaction, thus is not in scope of this solution.\n",

For the untrusted AF, NEF can be involved between the AF and PCF.\n2.\tPCF generates the authorized PCC rule(s) based on the AF request, and performs PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.2 to provide the PCC rule(s) to SMF.

In such case, the PCF may activate the Configured QoS rules in the SMF, and the SMF can provide some general PDR to the UPF to intelligently detect the XRM traffic and performance the mark. E.g. based on the time between the two successive PDU burst to determine the FPS (Frame per Second) of the XRM media, and start/end of the PDU set (and the PDUs between the start and end of the PDU set) if there is only one PDU set in the PDU burst. If there are multiple PDU Sets within a PDU burst, the UPF can intelligently get FPS, the number of the PDU set, start/end of a PDU set (and all the PDUs of this PDU set) based on packet size of the last PDU of the PDU set, since normally the size of the last PDU is less than the MTU while all other PDUs of the PDU set are in the full size of MTU.\nAlso, the normally the UPF can intelligently detect the I-type frame (in H.264 there is only one type frame for I frame, but there are 6 type frames for I frame in H.265 and there are 4 type frames for I frame in H.266) since normally the I frame is the largest frame in the XRM stream and about 5 times bigger than the P type frame and about 20 times bigger than the B type frame. And normally the more important frame within the B/P frames are the frame in the first received frames after the I frame.\nBased on the information provided by the SMF, the UPF can intelligently identify the most important I frame, and second important (P) frame just following the I frame and other less important (B) frame in the XRM stream. However such important information maybe is not reliable in some cases. But the detected FPR, the start/end PDU (and the all the PDUs) of a PDU Set are very reliable in practice and works well even when the traffic is encrypted.\nBased on the detected information, the UPF can mark the QoS Flow and Sub QoS Flows in the GTP-U header as described in clause 2.\nAnd the SMF generates and provides the main QoS profile and the sub QoS profiles to the RAN based on the activated configured QoS rule from the PCF.\nThe SMF generates and provides the main NAS QoS rule and the NAS sub QoS Rules to the UE.\n",

                            "text_content": "For the DL XRM service stream, the UPF needs to identify the PDU Sets in the QoS Flow and also needs to marks the identified PDU Sets in the N3/N9 interface to the RAN.\nThe DL XRM service stream can be carried on RTP/SRTP or not in STP/SRTP from N6 interface, two ways to identify the PDU Sets in RTP/SRTP or not. The UPF also needs to identify the different PDU Sets in a PDU burst, the start/end of each PDU Set, the importance/dependency of each PDU set.\nThe UPF then needs to mark the identified PDU Sets in the GTP-U header (extended GTP-U header) of N3/N9 interface. The UPF need to mark the different PDU Sets, the star/end of each PDU set, the important/dependency of each PDU Set in the GTP-U extension header.\nFinally, the UPF also needs to perform the transport level marking, i.e. the DSCP/TOS for the identified PDU Sets.\nFor the UL XRM service stream, the UE performs the similar PDU Set identification procedure as the UPF. How the UE performs the marking for the identified PDU Set is defined in the RAN.\nIf the XRM service stream is carried over RTP/SRTP, the RFC 6184 [12] / RFC 6190 [13] has defined the encapsulation format for the H.264/AVC stream, the RFC 7798 [21] has defined the encapsulation format for the H.265/HEVC stream. The IETF WG draft is in process to define the encapsulation for the H.266/VVC stream.\nIf the XRM service stream is carried over RTP/SRTP, it is assumed that the XRM AF can provide the XRM service stream information to the PCF (via the NEF), then these stream information are further provided to the UPF by the SMF in the PDR to detect and to the UE by the NAS QoS rules, the UPF and UE use these information to identify the PDU Sets.\nNormally the XRM service stream information provided by the XRM AF can be in SDP or MDP format, and XRM AF can change the format to provide the stream information to the PCF via the service based interface.\nThe XRM service stream information can include the following information (not exhausted):\n-\tIP Packet Filters as defined in clause 5.7.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2] (including the UDP ports for the RTP/SRTP).\n-\tGBR and or MBR.\n-\tRTP Payload type for media type (e.g. H.264/H.265/H.266/VP9/AV1) and clock frequency to measure the timestamp in the RTP header.\n-\tSSID : synchronization Source Identifier.\n-\tSpecial Label Information as defined in related RFCs (e.g. RFC 6184 [12]/RFC 6190 [13] for H.264, RFC 7798 [21] for H.265), including:\n-\tLayer ID.\n-\tTemporal ID.\n-\tNRI.\n-\tNAL Type.\n-\tOther ID and Flags, e.g. DID, QID and Discardable Flag.\nThe figure 6.18.2.1.1-1 provides the detailed information to identify the first packet of a PDU Set.\nThe figure depicts a packet set in a network, specifically a PDU set, with the first packet of a PDU set highlighted. The PDU set is a crucial component in network communication, responsible for transmitting data packets. The figure shows the first packet of a PDU set, which is a crucial part of the network communication process.\nFigure 6.18.2.1.1-1: The First Packet of a PDU Set.\nIf the XRM service stream is carried over RTP/SRTP, the UE/UPF can:\n1.\tUse the IP packet filter in the PDR (for UPF) or in the NAS QoS rules to match the XRM service stream.\n2.\tUse the RTP payload type to identify the media type (e.g. H.264/H.265). the RTP payload type can be provided in the PDR by the SMF.\n3.\tUse the RTP/SRTP header to identify the PDU Set type (i.e. the NAL type).\nNOTE:\tFor the Aggregated SRTP packet, the PDU Set type cannot be identified. In such case, the predefined default PDU Set type can be used.\n4.\tUse the RTP/SRTP header information to identify the PDU importance, e.g.:\na)\tusing the Layer ID + Temporal ID + PDU Set type for the H.265.\nFirst, using the Layer ID + Temporal ID to compare the importance for the two PDU Sets. Smaller value of the Layer ID,\tmore importance of the PDU Set. If the two PDU Sets have the same Layer ID, smaller value of Temporal ID, more importance of the PDU Set. If the two PDU Sets have the same Layer ID and Temporal ID, using the NAL type of the PDU Set to compare. E.g. IRAP type PDU Set is more important than the TRAIL type PDU Set.\nb)\tusing the NRI and PDU Set type for the basic H.264.\nFirst, using the NRI to compare the importance for the two PDU Sets. Smaller value of the NRI, more importance of the PDU Set. If the two PDU Sets have the same NRI, using the NAL type of the PDU Set to compare. E.g. I type PDU Set is more important than P, and P is more important than B type PDU Set.\nIf multilayer H.264 is used, RFC 6190 will be used by the UPF, and similar mechanism as defined for H.265 is used. Only the Layer ID and Temporal ID are placed by other ID, e.g. the QID, TID, DID as defined in RFC 6190 [13].\n5.\tUse the \"Marker\" Flag in the RTP/SRTP header, \"Start\" and \"End\" Flag in the payload header to identity the start and end of a PDU Set. The detailed description can reference to the RFC 6184 [12] / RFC 6190 [13] /RFC 7798 [21].\nIf the XRM stream is not carried in RTP/SRTP, it is assumed that XRM AF can only provide the IP packet filters to identify the XRM service stream. In such case, it is still possible for the UPF to identify the different PDU Sets. The UE/UPF can:\n-\tUse DSCP/TOS to identify the different PDU Sets if the DSCP/TOS has been marked in the XRM service stream by the XRM AF to identify the different NAL type.\n-\tUse the time span between two successive PDU burst to determine the FPS (Frame per Second) of the XRM media.\n-\tUse the size information of the PDU with the full MTU size and PDU with less the MTU Size to determine the PDU Sets in a PDU burst and start and end of all the PDU Sets in the PDU burst.\nOne example is showed in Figure 6.18.2.3-1, the H.265/HEVC stream has 3 slices and the stream is delivered in the raw IP packet without using the RTP/SRTP encapsulation. Using the number of the packets with size smaller than 1500 (MTU) in a PDU Burst, the slices number is 3. (Since there are some non-VCL data in the video stream, like the SPS,PPS, the smaller packets of the packet burst may be bigger than 3. Since some slice packets are small, packets from 1 or 2 slice are aggregated into one packet, so some packet bursts have 1 or 2 smaller packets. If the resolution of the video is increased, almost most of the PDU bursts have 3 smaller packets).\n-\tDetect the I/P/B type frame for the H.264 service stream.\nBut it is some difficult for the UE/UPF to detect the frame type for the H.265 and H.266 stream (in H.264 there is only one type I frame, but there are 6 types of I frame in H.265 and there are 4 types of I frame in H.266). Since normally in H.264, the I frame is the largest frame in the XRM stream and about 5 times bigger than the P type frame and about 20 times bigger than the B type frame. And normally the more important frame within the B/P frames are the frame in the first received frames after the I frame.\n-\tDetect the important PDU Sets in a PDU burst. Normally the first arrived PDU Set is decoded first and the decoded picture will be used by the following pictures, so the more first arrived PDU Set, the more important.\nThe figure depicts the number of packets with size < MTU (1500) in a H.265/HEVC XRM stream, illustrating the compression efficiency of the video codec.\nFigure 6.18.2.1.3-1: Number of Packets with Size < MTU (1500) in a H.265/HEVC XRM stream\nAll in all, if the XRM service stream is totally encrypted or not pre-configured information or no SLA information available, in some cases, the UPF can still intelligently and correctly detect the different PDU Sets and the start and end of a PDU Set and importance of the PDU Set. But in some cases, the UE/UPF can only provide the start and end of the PDU Sets in a PDU burst, but cannot provide the correct importance information for the PDU Set, especially the importance information of the PDU Sets from the different PDU bursts.\nAfter the UPF has identified the PDU Sets, the UPF needs to mark the different PDU Sets in the N3/N9 interface to the RAN in order to provide additional information to help the RAN to different the radio resource admission control and scheduling.\nUPF marks PDU Sets with the proposed XQFI, the main functions are listed as below. The QFI and XQFI list are provided by the SMF during the QoS Flow establishment or during the QoS Flow modification procedure.\n1)\tAll the PDU Sets of a XRM user plane traffic is mapped to the same QoS Flow.\n2)\tThe QoS Flow is composed with multiple sub QoS Flows, i.e. the different PDU Set can be mapped to different sub QoS Flow of the QoS Flow.\n3)\tEach Sub QoS Flow is identified with a XQFI which is composed with the QoS Flow ID (QFI) and a sub QoS Flow ID (SQFI), the XQFI (= QFI + SQFI) is unique per UE and the SQFI is unique per QoS Flow.\n4)\tThe XQFI is used in the GTP-U header in the N3/N9 GTP-U traffic for the XRM PDU Sets.\n5)\tThe UPF maps the DL PDU Sets to a QoS Flow and a Sub QoS Flow of the QoS Flow and includes the XQFI in the encapsulation GTP-U header.\n6)\tUPF performs transport level packet marking in DL on per sub QoS Flow basis. The UPF uses the transport level packet marking value provided by the SMF.\nThere are two options, anyone of the two options can be supported in Rel-18:\n1)\tNo explicit start and end mark in the GTP-Header, the first GTP-U packet with XQFI indicated the start of the PDU Set with XQFI, and last GTP-U packet with XQFI indicated the end of the PDU Set with XQFI.\na)\tThis method needs a timer in the GTP-U receiver (e.g. the RAN) to detect if there is no any following GTP-U packet (e.g. the last PDU Set in a PDU burst), then it concludes the end of the PDU Set with the XQFI.\n2)\tExplicit start and end mark in the GTP-Header, i.e. the first GTP-U packet with XQFI has the \"start\" marker in the GTP-U header and the last PDU has the \"end\" marker in the GTP-U header.\na)\tThis method normally needs a timer in the GTP-U sender (e.g. the UPF) to detect if there if there is no any following GTP-U packet (e.g. the last PDU Set in a PDU burst), then it marks the \"end\" in the GTP-U header.\nBoth methods need the GTP-U packets are delivered in order.\nThe SQFI is unique per QoS low and XQFI is unique per UE, e.g. PDU set-1 SQFI= 0010, PDU set-2 SQFI = 0012.\nThere are two options, anyone of the two options can be supported in Rel-18:\n1)\tImportance ID = SQFI, the value of sub QoS Flow ID (i.e. SQFI) indicates the importance of the PDU Set.\nNormally the smaller value, the more importance, the value of zero is the most importance PDU Set.\n2）Importance ID in the Sub QoS Flow QoS profile in control plane indicates the importance of the PDU Set.\nNormally, A XQFI identifies a PDU Set, and a Sub QoS Flow QoS profile with the XQFI includes an Importance ID which indicates the importance of the PDU Set.\nIn the H.264, the P frame depends on I frame, the B frame depends on I frame, P frame and possible other B frames. If there are multiple successive B (e.g. over 3) frames in the GOP, it is very hard to identify the dependency between these B frames.\nIn the H.265 and H.266, with different type of I frame (6 types of I frame in H.265 and 4 types of I frame in H.266) and different type of B/P frame (10 types of B/P frame in H.265 and 4 types of B/P frame in H.266), it is very hard to identify the dependency of the PDU Sets with the same Layer ID and the same Temporal ID.\nSince it is very easy to use the Layer ID, Temporal ID to identify the dependency between different layer and between different temporal, and the Layer ID and temporal ID is also used to identify the importance information of the PDU Set, it is proposed that there is no explicit dependency ID defined, and the importance ID can be used both as importance information and dependency information.\n",

The control plane related aspects are described in Solution 25 in clause 6.25.\nThe figure depicts a PDU Set based QoS framework, highlighting the identification of PDU Set UP aspects for QoS management. It illustrates the use of a PDU Set based QoS framework, which is crucial for ensuring high-quality service delivery in telecommunication networks. The framework includes various PDU Set UP aspects, such as the identification of PDU Set UP, the selection of PDU Set UP, and the management of PDU Set UP. This framework is essential for ensuring that telecommunication services are delivered efficiently and reliably.\nFigure 6.20.2.1-1: PDU Set based QoS framework: UP aspects for PDU Set identification\nThe solution is based on the UPF generating additional N3 PDU Set metadata to be provided in the PDU (i.e. GTP-U) headers to the RAN to help it identify PDU Sets and to which PDU Set a PDU belongs, so that the RAN can properly determine how to use the allocated resources. How the UPF generates the N3 PDU Set Metadata is independent of how the N3 PDU Set Metadata is encoded and sent to the RAN. Figure 6.20.2.2-1 shows the N3 PDU Set metadata added to the PDUs by the UPF and sent to the RAN.\nThe UPF can generate the metadata in the following ways:\n-\tBased on metadata generated by the AS. The metadata provided by the AS to the UPF may include similar information to the one included in the N3 PDU Set Metadata (see below) and it can be signalled in a proprietary or in a standardized way.\nNOTE 1:\tExamples of PDU Set marking mechanisms are proprietary/non standardized mechanisms. Some other examples are described in clauses 6.7.3.2.2 and 6.12.3.2. Solution X in clause 6.X (Negotiation of details of marking mechanisms for AS to UPF communication) describes how such and other marking mechanisms can be negotiated between AF and 5GS.\n-\tBased on implementation specific ways. The UPF may generate the N3 PDU Set Metadata by analysing the UP data transferred by the AS and by applying, e.g. deep packet inspection.\nNOTE 2:\tPDU Set detection mechanisms such as deep packet inspection and machine learning does not work in case fully end-to-end encrypted traffic (e.g. HTTPS). However, according to NOTE 2 in clause 4.1, the scenario of fully end-to-end encrypted traffic is not part of this study item.\nNOTE 3:\tDetails of the communication between UPF and RAN, and between RAN and UE are to be discussed in RAN WG3 and RAN WG2, respectively.\nThe figure depicts a network device (UPF) sending a set of metadata to the Radio Access Network (RAN) using a PDU (Power Distribution Unit). The metadata includes information about the network's status, such as the number of active users, the number of active devices, and the number of active subnets. The PDU is a crucial component of the network, as it enables the UPF to send data to the RAN without the need for a physical connection. The figure illustrates the network's architecture and the role of the PDU in managing the network's resources.\nFigure 6.20.2.2-1: UPF sending N3 PDU set metadata to the RAN\nThe following pieces of information are included in the UPF generated PDU Set metadata sent to the RAN:\n-\tPDU Set Identifier (PSID). This is necessary to identify to which PDU Set a certain PDU belongs. The PSID needs to be added to each PDU header.\n-\tPDU sequence number within the PDU Set. This is used to identify the position of each received PDU within the PDU Set and is helpful to identify when the PDU Set begins and, in case PDUs arrive out of order, to properly reconstruct the PDU Set.\n-\tPDU Set size (expressed in number of bits or of PDUs). This parameter is used to identify when a PDU Set ends that the RAN can allocate the appropriate amount of radio resources for the specific PDU Set. The PDU Set size shall be consistent with the PDU Set maximum size associated to the QoS Flow transporting the PDU Set (see clause 6.20). The PDU Set size is added to the PDU Header of the first PDU of the PDU Set.\n-\tLast PDU Indication. This flag indicates whether or not a PDU is the last PDU of a certain PDU Set (identified by the PDU Sequence Number).\nNOTE 4:\tCertain applications may not be able to compute the PDU Set Size before the whole PDU Set has been sent. In that case the Last PDU Indication needs to be used.\n-\tPDU Set Content Criteria and PDU Set Content Ratio. These parameters are optionally used if the PDU Set Content Criteria or the PDU Set Content Ratio of the specific PDU Set differ from the default values of the QoS Flow indicated at QoS Flow establishment (see clause 6.25).\nNOTE 5:\tAdditional parameters may be identified depending on, e.g. cooperation with RAN WGs and SA WG4.\nThe PDU Set related parameters describe above are applicable both in DL and in UL.\nNOTE 6:\tThe provision of PDU Set related parameters to the NG-RAN in DL is independent of the DL detection mechanism. Similarly, the provision of UL PDU Set related parameters from the UE to the NG-RAN is independent of the UE detection mechanism.\nThe UPF selects the GTP-U tunnel over which the PDU Sets needs to be forwarded. The mapping between XR traffic and QoS flows is done by using the existing IP Packet Filter Sets mechanism (see clause 5.7.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) with the assumption that each QoS Flow is associated with PDU Sets with specific QoS Characteristics values. As an example, the following filters could be applied (see Solution 25 for a detailed description of the CP parameters):\n-\tPSDB = 50ms, PSER = 10-5, PSMS = 50000B  QoS Flow ID = 1  IP address = 1.2.3.4, port = 5678;\n-\tPSDB = 100ms, PSER = 10-4, PSMS = 100000B  QoS Flow ID = 2  IP address = 1.2.3.5, port = 5679.\nNOTE 7:\tIt is assumed that an application uses different port numbers for data streams of different QoS requirements.\n",

The PCF then generates the new PCC rules and send the PCC rules to the SMF.

The GTP-U header is extended to include information of the PDU Set, for example, the PDU Set ID and an indication of last packet of the PDU set.

                            "text_content": "This solution assumes that there is a set of preconfigured N6 tunnels between the UPF serving as a PDU Session Anchor (PSA) in the 5GS on one hand and a trusted 5G-XR Application Server (5G-XR AS) on the other hand, as illustrated in Figure 6.22.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a 5G-XR support scenario with N6 tunnels, illustrating the use of 5G technology to enable extended reality (XR) applications. The figure shows the 5G network infrastructure, including base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, with N6 tunnels connecting the network to the user's device. The use of N6 tunnels enables seamless communication between the network and the user's device, enabling immersive and interactive experiences.\nFigure 6.22.2-1: 5G-XR support with N6 tunnels\nThe following are the salient features of this solution:\n-\tThe UPF with preconfigured N6 tunnels is selected based on the S-NSSAI/DNN requested by the UE during PDU Session establishment.\n-\tAny suitable tunnelling technology can be used for the N6 tunnel between the UPF (PSA) and the 5G-XR AS provided that it relies on extendable encapsulation header (see below for the extended header information proposed by this solution) that can carry vendor-specific information.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the scope of this study this solution assumes that GTP-U encapsulation over N6 with the extensions defined in this solution is used. Using encapsulation protocols defined by the IETF (e.g. GRE) would require registration of a new Protocol Type with IANA.\nNOTE 2:\tThe use of GTP-U on N6 is already supported using the Traffic Steering functionality described in clause 5.4.8 of TS 29.244 [49]. Specifically, the Outer Header Creation IE (clause 8.2.56 of TS 29.244 [49]) and Outer Header Removal IE (clause 8.2.64 of TS 29.244 [49]) support the use of GTP-U.\n-\tThe trusted 5G-XR AS (i.e. the 5G-XR AS at the other end of the N6 tunnel) provides PDU Set-related information in the N6 tunnelling encapsulation header. Whether the PDU payload is encrypted or not is irrelevant, given that all the information that is relevant for PDU Set-level traffic handling is copied in the (external) N6 tunnelling header.\n-\tThe PDU Set-related information is further propagated on N9/N3 towards the RAN inside the GTP-U header using new header extension inside the Frame format for the PDU Session user plane protocol defined in clause 5.5.2 of TS 38.415 [24].\n-\tTraffic destined to multiple 5G-XR Clients (residing in the same or in different UEs) can be multiplexed in the same N6 tunnel.\n-\tThe binding of downlink packets onto QoS Flows is performed by the UPF PSA using the existing functionality specified in clause 6.1.3.2.4 of TS 23.503 [4]. In other words, the QoS Flow binding does not rely on the PDU Set-related information in the N6 tunnelling encapsulation header.\n-\tThe extended header can include any of the following information:\n-\tXR stream identifier (XRS ID): identifies all Protocol Data Units (PDUs) corresponding to the same eXtended Reality or media traffic stream. The uniqueness of this identifier is ensured by the 5G-XR AS.\n-\tXR Multi-modal Data identifier (XRMD ID): optional identifier indicating all Protocol Data Units (PDUs) corresponding to a set of distinct XR traffic streams that are affiliated with each other e.g. in case of Multi-modal Data. The uniqueness of this identifier is ensured by the 5G-XR AS.\nNOTE 2:\tXRMD ID can be used by NG-RAN to provide joint delivery of PDUs belonging to affiliated XR traffic streams.\n-\tPDU Handling Type (PHT): indicates whether in case of PDU loss the remainder of the PDUs in the PDU Set should be discarded or not.\n-\tPDU Set sequence number (PS-SN): indicates the PDU Set to which a PDU belongs. All PDUs corresponding to the same PDU Set have the same PS-SN in the encapsulation header. PS-SN is increased monotonously by the 5G-XR AS.\n-\tPDU sequence number (PDU-SN): indicates the sequence number of the PDU within a PDU Set.\n-\tLast PDU Flag (LPF): indicates the last PDU in a PDU Set.\n-\tPDU Set Priority (PSP): indicates the priority of the PDU Set to which the PDU belongs. The PDUs belonging to the same PDU Set have the same priority. PDUs from one PDU Set can have different priority compared to PDUs from another PDU Set.\n-\tReference PDU Set SN (RPS-SN): optional parameter used for PDU Sets that depend on a more important (Reference) PDU Set and need to be transmitted only if the Reference PDU Set has been successfully transmitted.\nThe use of PS-SN, PDU-SN and LPF allows the network entities (UPF or NG-RAN) to determine the PDU Set boundaries, as well as any loss of PDUs. Upon detection of a lost PDU, the network entity can decide to drop the remaining PDUs belonging to the same PDU Set e.g. based on the PHT.\nSimilarly, the use of RPS-SN allows the network entities (UPF or NG-RAN) to drop all dependent PDU Sets if the Reference PDU Set has not been transmitted successfully.\nIn the Control plane the solution assumes that a PDU Set Error Rate (PSER) parameter (as in Solutions #8 and #25) is indicated in association with the 5QI. When the PSER is indicated, it overrides the PER of the corresponding 5QI\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether the same PSER or different PSERs are used when PDU Sets with different importance to the application layer are sharing the same QoS Flow.\nIn presence of congestion, the network entity (NG-RAN or UPF) can rely on the PPPS to determine which PDU Sets should be dropped preferably.\nNOTE 3:\tThe encoding of the extended header information listed above is a stage-3 matter.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to RAN WG to determine whether the extended header information listed above could be used for additional purposes (e.g. selection of coding and modulation scheme on the radio interface, etc.).\n",

Within one PDU set, if the number of lost packets are more than certain threshold, other packets within the PDU set can't be used to recover the frames. There is also the case that certain data packets are dependent by other packets within the PDU set for decoding. So it's helpful to consider the dependency between the packets within the PDU set in the 5GS to further improve the transmission efficiency. It is also possible that the dependency between different PDU sets exists. The packets which are dependent by other packets are considered to be more important. Both the inter and intra PDU set dependency information are helpful for handling the packets dropping during the congestion situation.\nThe application layer has the knowledge of the dependency between the packets, so it's possible for the application layer to identify the PDU sets for the dependent packets. It is also assumed that some header information is not encrypted and can be used to identify the packets within the PDU set by the application layer. The application layer could provide the dependency information within the header information to help the network to identify the PDU set and dependency information intra and inter the PDU set.\nThis solution is based on the current the network exposure framework and QoS model with the following enhancements.\n-\tThe AF could send the external header information and the handling request of the PDU set to the 5GS including the packet loss threshold. So during the congestion situation, if the lost packets within PDU set are above the threshold, other packets within the PDU set can also be dropped. When considering the packets dropping, the dependency information intra or inter the PDU sets could also be considered. This dependency information could also convey the importance information of the packets.\n-\tThe PCF generates the PCC rules considering the PDU set.\n-\tThe SMF generates the following N4 session management parameters related with PDU set handling parameters:\n-\tPDRs: detection of the header information of the IP packets within the QoS flow to identify the PDU set and the dependency information intra or inter the PDU sets.\n-\tFARs:\n-\tadding the PDU set internal header information to the GTP-U header (e.g. PDU set identification, PDU sequency number within a PDU set, etc.) to mark the data packets within the PDU set;\n-\toptionally adding the dependency information intra and/or inter PDU set to the GTP-U header;\n-\tdropping the packets of the PDU set if the lost packets within the PDU set are above the threshold.

The figure also shows the flow of packets through the network, with the PPUs responsible for routing and forwarding packets based on their destination and priority. The diagram is crucial for understanding the complex network architecture and ensuring efficient packet handling in telecommunications networks.\nFigure 6.23.3-1: PDU set related packet handling procedure\n1.\tTo create a new request, the AF invokes a Nnef_PDUSetHandling_Create service operation (Target, AF Identifier, Flow description(s), PDU set handling information).

The figure illustrates the RTP header extension with a graphical representation, highlighting the different types of frames and their corresponding markers. This extension is essential for applications that require the efficient management of data and the reliable transmission of multimedia content.\nFigure 6.24.3.2.1-1: Frame Marking RTP header extension for non-scalable streams\nIn the above RTP header extension (see clause 3.1 of draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11]):\n-\tThe I field named as Independent Frame reflects whether a frame can be decoded independent of temporally prior frames or not. 1 means this frame can be decoded independent of temporally prior frames, e.g. intra-frame, IDR frame of H.264/H.265 or VP8/9 keyframe.\n-\tThe D field named as Discardable Frame which reflects whether a frame is droppable or not. 1 means the sender knows this frame can be discarded, and still provide a decodable media stream.\nUPF can based the above I field or D field to identify the important PDU Set/frame.\nIf scalable streams (i.e. different temporary, spatial, quality layers) is used, the RTP header extension is defined as following:\nThe figure depicts a 24-bit, 3-2-1-2 RTP header extension for scalable streams, which is used to enhance the signaling capabilities of the network. This extension allows for the transmission of more data and improved quality, making it suitable for high-capacity applications.\nFigure 6.24.3.2.1-2: Frame Marking RTP header extension for scalable streams\nThe TID field named as Temporal ID identifies the temporal layer/sub-layer encoded, starting with 0 for the base layer, and increasing with higher temporal fidelity. Higher values of TID identify higher temporal layers with higher frame rates as defined in draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11].\nThe LID field named as Layer ID identifies the spatial and quality layer encoded, starting with 0 for the base layer, and increasing with higher fidelity. Higher values of LID identify higher spatial and/or quality layers with higher resolutions and/or bitrates as defined in draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking [11].\nUPF can based on the TID and LID field to identify the independent PDU Set/base layer.\nOption#2. Identification based on H.264 NALU header\nFor each RTP packet, a H.264 NAL unit header is included following RTP header. For RTP payload carrying H.264 video slices, according to RFC 6184 [12], the H.264 NAL unit header is as following:\nThe figure depicts the H.264 NAL unit header format, which is a crucial component in the compression and decompression of video and audio data in H.264 video compression. The header format is used to store the video and audio data, as well as metadata, such as the video resolution, frame rate, and bit rate. The format is standardized and used in various video compression standards, including H.264, H.265, and H.266. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the header format, making it easy to understand and use in video compression applications.\nFigure 6.24.3.2.1-3: H.264 NAL unit header format\nIn the NAL unit header, the NRI value indicates the relative transport priority, as determined by the encoder. According to clause 5.3 of RFC6184 [12], a value of 00 indicates that the content of the NAL unit is not used to reconstruct reference pictures. Such NAL units can be discarded without risking the integrity of the reference. Values greater than 00 indicate that the decoding of the NAL unit is required to maintain the integrity of the reference pictures. The highest transport priority is 11, followed by 10, and then by 01; finally, 00 is the lowest.\nTherefore, UPF can use the NRI value to identify the importance information of NAL unit carrying the PDU Set/slice. In case the frame includes only one slice, the method can be used to detect the importance of the frame.\nIf scalable streams are used, the RTP NAL unit header is defined in RFC 6190 [13] can be used to identify the importance/dependency information of PDU Set in different media layers.\nThe scalable streams use NAL unit type 14, 15, and 20 for prefix NAL unit, subset sequence parameter set and coded slice in scalable extension respectively as described in Figure 6.24.3.2.1-3. NAL unit type 14 and 20 indicate the presence of three additional octets in the NAL unit header, as shown below.\nThe figure depicts a 24-bit, 3-2-1-4 NAL unit header, which is an essential component in the 24-bit, 3-2-1-4 modulation scheme used in 24-bit, 3-2-1-4 modulation. The figure illustrates the structure of the NAL unit header, including the octets, which are used to store the data in the 24-bit format. The figure also shows the additional octets in the NAL unit header, which are used to store additional information such as the modulation scheme and the data rate.\nFigure 6.24.3.2.1-4: additional octets in the NAL unit header\nThe PRID field named as priority_id specifies a priority identifier for the NAL unit. A lower value of PRID indicates a higher priority.\nThe DID field named as dependency_id indicates the inter-layer coding dependency level of a layer representation. At any PDU Set, a layer representation with a given dependency_id may be used for inter-layer prediction for coding of a layer representation with a higher dependency_id, while a layer representation with a given dependency_id shall not be used for inter-layer prediction for coding of a layer representation with a lower dependency_id. The dependency_id gives the details on the dependency relationship between different layers. For example, a layer of DID=n will be decoded based on another layer of DID=n-1.\nUPF can determine importance information based on PRID field and/or determine dependency information based on the DID field.\nNOTE 1:\tOption 2 depends on the readability of NALU header in RTP payload. If RTP payload is encrypted, e.g. SRTP is used, option 2 will not applicable.\nOption#3. Identification based on assistance information from AF\nPDU sets group refers to a group of PDU sets which have some dependency relationship among them (e.g. PDU sets carrying the video contents from the same GOP, PDU sets carrying the video contents from the same video segment, etc.). In a PDU sets group, the dependency relationship among the PDU sets can be represented by the PDU set priority. E.g. PDU set carrying I, 1st P, 2nd P, 3rd P frame in a GOP could be assigned to priority level 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. PDU set carrying the base layer, enhancement layer 1, enhancement layer 2 of a video segment could be assigned to priority 1, 2, 2 respectively.\nThe media application (i.e. AF) may provide/update to 5GS importance/dependency information of PDU sets in the form of group size (i.e. number of PDU set), indication of starting/ending PDU set of a group of PDU sets (e.g. sequence number, transmission time), importance/dependency information of the PDU set with respects to the position/order of PDU set in the group of PDU sets. 5GS derives the importance/dependency relationship between different PDU sets using the assistance information from AF. Option#3 can be used together with UP based identification (i.e. Option #1, Option #2, Option #5 or Option #6). Information derived from UP based identification, if available, takes precedence to the one derived from option 3. For example, PDU set with 'I' field set in the RTP header or an 'IDR' indicates/resets the start of a group of PDU sets. The PDU sets with the highest importance or the base PDU set is detected using option #1, #2, #5, #6, the importance/dependency information of other PDU sets is derived further with the assistance information from AF. Option#3 also applies to the cases where the RTP header or NAL header is encrypted.\nOption#4. Identification based on traffic pattern\nIn general, different PDU Sets have different traffic patterns, e.g. size of one PDU Set, number of packets within one PDU Set. For example, the size of I frame is generally 2-3 times larger than P frame. Therefore, the traffic patterns can be used to identify the frame type and hence the importance information of PDU Set.\nNOTE 2:\tAccuracy of the detection in option 4 depends on the implementation of UPF.\nOption#5. Identification based on H.265 NALU header\nFor each RTP packet, a H.265 NAL unit header is included following RTP header. For RTP payload carrying H.265 video slices, according to RFC 7798 [21], the H.265 NAL unit header is as following:\nThe figure depicts the H.265 NAL unit header format, which is a crucial component in the compression and decompression of video and audio data in the H.265 video compression standard. The header format is used to store the video and audio data, as well as metadata, in a standardized format that can be easily understood and processed by the video and audio processing systems. The figure provides a visual representation of the header format, including the number of bytes per frame, the number of frames per second, and the number of channels. This information is crucial for understanding the compression and decompression process, as well as for ensuring that the video and audio data is processed correctly.\nFigure 6.24.3.2.1-5: H.265 NAL unit header format\nThe 6-bit Type field in the H.265 NAL unit header can indicate the content of VCL (video coding layer) NAL unit. Table 6.24.3.2.1-1 shows the VCL NAL units as defined in H.265 [46]. H.265 [46] includes signalling in the NAL unit header, through NAL unit types, of IRAP (Intra-Random Access Point) pictures beyond IDR (Instantaneous Decoding Refresh) pictures defined in H.264 [19]. Three types of IRAP pictures, namely IDR, CRA (Clean Random Access), and BLA (Broken Link Access) pictures, are supported: IDR pictures are conventionally referred to as closed group-of-pictures (closed-GOP) random access points whereas CRA and BLA pictures are conventionally referred to as open-GOP random access points. The BLA, IDR and CRA pictures do not refer to any pictures other than themselves for inter prediction in its decoding process. The BLA, IDR and CRA pictures are considered as the most important pictures, other pictures are encoded based on these pictures.\nTherefore, UPF can use the NAL unit value of BLA, IDR or CRA to identify the importance information of NAL unit carrying the PDU Set/slice.\nTable 6.24.3.2.1-1 H.265 VCL NAL units\n\nIf temporal scalability streams are used, TID (TemporalId) field in the NAL unit header indicates the relative importance of an RTP packet. For example, NAL units belonging to higher temporal sub-layers are not used for the decoding of lower temporal sub-layers. A lower value of TID indicates a higher importance. More-important NAL units may be better protected against transmission losses than less-important NAL units based on temporal scalability.\nTherefore, UPF can determine importance information of NAL unit carrying the PDU Set/slice based on TID field.\nNOTE 3:\tOption#5 depends on the readability of NALU header in RTP payload. If RTP payload is encrypted, e.g. SRTP is used, option#5 will not be applicable.\nOption#6. Identification based on H.266 NALU header\nFor each RTP packet, a H.266 NAL unit header is included following RTP header. For RTP payload carrying H.266 video slices, according to draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-vvc-14 [48], the NAL unit header is as following:\nThe figure depicts the H.266 NAL unit header format, which is a crucial component in the H.266 video compression standard. The header includes various fields such as the video stream identifier (VSI), video stream type (VST), video stream length (VSL), and video stream format (VSF). The format is standardized to ensure compatibility and efficient transmission of video data over the network.\nFigure 6.24.3.2.1-6: H.266 NAL unit header format\nThe 5-bit Type field in the H.266 NAL unit header can indicate the content of VCL(video coding layer) NAL unit. Table 6.24.3.2.1-2 shows the VCL NAL units as defined in H.266 [47]. The IDR and CRA pictures do not refer to any pictures other than themselves for inter prediction in its decoding process. One of the H.266 features is that a the first coded picture in a bitstream can start with a GDR(Gradual Decoding Refresh) picture, without requiring presence of traditional random access points in the bitstream, such as IDR and CRA. In GOP, the IDR, CRA and GDR pictures are considered as the most important pictures, other NAL units are encoded based on these pictures.\nTherefore, UPF can use the NAL unit values of IDR, CRA or GDR to identify the importance information of NAL unit carrying the PDU Set/slice.\nTable 6.24.3.2.1-2 H.266 VCL NAL units\n\nIf temporal scalability streams are used, TID (TemporalId) field in the NAL unit header indicates the relative importance of an RTP packet. For example, NAL units belonging to higher temporal sub-layers are not used for the decoding of lower temporal sub-layers. A lower value of TID indicates a higher importance. More-important NAL units may be better protected against transmission losses than less-important NAL units based on temporal scalability.\nTherefore, UPF can determine importance information of NAL unit carrying the PDU Set/slice based on TID field.\nNOTE 1:\tFor non-VCL NAL unites, the UPF determines the importance information based on local configuration. For example, the non-VCL NAL unites could be assigned with a higher importance based on operator configuration.\nNOTE 2:\tOption#6 depends on the readability of NALU header in RTP payload. If RTP payload is encrypted, e.g. SRTP is used, option#6 will not be applicable.\nWhen the PDU Set stands for a video slice, the RTP Payload as defined in RFC 6184 [12], RFC 7798 [21] and draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-vvc-14 [48]can be used to identify the priorities between different video slices. Details can be found in option#2, option#5 and option#6 of clause 6.24.3.2.1.\n",

                            "text_content": "Figure 6.25.2-1 describes the overall QoS Framework for supporting PDU Sets with an emphasis on the pieces of information that need to be exchanged over the control plane interfaces and on the roles of the related network entities. The user plane related aspects are described in Solution 20 in clause 6.20.\nThe figure depicts a 25.2.1 -1 PDU set based QoS framework, which is a crucial component of the CP signalling aspects in the 25.2.1 -1 PDU set. This framework ensures that the QoS requirements of the network are met by providing a set of QoS parameters for the PDU set. The figure illustrates the various QoS parameters, such as the maximum data rate, minimum delay, and maximum jitter, which are essential for ensuring reliable communication in the network.\nFigure 6.25.2.1-1: PDU Set based QoS framework: CP signalling aspects\nThe roles of the different network functions and UE remains essentially the same as in the case of the traditional (per-PDU) QoS framework. The main changes are:\n-\tExtension of the QoS related information exchanged between AF, CN, RAN and UE to indicate the per-PDU Set QoS requirements provided by the AF the associated QoS parameters.\n-\tNegotiation between the AF and 5GS about the capability to support the per-PDU Set QoS framework.\nNOTE:\tThe negotiation between AF and 5GS may provide also PDU Set identification information helpful to identify PDU Sets in the 5GS. Such details are described in solution Y.\nThe new per-PDU Set QoS framework needs:\n-\tA new type of QoS Profile specifically defined to describe QoS Flows that support a per-PDU Set traffic delivery.\n-\tA new set of QoS Characteristics associated to the 5QI describing a PDU Set capable QoS Flow.\nThe new type of QoS Profile specifically defined to support a PDU Set (PS) based QoS framework includes:\n-\tPDU Set 5QI (PS5QI). The PS5QI is needed to describe the QoS characteristics associated with the QoS flow supporting the transport of PDU Sets.\nFor each PS5QI value indicating a QoS Flow supporting the transport of PDU Sets, the following QoS characteristics derived from the per-PDU QoS framework but applied to PDU Sets are indicated.\nResource type.\nIn the same way as for the PDU based QoS framework, this parameter indicates if the resources of Non-Guaranteed Bit Rate (Non-GBR), GBR or Delay-Critical GBR (see clause 5.7.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nDefault Priority level.\nThe priority level used to prioritize QoS Flows when scheduling resources. The usage of this parameter is the same as for the case of PDU based QoS framework (see clause 5.7.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nPDU Set Delay Budget (PSDB).\nThe PDU Set Delay Budget (PSDB) defines an upper bound for the time that a PS may be delayed between the UE and the N6 termination point at the UPF before being considered as not successfully delivered.\nThe PSDB applies to the DL PDU Sets received by the UPF over the N6 interface and represents the difference between the time when the last bit of the last PDU of the PDU Set is injected into the UPF and the time when the last bit of the last PDU of the PDU Set is delivered to the UE. For UL, it applies to the UL PDU Sets sent by the UE and represents the difference between the time when the last bit of the last PDU of the PDU Set is sent by the UE and the time when the last bit of the last PDU of the PDU Set is delivered to the UPF.\nNOTE 1:\tThis implies that the time by which all PDUs in the PDU set have to be received by the UE (for DL) and by the UPF (for UL) is determined when the last PDU of the PDU set is received at the RAN.\nThe 5G Access Network Packet Delay Budget (5G-AN PSDB) is determined by subtracting a static value for the Core Network Packet Delay Budget (CN PSDB).\nThe PSDB is used to support the configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points).\nNOTE 2:\tIf a RAN node supports per PDU Set QoS Characteristics and it receives the PSDB, then the (per packet) PDB is ignored.\nNominal PDU Set Delay Budget (NPSDB).\nIn the case of periodic DL traffic, the Nominal Arrival Time represents the time at which each DL PDU Set of the QoS Flow is supposed to be received at the UPF, whereas the (actual) arrival time is the time when each DL PDU Set is received at the UPF. In this case, the Nominal PDU Set Delay Budget (NPSDB) is the same concept of the PDSB but applied to the Nominal Arrival Time of PDU Set. Figure 6.25.2.3-1 shows the relationship between Nominal and actual arrival time and between PSDB and Nominal PSDB.\nThe figure depicts a PS Nominal Arrival Time and Nominal PDU Set Delay Budget (NPSDB) for a 25.2.3-1 network. The NPSDB is a key metric in network performance evaluation, representing the minimum delay required to deliver a packet to the destination. The figure shows the relationship between the arrival time and the set delay budget, which is an important factor in network planning and optimization.\nFigure 6.25.2.3-1: PS Nominal Arrival Time and Nominal PDU Set Delay Budget (NPSDB)\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that the Nominal Arrival Time of PDU Sets for a periodic DL traffic is known at the 5GS and does not need to be signaled.\nNOTE 4:\tThe NPSDB and the PSDB are used in a mutually exclusive way, i.e. if the NPSDB is used for a QoS Flow, then the PSDB is not used, and vice-versa.\nPDU Set Error Rate (PSER).\nThe PDU Set error rate is an upper bound for the ratio between the number of PDU Sets not successfully received and the total number of PDU Sets sent towards a recipient measured over a measurement window.\nThe PSER can be used by the communication system to set rate adaptation target, number of HARQ retransmission, RLC parameters based on PSER rather than on PER.\nNOTE 5:\tPDU Sets with different PSER values are mapped onto different QoS Flows. The details of how to map PDU Sets with different QoS characteristics values to different QoS Flows is described in clause 6.20.1\nAveraging Window\nThis applies only to QoS flows of GBR and Delay-Critical GBR type and, as for the PDU based QoS framework, it is used to calculate the GFBR and MFBR values associated with the QoS flow (see clause 5.7.3.6 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIn addition to the QoS characteristics derived from the per-PDU QoS framework, these additional QoS characteristics applicable only to PDU Sets are indicated for each PS5QI:\nPDU Set Maximum Size (PSMS) expressed in bytes.\nThe PSMS indicates to the RAN scheduler an upper bound on how many bytes can be scheduled within a certain delay budget:\nPDU Set Discard Time (PSDT).\nThe PDU Set Discard Time is an upper bound for the time that a PS has been waiting for transmission at the sender of a link layer protocol (e.g. RLC in RAN of a 3GPP access) before being discarded.\nThe PSDT applies to the DL PDU Set received by the UPF over the N6 interface, and to the UL PDU Set sent by the UE.\nIn the case of 3GPP access, the PSDT is used to support the configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points).\nThe PS is retained in queue beyond PSDB, up to PSDT: the application considers the PS as not useful if received beyond the discard time. For example, there can be XR type traffic for which the PS is useful for decoding subsequent PDU sets even if they are not available within the associated PSDB for display.\nPDU Set Content Criterion (PSCC) and PDU Set Content Ratio (PSCR).\nSince, as reported in the definition of`` PDU Set in clause 3.2, \"In some cases, the application layer can still recover parts of the information unit, when some PDUs [of the PDU Set] are missing.\", it is necessary to provide to the scheduler when needed an indication of the criterion associated to the PDU Set.\nThe PDU Set content criterion (PSCP) refers to criteria based on which a recipient can determine whether the PS can be considered successfully delivered or not. The PSCP allows to specify the relative importance of bits/PDUs within a PS and its purpose is to enable an appropriate link layer protocol configurations and functions (e.g. Scheduling, RLC and HARQ in RAN of a 3GPP access). A minimal set of PSCPs is shown in Table 6.25.2.3-1 below.\nTable 6.25.2.3-1: Minimal set of PDU Set Content criteria\n\n",

In Figure 6.26-1, XR App server provides different IP packet flows associated with specific frame type/importance. In Figure 6.26-2, XR App server provides one IP packet flow with different frame types/importance. UPF splits one IP packet flow into different QoS flows based on specific frame type/importance.\nCase 1: XR App server provides different IP packet flows associated with specific frame type/importance\nIn this case, XR application server identifies packets with different frame type/importance and marks the IP header with different Type of Service (IPv4), or traffic class (IPv6) and mark, or IPv6 Flow Label.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with various components, including an IP packet flow, frame type, and importance. The XR App server is responsible for managing different IP packet flows associated with specific frame types and their respective importance. This helps in ensuring efficient network performance and security.\nFigure 6.26.2-1. XR App server provides different IP packet flows associated with specific frame type/importance\nAF provides 5GC flow description with the associated frame type/importance, which will further be contained in PCC rules provided to SMF. SMF provides UPF different IP packet filters with the associated frame type/importance and QFI. In this way, UPF is able to identify frame type/importance based on the IP packet filter and marks the packets with the associated QFI. Meanwhile, SMF provides RAN node QFI with the associated frame type/importance. RAN node maps different QoS flows to different DRBs, in order to reuse the existing RAN scheduling mechanism to realize the prioritized transmission of the XRM data.\nCase 2: XR App server provides one IP packet flow with different frame types/importance\nIn this case, XR App server provides one IP packet flow, which contains packets of different frame types/importance. UPF splits one IP packet flow into different QoS flows based on specific frame type/importance identified in user plane.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of an XR App server, which is a component of a network-based XR application. It shows one IP packet flow with different frame types and their respective importance. The figure illustrates the flow of data packets within the network, highlighting the importance of each packet type and the role of the XR App server in managing and routing these packets.\nFigure 6.26.2-2. XR App server provides one IP packet flow with different frame types/importance\nOne possible solution is, AF provides XR configuration information, which contains flow description and the possible values of frame type/importance. SMF provides UPF PDR together with the mapping relationship between QFI and frame type/importance. Specifically, frame type/importance can be in the form of 1) I/D field in RTP header extension or 2)TID/LID field in RTP header extension or 3)NRI value, PRID/DID filed in NAL unit header format as mentioned in other solutions. In TR 23.700-60, some solutions also mentioned that UPF is also able to identify frame type/importance based on assistant information from AF or traffic pattern.\nIn short, the XR configuration information provided flow description and the associated parameters as follows:-\tTime assistance information: Burst Arrival Time, Periodicity.\n-\tPDU set based QoS requirement: PDU set delay budget, PDU set error rate.\n-\tFrame type/importance(for case 1).\n-\tPossible values of frame type/importance (for case 2)\n-\tindication of PDU set integrated packet handling, which may be associated with frame type/importance for case 2\nWhere PDU set delay budget is defined as an upper bound for the time that a PDU Set may be delayed between the UE the N6 termination point at the UPF. PDU set error rate is defiend as an upper bound for the rate of PDU sets (e.g. set of IP packets constituting a PDU-Set) that have been processed by the sender of a link layer protocol (e.g. RLC in RAN of a 3GPP access) but that are not successfully delivered by the corresponding receiver to the upper layer (e.g. PDCP in RAN of a 3GPP access). Possible values of frame type/importance may be provided for case 2. Indication of PDU set integrated packet handling may be associated with flow description, and even with speicific frame type/importance.\nPCF initiates SM Policy Association Modification to provide the service data flow fiter and the associated XR traffic configuration information. After that, the solution relies on the PDU Session Modification Procedure in clause 4.3.3 in TS 23.502 [3] for SMF to provision the XR traffic configuration to UPF and RAN node.\n",

Thus, it is necessary to study how to meet the very low RT latency requirements in 5GS. But the challenge is how to meet the very low Round-Trip latency requirement with a variable or unequal uplink/downlink latency. Since the AF lacks dynamic information of the current UL/DL situation, it is difficult for AF to split the RT latency requirement into UL and DL delay requirements in an optimized way.

More specifically, pose/control information sent in UL by the UE is processed by a spatial computing server (SCS) hosted in the network. The SCS renders the media content according to the received pose information and transmits it in DL to the UE. UL traffic consists of a stream of small packets generating few kbps, whereas DL traffic consists of large visual content, which accounts to several Mbps (see TS 22.261 [5]). Therefore, UL and DL traffic experience different transmission latencies due to the different size of the content UL and DL PDUs carry.\nAccordingly, the user experience of these interactive services is affected by the round-trip delay (RTD) rather than the one-way delay and is measured as the difference between the transmission of the pose/control information and the reception of the corresponding media content. To allow an immersive experience, the RTD must be kept below a certain threshold (RTDmax). The RTD assigned for a given QoS Flow does not necessarily need to be split equally between UL and DL. Having distinct QoS characteristics and parameters for UL and DL as in the current 5GS QoS framework is too restrictive for XR services and applications since the information in UL and DL is different and XR quality is affected by RTD instead of one-way delay.\nThis solution proposes the definition of a two-way delay budget (TWDB) as a new 5QI parameter, which allows to increase the DL PDB by an amount equal to the unused UL PDB (and vice versa). Unused PDB is the difference between PDB and latency incurred for actual transmission.\n",

                            "text_content": "We propose two solutions for the specification of TWDB, both extending the QoS model defined in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. More specifically, we propose the following two solutions:\nOption 1 Explicit definition of TWDB: the TWDB is defined explicitly as a new QoS characteristic associated with 5QI. This requires the description of a new clause for the definition of the TWDB and its relationship with the PDB as well as the extension of Table 5.7.4-1 with one additional column marked as TWDB.\nOption 2 Implicit definition of TWDB: the TWDB is defined implicitly by specifying a different handling of the UL and DL PDBs. as a new QoS characteristic associated with 5QI. This requires the modification of the clause associated to the description of the PDB in clause 5.7.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2] as well as the addition of a note in Table 5.7.4-1 to specify how to compute the TWDB from the PDB associated to the 5QIs for UL and DL.\nAn example of explicit and implicit definition of the TWDB is illustrated in Table 1, where the value of the TWDB is explicitly defined for 5QI=80, whereas is implicitly defined for 5QIs={88,89,90}. The new note (NOTE 18) indicates that the TWDB is the sum of the PDBs of the 5QIs selected for UL and DL QoS flows. If the 5GS select 5QI=80 for both UL and DL QoS flows, the resulting TWDB is equal to 40ms, whereas for the case 5QI=88 for UL and 5QI=89 for DL, the resulting TWDB is equal to 25ms.\nTable 6.29.3-1: New definition of Table 5.7.4-1: Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping\n\nAt the time of QoS Flow setup, SMF can indicate to the NG-RAN whether the TWDB applies. NG-RAN can consider a DL packet as received only if the sum of the transmission latencies for UL and DL together exceeds the TWDB. The TWDB can be determined by the PDB associated for individual 5QIs for UL and DL respectively. Alternatively, the split of the TWDB can be decided by the network (i.e. the amount of TWDB allocated to UL and DL) and can be updated dynamically for a given QoS Flow.\nBy default, the TWDB is determined based on the PDB for UL and DL. If a dynamic split applies, then SMF can also indicate the split for the UL and DL. For example, the delay budget assigned to DL can be computed as the difference between the TWDB and a function of the UL latency. The function of the UL latency can be the maximum of the latency experienced by a sequence of consecutive packets transmitted in UL over a sliding window. Other options may include the average or the upper bound of the confidence interval of the UL latency (this requires the estimation of second order statistics). The sliding window can be defined in terms of number of consecutive PDUs or as a time interval. The update of the split of the TWDB between DL and UL can be periodic or based on conditions on the variation of the transmission latency in each direction.\nIn summary, when a TWDB (two-way delay budget) is not utilized, a packet which is delayed more than the one-way PDB is counted as lost and included in the PER unless the data burst is exceeding the maximum data burst volume (MDBV) within the period of PDB or the QoS flow is exceeding the guaranteed flow bit rate (GFBR). When two-way delay budget is utilized, as long as the PDUs for UL and DL are delivered within the TWDB (two-way delay budget), the corresponding PDUs are not counted as lost and thus not included in the PER.\n",

One aspect is the 5GS should have a clear idea about the jitter concept, i.e. how to calculate the jitter value. The second aspect is that once the PCF calculates the jitter value for RAN part and the part between NG-RAN and PSA UPF, what kind of policy enhancement can be implemented to reduce the jitter.\n1)\tFor the first aspect, with considering the QoS monitoring mechanism in Rel-16, 5G system can calculate the jitter based on packet transmission delay per QoS flow. For the 5GS jitter, the End-to-End delay from UE to PSA UPF should be used. While for the air interface jitter, the air interface delay from UE to RAN should be considered, and for the CN part jitter, the delay from RAN to N6 should be considered.\nAF sends a request for jitter calculation by using Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe request message to NEF, the indication of jitter requirement, jitter measurement period, sample frequency, reporting threshold or reporting frequency (clause 6.1.3.21 of TS 23.503 [4]) may be included in the request, and are sent to PCF via NEF.\nWhen PCF accepts the jitter requirement, PCF generates the QoS Monitoring policy for a service data flow, based on the request from AF. In the QoS Monitoring PCC rule, the QoS monitoring period can be the same as jitter measurement period. Then PCF provides the QoS Monitoring policy to the SMF.\nAfter the QoS monitoring procedure, the SMF can report the RAN part delay values, delay values between NG-RAN and PSA UPF, to PCF. PCF may use the RFC 1889 [25] method to calculate estimation of jitter(s) of end to end delay, RAN part delay or delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF, based on measured delay values and then sends the estimated jitter value to AF.\n2)\tFor the second aspect, AF may provide a jitter expectation to PCF, as well as the Alternative Service Requirements in a prioritized order. When the PCF authorizes the service information from the AF and generates a PCC rule, it shall also derive Alternative QoS Parameter Sets for this PCC rule based on the QoS Reference parameters or the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Sets in the Alternative Service Requirements.

CDRX operation is controlled by the RAN node and is configured to provide the UE with periods of time during which the UE does not need to monitor the downlink control channel. The assistance information proposed in this solution allows the RAN node to configure the CDRX operation based on attributes of the XR/media services and based on the attributes of the UEs using these services. Parts of this solution are modelled after the External Parameter Provisioning feature that is defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [3].\nThe proposal is based on the following enhancements to the 5G system:\n-\tA 3rd party application server may invoke an NEF API to provide the 5GC with information about the XR/Media service. For example, the NEF API can be used to provide a traffic pattern(s) (e.g. related to video transmission) and the traffic type(s) (UE driven or server driven) of the XR/Media service. Multiple traffic patterns may be provided by the 3rd party application server because the traffic patterns may change dynamically. The RAN may use the Multiple Traffic patterns to provide the UE with multiple CDRX configurations (e.g. a configuration for each traffic pattern). The 3rd party application server may also update the traffic patterns (e.g. if possible configurations change).\n-\tSome UEs may be able to autonomously determine between one of two operating modes; high-power and low-power. The high-power mode may be used when the UE requires higher throughput/performance and lower latency, at the expense of power consumption. While the low-power mode may be used to save power (at the expense of lower throughput/performance and higher latency). The decision to switch between one mode or the other mode may be based on power status (battery-powered or mains/wall-powered) or based on a user preference.\n-\tTo optimize power savings based on these different attributes (i.e. traffic pattern and operating mode), a UE may be configured, by the RAN, with multiple CDRX configurations or with an adaptable CDRX configuration. A UE may choose to move from one CDRX configuration to another, or may choose to modify a CDRX configuration parameter based on the traffic pattern that is being used.\n",

This XR Communication Pattern may be used later by the SMF to provide assistance to the RAN.\nThe procedure that is used to configure information about a session of the XR/media service may be modelled after the External Parameter Provisioning procedure that is shown in clause 4.15.6.2 of TS 23.502 [3] and the Nnef_ParameterProvision service which is defined in clause 5.2.6.4 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe inputs to the NEF API may be:\n-\tA session identifier for the XR/media service.\n-\tXR Communication Pattern associated with the session. The XR Communication Pattern including the following information: frame rate(in frames/sec) or periodicity (in msec), Group of Picture (GOP) structure (which defines the arrival pattern of the different video frame types (e.g. ,I-frames, P-frames)), Dynamic GOP (which defines if the application can dynamically change the GOP structure), Maximum frame size (which defines the maximum frame size in terms of octets or IP packets), and a traffic profile (which identifies if the DL traffic is UE driven or server driven). For UE driven traffic, an UL transmission triggers a DL transmission from the server. For Server driven traffic, a DL transmission triggers an UL transmission from the UE.\nTable 6.34.3.1.1: Description of XR Communication parameters\n\nIn this solution, the UDM stores the XR Communication Pattern that is associated with the session of the service. Following the principles of the External Parameter Provisioning procedure, the UDM may classify this information as \"SMF associated\". The SMF may retrieve this information, combine/merge overlapping parameters for the UE and derive CN assisted RAN information. The latter is sent to the RAN (via the AMF), so that the RAN node may optimize Uu resource allocation (similar to the case for NB-IoT UEs) and CDRX configurations.\nThe XR Communication Pattern information that is sent to RAN and used to derive CDRX Configurations relates to all the flows that are sent or received by the UE. For example, it may be certain types of data (e.g. I-frames and P-frames) are bound to different QoS flows. Regardless of whether traffic is segregated into different QoS Flows or bound to a single QoS Flow, CDRX opportunities only occur at times when the UE is not sending or receiving traffic. Thus, each XR Communication Pattern information should represent a possible the aggregate pattern for the PDU Session.\nFigure 6.34.3.3-1 shows an example use case where the UE is configured with multiple CDRX configurations, where the CDRX configurations may be tailored to a specific frame type (I-frame vs B/P-frames).\nNOTE 1:\tThe concept of I, P and B frames may not be generally applicable to new codecs and in particular for low-latency applications. The procedure uses this concept for an example to show how the CDRX configurations could be optimized.\nThe figure depicts a UE (User Equipment) with multiple CDRX (Channel Resource Reservation) configurations, illustrating the complexity of network configuration and the need for efficient resource allocation.\nFigure 6.34.3.2-1: UE Configured with multiple CDRX Configurations\n1.\tRAN node receives the CN assisted RAN information from the SMF. The CN assisted RAN information may be updated by the SMF based on updated traffic patterns from the 3rd party application server (e.g. if possible configurations change).\n2.\tBased on this information, the RAN node configures the UE with multiple CDRX configurations. CDRX Configuration 1 may be for transmission of I-frames, and CDRX configuration 2 may be for the transmission of B/P-frames. The UE is configured with these configurations as well as an indication of which configuration to use initially.\nNOTE 2:\tThis part of the solution requires coordination with RAN WGs.\n3.\tUE receives XR/Media service downlink traffic according to the initial CDRX configuration.\n4.\tApplication layer notifies the UE that it has just received an I-frame. Based on the known GOP structure and frame rate, the UE determines the next time instance when an-I frame is expected. UE starts using CDRX configuration 2.\n5.\tUE signals to the RAN node that it is using CDRX configuration 2.\nNOTE 3:\tHow the UE signals to the RAN node that it is using CDRX configuration 2 is in scope of RAN WGs but may be through RRC message MAC CE, or PHY layer control signalling.\n6.\tRAN node changes to CDRX configuration 2.\n7.\tAfter this, RAN node and UE may use the known GOP structure to switch between CDRX configurations. Explicit signalling from UE may be used to ensure that the UE and RAN node are using the same CDRX configuration.\nFigure 6.34.3.3.2 shows an example use case where the UE is configured with an adaptable CDRX configuration, where the UE may autonomously change the CDRX operation, based on uplink activity that triggers a DL transmission that, for example, has strict Motion-to-Photon (MTP) latency. In this example use case, the UE adapts the CDRX Active time, however, the following CDRX parameters defined in [17], are also adaptable:\n-\tDRX cycle: defines the length of the periodic repetition of the ON duration followed by a possible period of inactivity.\n-\tDRX ON duration timer: defines the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle (e.g. where the UE monitors the PDCCH).\n-\tDRX start offset: defines the subframe (i.e. time unit used in the access stratum) where the DRX cycle starts.\n-\tDRX slot offset: defines the delay before starting the DRX On duration timer.\n-\tDRX inactivity timer: defines the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a PDCCH indicates a new UL or DL transmission.\nThe figure depicts a UE (User Equipment) with an adaptable CDRX (Conditional Redundancy Routing) configuration, which allows for efficient and flexible routing of data packets. The UE is equipped with a CDRX that can be configured to prioritize certain paths based on the network conditions, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where the network topology may change frequently, such as in a dynamic network environment.\nFigure 6.34.3.3.1: UE Configured with Adaptable CDRX Configuration\n1.\tRAN node receives the CN assisted RAN information from the SMF.

Parts of this solution are modelled after the 5G VN group management feature that is defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [3].\nA 3rd party application may invoke an NEF API to configure QoS policies in the 5GC for a tactile and multi-modal communication service and to request that the 5GC allocate a Coordination Identifier for a tactile and multi-modal communication service. The Coordination Identifier is used to identify which flows are associated with the tactile and multi-modal communication service.\nA UE Application uses application layer procedures with the 3rd party application to discover and join the tactile and multi-modal communication service. The Coordination Identifier is provided to the UE Application by the 3rd party application when it discovers, or joins, the tactile and multi-modal communication service.\nAs UE Application(s) join the tactile and multi-modal communication service, the 3rd party application may provide the Coordination Identifier to the UE application and invoke an NEF API to provide the network with the identity (e.g. GPSI) of the UE(s) that are participating in the service.\nWhen the UE Application initiates traffic that is associated with the tactile and multi-modal communication service, the UE Application may provide the Coordination Identifier to the NAS layer as a Traffic Descriptor. URSP Rules may be configured in the UE to use the Coordination Identifier as a Traffic Descriptor and select a DNN / S-NSSAI combination that is suitable for the traffic. The Coordination Identifier may also be provided to the network in the PDU Session Establishment and PDU Session Modification procedures.\nThis solution does not require that the same SMF, UPF, RAN, or AMF be selected in the multiple UE scenario. However, the Coordination Identifier may be used by the network:\n-\tin SMF selection;\n-\tin PCF selection and the Coordination Identifier may be provided to the PCF to obtain PCC Rules that are associated with tactile and multi-modal communication service; and\n-\tin UPF selection if there is a need to ensure that all PDU Sessions that carry application traffic that is associated with the same tactile and multi-modal communication service use the same PSA UPF.\n",

L4S has been demonstrated in the RITE EU project [39]. Congestion control algorithms that support L4S are described, e.g. in TS 29.281 [16].\nThis solution proposes that the 5G System uses ECN bits defined in RFC 8311 [36] as identifier to be used on IP packets for the new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (IETF L4S [37]) RFC 3550 [9].\nTo address service requirements, by using ECN bits for marking of payload packets as specified in RFC 8311 [36], the NG-RAN exposes current load level.\nThe solution is based on following components:\n-\tUse of ECN bits at IP layer in NG-RAN for L4S.\n-\tEnablement of using ECN bits for L4S in NG RAN.\n-\tThe UE application layer supports L4S, e.g. provides feedback based on L4S and the received ECN mark for L4S.\nNOTE:\tThis solution is applicable only in case user terminal and Application Server support L4S defined in RFC 8311 [36] and IETF drafts L4S [37] and RFC 3550 [9] and use protocols that support L4S feedback between user terminal and application server.\nIt is assumed that the varying radio conditions and resource availability in NG-RAN are the main contributors to the need for the application to adapt its rate accordingly.\nGiven that it is NG-RAN that has the visibility of the resource availability and sudden changes on the radio interface that impact the performance in terms of latency, any fast reaction to trigger rate adaptation, that is required for services with tight latency requirements and benefit from bounded latency, must be triggered by NG-RAN. NG-RAN makes use of ECN bits for marking of payload packets as specified in RFC 8311[7to support L4S. ECN bits marking interacts with the application layer, wherein the application layer triggers rate adaptation based on feedback using ECN bits. In this solution NG-RAN makes use ECN bits marking for both, DL and UL direction.\nNOTE:\tThe criteria that RAN perform the marking is up to RAN implementation.\nEditor's note:\tWhether RAN can support such a marking need to be coordinated with RAN WGs.\nTo enable ECN bits marking for L4S, an existing or a separate QoS flow can be used for L4S traffic. In context of this descriptive text for readability reasons, we refer to it as an 'L4S QoS Flow'. Following are possible alternatives to determine use of ECN for the purpose of L4S:\n-\tThis alternative does not propose to introduce a new concept and instead it reuses the 5QI framework. Namely, use of a certain QoS flow for L4S traffic, enabling ECN bits marking treatment in NG-RAN, is achieved via a preconfigured 5QI value. One or several 5QI(s) may be defined for this purpose by the operator in a deployment.\n-\tProvide an explicit indication at the time of QoS Flow setup to indicate whether use of ECN for the purpose of L4S can be enabled.\nThere are 3 main principles to establish a L4S QoS flow within a PDU session:\n-\tStatically: At PDU session establishment the L4S QoS flow is always established. This by either a pre-configured PCC rule if PCF is used, or by configuration in SMF.\nNOTE:\tIn this case, the configuration ensures the application using the L4S QoS Flow supports L4S and uses one of the protocols that support ECN feedback.\n-\tDynamically based on 5GC configurations: SMF installs a Detection filter in UPF. This is either based on a request from PCF or from local configuration. The Detection filter can either use the ECN bits for L4S in the IP header or the XR server IP address(es). When L4S traffic is detected, the UPF notifies SMF. If PCF is used, SMF notifies PCF which triggers a L4S QoS flow establishment, or if PCF is not used, SMF is configured to establish a L4S QoS flow.\n-\tDynamically based on AF request: The AF makes an authorization request either via NEF (untrusted) or directly to PCF, which triggers a Session modification procedure according to clause 4.3.3 in TS 23.502 [3].\nThe filters provided by SMF in the QoS rule to the UE and PDR to the UPF to identify traffic to be routed onto the L4S QoS flows can be a combination of existing filters and/or the ECN bits for L4S in the IP packet header of the XR service.\n",

So the user experience is affected by the round-trip delay rather than the one-way delay. So the round-trip delay may be used by the server to optimize the XR/media services. For example, if the XR server could get the knowledge that the round-trip delay within the network is bigger than certain threshold, it can adjust the coding algorithm complexity accordingly to the impacted UEs so as to further improve the user's service experience. The round-trip delay needs to be exposed timely in order to guarantee the effective usage in the server side.\nThis solution is based on the current network information exposure architecture. The NEF interacts with AF to receive the QoS monitoring request on the round-trip delay of certain UE, and then obtains the round-trip delay information from certain network function. Finally the NEF responds with the requested information to the AF.\nThere are two possible cases for round-trip delay monitoring:\n-\tThe UL and DL traffic may be within the same QoS flow. In this case, this QoS flow is impacted for the round-trip delay monitoring.\n-\tThe main UL and DL traffic are separated into two different QoS flows, e.g. the UL pose/control information from UE is sent in QFI-1, the DL media content information from sever is sent in QFI-2.\nThe CN round-trip delay which is between the RAN and PSA UPF for the service (CNRTT) is calculated by the PSA UPF. If the two QoS flows (QFI-1 and QFI-2) are impacted, the CNRTT should be the average value of CN round-trip delay of QFI-1 (CNRTT1) and CN round-trip delay of QFI-2 (CNRTT2), i.e. CNRTT=( CNRTT1+CNRTT2)/2.\nSimilarly, the RAN part of round-trip delay for the service could also be calculated by RAN.\nIn this solution, the PCF determines the impact QFI(s) according the QoS monitoring request on round-trip delay. And then the PCF sends the QoS monitoring indication to the SMF. The SMF sends a QoS Monitoring request to the PSA UPF via N4 and NG-RAN via N2 signalling to request the QoS monitoring on round-trip delay.\nBased on the monitoring request, the RAN calculates the RAN part of round-trip delay and sends the results to the PSA UPF; PSA UPF calculates the CNRTT and obtains the whole round-trip delay for the service.\nThe related procedure is in the following section.\n",

The QoS Parameter Notification control indicates whether notifications are requested from the NG-RAN when the \"GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed\" for a QoS Flow during the lifetime of the QoS Flow.\nIn the 5GS, each GBR QoS Flow shall be associated with an AW (Averaging Window). The AW represents the duration over which the GFBR and MFBR shall be calculated (e.g. in the (R)AN, UPF, UE). The AW may also be signalled together with a standardized 5QI to the (R)AN, UE and UPF, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the default value. In the Table 5.7.4-1(Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping) of the TS 23.501, the Default AW is 2000 ms.\nThe AW represents the duration over which the GFBR and MFBR shall be calculated (e.g. in the (R)AN, UPF, UE), the AW can determine the measurement periodicity (i.e. the rate) of the GFBR/MFBR. The QNC is trigged by the NG-RAN if the GFBR can no longer be guaranteed. The time span (i.e. the latency) from the GFBR measurement to generate the QNC also be determined by the AW.\nThe XRM service is assumed to use high data rate (e.g. 360o 3D VR video) and low latency (e.g. interactive cloud gaming). If the GFBR is changed to very low value, e.g. the UE enters an elevator or basement with very poor radio signalling or the UE enters in the quick moving vehicle. If the XRM AF does not know the GFBR is changed, the XRM AF continues the DL high data rate to the NG-RAN, the NG-RAN will soon be in congestion state. In such case, the NG-RAN needs to quickly provide the GFBR changes for the XRM services to the XRM AF. But if the default AW is used, the 2000ms measurement time is some large and introduces large latency to generate the QNC for the NG-RAN. In such case, to reduce the latency from the GFBR change to generating a QNC in order to reduce the chance of NG-RAN congestion, a lower value AW should be used.\nAlso, if the GFBR is changed back to a high data rate (e.g. the UE moves out of the elevator), in order to quickly to recover to DL high data rate to provide better XRM QoE to the user, the latency from the GFBR change to generating a new QNC, a low value AW should be used.\nBased on the TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503 [4], the AW is provided by the PCF to the SMF and then is provide to the UPF, RAN and UE. If no AW is provided to the NG-RAN and there is pre-configured in the NG-RAN, the pre-configured or the default AW is used.\nThough, the PCF can provide the AW value to the SMF based on the XRM stream information (e.g. the XRM video periodicity = 1000/FPS), however, it is not defined in the 3GPP standards. I.e. it is not clear how the PCF to set the AW to the SMF.\nThe XRM AF can optionally provide a Requested AW to the PCF as an additional request QoS parameter in the API for the XRM stream, the PCF can set the value of AW in the PCC rules to be the value of Requested AW from the AF . In such case, the latency of generating the QNC can be driven by the AF. The Requested AW normally is less than 2000ms, e.g. is 500ms, 200ms.\nWhen the NEF receives the Requested AW from XRM AF, the NEF forwards the Requested AW to the PCF. And PCF generates the PCC rules to include the AW with equitation to the Requested AW.\nHowever, the NG-RAN has its own logical to control the number of the QNC message to 5GC. The AF provided AW only control the latency from the GFBR measurement to generating the QNC message, it does not control/determine the number of QNC to be generated by the NG-RAN.\n",

It is preferrable to perform the marking in the entity where congestion is detected.\nThe figure depicts a 46.2.1-1 ECN marking for Uplink, indicating that the marking is either present in the UE or the gNB. This marking is crucial for ensuring reliable communication in a 4G/5G network, as it helps to detect and correct errors in the signal transmission.\nFigure 6.46.2.1-1: ECN marking for Uplink – either in the UE or gNB\nThe congestion in the wireless uplink between UE and gNB can be detected and remedied via ECN marking by either the UE or the RAN. Either the gNB or the UE should be responsible for congestion detection. Otherwise, they could conflict. After this initial choice, several options are possible to bring the congestion information into the PDU IP header where it is further handled by the end-host to control the application's sending rate.\nThe figure depicts a 46.2.1-2 scenario in a 5G network, showing the detection of congestion in the gNB. This indicates that the network is experiencing high traffic levels, potentially leading to packet loss and latency issues. The figure highlights the importance of network optimization and capacity planning to ensure reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 6.46.2.1-2: Congestion for uplink detected in the gNB\ngNB is well positioned to have the overall view of congestion in the cell and overall queues that are building up in the UEs are visible in the gNB via buffer status reports. Following options are possible when the gNB handles congestion in the uplink (illustrated in figure 6.46.2.1-2):\n1)\tgNB translates congestion into ECN marks, sets immediately in the PDU IP header directly. This option does not impact the UE and the UPF.\nNOTE\tThe criteria that RAN uses to perform the marking is up to RAN implementation.\nEditor's note:\tWhether RAN can support such a marking need to be coordinated with RAN WG.\n2)\tgNB transmits congestion information in the GTP-U header, which is transmitted over N3 to UPF, that translates congestion into ECN marks, which is finally set in the IP PDU header. This option will impact the UPF in addition.\n3)\tgNB translates congestion into ECN marks, sets in the outer IP header of the GTP-U tunnel, which is transmitted over N3 to UPF, which is finally transferring the ECN marks over to the IP PDU header towards N6. This option also impacts the UPF in addition.\nThe figure depicts a network scenario where a UE (User Equipment) detects congestion in the uplink, indicating potential issues with the network's capacity. This can be a result of various factors such as network congestion, interference, or network congestion in the uplink. The figure shows the UE's signal strength, which is a crucial metric for understanding the network's performance. The presence of congestion in the uplink can impact the quality of service for the UE, leading to reduced data rates and potential disruptions in the network.\nFigure 6.46.2.1-3: Congestion for uplink detected in the UE\nUE can also monitor congestion in the uplink radio bearers. This option can cause interactions between scheduler policies that use the buffer status reports which will be influenced (especially if kept \"too\" low) by the congestion control in the UE. This option impacts additionally the UE, and detection of uplink congestion is limited to the scope of the UE. Three options are possible for inserting ECN marking when the UE handles congestion in the uplink while two of them require gNB assistance (and potentially other nodes), which has further 3 options to carry the ECN marks into the final IP PDU header. (illustrated in figure 6.46.2.1-3):\n1)\tUE translates congestion into ECN marks, sets immediately in the PDU IP header.\n2)\tUE translates congestion into ECN marks, sets in the PDCP header, which is transmitted over NR-Uu to the gNB, and carried further over one of the three options 4, 5 or 6 for the gNB to forward the ECN marks over to the IP PDU header.\n3)\tUE translates congestion into ECN marks, sets in the RLC header, which is transmitted over NR-Uu to the gNB, and carried further over one of the three options 4, 5 or 6 for the gNB to forward the ECN marks over to the IP PDU header.\nIf UE is transmitting the ECN marks in one of the lower layer headers (like options 2 and 3 above) additional network support is needed as in one of the following 3 options:\n4)\tgNB transfers the ECN marks, sets immediately in the PDU IP header.\n5)\tgNB transmits the ECN marks as congestion information in the GTP-U header, which is transmitted over N3 to UPF, which translates congestion into ECN marks, set finally in the IP PDU header.\n6)\tgNB transfers the ECN marks, set in the outer IP header of the GTP-U tunnel, which is transmitted over N3 to UPF, which finally transfers the ECN marks over to the IP PDU header towards N6.\nEditor's note:\tWhether RAN can support uplink congestion detection and ECN marking within the UE needs to be coordinated with RAN WGs.\nIn general, if functions are not marking packets directly in the PDU IP header, guarantees are needed that another function will do so before the intermediate header information is discarded and before the PDU IP packet is processed by the end system.\nWhen the 5G System detects congestion in the downlink, it inserts ECN marking in the IP header that facilitates the application layer to provide feedback and do rate adaptation in the downlink (illustrated in figure 6.46.2.2-1). It is preferrable to perform the marking in the entity where congestion is detected.\nThe figure depicts a 46.2.2-1 ECN marking for Downlink, which is a crucial component of the 4G/5G network. It illustrates the marking's placement on the downlink signal path, highlighting its importance in ensuring efficient signal transmission.\nFigure 6.46.2.2-1: ECN marking for Downlink\nThere are multiple options to do this (as illustrated in figure 6.46.2.2-2 below):\n1)\tgNB translates congestion into ECN marks, sets immediately in the PDU IP header. It should be noted that the gNB already has visibility to the PDU IP header for ROHC compression. This option does not impact the UE at all.\nEditor's note:\tWhether RAN can support such a marking need to be coordinated with RAN WG.\n2)\tgNB translates congestion into ECN marks, sets in the PDCP header, which is transmitted over NR-Uu to the UE, which finally copies the ECN marks over to the IP PDU header. This option supports a direct correlation between PDCP and IP packets.\n3)\tgNB translates congestion into ECN marks, sets in the RLC header, which is transmitted over NR-Uu to the UE, which finally copies the ECN marks over to the IP PDU header. With this option, congestion can be reported immediately where it occurs.\n4)\tgNB transmits congestion information as part of the uplink traffic in the GTP-U header, which is transmitted over N3 to UPF. The UPF translates congestion into ECN marks, set finally in the IP PDU header of subsequent downlink packets. This option impacts also UPF and will cause extra latency going backwards and forward again. This can cause an extra delay in congestion response of twice the link latency between gNB and UPF.\nNOTE:\tThe criteria that RAN uses to perform the marking is up to RAN implementation.\nIn general, if functions are not marking packets directly in the PDU IP header, guarantees are needed that another function will do so before the intermediate header information is discarded and before the PDU IP packet is processed by the end system.\nThe figure depicts various solution options for ECN marking over Downlink, with a focus on the downlink. It illustrates the different marking techniques and their respective advantages and disadvantages. The figure also highlights the importance of proper signal processing and network management to ensure reliable and efficient ECN marking.\nFigure 6.46.2.2-2: Solution options for ECN marking over Downlink\nTo enable ECN, an existing or a separate QoS flow can be used. At the time of QoS Flow establishment, it is determined whether use of ECN is enabled or not. Following are possible alternatives to determine use of ECN for the purpose of L4S:\n-\tPre-configure a dedicated 5QI for which use of ECN for the purpose of L4S is enabled.\n-\tProvide an explicit indication at the time of QoS Flow setup to indicate whether use of ECN for the purpose of L4S can be enabled.\n",

The NEF also sets the Event ID, and Event Filter identical to the received request from the AF.\nNOTE:\tIn this Release, the one PCF can be selected for the PDU session of the single UE, because that the single PDU session should be used to support the XRM service; the delay difference between the flows of multi-UEs in different PCFs cannot be guaranteed.\n5.\tThe PCF(s) confirms with Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe Response message to the NEF.\n6.\tPCF make the policy decision and subscribed the Event requested by AF or NEF; In order to subscribe the requested Delay Difference, the PCF may trigger the QoS monitoring for the specific couple of flows, in order to get the end-to-end delays, and calculate the delay difference.\ne.g. The PCF initiates SM Policy Association Modification Request to the SMF. Based on the QoS monitoring policy for measurement from the PCF, the SMF generates the QoS Monitoring configuration for UPF, and for RAN, if needed.\n7.\tEvent trigger or notifies the report to PCF (When the event detected/reached, the report will be triggered, e.g. achieved the threshold, or the period timer overtime). E.g. the UPF triggers the Notify message to report the measured information to the PCF. The PCF calculate and notify to NEF with the subscribed delay difference as well as the real-time delay values for the couple of flows.\n8.\tWhen the reporting condition for a subscribed event is fulfilled, as described in Step7, the PCF triggers a notification towards the NEF.\n9.\tThe PCF sends the Npcf_Policy Authorization_Notify Request (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information) message to the NEF.\nIf the subscription is for event based notification (e.g. based on the monitored event reaching a threshold value), the Event Reporting information parameter contains confirmation for the event fulfilment.\nIf the subscription is for periodic notification or for immediate reporting, the Event Reporting information parameter provides information for the current delay and delay difference (e.g. the delay difference value or represented in percentage of the maximum delay difference).\n10.\tWhen a single PCF is returned from the discovery procedure, the NEF immediately returns, the notification received from the PCF since the reporting condition is fulfilled. In case of untrusted AF; the NEF includes the AF-Service-Identifier corresponding to the S-NSSAI in the returned notification.\n11a.\tWhen multiple PCFs are selected for the requested delay, the NEF performs the aggregation from reporting PCF(s). And NEF maintains the overall calculate of the specific couple of flows (e.g. including real-time end-to-end delays, and the delay difference) for the selected PCFs as long as the subscription is active.\nIf multiple PCFs are selected for the requested delay of the couple of flows, the NEF continuously updates the aggregated information to be able to fulfil the incoming subscription request from the AF.\n11b.\tWhen multiple PCFs are selected for the requested delay of the couple of flows, and when the reporting condition for a subscribed event by the AF is fulfilled, the NEF triggers a notification towards the AF.\n",

Therefore, PDU set integrated packet handling can be performed as requested by AF at the receiver and transmitter respectively, e.g.:\n1)\tAs a receiver, check whether all the PDUs of one PDU set has been received or not. If not, drop all the receiving PDUs of the PDU set.\n2)\tAs a transmitter, check whether any PDU of one PDU set is not successfully delivered, or exceed the PDU set delay budget. If so, drop the remaining PDUs of the PDU set.\nThere's no flow control over NG interface. That is, RAN node will not feedback whether the PDU has been successfully transmitted or delivered to UE. Therefore, UPF can only check the receiving status of PDUs of PDU set to decide whether to drop the PDU set or not. That is, whether UPF shall perform PDU set integrated packet handling depends on whether UPF is able to identify all PDUs of one PDU set. That is, if no SN within PDU set or the size of PDU set is introduced for PDU set identification, 5GS is not able to check whether all PDUs of one PDU set have been successfully received or delivered.\nIf UPF shall perform PDU set integrated packet handling for XR traffic, UPF shall determine whether all PDUs of one PDU set are received within an integrity checking timer. The integrity checking timer should be started upon receiving the first PDU of one PDU set. After integrity checking timer expires, if UPF determines that not all PDUs of one PDU set are received, UPF shall stop deliver the remaining PDUs of the PDU set and informs the downstream node (either UPF or RAN node) to drop the PDU set, which avoids unnecessary transmission.\nFor uplink transmission, there's no transmission loss from UE's application to UE's AS layer. Therefore, (1) is not applicable for UE. As a transmitter for uplink transmission, whether UE shall perform PDU set integrated packet handling depends on whether RAN node will provide feedback to UE, which is closely related with HARQ and RLC transmission mode for uplink.\nSolution#22,#23,#25 have also propose that AF shall indicate 5GS whether all PDUs are needed for the usage of PDU Set by application layer, i.e. the indication of PDU set integrated handling. The indication of PDU set integrated handling can be applied to all the XR flows. Specifically, different indications of PDU set integrated handling may be associated with different frame types based on different importance. E.g. the indication of PDU set integrated handling is true for I-frame and false for P-frame. Then UPF shall perform PDU set integrated handling for PDUs of I-frame and not for that of P-frame.\n",

But P-frames in the same GoP only shows the changes in the image from the previous frame, which cannot be decoded without the help of the previous frames. If I-frame and the previous P-frames are not transmitted successfully, the later P-frames cannot be decoded even though they are transmitted successful. A frame that is not transmitted within PDB may be not displayed which may result in the skip of the picture, but it could also be useful for decoding other frames.\nTherefore, it's meaningful to consider the dependency among PDU sets during the transmission.\nWhen UPF sends the PDU set to RAN, it encapsulates the PDU set ID into the GTP-U header, the PDU set ID is used to identify a PDU set. Moreover, UPF buffers the PDU set for a period. If the PDU set is failed to be transmitted by RAN (e.g. HARQ failed), RAN sends the PDU set ID to UPF to indicate that the PDU set is not transmitted successfully, then the UPF determines the importance of PDU set based on backward dependency, , and determines whether the dropped PDU set is to be retransmitted or not based on the importance of PDU sets. For example, (1) UPF could make decision by detecting the location of the PDU set in a GOP, if the PDU set is near the end of a GOP, then the PDU set doesn't need to be retransmitted; or (2) if UPF could derive the backward dependency relation between PDU sets, and find the following received PDU Sets have dependency on the dropped PDU set, then the PDU set needs to be retransmitted, otherwise if there is no dependent, then the PDU set doesn't need to be retransmitted.\nWhen UPF determines the importance of PDU set, the importance of a PDU set increases the more dependent PDU sets exist.\nWhen UPF retransmits the PDU set, it could increase the priority of the PDU set to make sure that the PDU set can be delivered as soon as possible.\nWhen a PDU set is not transmitted successfully, its dependent PDU sets cannot be decoded even if they are transmitted successfully.\nTherefore, when the UPF decides not to retransmit a PDU set that the RAN could not transmit successfully (e.g. based on the importance of the PDU set, awareness of the RAN congestion and so on), the UPF should also drop all dependent PDU sets of the dropped PDU set, avoiding waste of RAN resources and N3 resources.\nEditor's note:\tThe feasibility of reporting the PDU Set ID requires RAN support.\n",

The principles of the solution are as follows:\n-\tThe UE hosts a PDU Set Handling Service Proxy Client.\n-\tThe UPF hosts a PDU Set Handling Service Proxy Server.\n-\tA tunnel is established between the client and the server to carry XR flows. The tunnel is established using the MASQUE protocol, which relies on HTTP/3 over QUIC and supports efficient proxying of UDP flows.\n-\tThe HTTP/3 protocol is defined in draft-ietf-quic-http [32] and the extensions defined in:\n-\tdraft-ietf-masque-connect-udp [31] for supporting UDP proxying over HTTP;\n-\tdraft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram [33] for supporting HTTP datagrams; and\n-\tdraft-ietf-httpbis-h3-websockets [34] for supporting Extended CONNECT.\n-\tThe QUIC protocol is defined in the IETF specifications RFC 9000 [50], RFC 9001 [51], RFC 9002 [52] and the extension defined in RFC 9221 [53] for supporting UDP proxying over HTTP.\n-\tIn the UE, the Proxy Client is an HTTP/3 client.\n-\tIn the UPF, the Proxy Server is an HTTP/3 proxy.\n-\tOnce a HTTP/3 connection has been established between the Proxy Client and the Proxy Server, the Proxy Client will allocate a new bidirectional HTTP data stream for each data flow. Each bidirectional HTTP data stream is established by the Proxy Client sending an extended CONNECT to the Proxy Server to establish a session for the flow.\n-\tOnce HTTP data stream is set up for a data flow, the Proxy Client and Proxy Server can send data packets to each other in unreliable HTTP datagrams. Each data packet carries a PDU or information about the PDU Set.\n-\tThe proxy client and server perform PDU set identification of inbound traffic (i.e. of UL traffic on UE and DL traffic on UPF).\nThe PDU Set Handling Service is configured in different granularities:\n-\tPer flow information is exchanged between the proxy client and proxy server using MASQUE, e.g. using the extended CONNECT request and response. This information can include:\n-\tA flow descriptor (e.g. an IP 3-tuple describing the flow between the UE and XR Application Server).\n-\tPer PDU Set information is exchanged between the proxy client and proxy server. Per PDU set information, makes it possible for the receiver (i.e. UE or UPF) to handle the PDU set (e.g. transmit it towards AS or another UE) without re-generating the PDU set information from application headers (or without requiring the entire PDU set information to be present in all packets). Per PDU Set information can be sent in advance of sending the PDUs of the PDU Set, thus reducing the overhead of including the information in the header of each PDU of the set:\n-\tInfo for intra-PDU Set handling (i.e. KI#4, PDU Set integrated handling):\n-\tPDU Set Sequence number (SN) (solution 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22).\n-\tStart/End PDU of the PDU Set (solution 11, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22).\n-\tPDU SN within a PDU Set (solution 11, 20, 22).\n-\tNumber of PDUs within a PDU Set (solution 9, 20).\n-\tInfo for inter-PDU Set handling (i.e. KI#5, PDU Set differentiated handling):\n-\tPDU Set importance (solution 7, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 24).\n-\tPDU Set dependency (solution 11, 14, 19, 22, 24).\nNOTE 1:\tWhether Per PDU Set information is sent in advance of sending the PDUs of the PDU Set, or included in the headers of the individual PDUs depends on what and how much information SA2 agrees is needed to describe a PDU Set and may be left as a stage-3 encoding decision.\n-\tPDUs are communicated between the proxy client and proxy server. Per PDU information is sent with each PDU and is visible to the RAN. Per-PDU markings are set by the UE for UL traffic and by the UPF for DL traffic. In the DL, the UPF will populate the GTP-U header with information that can be used by the RAN for PDU Set handling. In the UL, UE includes the per PDU information in the PDU header which is visible to the RAN.

The proxy client initiates each new MASQUE sessions, by sending an HTTP CONNECT request including a \"connect-udp\" protocol parameter, and the Per flow information. The UE app can then send and receive UDP payloads of XR flows (e.g. RTP or SRTP packets) to/from the UE. The proxy client implements the PDU Set Handling Service including PDU set identification, and forwards encapsulated XR flows over MASQUE to/from the UPF. UPF forwards UDP traffic to/from the AS; this is shown in the following steps.\n8.\tUpon receiving DL packets from the XR AS, based on received N4 rules or local configuration, the Proxy Server of the UPF identifies PDU sets and per-PDU set information listed above by matching RTP/SRTP header and payload. If the PDU is the first PDU in the set, then the Server Proxy will send a PDU Set Descriptor to the Proxy Client. The Proxy Server will then send the PDU to the Proxy Client.

                            "text_content": "To support PDU Set integrated packet handling with QoS differentiation, this solution proposes key principles. The general architecture to support this is shown in Figure 6.56.1-1.\nThree principles are adhered to:\n1.\tPDU Set QoS treatment is determined by policy using dynamic or non-dynamic PCC. Policy is enforced at the RAN based on NG-AP signalling between the RAN and SMF. User plane packet marking at the UPF should indicate the characteristics of a given PDU, not QoS handling such as the \"priority\" to be provided to a PDU. Note that \"priority level\" is already a QoS parameter sent via NG-AP.\n2.\tRTP header extensions for scalable media streams are proposed by the IETF in draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking. The header extension identifies the Temporal and Spatial media layers associated with a packet as well as dependencies of enhancement layer instances on base layer instances. This allows layers to be selectively forwarded or otherwise handled in the network. The solution adopted for this Key Issue should provide comparable capability for the 5GS.\n3.\tIn the 5GS, a QoS Flow can carry multiple application flow instances of the same type (e.g. two H.26x video streams) as well as application flow instances of different types (e.g. H.26x video, AC Audio, haptic data). To maintain this capability while providing per-PDU set handling, it must be possible to distinguish between these application / media sub-flows within a QoS Flow. One option for doing so is to consider the Application / media-stream / sub-flow as a PDU Set to which a PDU may belong, and to identify it as such in the GTP-U header.\nThe figure depicts a 5G signal path, illustrating the multi-path signal propagation in a 5G network. It shows how signals reflect off buildings (NLOS) and combine at the receiver. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 6.56.1-1: 5GS Support for PDU Family integrated packet handling\n",

PDU Set identification rules provisioned on the UPF or sent by the SMF may specify the RTP header type to be detected.\n-\tWhich PDU Sets the UPF identifies is provisioned on the UPF, and may include one or more of:\n1.\tA Frame / Slice PDU Set:\n-\tAll PDUs that carry segments of the same Frame / Slice belong to the same set.\n2.\tA Temporal Layer PDU Set:\n-\tAll PDUs that carry Frames / Slices that belong to the same Temporal Layer belong to the same set.\n3.\tA Spatial Layer PDU Set:\n-\tAll PDUs that carry Frames / Slices that belong to the same Spatial Layer belong to the same set.\n4.\tAn Application / Media-Stream / Sub-Flow PDU Set:\nAll PDUs that carry Packets / Frames / Slices that belong to same application or media stream (e.g. audio or video or haptics) belong to the same set.\n-\tPackets are identified and the GTP-U header extension is populated by examining PDU RTP header fields, when present.\n-\tPDU Set identification and marking is supported for downlink packets.\nEditor's note:\tSupport for uplink is FFS.\n-\tTo support scalable / layered media or multiple media streams mapped into the same QoS flow (because they are multiplexed into the same UDP/IP traffic flow), a PDU may be identified at the UPF and marked as belonging to more than one PDU Set. Thus, the UPF can also identify one or more PDU Sets to which a packet belongs.\nFor example, an IP packet that carries a segment of a video frame belonging to a specific Spatial Layer and a specific Temporal Layer, would belong to all four PDU Set Types and could thus receive four different PDU Set markings, which could all affect the QoS treatment of the packet depending on the QoS policy.\n-\tFor each PDU Set to which a PDU is associated, the following information may be provided in a GTP-U header extension:\n1.\tThe PDU Set Type:\n-\tFrame or Slice type (e.g. I-frame or P-frame) for a Frame/Slice PDU Set.\n-\tLayer ID for Temporal and Spatial Layer PDU Set.\n-\tApplication or Media-Stream or Sub-Flow ID for Application / Media-stream / Sub-Flow PDU Set.\n2.\tPDU Set Instance Number - a rolling counter that sequentially numbers each PDU Set instance within a PDU Set, independent of PDU Set Type\n3.\tDependent PDU Set Instance, which is the PDU Set Instance Number previously assigned to the PDU Set instance on which this PDU Set is dependent.\n4.\tPDU Set Instance Start / End Indicator for Frame / Slice PDU Sets\n2.\tQoS framework and policies:\n-\tAs per current QoS framework, packet handling is determined according to PCF \"policy\".\n-\tNon-Dynamic PCC is supported via configuration of PCC rules with per-PDU set granularity on the SMF.\n-\tDynamic PCC is supported via provisioning by the PCF on the SMF of PCC rules with per-PDU set granularity.\n-\tThe NG-RAN is not aware of media characteristics.

Beyond this time, the PDU Set instance is not considered valid, and thus all un-transmitted packets of the PDU Set can be discarded at the RAN. For example, that for an I-Frame PDU set, the Validity Time may take into account the usefulness of I-Frames for subsequent P-Frame decoding, which may occur at a later time than is required to render the I-Frame.\n3.\tAF Request:\n-\tThe AF may (optionally) send a request to support PDU Set identification and differentiated handling\n-\tThe AF request may contain the following to support PDU Set identification and per PDU Set QoS:\n1.\tFlow description of the target media service data flows for per PDU Set handling\n2.\tAn RTP/RTPSP header type to be detected (for media with RTP/RTSP headers).\n3.\tAssistance Information describing the media and characteristics including:\na.\tThe number of Temporal and Spatial media layers.\nb.\tPDU Set periodicities (e.g. for Temporal and Spatial Layers).\nc.\tPDU Set dependencies (e.g. the existence of Referenced Frames or Slices such as a P-Frame with forward references).\n4.\tRequested Priority, PDB and PER per-PDU Set type.\n5.\tValidity Time per-PDU Set type.\n",

This has three aspects:\n1.\tSetting policies in 5GS for which protocol to use for PDU set information between AS and 5GS in line with application support. This can either be arranged offline (e.g. based on Service Level Agreements) or via explicit signalling.\n2.\tTaking into account the selected protocol for PDU set information during the PDU Session establishment.\n3.\t5GS exposure/confirmation to AF that such protocol is available to be used.\nWhile aspects 2 is addressed by, among others, Solution 7, 12, 20 and 25, this solution focuses on aspects 1 and 3. Consequently, this solution is composed of two steps.\nStep 1:\tNegotiation of PDU set and/or burst marking mechanism between AF and CN.\nTo negotiate the marking mechanism between AF and CN, the AF subscribes to get the options for PDU Set and burst marking:\n-\tThe AF subscribes to the 5GCN to obtain the list of options that the 5GS support.\n-\tThe NEF stores/retrieves and exposes the options for PDU set marking and for burst marking (no marking, RTP header based, SRTP header based, non-standardized marking, etc.) to the AF.\n-\tThe AF indicates to the PCF the options it prefers (e.g. no marking, RTP for PDU set marking and/or burst marking).\n-\tThe PCF updates the PCC rules accordingly.\nNOTE:\tIf the PCC rules describing the AF's preferred options to mark the PDU Sets and data bursts between AS and UPF are already pre-configured in the PCF (e.g. per DNN/S-NSSAI, per AF ID, based on flow description, etc.) then no signalling is needed between PCF and AF.\nStep 2:\tNotification of selected PDU set and/or burst marking mechanism from SMF to AF.\nThe notification of the selected marking settings is based on the following steps:\n-\tThe AF uses the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe to subscribe to the notification of the selected option for marking the PDU Sets and/or bursts.\n-\tThe SMF dynamically retrieves the PCC rules from the PCF. The rules include the details of the AF preferred option for marking the PDU sets and/or bursts.\nNOTE:\tThe SMF can also use the locally stored predefined PCC rules. In this case no interaction with PCF is needed, but it is assumed that such predefined PCC rules already include the AF preferred options for marking the PDU Sets/data bursts.\n-\tThe SMF selects and configures the UPF:\n-\tThe SMF selects the UPF based on marking method indicated in PCC rules.\n-\tThis may require the UPF to perform NF registration with NRF by indicating its capability for PDU sets marking. SMF performs NF discovery with NRF by querying the PDU sets and bursts marking option.\n-\tThe SMF configures the UPF based on selected marking mechanism for PDU set and/or burst.\n-\tBased on the selected UPF's actual capabilities, the SMF then notifies to AF the selected method for marking by using the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message.\n",

                            "text_content": "We adopt the term 'application packet', consistent with the term 'packet' in TR 38.838 [58], where 'a packet models the set of IP packets belong to the same video frame'. Nonetheless, we assume an application packet refers also to other types XR application flows and not only video, e.g. audio.\nThe following information is useful for the NG-RAN to enhance and configure CDRX: application packet periodicity and periodicity changes, and application packet jitter statistics (e.g. jitter range defined by minimum/maximum around the mean application packet periodicity), all per application flow. We discuss each of these parameters as follows.\nThe application packet periodicity (i.e. generation rate at the application) can be used to enhance CDRX at the NG-RAN, such that the CDRX cycle length is matched to the inter-arrival time of the application packets. An application packet can be, for instance, a video frame with periodicity 1/(60 fps). Thus, more power could be saved at the UE while ensuring a short traffic delay, since the UE awake time could follow closely the traffic arrival. Furthermore, information about changes in this periodicity is also needed, e.g. when the application employs rate adaptation.\nWe note that the periodicity is a parameter already supported in one of the NGAP information elements (IEs) in TSCAI, associated with a TSC QoS flow (TS 38.413, TS 23.501 [2]). However, this periodicity is defined per packet burst, which does not have a clear one-to-one mapping to a single application packet. For instance, for a video traffic flow, it is not clear that a burst contains exactly one video frame. We propose to introduce a new attribute for the periodicity per application packet basis. This attribute contains a list of periodicity values, corresponding to different application traffic flows (e.g. for video and audio flows), in case multiple such flows are multiplexed in the same QoS flow. This attribute is provided by the AF and included in the NGAP PDU Session Management procedures and associated with the applicable QoS Flow.\nNote that an equivalent way to obtain this periodicity information per application flow is to separate the application flows, each into an individual QoS flow. If this is possible, supporting only one periodicity parameter per QoS flow is sufficient. However, this separation cannot be guaranteed. Thus, to support sending the same periodicity information to the RAN, a QoS flow containing multiple application flows needs to have an associated list of periodicities.\nThe application server may, due to its limited capabilities induce a jitter to the generation of the periodic application packets. To cater for jitter induced by the transport network, the 5GC can add a fixed jitter value, e.g. preconfigured by the operator, to the jitter provided by AF. The jitter range of the application packet is useful for the RAN to ensure a short traffic delay, while allowing the UE to save power by sleeping as long as possible outside the jitter range. Figure 1 shows an example of RAN delay values for a single UE receiving video traffic in the downlink, with different application packet periodicities. If the RAN expects the periodic traffic to suffer from jitter, but no other jitter information is known, the UE has to be awake all the time (i.e. no CDRX configured), to ensure a short traffic delay. If the RAN does not have any information about jitter and expects no jitter w.r.t. the periodicity, but in fact jitter is present, the CDRX on-time may be wrongly configured to be too short (e.g. 1 ms – much shorter than the jitter range). In such a case the delay is very long, i.e. 10-35 ms, likely exceeding the values tolerated by the application. Finally, if the RAN has information about the jitter range, it can configure CDRX to achieve a short delay equal to that for no CDRX, even with a simple standard on-time configuration. Consequently, we propose to support information about the jitter range per application flow in an additional attribute.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 6.58.2.3-1,\" depicts the delay for the 99th percentile of a network. This figure is crucial for understanding the performance of a network, particularly in terms of latency. The 99th percentile represents the 99th percentile of the delay distribution, which indicates the average delay for the 99th percentile of network traffic. This figure is essential for network planning, troubleshooting, and performance analysis.\nFigure 6.58.2.3-1\tDelay for 99th percentile\nFigure 1 depicts an example of RAN delay (99th percentile), for CDRX without and with information about the jitter range, for different application packet periodicities corresponding to a video flow with {120, 90, 60, 30} fps. For all CDRX configurations it is assumed that the RAN knows the application packet periodicities and the application packet transmission duration is 1.5 ms.\nIn this solution following new information, in following text designated in bold format, is provided by AF to 5GS:\n-\ta set of periodicities; and\n-\tfor each periodicity there is one associated jitter range.\nTo avoid inducing load on the CP interfaces and to also ensure timely information update in RAN, the change of the content of the set of periodicities, e.g. due to application layer rate adaptation, is signalled in-band in the PDU Set information according to solution #8.\n",

This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain. Therefore, UE power saving scheme would benefit from application awareness in the form of additional information either carried over the user plane or new assistance information delivered using the control plane.\n",

RAN shall be able to distinguish PDUs that belong to the same PDU Set, the first PDU of a new PDU Set and the last PDU of the PDU Set.\n-\tIndication of the delay budget and maximum error rate for PDU Set.\nFurthermore, the following information is considered as auxiliary and/or assistance information, namely information that would assist RAN to optimally configure and improve UE power saving schemes, yet not essential for enabling power savings:\n-\tPeriodicity of the application layer traffic. Information like the rate at which PDU Sets such as XR frames and pose information packets are generated would assist the RAN to configure and adjust UE power saving schemes.\n-\tJitter statistics like mean and variance as well as the maximum value of the jitter of the PDU Set would assist RAN to configure and adjust UE power saving schemes that can tolerate the variability of the expected arrivals in order to fulfil the delay budget and error rate of the PDU Set.\n-\tSize of the PDU Set will assist the RAN in determining whether and when to trigger a UE power saving enhancement.\n-\tIndication of priorities, dependencies and validity time of PDU Sets would assist the RAN to decide whether and when to trigger a UE power saving enhancements.\nAuxiliary information can be provided per QoS flow or per PDU Set type in the Application/Media-Stream/Sub-flow PDU Set family. For example, the application layer traffic of an XR application can be divided in three media stream PDU Sets of type video, audio, and control, all belonging to the same QoS flow. If auxiliary information is provided per QoS flow, then one periodicity and one set of jitter statistics are provided to the network (e.g. the smallest periodicity and the largest jitter range). In contrast, if the auxiliary information is provided per PDU set-type in the Application/Media-Stream/Sub-flow family, there would be three instances (one each for video, audio and control) within the QoS Flow, then three periodicities and three jitter ranges are provided to the network.\nIndication of priorities, dependencies and validity of PDU Sets would assist the RAN in selecting the parameters of power saving schemes. For example:\n-\tDRX parameters that control the UE active time (e.g. On duration and the Inactivity time) can be configured to consider the PDB, jitter range and the validity time of the PDU Set [2]. The validity time indicates that the UE must remain active beyond the PDB even if the number of retransmissions has reached its limit. Therefore, the On duration can be opportunistically configured to prevent the UE entering in sleep mode before the validity time of the PDU Set is expired.\n-\tPDCCH adaptation parameters (e.g. SSSGs duration and timer) that control the PDCCH monitoring frequency can be configured to consider the PDB, jitter range and the validity time of the PDU Set [2]. The monitoring frequency can be reduced only after both the PDB and the validity time of a PDU Set expire to minimize any extra scheduling delay due to less frequent PDCCH monitoring.\n-\tPDCCH skipping can be enabled only after both the PDB and the validity time of a PDU Set expire. This prevents the UE skipping PDCCH monitoring opportunities when the PDU Set has a certain utility for the application.\nWe observe that part of auxiliary information can be learnt by the network using the essential information. For example, the periodicity and jitter statistics of a PDU Set Type can be estimated by measuring the inter-arrival time of the PDU Set instances. However, this requires to be able to identify packets belonging to the same PDU Set in the Application/Media-Stream/Sub-flow PDU family using solutions as the one proposed in [2].\n",

This is to ensure that related tactile and multi-modal data (e.g. audio, video and haptic data related to a specific time) is delivered by the application to the user at a similar time. There are requirements about the synchronization threshold between two or more modalities (for example audio-tactile, or visual-tactile) specified in TS 22.261 [5] and TR 22.847 [6].\nHowever, it is a misconception to think that media synchronization can be achieved by ensuring that all modalities are transmitted at the same time and/or have the same maximum end-to-end latency. Media synchronization requires that data from two or more modalities is synchronized to a common timeline when presented to the end user or received at the client application.\nThis solution proposes to achieve media synchronization by using application-level mechanisms, as described in solution #40 that proposes to reuse the mechanisms used by IMS for media synchronization (refer to clause 7.5.3 of TS 26.114 [28], that mandates to use RTCP Sender Reports for media synchronization according to RFC 3550 [9]). The requirement is to have a common wall-clock time for all data flows that need to be in sync. In the case of multiple UEs, there are 3GPP mechanism to achieve a common clock, e.g. using the timing information provided by gNodeB in SIB9 (see TS 38.331 [60]).\nQoS policy coordination of multi-modality flows for a single UE (KI #1) or multiple UEs (KI #2) is best achieved by the application client and server that handles all required data flows / streams.\n-\tEach of the data streams that comprise a multi-modal application, in general, requires a different set of QoS parameters.\n-\tEach data stream may follow a separate transmission path, i.e. use a different PDU session, on a different DNN or network slice.\n-\tSome data streams do not require any coordination or media synchronization, for example a temperature sensor may not require to be coordinated with other media, but provide a constant flow of ambient information.\n-\tApplications need to be able to control each data stream independently, in terms of enabling, disabling or setting the conditions for the device to deliver the data stream.\n-\tXRM applications provide service requirements (including QoS info) when the XRM session is initiated. It may not be possible for the application to provide the Flow Description(s) before the PDU session is establish, if server IP address/port is allocated on demand.\nOn the other hand, some data streams may be fully inter-dependent, in the sense that they are all necessary for the multi-modal application to function correctly. But even in such case, it is up to the application layer to decide what to do in case one of the (single-modal) data stream fails. For example, a video conference call requires both audio and video data streams to be successfully delivered. If the video stream fails, the conference call can continue only with audio (impacting the use experience, but still allowing communication). However, if the audio stream fails the conference call is typically terminated.\nThis solution proposes that those data streams (or set of data streams) that are closely related and require strong application coordination for correct delivery of a multi-modal application, are transmitted in a single PDU session by a single UE (either via a single device or multiple devices connected to a single UE that can access the 5GS). This enables the application (AF/AS) to handle multiple medias in a single procedure and single AF session. However, those data streams (or set of data streams) that contribute to the immersive experience, but may still be valid stand-alone, may be transmitted over separate PDU sessions from multipe UEs.\nAn example use case is provided in TR 22.847, chapter 5.1 (Immersive multi-modal Virtual Reality (VR) application). The VR system consists of two separate devices (VR glasses and gloves) connected to the 5GS as independent 5G UEs. The VR glass device generates positioning and view information that is closely inter-related, but can function with or without the haptic and sensing data generated by the VR gloves.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with multiple 5G UEs directly connected to the 5G network, showcasing the immersive multi-modal VR application.\nFigure 6.62.2-1: ( Figure 5.1.2-1 from TS 22.847 [6]): Immersive multi-modal VR application with multiple 5G UEs directly connected to 5G network\nFor multi-modality flows transmitted by a single UE (KI #1), all required application coordination can be achieved by re-using existing 5GS mechanisms. The functionality provided by the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service (TS 29.514 [66]) allows the AF/NEF to provide service information to the PCF and request specific QoS, charging, subscribe to events, etc. The service information provided by the AF/NEF consists of media components and media sub-components. Hence, different data streams of the multi-modal application, can be mapped onto different media components.\nNOTE:\tThis is the current mechanism used by IMS to setup video calls. Extensions to the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service may be needed to best accommodate XR applications\nThe procedure for AF session setup with required QoS (clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3]), can be reused for untrusted AFs interacting with NEF. However, current Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS service (TS 29.522 [67]) does not allow the AF to provide information for multiple medias:\n-\tOption 1. Extend the existing Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS service to allow the AF to provide service information for multi-modal (XRM) applications.\n-\tOption 2. Define a new NEF service/API for multi-modal (XRM) applications.\nOption 1 has less system impacts and so it is the preferred alternative. Note that the current specification for Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS is fully extensible in a backwards compatible way. On the other hand, option 2 (define a new NEF service/API) opens the option for single-modal applications to either keep using the legacy API or the new API (which may lead to inter-operability issues).\nFor multi-modality flows transmitted by multiple UEs (KI #2), the solution proposes to extend the existing mechanisms for AF session setup with required QoS with an additional attribute that characterize the service data flow. This allows 5GC to apply different QoS policies for data flows that are part of a multi-modal application, compared to the same data flows from a single-modal applications. If multiple UEs are provided with the same MMCI it implies these multiple UEs are using the same type of service, and will have a QoS handling that would depend on it. MMCI is an additional/optional information. The MMCI can complement the information provided by a QoS reference. The combination of both, MMCI and QoS reference can point to a QoS profile. Availability of MMCI would allow to distinguish one multi-modal service from another, and hence the specific treatment each service may have, in combination with other QoS parameters included in the request.\n-\tMuti-modality Communication Identifier (MMCI): Indicates that the created Individual Application Session Context resource relates to a tactile or multi-modal communication service. It may also include the name of the multi-modal service provider, a qualifier to further characterize the type of multi-modal service or a specific instance of multi-modal service.\nThere is no need to hide to the application that there are multiple UEs involved in the multi-modality service. For the example use case of the VR system described above. The application will manage each device (VR glases and gloves) via separate procedures, but allocate the same MMCI.\n",

The 5GS is expected to be able to apply common policies for the group of flows such as joint admission or aligned QoS fulfilment upon a request by an AF.\nThis solution assumes that the UEs involved in the multi-modal service with a flow group policy may be served by multiple PCFs. In order to enforce joint admission or aligned QoS fulfilment policies the PCFs need to coordinate. In this solution the coordination is performed by NEF, who receives the AF request(s) with the service flows and the flow group policies, discovers the PCFs involved, passes updates/notifications between the PCFs and provides the overall updates/notifications back to the AF. This way, the coordination on events such as QoS fulfilment failures across flows related to different UEs even served by different PCFs does not need to be done to the AF but can be handled directly within the 5GS based on the polices provided by the AF. This simplifies the AF implementation and reduces signalling between the AF and the 5GS.\nIt is further assumed that for the enforcement of joint admission control policies within the flow group, it may be beneficial for the SMF and the RAN to receive information on all flows subject to the policy before making admission decisions. For this purpose, this solution also includes a mechanism by which each PCF knows it has received information about all service flows that should be considered together before proceeding with policy updates about them to the SMF.\nThe AF-NEF interface may operate in either or both of these ways:\n1.\tAF can include all service flows related to all UEs in a single request. In this case the NEF parses the request and makes a separate PCF discovery for each UE.\n2.\tAF makes a separate request for each UE correlated by a common flow group coordination ID and a common request batch indicator which will identify the requests AF does in a batch (at the same time or back-to-back) and their amount so that the NEF knows which requests should be taken into account for joint admission. In this case the NEF discovers PCF separately for AF each request but will wait until it has received the full batch of AF requests before proceeding towards the PCFs.\nNOTE 1:\tIt does not seem necessary to support both options so one of them should be selected but that is beyond the scope of this solution.\nIn NEF-PCF interface only single UE specific operations are supported, again correlated by a common flow correlation group id and batch information. If a PCF is serving multiple UEs included in AF request (or batch of requests), the NEF will make multiple requests to that PCF indicating their number in the batch information, so that the PCF will know when it has received the full batch. PCF will only proceed after receiving the full batch in order to allow joint admission for all flows in that batch in the RAN. The NEF also passes the full group policy including all UEs and all flows to each PCF even if the PCF is not responsible for all UEs.\nNOTE 2:\tThe batch mechanism and PCF waiting for the full batch is not necessary if RAN does not require information on all service/QoS flows to be considered for joint admission at the same time but also that is beyond the scope of this solution.\nFor joint admission and aligned QoS fulfilment, each PCF will be able to take the flow group policy into account. It sends the replies/notifications on admission and QoS fulfilment events concerning those UEs to the NEF. The NEF will forward the reply/notification information from one PCF to all other PCFs, which can based on that apply the group policy also based on information from the UEs they are not serving.\nNEF also passes the replies/notifications to the AF. In case AF has used just a single request covering multiple UEs, NEF combines the replies/notifications received for individual UEs and provides the overall result to the AF (but can still provide also UE-specific information to the AF). Otherwise, AF receives replies/notifications for each UE separately.\n",

In this message flow, a single request from AF including multiple UEs is made but the explanation covers also the case when AF sends UE specific requests.\n\nFigure 6.64.3-1: Coordination across multiple PCFs\n1.\tPDU session established for each UE\n2.\tAF sends Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update request message towards NEF for a group of service flows related to multiple UEs. The AF includes the following information in its request: Multiple UE identities, related to each UE a set of Service flow descriptions and their QoS requirements, and flow group policies that apply across service flows.\nIn case AF sends a separate request for each UE, each request contains a common flow group correlation ID and common batch correlation information which indicates which requests belong to the same batch and how many requests the batch contains.\n3.\tNEF authorizes AF's request(s) and discovers PCF related to each of the UEs included in AF's request(s) according to clause 4.15.6.6 of 23.502 [3]. In case AF sends multiple requests in a batch, the NEF stores the request information until it has received the full batch based on the batch correlation information. In this example call flow NEF discovers PCF1 for UE1 and UE3 and PCF2 for UE2. Based on the discovery (and flow group correlation ID and batch correlation information in case AF sent multiple requests) NEF determines how many separate UE specific Npcf_PolicyAuhorization_Create requests it has to send to each PCF to cover the whole flow coordination group. In practice, this is the number of different UEs for the group served by each PCF. The NEF can subscribe the Resource allocation status to the PCFs in the Npcf_PolicyAuhorization_Create requests. The group information and policy change event can be subscribed to the NEF by PCFs in the Npcf_PolicyAuhorization_Create responses. It can be exposure to AF, if subscribed.\nIn case NEF does not get the full batch of requests from the AF within a specific time, the NEF fails the requests it has received thus far with an error code indicating an incomplete batch.\nNEF stores information about all the PCFs involved with the particular flow group coordination ID locally and/or in the UDSF in order to pass information between the PCFs about future events.\n4.\tNEF interacts with the PCF1 related to UE1 by using Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request with input parameters UE1 address, UE1 ID, flow coordination group ID and policies, total number of requests for this PCF to cover the whole flow correlation group QoS reqs and Flow group policies. Based on the number of requests/UEs for the group and batch the PCF will be able to determine when it has received all requests related to the group and will only then proceed towards SMF with full information related to the group.\n5.\tPCF1 does the Session binding but since it sees it will receive a total of 2 requests in a batch for this flow coordination group and this is just the first one, it stores the first request and does not proceed towards SMF until it has received all requests relevant for the flow coordination group.\nNOTE:\tThis logic is needed to enable appropriate admission control decisions in RAN for all QoS flows added or updated within a batch. If such admission control in RAN is not supported, PCF may proceed immediately with policy updates towards the SMF after receiving the first request. How RAN performs admission control is out of scope.\nIn case PCF does not get the full batch of requests from NEF within a specific time, the PCF fails the requests it has received thus far with an error code indicating an incomplete batch.\n6.\tSimilar to step 4 but with UE2 and PCF2.\n7.\tand 8.

                            "text_content": "This solution proposes enhanced interaction between the AF and the 5GS and also QoS policy enhancement to support the delivery of data from multiple service flows (mapped to QoS flows) of an application in a similar or compatible delay (PDB of the QoS flow). Similar or compatible here mean that when each flow is delivered with its delay requirement, the receiving application can play out or render the data from each flow with minimum buffering or waiting time between the flows. The exact synchronous playout or rendering is handled by the application itself using, e.g. RTP time stamps. The compatible delays are kept even if the 5GS has to downgrade any of the flows to alternate QoS profile with a longer PDB by downgrading also the other flows's corresponding alterative QoS PDBs.\nThe solution also proposes enhanced interaction between the AF and the 5GS that allows AF to provide the 5GS policy information about the service flows with respect to which flows are critical to the usability of the application and if they fail either at admission phase or while being delivered (e.g. even downgrade to a lower alternative QoS profile is no longer possible), successful admission or delivery of any of the other flows will not help. The 5GS can use this information for its admission control and QoS fulfilment decisions at both CN and RAN level.\nFor an application, service flows requiring coordinated delivery are grouped into a service flow group. Each service flow group has group level treatment requirements used for associated control of the service flows in the group, e.g. delivery of data to the receiver at a similar time. Each service flow can also be declared as critical within the group meaning its failure will render the application unusable. Each flow in the service flow group still has its own QoS requirements which is mapped to a QoS profile such as 5QI, ARP, PDB, PER, etc, and optionally a set of ordered alternative QoS profiles (AQPs).\nFor each group of service flows of an application, AF provides service flow association requirements to 5GS via interactions between AF and PCF. The service flow association requirements indicate association among a group of service flows of the application, and associated control between these service flows. The service flow association requirements consist of a service flow coordination group ID and group level treatment requirements for a group of service flows. The service flow coordination group ID is for identifying a group of service flows, and the group level treatment requirements include information for associated control of service flows in the group, e.g. information for for flow criticality forjoint fulfillment of admission control/resource allocation purposes and information for indicating synchronized delivery of service flows to the receiver side.\nPCF maps the service flow coordination group to QoS flow coordination group in the 5GS and derives associated group level treatment policy in the network based on service flow association requirements.\nPCF can provide PCC rules with group level treatment policy for service flows in the group, where the group level treatment policy/requirement may include the following information:\n1.\tSynchronized delivery and joint QoS fulfilment information, including an ordered list of PDB values per service flow in the coordination group. SMF derives the QoS profile and AQP(s) of each QoS flow based on ordered list of PDB values. The AQPs of the QoS flows in the group with the same order number are mapped AQPs, which means they are associated with each other. When PDB values have been chosen in such a way that when the PDB in the same position is chosen for each flow, the flows are delivered to the recipient in a synchronized manner, i.e. with a similar end-to-end delay.\n2.\tJoint admission control and resource allocation information, indicating associated resource allocation in 5GS among service flows. For example, once a service flow or a certain percentage of the service flows in a group cannot be allocated with the network resource due to poor network condition, the others do not need to be allocated to save the network resource and thus they should be treated jointly.\nEach service flow in a service flow group is treated as individual QoS flow without aggregation, and based on the PCC rule, SMF could derive QoS profile and AQP(s) for each QoS flow.\nThe network fulfills the QoS alignment requirement in the QoS flow coordination group based on the group level treatment policy in addition to the fulfillment of the QoS requirements of each individual QoS flow.\nAlternatively, SMF/PCF may use such group level treatment policy for PDU session management decisions. E.g. release the other QoS flows in the coordination group in case admission control/QoS fulfillment of one of the QoS flow fails.\nJoint admission policy can be enforced in 5GS as explained in 6.65.3.2 and 6.65.3.3, where each flow is separately admitted but if a new critical flow cannot be admitted, the 5GS can also release the earlier admitted flows in the group. Providing RAN more information about the QoS flows that should be considered for joint admission proactively during the setup of the first QoS flow allows RAN to further optimize its flow group admission decision and resource reservation. This procedure however requires Core Network Functions (PCF, SMF) to get all the service flow information before proceeding towards the RAN. This optimization is described in 6.65.3.4 with additional CN impacts listed in clause 6.65.4.\n",

The AF can provide the requirements and information of all of the service flows in a group with a single request or using multiple requests. If there are service flows related to multiple UEs, the request contains flow information for each UE.\nThe AF can provide updates to the service flow information or group policy in update requests. If the AF provides or adds service flows in separate requests, joint admission control/resource allocation can be performed not at one specific point of time but still in a joint manner in that failed admission of one service flow can affect the corresponding actions on already established and to-be-established service flows in the same service flow group.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an AF session with required QoS procedure, illustrating the steps to configure the necessary parameters for a successful AF session.\nFigure 6.65.3-1: Setting up an AF session with required QoS procedure\n1.\tThe AF sends single (1a) or separate (1b) requests to reserve resources for an AF session using an extended Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request message (AF Identifier, one or multiple UE identifiers, Flow description(s), QoS reference, (optional) Alternative Service Requirements (containing one or more QoS reference parameters in a prioritized order and the order of QoS reference parameters is used as association relationship between QoS reference parameters of different service flow), service flow coordination group ID, group level treatment requirements to the NEF.\nNOTE:\tThe UE identifier could be UE IP address or GPSI.\nThe group level treatment requirements may include joint admission and joint QoS fulfilment policy for the flows in the group.

It continues with step 3 if the request is authorized and continues with step 5 is the request is not authorized.\n3.\tThe NEF discovers the PCF and interacts with the PCF by triggering single or separate Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create requests for the UE(s) included in the AF's request. In the request to the PCF the NEF provides AF Identifier, UE address(es), Flow description(s), the QoS reference, and the optional Alternative Service Requirements (containing one or more QoS reference parameters in a prioritized order and the order of QoS reference parameters is used as association relationship between QoS reference parameters of different service flow), service flow coordination group ID, and group level treatment requirements. PCF uses this information to issue policy rules for the service flows in the request together. PCF also uses this information to check if there is already established service flows using the same service flow coordination group ID, in which case PCF treats the received request together with the existing policy rules for the service flow coordination group.\n4.\tPCF responses to NEF whether the group level policy is authorized or not.\n5.\tNEF responses to AF whether the request is granted or not.\nPCF derives the group level treatment policy for each service flow coordination group based on the group level treatment requirements from the application, and SMF maps the service flow coordination group to QoS flow coordination group in the 5GS. Each service flow in a service flow group should be treated as individual QoS flow without aggregation.\nPCF distributes the service flow coordination group ID and group level treatment policy in 5GS using the following procedure. SMF is responsible for providing the information to individual RAN Nodes with the PDU Session modification procedure, which is separate for each UE or PDU Session involved.\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with multiple QoS flows, each with its own dedicated path. The figure illustrates the coordinated delivery of these flows, ensuring that the highest priority flows are delivered first, while the lower priority flows are delivered after the higher priority ones. This design is based on the principles of SDN, which emphasizes the use of network functions virtualization to enable efficient network management and control.\nFigure 6.65.3-2: Coordinated delivery of multiple QoS flows\n1.\tPCF provides service flow coordination group ID and group level treatment policy to SMF using the existing session management policy association procedure (e.g. SMF policy association modification procedure). This happens with a separate procedure for each PDU session using the flow coordination group ID as a correlator that allows SMF to combine all the policies.\n2.\tIf the PCC rule contains a service flow coordination group ID, SMF binds the PCC rule to separate QoS Flows and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow. 3.-4. SMF provides QoS flow coordination group ID, QoS profile, Alternative QoS Profile (including association relationship information with AQPs of other QoS flows in the group) and group level treatment policy further to RAN via AMF as part of session management information per UE using the existing single PDU session modification procedure.\nFor QoS alignment and joint QoS fulfilment policy, it is enough if RAN gets the information of each QoS flow in the group independently.\n5.\tRAN used the information provided by SMF to apply admission control.\n6-7.\tRAN sets up the AN resource and update the session context accordingly.\n8.\tRAN use the informatio provided by SMF to apply QoS fullfillment.\n9.\tRAN sends notification via QoS Parameter Notification Control. And SMF/PCF adjusts QoS parameters for other flows in the group based on group level treatment policy.\nFor multiple UE case: Based on the newly selected QoS parameter from received from QoS Parameter Notification Control, AF/PCF/SMF adjusting QoS parameters or release service flows for other UEs via the procedure defined in clauses 6.65.3.1 and 6.65.3.2.\nAccording to the above procedures, the RAN/SMF/PCF can identify the QoS flows in the same QoS flow coordination group and apply the group level treatment policy, e.g. AQP level alignment to ensure synchronized delivery, joint QoS fulfilment, joint admission control/resource allocation among the QoS flows.\nGroup level treatment requirements (joint admission control, joint QoS fulfilment, AQP level alignment) can be performed at SMF/PCF for a single or multiple UEs. In the former case, PCF can notify AF on the received result whereas in the latter case, SMF can make PDU session management decisions according to the notification from RAN and PCF can decide on group level treatment policy update to be applied by the RAN in addition to notifying AF.\n-\tRAN performs admission control for each received PDU session modification request following the current procedures assisted by the flow group treatment policy information.\nIn case one or more of the QoS flows cannot fulfil its QoS requirements, based on communication with SMF/PCF/AF and assisted by the flow group treatment policy information, PDU session modification with QoS flow modification or termination can be performed.\nAs depicted in the procedures in clauses 6.65.3.1, 6.65.3.2 and 6.65.3.3, it is possible for 5GS to enforce a joint admission control policy for service flows requested by an AF with a common flow group coordination ID by handling and admitting them one by one until a new critical flow cannot be admitted, at which point 5GS can release (or lower the retention priority) for the flows within the same group admitted earlier.\nThis requires that the AF requests the service flows from the 5GS together. This can be done either by placing them all within a single request (as in clause 6.65.3.1 option 1a) or within a batch of separate but correlated requests (as in clause 6.65.3.1 option 1b). The AF must perform the request batch within a specific narrow time window, in practice as back-to-back requests. The requests in the batch need a further correlation ID beyond just the flow group coordination ID. This new correlation ID is called the batch correlation ID and it also includes the information of how many requests or service flows the full batch contains. This allows the receiving NF to be able to know when it has received the full batch of requests or flows.\nFor the procedure in clause 6.65.3.1 this requires for the multiple request option between AF and NEF and NEF and PCF the additional of the batch correlation ID and the information or the number of requests or service flows within the batch. The receiving NF, i.e. NEF or PCF, respectively, does not proceed until it has received all the requests or service flows in the batch, or fails the requests if it does not receive all of them within a specific time.\nFor the procedure in clause 6.65.3.2 this requires a similar batch correlation ID and information about the number of requests or service flows between the PCF and SMF. SMF does not proceed with PDU Session modifications until it has received the full batch or fails the requests if it does not receive all of them within a specific time.\nAfter receiving the full batch, the SMF determines how many QoS flow additions or modifications per each RAN Node the batch contains. When issuing the PDU Session modification requests towards each RAN Node, the SMF includes in each request in addition to the flow group coordination ID and the flow group level treatment policy (which indicates if a certain flow is critical for admission) and the total number of critical QoS flows as a new parameter.\nNOTE:\tSeparate batch coordination IDs and request or flow counters between AF and NEF, NEF and PCF, and PCF and SMF are needed in the general case that multiple PCFs and SMFs may be supported for a flow coordination group, otherwise the same batch ID and information can be carried even all the way from AF to SMF. Also, only if it is assumed that UEs involved in the flow coordination group can be served by different RAN Nodes, the SMF needs to determine the number of critical QoS flows per RAN Node, otherwise the information provided by PCF (or even AF) can be directly used.\nIf a new critical service flow is added to the flow coordination group by the AF at a later stage, it would not share the same batch correlation ID and would be handled according to the default procedure in clause 6.65.3.2.\n",

The remaining PDU session establishment/modification procedures are performed. NG-RAN and UPF schedule the packet delivery not to exceed the delay difference between the paired QFIs of UE1 and UE2.\nAnother UE2 performs PDU session establishment request procedure, which are same as UE1 step 3~12 except for step 3a, 4a and 7a in place of step 3, 4 and 7.\n3a.\tUE2 requests PDU session establishment as same as step 3.\n4a.\tThe same SMF is selected for UE2's PDU session for XR service of the XR application based on requested XR/media associated DNN and S-NSSAI.\n7a.\tSMF selects the same UPF for UE2 as UE1 based in the AF specific service flow group ID.\n13.\tWhen the SMF recognizes the UE1 and UE2 belong to the AF specific service flow group ID, it should confirm the UEs are in the same NG-RAN. So the SMF sends multi-modality indication to AMF with together UE1 ID and UE2 ID.\n14.\tReceiving the multi-modality indication from the SMF, the AMF may confirm whether UE1 and UE2 are in the same NG-RAN. If not, the AMF trigger redirection or handover of UE2 into UE1's NG-RAN, where the triggering message to UE2's NG-RAN may contain UE2 ID and Cell ID of UE1's NG-RAN and multi-modality indication.\nNOTE:\tIt can be assumed that the UEs belonging to the AF specific service flow ID can be moved in the same NG-RAN and AMF because the UEs are near enough.\n15.\tWhen the AMF confirms that UE1 and UE2 are in the same NG-RAN, it may notify the SMF of multi-modality ready (i.e. UEs of AF specific service flow group ID are in the same NG-RAN). And SMF may update N4 session accordingly.\nThe figure depicts the procedures for establishing a PDU session in a multi-modality communication scenario for a single UE. It illustrates the steps involved in establishing a PDU session, including the selection of the appropriate modulation scheme, the selection of the PDU protocol, and the establishment of the session parameters. The figure also includes a flowchart to guide the process, ensuring a clear and concise understanding of the procedures.\nFigure 6.66.3.2-2: PDU session establish procedures for multi-modality communication for single UE situation\nThe procedures are shown simultaneous for single UE, which, if not mentioned, basically follows clause 4.3.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]:\n1.\tXR application clients of a UE register AF/AS. As a pre-configuration, AF/AS obtains a paired service flows info between XR application clients or assign an AF specific service flow group ID for XR application clients, which implies that the XR application clients are associated between service flows for clients of the XR application.\n2.\tFor the paired service flows(or AF specific service flow group ID) multi-modality QoS policy information is stored or provisioned in PCF(or UDR) per UE, which can be done by some QoS specific provisioning from AF solutions.\nAt step 2, If the multi-modality policy information is provisioned in PCF, step 3~6 are replaced with step 6a SM policy association update procedures.\n3.\tWhen UE requests PDU session establishment, it includes XR/media dedicated DNN and S-NSSAI, which may be standardized or determined by the operator.\n4-6.\tAMF select a dedicated SMF based on requested XR/media-associated DNN and S-NSSAI.

                            "text_content": "In this key issue, it is proposed to identify the PDU set for a group of packets which have dependency and closer relationship. However, within the service data flow, there could be several types of traffic data, e.g. video frame data, audio data, haptic data, etc. For each kind of traffic data, the handling requirements may be different. The following examples are the possible implementations of the PDU set.\n-\tFor the audio data, one PDU set could include several or all the packets of the audio data. If certain packets are lost, others audio packets within the PDU set may not be impacted.\n-\tFor the video data, one PDU set could include one I frame and the P frames based on this I frame. If the certain percent of packets are lost, other packets within the PDU set may also be impacted.\n-\tFor the video data, another implementation of PDU set is that the packets of one I frame could form one PDU set, and the packets of one P frame could form one PDU set. So each of the I frame or P frame could form different PDU sets. PDU set of I frame and PDU set of P frame could be different PDU set types. In this case, the handling requirement of different PDU set type could be different.\nThere may be other implementations of the PDU set. In order to support different handling requirements on different kinds of PDU sets, it is proposed to have the following identification of the PDU set within the network. The following figure shows the possible different implementations of the PDU set within the service data flow.\nThe figure depicts various examples of PDU sets, which are essential components of a 68-11 network. These sets are used to manage and control the flow of data within the network, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure illustrates the different types of PDU sets, such as PDU-1, PDU-2, and PDU-3, each with its own specific functions and connections. The PDU-1 set is responsible for receiving and processing incoming data, while the PDU-2 set is used for transmitting data to the network. The PDU-3 set is used for managing the network's power and other resources. The figure also includes a diagram of the network's architecture, showing the connections between the different PDU sets and the network's core switches.\nFigure 6.68.1-1: Examples of PDU Sets\nWithin the service data flow, there could be different types of PDU sets. Each type of PDU set could have different features and handling requirements in the network. So the marking and identification of the PDU set could at least include the following parameters:\n-\tPDU Set type. This is optional to identify the type of the PDU set to which a certain PDU belongs. If there is only one type of PDU Set within the service data flow, there is no need to add this parameter. If there are more than one type of PDU set within the service data flow, this parameter is needed to differentiate the type of the PDU set. Each PDU could belong to at most one PDU Set type. The PDU Set type is added to each PDU header if needed.\n-  PDU Set Identifier (PSID). This is necessary to identify to which PDU Set a certain PDU belongs. The PSID needs to be added to each PDU header.\n-\tPDU sequence number within the PDU Set. This is used to identify the position of each received PDU within the PDU Set. It can help to identify when the PDU Set begins and the order of the PDUs within the PDU Set. It is\noptionally added to each PDU header.\nIn this case, if there are more than one PDU Set type within the service data flow, one PDU set can only belong to one PDU Set type. So one PDU can only belong to one PDU set with one PDU Set type. Other parameters may also be added in the GTP-U header to express the dependence or importance information of the PDUs inter or intra the PDU set. How to identify the PDU Set type and the related PDU Set marking information is decided in the PCF taking into account of the AF request.\nThe handling requirements of the PDU set could be set differently for the PDU Set types.\nEditor's note:\tWhether RAN could support different PDU Set related QoS parameters within one QoS flow is FFS.\nNOTE:\tIf certain parameters can't be differentiated for PDU Sets of different PDU Set types, they are common to all PDU sets.\nThis solution is based on the current network exposure framework and QoS model with the enhancements. The baseline procedure is proposed in the following section.\n",

In solution#57, negotiation of PDU set and/or burst marking mechanisms between AF and CN. The solution requires UPF to perform NF registration with NRF by indicating its capability for PDU sets marking (e.g. no marking, RTP for PDU set marking and/or burst marking).

This periodicity can be exploited in the RAN to set an appropriate CDRX cycle and CDRX settings yielding power saving in the UE.\nThe periodicity of the data transmission can be exploited to reduce the time the UE receiver is active (\"on-duration\"), specifically the receiver is activated at the expected arrival time of the first packet and switched off when the last packet is received. When the data provided to the base station is affected by jitter, the arrival time of data at the UE is no longer ideal, and configuration of CDRX based on ideal arrival time causes two impacts. The UE may activate the receiver before data is present causing unnecessary power consumption and could power down the receiver before all the data for the period has been received causing the need for re-transmission with negative impact on the user experience.\nThis solution proposes to address both the issues caused by jitter by sending the RAN three parameters to characterise the jitter and assist the RAN in optimising the CDRX on-duration:\n-\tOverall jitter range. The overall jitter range is an estimate of the maximum and minimum value of the jitter observed for the whole service duration. This parameter can be used to ensure that all the transmitted data of the period is received.\n-\tLocal jitter average. The local jitter average is a measure of the mean value of the jitter calculated over a few XR service periods.\n-\tLocal jitter range. The local jitter range is the observed fluctuation of the jitter around the local jitter average. This parameter can be used in combination with the local jitter average to optimise the start of the on-duration within the CDRX cycle.\nThe overall jitter range and local jitter range can be considered properties of the connection between application server and 5GC and therefore not expected to change substantially during the service duration. The Local jitter average on the other hand is expected to vary, albeit slowly.\n1.\tDuring PDU Session Establishment/Modification procedure, SMF determines the overall jitter range and the local jitter range and delivers it to the RAN.\na)\tOverall jitter range and local jitter range are expected to be relatively static and their initial value may be based on historical data collected for the particular application server.\nb)\tThe local jitter average is calculated dynamically during the service rendering.\n2.\tThe RAN can configure and enable the CDRX based on the overall jitter range, the local jitter range and the local jitter average.\nNOTE:\tHow jitter statistics are used for the configuration of CDRX is determined by RAN WGs.\n3.\tThe 5GC keeps track of the jitter and uses the data to provide updates to the RAN when necessary.\n",

And thus, the trade-off between throughput/latency/reliability and power consumption can be achieved.\nIt is assumed that the PCF can generate different PCC rules corresponding to distinct power modes. Power mode could be power saving mode or ultimate performance mode. Power mode can be determined by UE implementation or user preference. For example, a UE is connected to a power supply or has sufficient power, the ultimate performance mode may be applied. The UE informs PCF of the ultimate performance mode, and then PCF generates corresponding QoS parameters (e.g. high bitrates, low PDB), so that the user experience can be improved. On the contrary, when the UE is disconnected from the power supply or the battery is low, the power saving mode may be selected by the UE, and then the PCF generates corresponding QoS parameters (e.g. low bitrates and high PDB), so that the power consumption will be reduced and the available time of UE is extended.\nThere are two alternatives to provide the power mode info to PCF:\n-\tUE reuses the existing PDU session establishment/modification procedure to send the power mode info to SMF, and then SMF can forward such information to PCF by initiating the SM establishment/modification procedure. UE is supposed to report power mode info to SMF by UE implementation or based on network policy e.g. event trigger, periodicity or network request.\n-\tUE sends the power mode info to the AF over the application layer, and then the AF provides the power mode info to the PCF directly or via NEF. The power mode info can be carried by the setting up an AF session with required QoS procedure.\nEither triggered by AF or by UE, PCF generates the PCC rules based on the received power mode info. In addition, After PDU session establishment, and application starts, AF may provide media codec information for specific application to PCF. PCF can also consider the received media codec information for PCC rule decision. Upon receiving the PCC rules, SMF performs the binding of PCC rules to QoS flows, and provides QoS profile to RAN and QoS rule to UE.\nPCF has the knowledge of current QoS parameters for specific traffic flow corresponding to NG-RAN current QoS profile. If Alternative QoS profile method is used in NG-RAN, the QoS Notification Control mechanism can support NG-RAN to indicate the reference to the matching Alternative QoS Profile to the SMF, and notify the corresponding Alternative QoS parameter set to PCF to show the QoS changing.\nFurthermore, PCF can also update the PCC rule with new QoS parameters, if the power mode is switched to a new one, or if the new media codec information is provided. Consequently, the throughput/latency/reliability and power consumption can be adjusted correspondingly.\n",

All solutions rely on providing some information to the RAN so that it can optimize the setting of the CDRX parameters (e.g. the DRX cycle). Such solutions can be summarized as follows:\n-\tSolution 33. In this solution the RAN and the UPF are provided with UL/DL traffic patterns that then are used to optimize the CDRX cycle duration. The UL/DL traffic patterns include, e.g. the periodicity and/or the frequency of the UL and DL bursts and traffic descriptions (to describe the type of traffic). Such information may be provided to the RAN either by the AF (via NEF/PCF and SMF) or by the UPF (via GTP-U header extension). The UPF may receive the information from the AF (via NEF/PCF and SMF) or can derive it based on statistical analysis (e.g. as described in Solution 12).\n-\tSolution 34 has two parts.\nThe first part focuses on how to provide CN assistance information to the RAN to that it can optimize the CDRX cycle duration. The 3rd party application function provides session identifier, traffic patterns (frame rate, dynamic GOP, maximum frame size) and traffic profile (UE driven vs. server driven DL traffic) in a way similar to the External Parameter Provisioning of Rel-15. The UDM stores the XRM Communication Patterns and the SMF can retrieve the \"SMF associated\" information and use it to derive the CN assisted RAN information.\nThe second part focuses on how the UE may be configured with multiple CDRX configurations and that the UE may choose to move from one CDRX configuration to another or may choose to modify a CDRX configuration parameter based on the traffic pattern that is being used. This might be useful in situations where the UE is aware of a traffic pattern starting or beginning before it can be detected by the network.\n-\tSolution 58 proposes to provide the Application Packet periodicities and jitter ranges on a per application flow manner to the RAN. Such information can be provided as part of the TSCAI (Time Sensitive Communication Assistance Information) in a semi-static way (over CP). In case of dynamic corrections of the periodicity values, corrections can be indicated in-band (i.e. via the AS-UPF-RAN in the PDU Set information – See Solution 8).\n-\tSolution 59 categorizes the information to be sent to the RAN in essential (PDU Set boundaries, i.e. indication of first PDU of the PDU set, last PDU of the PDU set, sequence number of the PDU within the PDU Set), assistance information (traffic periodicity, jitter statistics, PDU set size as well as priorities, dependencies, and validity times of the PDU sets). The information is provided to the RAN at PDU session establishment/modification via GTP-U header and/or CP signalling (NGAP). In general, information provided to NG-RAN for the purpose of KI#4/5 is also leveraged for improved power savings.\n-\tFinally, Solution 60 proposes to provide the RAN with the end of burst indication via in-band signalling over GTP-U header. Such information is sent by the UPF which can get it explicitly from the AS or can generate it locally based on other mechanisms.\n",

                    "text_content": "Solutions that are relevant to KI#9 are summarized and evaluated as the following:\nSol#34: RAN provides UE with multiple CDRX configurations or adaptable CDRX configuration. Based on the UE's operating mode, e.g. high-power or low-power, UE may choose to move from one CDRX configuration to another, or may choose to modify the CDRX configuration parameter, then UE indicates to the RAN node which CDRX configuration is used. In this solution, with the status of power consumption at UE, CDRX parameters may change and thus may have impact at transmission latency, the QoS parameters (e.g. GFBR/MFBR/PDB/PER) are not changed. Trade-off of throughput/reliability and power consumption is not supported, for trade-off of latency and power consumption, as the PDB is not changed, the impact from CDRX could be minor. This solution requires multiple signalling handshakes between the UE and the network in order to (constantly) change the applied CDRX configuration, therefore causing additional UE power consumption and costing radio capacity. No evidence has been shown the solution provides gains over existing CDRX mechanism. CDRX is under full responsibility of RAN WG2.\nSol#35: SMF provides conditional QoS profile(s) to RAN, each conditional QoS profile associates with an event, when the event is detected by RAN, the QoS parameters are changed accordingly. The event could be time based, UE's power consumption based or UE's memory status. If the event is time based, the assumption is AF foresees the relationship of UE's power consumption and the event, if the event is UE's power consumption based, the assumption is RAN can get UE's power consumption (e.g. device battery life) from UE. None of these metrics however are reliable indicators that can be used by the AF or the network. The solution does not provide any evidence that the above events are necessary nor any explanation as to what trade-off is actually achieved. It also incurs additional signalling from the UE to the RAN and related increase of signalling load and UE power consumption which is function of the event a) granularity b) frequency and c) hysteresis.\nSol#61: PCF subscribes to SMF or AMF to get the UE battery level which may be a special value or the percentage of the battery life. With the UE battery level, PCF decides the corresponding QoS parameters. AMF or SMF obtains the UE battery level from UE within the NAS message. UE battery level is also can be reported to AF by the PCF, so that AF can take some action (e.g. change codec) to keep an aligned policy. The solution does not explain how policy adjustments are made depending on the reported battery level, with what granularity and based on what criteria and fails to explain how this in turn provides any benefit. Battery level and relative battery life of a device are not deterministic quantities that can be used reliably in the network for policy adjustment. The device alone knows what it should do to preserve battery life and this can change in time for the same UE and also between UEs even of the same make/model.\nSol#74: Power mode info determined by UE implementation or user preference can be provided to PCF either via NAS signalling or via AF. Based on the receiving power mode info, PCF generates the PCC rule with corresponding QoS parameters. In addition, AF may also provide media codec information to PCF for PCC rule decision. Furthermore, PCF can also update the PCC rule with new QoS parameters, if the power mode is switched to a new one or the new media codec information is provided. The solution does not explain how a trade-off is achieved between QoE and power consumption, how policies are adjusted, with what granularity and importantly whether any gain is obtained at all, whilst it however requires additional signalling handshakes between the UE and the CN with the corresponding increase in power consumption and radio capacity usage. \"Power mode\" is not a universally accepted definition but is instead very specific to a particular device (make and model). Low power mode in one device may have a very different meaning from low power mode in another device. Similar to battery level, low power mode is not a deterministic variable that can be used reliably by the network. \"Ultimate performance mode\" is not a universal accepted definition notion, given performance can be associated to e.g. data rate, latency, reliability, power consumption and any combination thereof. In other words ultimate performance is indefinite and certainly does not necessarily imply highest power consumption.\nSol#75: AF provides multiple QoS requirements to 5GC, and such requirements can be mapped into a target QoS profile and multiple alternative QoS profiles. RAN is configured with the relationship between UE overheating status and QoS parameters, and thus RAN can select an appropriate alternative QoS profile considering the UE overheating status. Optionally, the Alternative QoS Parameter Sets is extended to include a UE overheating parameter applies to the management. RRC signalling is used to report UE overheating status to the RAN (reusing the UE Assistance Information with overheating assistance). This solution leverages the existing overheating assistance indication from a UE to allow the RAN to select QoS parameters depending on the indication from the UE and QNC settings. This solution relies on RAN configuration of the relationship between overheating status and QoS which may be challenging. This solution can be counterproductive if combined with other proposed solutions. It should be noted though that overheating assistance is already specified in RAN specifications and unlike other solutions, relies on a deterministic, reliable indication from the UE.\nThere are some key aspects for these solutions proposed for KI#9 which can be summarized as follows:\n-\tA number of device-internal factors may prompt a device to reduce its activity in order to save battery power. Reducing e.g. the QoS level (e.g. data rate) of a data stream could - but not necessarily \"will\" - help reducing this activity hence battery consumption. These factors are of the device's internal states thus highly dependent on the device itself, its operation and characteristics. These can vary not only during the lifetime of the device but also across devices whether they be the same make/model or not. Unless a precise normalized representation of these factors can be properly specified, calibrated and tested, these cannot be exploited in a reliable manner by the network.\nTwo main observations can also be made:\n-\tExcept sol#34 (CDRX), all solutions advocate for allowing a QoS level reduction/increase, prompted by an indication from the UE.\n-\tUE overheating assistance is already specified that is deterministic.\nIt should also be observed that Notification Control (QNC) is already specified allowing NG-RAN to operate QNC whenever suitable for a given QoS profile.\n",

A QoS Flow level explicit indication may be provided to PSA UPF to enable the ECN marking for the purpose of L4S.\n-\tMethod1: To support L4S, NG-RAN performs ECN marking according to [37] and [62] for uplink and downlink in IP layer of the received packets.\nNOTE 1:\tThe criteria for RAN to determine (e.g. its congestion level) when to perform the marking is up to RAN implementation.\n-\tMethod2: PSA UPF performs ECN marking according to [37] and [62] for uplink and downlink IP layer of the received packets based on latest reported congestion information from NG-RAN via GTP-U header.

Thus, the PSER defines an upper bound for a rate of non-congestion related packet losses. The purpose of the PSER is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in RAN of a 3GPP access). For every 5QI the value of the PSER is the same in UL and DL. If any PDU within the PDU Set is not successfully transmitted, the PDU Set is treated as error.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this release, a PDU set is considered as successfully delivered when all PDUs of a PDU Set are delivered successfully.\n-\tPDU Set Delay Budget: The PSDB defines an upper bound for the delay that a PDU Set may experience for the transfer between the UE and the N6 termination point at the UPF, i.e. time between reception of the first PDU and the successful delivery of the last arrived PDU of a PDU Set. PSDB applies to the DL PDU Set received by the UPF over the N6 interface, and to the UL PDU Set sent by the UE. For a certain 5QI the value of the PSDB is the same in UL and DL.\nNOTE 3:\tTo enable support for PSDB, it is assumed that there is a maximum duration threshold for inter arrival time between PDUs and first arrived PDU within the PDU Set as per SLA or pre-configuration. How to handle the case of maximum duration threshold is not met needs to be discussed in normative phase.\nPSDB is an optional parameter.
