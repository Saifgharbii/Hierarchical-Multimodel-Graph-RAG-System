Only parameters for which there is the possibility for UEs to signal different values are considered as UE radio access capability parameters. Therefore, mandatory features without capability parameters that are the same for all UEs are not listed here.\nThe network needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.\nFor capabilities that required to be set consistently for all FDD-FR1 bands (i.e. capabilities that are supposed to be per UE), the UE shall also set capability values for all SUL bands with same values for FDD-FR1 bands if SUL band is supported by the UE.\nThe UE may support different functionalities between FDD and TDD, and/or between FR1 and FR2. The UE shall indicate the UE capabilities as follows. In the table of UE capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Yes\" in the column by \"FDD-TDD DIFF\" and \"FR1-FR2 DIFF\" indicates the UE capability field can have a different value for between FDD and TDD or between FR1 and FR2 and \"No\" indicates if it cannot. \"(Incl FR2-2 DIFF)\" in the column by \"FR1-FR2 DIFF\" indicates the UE capability field can have a different value for between FR2-1 and FR2-2. Regarding to the per UE capabilities that are FDD/TDD differentiated(i.e. capabilities indicated as \"Yes\" in the column by \"FDD-TDD DIFF\"), the corresponding capabilities indicated by the FDD capability is applied to SUL if SUL band is supported by the UE. \"FD\" in the column indicates to refer the associated field description. \"FR1 only\" or \"FR2 only\" in the column indicates the associated feature is only supported in FR1 or FR2 and \"TDD only\" indicates the associated feature is only supported in TDD and not applicable to SUL carriers. \"N/A\" in the column indicates it is not applicable to the feature (e,g. the signalling supports the UE to have different values between FDD and TDD or between FR1 and FR2).\n1>\tset all fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability except fdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC/Sidelink-Capabilities, tdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC/Sidelink-Capabilities, fr1-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and fr2-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities, to include the values applicable for all duplex mode(s) and frequency range(s) that the UE supports;\n1>\tif UE supports both FDD (or SUL) and TDD and if (some of) the UE capability fields have a different value for FDD (or SUL) and TDD\n2>\tif for FDD (and, if the UE supports SUL, for SUL), the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability/SidelinkParameters:\n3>\tinclude field fdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC/Sidelink-Capabilities and set it to include fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FDD;\n2>\tif for TDD, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability/SidelinkParameters:\n3>\tinclude field tdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC/Sidelink-Capabilities and set it to include fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for TDD;\n1>\tif UE supports both FR1 and FR2 and if (some of) the UE capability fields have a different value for FR1 and FR2:\n2>\tif for FR1, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:\n3>\tinclude field fr1-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FR1;\n2>\tif for FR2, the UE supports additional functionality compared to what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:\n3>\tinclude field fr2-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FR2;\nNOTE 1:\tThe fields which indicate \"shall be set to 1\" or \"shall be set to supported\" in the following tables means these features are purely mandatory and are assumed they are the same as mandatory without capability signalling.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case where the UE is allowed to support different functionality between FDD and TDD and between FR1 and FR2 according to the specification, the UE capability indication is clarified in Annex B.\nFor optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter indicates whether the feature has been implemented and successfully tested. For mandatory features with the UE radio access capability parameter, the parameter indicates whether the feature has been successfully tested. In the table of UE capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Yes\" in the column by \"M\" indicates the associated feature is mandatory and \"No\" indicates the associated feature is optional. \"CY\" in the column indicates the associated feature is conditional mandatory and the condition is described in the field description and the associated feature is considered mandatory with capability parameter, when the described condition is satisfied. \"FD\" in the column indicates to refer the associated field description. Some parameters in subsequent clauses are not related to UE features and in the case, \"N/A\" is indicated in the column.\nUE capability parameters have hierarchical structure. In the table of UE capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Per\" indicates the level the associated parameter is included. \"UE\" in the column indicates the associated parameter is signalled per UE, \"Band\" indicates it is signalled per band, \"BC\" indicates it is signalled per band combination, \"FS\" indicates it is signalled per feature set (per band per band combination), \"FSPC\" indicates it is signalled per feature set per component carrier (per CC per band per band combination), and \"FD\" in the column indicates to refer the associated field description.\nNOTE 3:\tUnless otherwise specified, for dependent capabilities with prerequisite capability in a finer granularity, the UE should indicate support of the prerequisite capability in at least one finer granularity. And the dependent capability is supported only in the finer granularity where the prerequisite capability is supported, e.g. a UE indicating support of supportNewDMRS-Port-r16 (dependent capability which is defined per band) should indicate at least one band combination where singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16 (prerequisite capability which is defined per feature set) is supported in the corresponding band. In this case, supportNewDMRS-Port-r16 is considered supported only in the corresponding band of the band combination where singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16 is supported.\n",

            "description": "Annex A.5 specifies for which multiple serving cells a UE supporting cross-carrier operation shall support a feature/capability for which it indicates support within the capability signalling.\nA UE that indicates support for cross-carrier operation in CA (e.g. MCG or SCG):\n-\tFor the fields for which the UE is allowed to indicate different support for different bands, the UE shall support the feature on the PCell and/or SCell(s) in cross-carrier operation, as specified in table A.5-1 in accordance to the following rules:\n-\tTriggered serving cell: the UE shall support the feature if the UE indicates support of the feature for the band of the scheduled/triggered/indicated serving cell;\n-\tTriggering&Triggered serving cells: UE shall support the feature if the UE indicates support of the feature for the band of both the scheduling/triggering/indicating serving cell and the scheduled/triggered/indicated serving cell;\nTable A.5-1: General UE capabilities for which differentiation is allowed\n\n\nAnnex B clarifies the UE capability indication for the case where the UE is allowed to support different functionality between FDD and TDD, and between FR1 and FR2. Table B-1 clarifies the setting of UE capability fields for cases where the UE supports the corresponding feature in different combinations of duplex mode and frequency range. There are two possible ways of UE capability indication in Case 3 and Case 8.\nTable B-1: UE capability indication for UE capabilities with both FDD/TDD and FR1/FR2 differentiations\n\nNOTE 1:\tFor a UE capability which cannot be differentiated between FR2-1 and FR2-2, 'FR2 TDD' in Table B-1 includes both 'FR2-1 TDD' and 'FR2-2 TDD'.\nNOTE 2:\tFor a UE capability which can be differentiated between FR2-1 and FR2-2, 'FR2 TDD' in Table B-1 only means 'FR2-1 TDD'.\n\n\n",
