                            "text_content": "In a video group call after the call is setup, at a given time multiple group members (the allowed maximum simultaneous MCVideo transmitting group members is configured in the group configuration data) are allowed to transmit videos and all other affiliated group members are invited to accept the incoming videos. Each of the other affiliated group members has the option to accept or reject the incoming videos. After accepting the video, the affiliated group member can end the video being received at any time. . The control action for obtaining this mode of operation is known as transmission and reception control. The direct actors of transmission and reception control are the transmission participants and the transmission control server. A transmission participant does the transmission and reception control related actions in the MCVideo client. The transmission control server is the decision maker of the transmission and reception control. In on-network the transmission control server is in the MCVideo server with the controlling role. In off-network no specific transmission control server exists. The current video transmitter plays the role of transmission control server.\nTransmission control actions in on-network are described in clause 4.1.1.2. The differences for off-network transmission control are described in clause 4.1.1.3.\nNOTE:\tEnd-user actions as operation of the video transmit, video transmission end, video receive and video reception end button illustrates functionality but no end-user actions are mandated by the present document.\nAt any point in time a group member can request permission to transmit.\nWhen the allowed maximum simultaneous MCVideo transmitting group members is not reached, a group member can click the video transmission send button, meaning the request for permission to transmit. The transmission participant entity of this user reflects this request to the transmission control server by sending a Transmission Request message. If the transmission control server decides to permit, it informs this permission for this request by sending a Transmission Granted message to the requesting group member. The transmission control server informs the initiation of the transmission to the other group members by sending a Media Reception Notification message. Once the group member receives the permission, a permission indication (permission tone) is generated by the client to inform the user that the video starts being transmitted. The media packets (encoded audio stream and video stream) are sent to the controlling MCVideo server and from there they are distributed to all receivers of this group. The click on the video transmission end button indicates the user's intention to end transmitting. Once the video transmission end button is clicked, the transmission participant sends a Transmission End Request message to the transmission control server indicating that this user has finished transmitting. This cycle, starting from the Transmission Granted message and ending with Transmission End Request message, is known as 'video transmission'.\nIn the beginning of a call the initial transmit request can be implied by the SIP message which initiates the call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.281 [2] without any specific Transmission Request message.\nA group member can also request permission to transmit media by sending a Transmission Request message when the allowed maximum simultaneous MCVideo transmitting group members is reached. The transmission control server can resolve this request in several ways.\n1.\tIf this request has higher priority than any one of the ongoing video transmissions, the transmission control server revokes the ongoing video transmission with lowest priority by sending a Transmission Revoke message to the video transmitter of the video transmission with lowest priority. The transmitter is interrupted and the current video transmission is ended by the current transmission participant by sending a Transmission End Request message. Then the transmission control server sends a Transmission Granted message to the revoking user and send Media Reception Notification message to other affiliated group members. Then a new video transmission starts.\n2.\tIf this request does not have higher priority and transmission request queueing is not used the transmission control server rejects this request by sending a Transmission Deny message to the requester. Then a reject indication (reject tone) is generated for the user. The ongoing video transmissions continue.\n3.\tIf request queueing is used the transmission control server sends Transmission Queue Position Info message indicating that there is no permission but the request is queued for potential permission when the current video transmissions end. Then a \"queued\" indication is generated for the user. The ongoing video transmissions continues.\nWhen an affiliated group member receives the Media Reception Notification message, if the maximum number of simultaneous video streams that can be received is not reached, a warning indication (new video coming tone) is generated by the client to inform the user that a new video transmission is coming to be accepted. The click on the video receive button indicates the user accepts the video, the transmission participant entity of this user sends a Receive Media Request message to the transmission control server. If the transmission control server determines to accept the Receive Media Request, a Receive Media Response message is sent back to the requesting receiver. The click on the video reception end button indicates the receiver's intention to end the video reception. Once the video reception end button is clicked, the transmission participant sends a Media Reception End Request message to the transmission control server indicating that this user does not want to receive the video transmission any more. Once receiving the Media Reception End Request message, the transmission control server interacts with media distribution function to stop sending the requesting video to the requesting receiver. If no one receives the video any more, the transmission control server can send Transmission End Request to the video transmitting user to end the video transmitting.\nIf maximum number of simultaneous video streams that can be received towards the affiliated group member is reached, the transmission participant can resolve this Media Reception Notification in several ways.\n1.\tIf this notification has higher priority than any one of the ongoing video receptions, the transmission participant ends the ongoing video reception with lowest priority by sending a Media Reception End Request message to the transmission control server indicating that this user does not want to receive the video transmission any more.. Then the transmission participant sends a Transmission Granted message to the revoking user and send Media Reception Notification message to other affiliated group members. Then the transmission participant sends a Receive Media Request to the transmission control server to receive the new video transmission. Then a new video reception starts.\n2.\tIf this notification does not have higher priority, a warning indication and a prompt (new video available but the maximum number of simultaneous video streams that can be received is reached) is generated by the client to inform the user that a new video transmission is available but the maximum number of simultaneous video streams that can be received is reached, and prompts the user to make a decision. If the user reject the new video transmission invitation, the ongoing video receptions continue and the video transmission is added to a recently invited group communications list locally for later reception.  If the user end the other ongoing video reception to accept the new video transmission, then the transmission participant sends a Receive Media Request to the transmission control server to receive the new video transmission. Then a new video reception starts.\nDuring the video transmissions, a queued user can ask its position in the queue by sending a Transmission Queue Position Request message. Then the transmission control server provides the information by sending Transmission Queue Position Info message. A queued user can also remove itself from the queue by sending a Transmission End Request message. This kind of message exchange during the video transmissions does not affect the ongoing video transmissions.\nIf request queueing is used, by the end of a video transmission, the transmission control server gives the transmit permission to the first pending request in the queue. For this, it sends the same messages as in the beginning of a video transmission; Transmission Granted message to the permitted user and Media Reception Notification message to other affiliated group members. The permitted user is expected to click the video transmission send button after the permission tone within a well-defined short period of time. If the permitted user does not click the video transmission send button, the MCVideo client loses the transmission permission.\nIf queueing is used the ordering in the queue is affected by the priority of the users in the queue.\nA transmission request with pre-emptive priority can be granted with revoking the ongoing video transmitter with lowest priority.\nDuring silence (when no video transmission is ongoing), the transmission control server can send Transmission Idle message to all transmission participants from time to time. The transmission control server sends Transmission Idle message in the beginning of silence.\nSome of the transmission control messages can be repeated as specified in state machines specified in clause 6.\nThe call can be released after a long silence period.\nThis clause describes the special features for off-network transmission control with respect to the on-network transmission control.\nIn off-network no specific transmission control server exists. All transmission control messages are sent to all group members.\nWhen a transmission control server gives transmission permission it sends a Transmission Granted message. The information element which expresses the group member, to which this transmission permission is given, implies to the other group members that the transmission is taken. No other Media Reception Notification message is sent.\nAfter silence, a transmission participant asks for transmission permission by sending a Transmission Request message. After a well-defined waiting period, if no response is received, this transmission participant sends a Media Reception Notification message indicating itself in the information element which expresses the group member to which this transmission permission is given and continues the video transmission.\nIn off-network, the Transmission Idle message is not used.\nSome of the transmission control messages can be repeated as specified in the state machines specified in clause 7.\nThe transmission control server can determine how to handle a received Transmission Request message using a number of input parameters. Examples of input parameters that the transmission control server can use are:\n1.\tthe transmission priority, using the value of the Transmission Priority field in the Transmission Request message;\n2.\tthe <user-priority> element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5];\n3.\tthe <num-levels-priority-hierarchy> element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [7];\n4.\tthe participant type, using the <participant-type> element specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5] or, in case a non-controlling MCVideo function is attached to a group call, the <Participant Type> value in the Track Info field in the Transmission Request message;\n5.\tthe type of call indicated in the Transmission Indicator field;\n6.\tthe effective priority of the transmission participant with the permission to send media, and the current type of the call (e.g. normal, imminent-peril, emergency, broadcast); and\n7.\tany other information in the group document specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5] or information stored in the controlling MCVideo function outside the scope of the present document.\nUsing a local policy and the above input parameters the transmission control server can determine that a transmission request is:\n1.\tpre-emptive such that the current transmission is overridden;\n2.\tpre-emptive such that the current transmission is revoked;\n3.\tnot pre-emptive and put in the transmission request queue, if queueing was negotiated; or\n4.\tnot-pre-emptive and rejected, if queueing was not negotiated.\nThe transmission participant can determine how to handle a received Media Reception Notification message using a number of input parameters. Examples of input parameters that the transmission participant can use are:\n1.\tthe transmission priority, using the value of the Transmission Priority field in the Transmission Request message;\n2.\tthe <user-priority> element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5];\n3.\tthe <num-levels-priority-hierarchy> element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [7];\n4.\tthe participant type, using the <participant-type> element specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5];\n5.\tthe type of call indicated in the Transmission Indicator field;\n6.\tthe effective priority of the transmission participant with the permission to send media, and the current type of the call (e.g. normal, imminent-peril, emergency, broadcast); and\n7.\tany other information in the group document specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [5] or information stored in the controlling MCVideo function outside the scope of the present document.\nThe transmission control participant can determine how to handle a received Transmission Request message using the following input parameters:\n1.\tthe transmission priority, using the value of the Transmission Priority field in the Transmission Request message;\n2.\tthe value of the \"/<x>/<x>/Common/MCVideoGroupMemberList/<x>/UserPriority\" leaf node of the sender of the Transmission Request message, present in group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [6];\n3.\tthe value of the \"/<x>/OffNetwork/NumLevelHierarchy\" leaf node present in service configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [6];\n4.\tthe type of call indicated in the Transmission Indicator field; and\n5.\tthe effective priority of the transmission participant with the permission to send media, and the current type of the call (e.g. normal, imminent-peril, emergency).\nUsing the policy as described in clause 7.2.1.2, and the above input parameters the transmission control participant can determine that a transmission request is:\n1.\tpre-emptive such that one of the on-going transmissions is revoked;\n2.\tnot pre-emptive and put in the transmission request queue, if the value of \"/<x>/<x>/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [6] is set to \"true\"; or\n3.\tnot-pre-emptive and rejected, if the value of \"/<x>/<x>/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [6] is set to \"false\".\n",

                            "text_content": "The participating MCVideo function can use an MBMS bearer for the DL transmission of the media and the media control plane.\nThe participating MCVideo function decides to activate an MBMS bearer. After the activation of the MBMS bearer, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.468 [15], the TMGI of this MBMS bearer is announced to the MCVideo clients in the MBMS service area of this MBMS bearer. This announcement enables the MCVideo client to listen (decode/demodulate) this MBMS bearer. The activation of an MBMS bearer and the announcement of the TMGI create a pool of MBMS subchannel resources without any association to a group or other purposes.\nThe criteria for a participating MCVideo function to decide to activate and use an MBMS bearer is implementation dependent.\nAn MBMS bearer can be used for the DL transmission for more than one group. For this, additional parameters like destination UDP port are used for enabling the differentiation of messages and packets belonging to different groups over the same MBMS bearer by a receiving MCVideo client.\nWhen a TMGI is announced a general purpose MBMS subchannel is created by defining an association between the identity of the general purpose MBMS subchannel (e.g., 'general purpose') and the TMGI (of the activated and announced MBMS bearer) together with the parameters (e.g., UDP port) differentiating this general purpose MBMS subchannel in this MBMS bearer. The parameters of this general purpose MBMS subchannel can be communicated to the MCVideo clients in the MBMS service area of this MBMS bearer using unicast over-the air transmission or can be pre-defined and stored in the MCVideo user profile that is downloaded to the MCVideo UE.\nWhen a MCVideo transmission starts, the participating MCVideo function can allocate an MBMS subchannel for this group by defining an association between this group (e.g. 'group id') and the TMGI (of the activated and announced MBMS bearer) with the parameters differentiating this MBMS subchannel in this MBMS bearer. The parameters of this MBMS subchannel are sent using the general purpose MBMS subchannel using the Map Group To Bearer message. The Map Group To Bearer message is repeated as long as the communication is ongoing for improving the reception probability and to allow MCVideo clients arriving late to listen to the MBMS subchannel.\nThe Map Group To Bearer provides the multicast IP destination address and the destination ports used to deliver the transmission control messages, the audio and video media packets, the FEC repair packets.\nIf an MBMS subchannel exists, the participating MCVideo function forwards the media plane control messages, received from the controlling MCVideo function via MBMS subchannel for media plane control. Only transmission control messages which are transmitted to more than one affiliated group member are forwarded to the MBMS bearer (e.g. the Media transmission notification, Transmission Idle and Transmission end notify messages). Transmission control messages can be repeated as long as the transmission is on going for improving the reception probability. The participating MCVideo function forwards the media packets, received from the controlling MCVideo function, via the MBMS subchannel for media.\nAmongst all affiliated group members under this participating MCVideo function, the participating MCVideo function is informed or is enabled to deduce the group members which do not or cannot receive the MBMS subchannels. The participating MCVideo function forwards the media packets and the media plane control messages, received from the controlling MCVideo function, to the group members which do not or cannot receive the MBMS subchannels, using unicast bearers allocated for media and media plane control respectively.\nThe participating MCVideo function can de-allocate an MBMS subchannel after a configurable period of silence in the transmission by removing the association to this group by sending the Unmap Group To Bearer message over this MBMS subchannel. The de-allocation of the MBMS subchannel frees the parameters used for differentiating this MBMS subchannel in this MBMS bearer. Therefore, the resources of a de-allocated MBMS subchannel can be reallocated for a transmission of another group.\nNOTE:\tThe participating MCVideo function will activate MBMS bearers with general QoS characteristics suitable for MCVideo service and will map MBMS subchannels for media or media plane control only to MBMS bearers that can provide the QoS required by media or media plane control.\nThe participating MCVideo function can activate an MBMS bearer that previously has been announced over a unicast bearer by sending an MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer. The MCVideo client acknowledges that it can listen to the MBMS bearer by sending a listening status report.\n",

In the present document the internal structure of the MCVideo client is illustrated in figure 4.2.2-1.\n\nThe MCVideo client is a video streaming application that utilizes a complex internal structure to handle video streaming and processing. The figure depicts the internal structure of the client, including the logic and procedures involved in video streaming.\nNOTE:\tThe real internal structure of the MCVideo client is implementation specific but a possible internal structure is shown to illustrate the logic and the procedures.\nFigure 4.2.2-1: Internal structure of the MCVideo client\nAll entities in the MCVideo client have a direct communication interface to the application and signalling plane.

The participating MCVideo function uses media plane control (non-SIP) messages when taking part in the transmission control and reception control procedures as specified in clause 6 and the use of MBMS Bearer procedures as specified in clause 10. In the sequel the term 'controlling MCVideo function' is used for the entity which performs the controlling role of an MCVideo server.\nThe following clauses describe the assumed internal structure of a participating MCVideo function and the role of the participating function in the transmission control and reception control procedures and the use of MBMS Bearer procedures..\nIn the present document the internal structure of the participating MCVideo function is illustrated in figure 4.2.3.2-1.\n\nThe figure depicts the internal structure of the MCVideo function, illustrating the logic and procedures involved in its implementation.\nNOTE:\tThe real internal structure of the participating MCVideo function is implementation specific but a possible internal structure is shown to illustrate the logic and the procedures.\nFigure 4.2.3.2-1: Internal structure of the participating MCVideo function\nAll entities in the participating MCVideo function have a direct communication interface to the application and signalling plane. The interface to the application and signalling plane carries information about SIP session initialisation and SIP session release, SDP content, etc.\nThe reference points MCVideo-3, MCVideo-4, MCVideo-7, MCVideo-8 and MCVideo-9 are described in 3GPP TS 23.281 [11].\nThe media and transmission control message distribution receives media control messages and RTP media packets to and from the MCVideo client and the controlling MCVideo function and the non-controlling MCVideo function. Media plane control messages and RTP packets are forwarded as received when unicast bearers are used. If MBMS bearers are used for transmission control messages, MBMS subchannel control messages and RTP media packets are sent to the MBMS bearer management.\nThe MBMS bearer management receives transmission control messages and RTP media packets from the media when transmission control messages and RTP media packets are sent over an MBMS bearer. MBMS bearer management also generates MBMS subchannel control message. Transmission control message, RTP media packets and MBMS subchannel control messages are sent to the GCS AS for distribution over an MBMS bearer. The GCS AS is outside the scope of the present specification.\nWhen a transmission control or reception control message or a media packet is received from an MCVideo client, in the MCVideo-4 and MCVideo-7 reference points respectively, the participating MCVideo function forwards it to the controlling MCVideo function over MCVideo-3 reference point or to the application and signalling plane. When a transmission control message or a media packet is received from the controlling MCVideo function, over MCVideo-3 reference point or the application and signalling plane, for MCVideo clients which do not use an MBMS subchannel, the participating MCVideo function forwards the transmission control message to the MCVideo client over the MCVideo-4 and MCVideo-7 reference points respectively. For MCVidep clients which use an MBMS subchannel, for transmission control messages directed to all of these MCVideo clients and for media packets, the participating MCVideo function forwards a single transmission control message or a single media packet using the MBMS subchannel over MCVideo-9 and MCVideo-8 reference points respectively.When MCVideo clients are listening to the MBMS subchannel multiple copies of the same media packet destined to each individual MCVideo client are sent by the controlling MCVideo function while the participating MCVideo function only forwards one single media packet over the MBMS bearer. Any optimizations for not sending the media packet from the controlling MCVideo function to all MCVideo clients are out of scope of the present document.\nThe participating MCVideo function can decide to apply forward error correction to the media packets to protect them against loss, and reach the QoS target. The participating MCVideo function can apply forward error correction to the media packets before transmitting them over MBMS, or it can ask the BM-SC to apply forward error correction application as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [12].\nThe participating MCVideo function specifications related to the transmission control and reception control are specified in clause 6.4 for unicast media and media plane control.\nIn the initiation of a transmission, if the MBMS bearer management in the participating MCVideo function decides to use MBMS subchannels for the media plane control messages and the media packets, the participating MCVideo function sends a Map Group To Bearer message over the MCVideo-9 reference point, for indicating the association information between the group identity of this call and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer and additional parameters necessary for the identification of this MBMS subchannels using the general purpose MBMS subchannel already associated for the transmission of this information. In the termination of a transmission the participating MCVideo function sends an Unmap Group To Bearer message for terminating the association between the MBMS subchannels in use for this transmission and the group identity.\nThe participating MCVideo function specifications related to the declaration of the association between an MBMS bearer and related parameters and the MBMS subchannels for media and media plane control are specified in clause 10.3.2 and clause 10.3.4.\n",

The SSRCs to be used in the RTCP messages over the media plane control channel for one communication are allocated at session establishment by each receiving entity.\nThe allocated RTCP SSRC is exchanged at session establishment, within an mc_transmission_ssrc 'fmtp' attribute included in the \"m=\" line defining the media plane control channel in the SDP offer or answer, in addition to the IP address and port that will be used by the receiving entity. This RTCP SSRC in the mc_transmission_ssrc 'fmtp' attribute is the SSRC value that the receiving entity expects in the RTCP header of the transmission control messages it will receive for this session, and therefore that the distant entity shall use in the RTCP header of the transmission control messages it sends in this session.\nThe SSRC allocated by a receiving entity shall be unique for that receiving entity. This ensures that there cannot be collision and the SSRC will allow to identify the session it is related to in the receiving entity without any ambiguity.\nNOTE 1:\tAs RTCP is used to transport messages on the media plane control channel, the \"m=\" line port value indicates an RTCP port. This is different from cases where an \"m=\" line is associated with an RTP-based stream, and the \"m=\" line port value indicates an RTP port.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case the media plane control channel uses a different IP address than other media described in the SDP, a media plane control channel specific \"c=\" line also needs to be associated with the \"m=\" line associated with the media plane control channel.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MCVideo client determines if the MCVideo server supports multiplexing from the <multiplex-support> element of the server configuration. The MCVideo server determines if the MCVideo client supports multiplexing from the <multiplex-support> element of the MCVideo client poc-settings. Lack of support of multiplexing can also be determined from the absence for the mc_transmission_ssrc attribute in a received SDP offer or answer.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen a local entity determines that a distant entity does not support multiplexing, the local entity will not use multiplexing with that distant entity and therefore allocates different IP addresses and/or Port numbers to the different sessions established with that distant entity, sending SIP re-INVITE as necessary if multiple offers using multiplexing have already been sent.\nNOTE 5:\tIf multiplexing is not used, any value can be used for the SSRC in the RTCP header as this field is not analyzed.\nThe format of the optional SDP fmtp attribute, when associated with the media plane control channel, is described in clause 14.\nThe example below shows an SDP media description for a media plane control channel.\nm=application 20032 udp MCVideo\na=fmtp:MCVideo mc_queueing;mc_priority=5;mc_reception_priority=5;mc_granted;mc_transmission_ssrc=12345678\n\n",

All requests for transmission are directed to the arbitrator, and the arbitrator checks the configured limits on the simultaneous transmissions, and grants or denies the request. If an MCVideo client is out of range of the current arbitrator, the MCVideo client is allowed to transmit and also become a transmission arbitrator.  If there is insufficient capacity to carry an extra transmission i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client can request that an existing transmitting MCVideo client is pre-empted; the pre-emption request is sent to the transmission arbitrator.\nIn the self arbitration approach, each MCVideo client decides for itself whether there is sufficient capacity to carry the transmission. If it determines that there is insufficient capacity i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous transmissions is reached, and from its perspective another transmitting MCVideo client has a lower priority, the requesting MCVideo client can send an override request directly to this other transmitting MCVideo client, which will either accept the override request and give way, or deny the override request.\nIn both the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach, if there is insufficient capacity to carry the communication i.e. the configured limit on the simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client can report this to the MCVideo user. The MCVideo user can decide to transmit anyway, and instruct the MCVideo client to proceed with the transmission.\n",

The MCVideo media plane control channel, and the protocols used on the control channel, is described in the present specification.\nIn an SDP offer and answer, the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute is used to indicate support of the Transmission Request message queueing mechanism, as defined in the present specification.\nIn an SDP offer, the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute indicates (using an integer value between '1' and '255') the maximum transmission priority that the offerer requests to be used with Transmission Request messages sent by the offerer. In an SDP answer, the attribute parameter indicates the maximum priority level that the answerer has granted to the offerer. The value must be equal or less than the value provided in the associated SDP offer.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute is not used within an SDP offer or answer, a default priority value is assumed.\nIn an SDP offer, the \"mc_reception_priority\" fmtp attribute indicates (using an integer value between '1' and '255') the maximum reception priority that the offerer requests to be used with Reception Request messages sent by the offerer. In an SDP answer, the attribute parameter indicates the maximum reception priority level that the answerer has granted to the offerer. The value must be equal or less than the value provided in the associated SDP offer.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the \"mc_reception_priority\" fmtp attribute is not used within an SDP offer or answer, a default reception priority value is assumed.\nIn an SDP offer, the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute parameter indicates that the offerer supports the procedure where the answerer indicates, using the fmtp attribute in the associated SDP answer, that the permission to transmit has been granted to the offerer.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute is used in an SDP offer, it does not indicate an actual request for the media transmission. The SDP \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute can be used to request the media transmission. In an SDP answer, the attribute indicates that the permission to Transmission has been granted to the offerer.\nNOTE 4:\tOnce the offerer has been granted the permission to Transmission, the offerer can perform media transmission until it receives a Transmission Revoked message, or until the offerer itself ends the media transmission by sending a Transmission end request message, as described in the present specification.\nIn an SDP offer, the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute indicates that the offerer implicitly requests for media transmission (without the need to send a Transmission Request message). In an SDP answer, the attribute parameter indicates that the answerer has accepted the implicit Transmission Request. Once the answerer grants the permission to Transmission to the offerer, the answerer will send a Transmission Granted message.\nNOTE 5:\tThe usage of the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute in an SDP answer does not mean that the answerer has granted the permission to Transmission to the offerer, only that the answerer has accepted the implicit Transmission Request.\nIn an SDP answer, the \"mc_audio_ssrc\" and \"mc_video_ssrc\" fmtp attributes indicate SSRCs values for the audio and video stream of the offerer. The values may be equal to provided values in the associated SDP offer or different if the collision is detected. If the associated SDP offer doesn’t indicate the SSRCs values, the server can determine values appropriately. These values are returned in an SDP answer only if the answerer accepts the implicit Transmission request offered in SDP.\nIn an SDP offer (resp. SDP answer), the \"mc_transmission_ssrc\" fmtp attribute indicates the SSRC that the answerer (resp. offerer) shall use in the RTCP header of Transmission Control messages sent to the offerer (resp. answerer) in this session.\nTable 12.1.2.3-1: SDP \"fmtp\" attribute for the MCVideo media plane control channel\n\nfmtp-attr-mpcp      = \"a=fmtp:\" \"MCVideo\" SP attr-param-list\nattr-param-list     =  attr-param *(COLON attr-param)\nattr-param          =  mc_queueing / mc_priority / mc_reception_priority / mc_granted / mc_implicit_request / mc_audio_ssrc / mc_video_ssrc / mc_transmission_ssrc\nmc_queueing          =  \"mc_queueing\"\nmc_priority         =  \"mc_priority=\" 1*2(DIGIT)\nmc_reception_priority = \"mc_reception_priority=\" 1*2(DIGIT)\nmc_granted          =  \"mc_granted\"\nmc_implicit_request =  \"mc_implicit_request\"\nmc_audio_ssrc\t\t=  \"mc_audio_ssrc=\" 1*(DIGIT)\nmc_video_ssrc\t\t=  \"mc_video_ssrc=\" 1*(DIGIT)\nmc_transmission_ssrc =  \"mc_transmission_ssrc\"\n\n\nEditor's Note:\tIANA registration may be required.\n",
