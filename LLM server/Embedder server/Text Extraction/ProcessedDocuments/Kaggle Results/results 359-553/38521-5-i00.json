Conformance to 38.101-5 is demonstrated by fulfilling the test requirements specified in the present document.\nThe Minimum Requirements given in TS 38.101-5 make no allowances for measurement uncertainty (MU). The present document defines test tolerances (TT). These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in 38.101-4 to create test requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.\nThe measurement results returned by the test system are compared – without any modification – against the test requirements as defined by various level of \"Shared Risk\" principle as described below.\na)\tCore specification value is not relaxed by any relaxation value (TT=0).

This decision may be correct, i.e., DUTs whose throughput is less than 95% maximum throughput being declared to fail, and DUTs whose throughput is higher or equal to 95% being declared to pass, or in-correct with opposite decision. The Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability that the decision is a correct one. The complement is the wrong decision probability (risk) D = 1-CL.\nAs described in H.2.2, the measurement of throughput could be mapped to ER (Error Ratio). When testing ER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are observed and the number of correctly and erroneously received blocks are recorded. For a \"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are observed, and a pass/fail decision is made based on the number of observed errors being above/below a threshold. This threshold is based on the targeted throughput or BLER and the design target CL. There is always some risk of a statistical variation leading to an incorrect pass/fail decision. The greater the number of samples that are recorded, the lower is the risk of such an error. The number of samples that are observed in a standard test is dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low risk of error (i.e., an acceptable high confidence level) for DUTs that just meet the specified limit.\nThe standard test works well where the target ER level is relatively high and confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a comparable order of magnitude). However, for relatively low ER testing the length of time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve a 95% confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the DUTs will in fact have a much lower true ER level than the target ER level, (in which case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence that the true ER level is lower than the limit is much smaller). On the other hand, a bad DUT which is expected to fail the requirement might have a much higher true ER level (in which case, errors occur more frequently and it can be demonstrated that the DUT is above the target ER limit with fewer samples).\nTo avoid long test time, an alternative test method called early pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error is encountered, a decision is made on whether the DUT can be passed/failed with 95% CL or the test needs to continue until another error is encountered. In the case of very good DUTs, the test can also be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error event is reached and no error event is recorded. Pass/Fail is decided based on the total number of observed samples and errors, and a statistical calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative distribution. The calculation involves one parameter, one variable and the result:\n-\tParameter: d (per step decision probability).\n-\tVariable: ne (number of observed errors).\n-\tResult: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on which one is calculated).\nThe per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each test of a large number of tests on a large number of DUTs that exactly meet the target ER limit is D=5% (and hence the CL 95%).\nIt should be noted that d is determined separately considering early pass and early fail testing.\nFor a marginal DUT (i.e., a DUT almost exactly meeting the target ER level), the unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to distinguish whether the DUT has just passed or just failed the BLER (ε→0), and can thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid this undecided result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device factor\" (M) is introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor biases the decision towards avoiding failing good DUT.\n",
