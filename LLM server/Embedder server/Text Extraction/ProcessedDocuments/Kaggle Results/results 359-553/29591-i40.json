When an event to which the NF service consumer has subscribed occurs, the NEF reports the requested information to the NF service consumer based on the event reporting information definition requested by the NF service consumer.\nThe 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Network Data Analytics Exposure architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [14]. The Media Streaming UE application data collection via the Data Collection AF is defined in 3GPP TS 26.531 [24]. The architecture for GNSS Assistance Data Collection for LCS is defined in 3GPP TS 23.273 [27].\nThe Nnef_EventExposure service is part of the Nnef service-based interface exhibited by the Network Exposure Function (NEF).\nKnown consumers of the Nnef_EventExposure service are:\n-\tNetwork Data Analytics Function (NWDAF)\n-\tData Collection Coordination Function (DCCF)\n-\tMessaging Framework Adaptor Function (MFAF)\n-\tLocation Management Function (LMF)\n-\tEvent Consumer AF in the 5GMS ASP\nThe Nnef_EventExposure service is provided by the NEF and consumed by NF service consumers (e.g. NWDAF, LMF, DCCF, MFAF, Event Consumer AF), as shown in figure 4.2.1.2-1 for the SBI representation model and in figure 4.2.1.2-2 for reference point representation model.\nThe figure depicts a reference architecture for the Nnef_EventExposure Service, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The SBI representation highlights the key elements such as the event exposure service, event data service, and event data processing service. The figure demonstrates the service's scalability and fault tolerance, with redundant paths and failover mechanisms.\nFigure 4.2.1.2-1: Reference Architecture for the Nnef_EventExposure Service; SBI representation\nThe figure depicts a reference architecture for the Nnef_EventExposure Service, illustrating the reference point representation. It includes a reference point, which is a point in the network where the event exposure is calculated. The architecture is designed to ensure that the reference point is accurate and reliable, with redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, allowing for efficient network management and control.\nFigure 4.2.1.2-2: Reference Architecture for the Nnef_EventExposure Service: reference point representation\nThe Network Exposure Function (NEF) is a functional element that provides application or user related information to the NF service consumers as defined in this specification.\nThe NEF allows the NF consumer(s) to (un)subscribe to notifications of monitoring observed event, and sends the notification to the NF consumer(s) when a subscribed event is detected.\nThe known NF service consumers are as follows:\nThe Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF), the Data Collection Coordination Function (DCCF), the Messaging Framework Adaptor Function (MFAF) or the Location Management Function (LMF):\n-\tsupports (un)subscribing to notifications of subscribed event(s) from the NEF;\n-\tsupports receiving the notifications of subscribed event(s) from the NEF.\nThe Event Consumer Application Function (Event Consumer AF):\n-\tsupports (un)subscribing to notifications of service experience information from the NEF;\n-\tsupports receiving the notifications of subscribed event(s) from the NEF.\n",

The process includes selecting a subscription type, defining the subscription parameters, and submitting the subscription request to the network. The figure provides a visual representation of the steps, making it easier to understand the process.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.2-1: Creation of a subscription\nTo subscribe to event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the NEF with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions\" as request URI as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, and the \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body.\nThe \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure shall include:\n-\ta URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notifUri\" attribute;\n-\ta Notification Correlation Identifier assigned by the NF service consumer for the requested notifications as \"notifId\" attribute; and\n-\tdescription of subscribed event information as \"eventsSubs\" attribute by using one or more \"NefEventSubs\" data.\nThe \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure may also include:\n-\tthe description of the event reporting information as \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute.\n-\ta specific Authorization AS provisioned Data Access Profile Identifier as \"dataAccProfId\" attribute, if the feature \"DataAccProfileId\" is supported and the subscribed events including \"MS_QOE_METRICS\", \"MS_CONSUMPTION\", \"MS_NET_ASSIST_INVOCATION\", \"MS_DYN_POLICY_INVOCATION\", and/or \"MS_ACCESS_ACTIVITY\".\nNOTE:\tThe optional Data Access Profile Identifier provisioned by the Authorization AS procedures are specified in clause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [28].\nThe \"NefEventSubs\" data structure shall include:\n-\tan event to subscribe to as a \"event\" attribute; and\n-\tevent filter information as \"eventFilter\" attribute associated with the event.\nThe \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute may include:\n-\tevent notification method (periodic, one time, on event detection) as \"notifMethod\" attribute;\n-\tMaximum Number of Reports as \"maxReportNbr\" attribute;\n-\tMonitoring Duration as \"monDur\" attribute;\n-\trepetition period for periodic reporting as \"repPeriod\" attribute;\n-\timmediate reporting indication as \"immRep\" attribute;\n-\tsampling ratio as \"sampRatio\" attribute;\n-\tpartitioning criteria for partitioning the UEs before performing sampling as \"partitionCriteria\" attribute if the EneNA feature is supported;\n-\tgroup reporting guard time as \"grpRepTime\" attribute;\n-\ta notification flag as \"notifFlag\" attribute if the EneNA feature is supported; and/or\n-\tnotification muting exception instructions within the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the \"notifFlag\" attribute is provided and set to \"DEACTIVATE\".\nIf the NEF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to an internal error or an error in the HTTP POST request, the NEF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nUpon successful reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions\" as request URI and \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the NEF shall create a new \"Individual Network Exposure Event Subscription\" resource, store the subscription and send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response, as shown in step 2 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1. The NEF shall include in the \"201 Created\" response:\n-\ta Location header field; and\n-\tan \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data type in the content.\nThe Location header field shall contain the URI of the created individual application session context resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".\nThe \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data type content shall contain the representation of the created \"Individual Network Exposure Event Subscription\".\nWhen the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the NEF, it represents NEF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time received in the request.\nWhen the \"immRep\" attribute is included and set to \"true\" in the subscription and the subscribed events are available, the NEF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response.\nWhen the sampling ratio attribute, as \"sampRatio\", is included in the subscription without a \"partitionCriteria\" attribute, the NEF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs. If the \"partitionCriteria\" attribute is additionally included, then the NEF shall first partition the UEs according to the value of the \"partitionCriteria\" attribute and then select a random subset of UEs from each partition according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected subsets of UEs.\nWhen the group reporting guard time, as \"grpRepTime\" attribute, is included in the subscription, the NEF shall accumulate all the event reports for the target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then, the NEF shall notify the NF service consumer using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation, as described in clause 4.2.2.4.\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the NEF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, the NEF may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute (if provided) and/or local configuration to determine its actions.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NEF accepts the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the NEF does not accept the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1 illustrates the modification of an existing subscription.\nThe figure depicts a modification of an existing subscription, showing the process of changing the subscription status. The figure includes a list of steps to follow, such as selecting the subscription, entering the new status, and confirming the changes. The figure also includes a visual representation of the subscription status, with the new status highlighted.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1: Modification of an existing subscription\nTo modify an existing subscription to event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as request URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the subscription correlation ID of the existing subscription. The \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure is included as request body as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nNOTE 1:\tAn alternate NF service consumer than the one that requested the generation of the subscription resource can send the PUT request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"notifUri\" attribute within the NefEventExposureSubsc data structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to a new NF service consumer.\nNOTE 3:\tThe \"monDur\" attribute within the NefEventExposureSubsc data structure can be modified to extend the expiry time to keep receiving notifications.\nIf the NEF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PUT request due to an internal error or an error in the HTTP PUT request, the NEF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NEF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the NEF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nUpon successful reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as request URI and \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the NEF shall update the subscription and send an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as response body containing the representation of the modified \"Individual Network Exposure Event Subscription\", or an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response, as shown in step 2 of figure 4.2.2.2.3-1.\nWhen the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the NEF, it represents NEF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time received in the request.\nWhen the \"immRep\" attribute is included and sets to \"true\" in the subscription and the subscribed events are available, the NEF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP PUT response.\nWhen the sampling ratio, as \"sampRatio\" attribute, is included in the subscription without a \"partitionCriteria\" attribute, the NEF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs. If the \"partitionCriteria\" attribute is additionally included, then the NEF shall first partition the UEs according to the value of the \"partitionCriteria\" attribute and then select a random subset of UEs from each partition according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected subsets of UEs.\nWhen the group reporting guard time, as \"grpRepTime\" attribute, is included in the subscription, the NEF shall accumulate all the event reports for the target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then, the NEF shall notify the NF service consumer using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation, as described in clause 4.2.2.4.\nWhen the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included, and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the NEF shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, the NEF may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute (if provided) and/or local configuration to determine its actions; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to \"RETRIEVAL\" in the request, the NEF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, and mute the event notification again and store available events; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the NEF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.\nIf the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NEF accepts the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the NEF does not accept the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".\nThis service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from event notifications.\nThe following procedure using the Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service operation is supported:\n-\tunsubscription from event notifications.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription from event notifications.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of an event notification system, with various components such as unsubscription buttons, event notifications, and subscription buttons. The system is designed to allow users to unsubscribe from notifications, which are typically sent to users when they receive an event. The figure shows the different types of buttons and their corresponding actions, such as unsubscription and subscription, as well as the status of the system. The system is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear labels and labels for each button to help users understand their actions.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1: Unsubscription from event notifications\nTo unsubscribe from event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as request URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the subscription correlation identifier of the existing subscription resource that is to be deleted.\nIf the NEF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP DELETE request due to an internal error or an error in the HTTP DELETE request, the NEF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NEF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NEF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nUpon successful reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as request URI, the NEF shall remove the corresponding subscription and send an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response, as shown in step 2 of figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.\nThe Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation enables the NEF to notify the NF service consumer(s) that the previously subscribed application related event occurred.\nThe following procedure using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation is supported:\n-\tnotification about subscribed events.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1 illustrates the notification about subscribed events.\nThe figure depicts a notification system for subscribed events, with a user interface (UI) for managing notifications. The system includes a list of events, a list of subscribers, and a list of notifications. The UI allows users to view, add, and delete events, as well as view the list of subscribers and notifications. The system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with a focus on providing a seamless experience for users.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1: Notification about subscribed events\nIf the NEF observes application related event(s) for which an NF service consumer has subscribed, the NEF shall send an HTTP POST request as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, with the \"{notifUri}\" as request URI containing the value previously provided by the NF service consumer within the corresponding subscription, and the \"NefEventExposureNotif\" data structure.\nThe \"NefEventExposureNotif\" data structure shall include:\n-\tnotification correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer during the subscription as \"notifId\" attribute;
