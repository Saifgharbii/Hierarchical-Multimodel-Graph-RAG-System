The figure illustrates the process of frequency control in a telecommunications network, where the TSCTSF is responsible for managing the frequency spectrum and ensuring that the network operates within the desired range. The figure also shows the use of PEC, which is a method of frequency control that allows for the exchange of power between the network and the TSCTSF.

The AF invokes the TSC and TS services via NEF when the AF is considered to not be trusted by the operator. For the trusted AF, the NEF cannot trigger the charging because the service interactions are directly from trusted AF to the TSCTSF.\n-\tSolution #6 proposed to add a new TSCTSF(CTF). The AF invokes the TSCTSF service directly or via NEF based on the whether the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator or not. The TSCTSF(CTF) charging can be supported for the enabler of TSC and TS charging when the AF is trusted party or not-trusted party.\n-\tSolution #7 proposed to trusted AF to support the times sensitive communication and time synchronization service invocation charging.
