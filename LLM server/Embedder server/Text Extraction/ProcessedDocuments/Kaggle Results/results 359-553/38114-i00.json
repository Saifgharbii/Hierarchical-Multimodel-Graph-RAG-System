                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].\nancillary equipment: electrical or electronic equipment, that is intended to be used with a receiver or transmitter\nNOTE:\tIt is considered as an ancillary equipment if:\nthe equipment is intended for use with a receiver or transmitter to provide additional operational and/or control features to the radio equipment, (e.g. to extend control to another position or location); and\nthe equipment cannot be used on a stand alone basis to provide user functions independently of a receiver or transmitter; and\nthe receiver or transmitter, to which it is connected, is capable of providing some intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub-unit of the main equipment essential to the main equipment basic functions).\nantenna port: for EMC purposes, port for connection of an antenna used for intentional transmission and/or reception of radiated RF energy, equivalent to an RF antenna connector.\nchannel bandwidth: the RF bandwidth supporting a single NR RF carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.\ncontinuous phenomena: electromagnetic disturbance, the effects of which on a particular device or equipment cannot be resolved into a succession of distinct effects (IEC 60050-161 [20]).\nexclusion band: frequency range(s) not subject to test or assessment.\nmulti-band repeater: Repeater Type 1-C whose antenna connector is associated with a transmitter and/or receiver that is characterized by the ability to process two or more passband(s) in common active RF components simultaneously, where at least one passband is configured at a different operating band than the other passband(s) and where this different operating band is not a sub-band or superseding-band of another supported operating band\nNCR-MT: the NCR-MT is defined as a function entity to communicate with a gNB via a Control link (C-link) to enable exchange of control information (e.g. side control information at least for the control of NCR-Fwd). The C-link is based on NR Uu interface.\nNCR-Fwd: the NCR-Fwd is defined as a function entity to perform the amplify-and-forwarding of UL/DL RF signal between gNB and UE via backhaul link and access link. The behavior of the NCR-Fwd will be controlled according to the received side control information from gNB.\nThe figure depicts a network-controlled repeater, which is a device that can be used to extend the range of a wireless network signal. It is designed to be placed in a location where the signal strength is weak, such as a building or a corner, and then the repeater can amplify the signal and extend it to a greater distance. This can be useful in areas where the signal is not strong enough to reach the intended location, or in areas with poor signal reception. The figure shows the repeater in a simplified model, with a central unit that can be controlled by a network manager to adjust the signal strength and extend the range of the signal.\nFigure 3.1-1: Conceptual model of network-controlled repeater\nNCR type 1-C: network-controlled repeater including both NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd operating at FR1 with requirements set consisting only of conducted requirements defined at individual antenna connectors.\nThe figure depicts the NCR type 1-C downlink and uplink interface, illustrating the various components and connections involved in the communication process.\nFigure 3.1-2: NCR type 1-C downlink and uplink interface\nNOTE 1:\tthe NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd may have the same or separate antenna connectors\nNCR type 1-H: network-controlled repeater including both NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd operating at FR1 with a requirement set consisting of conducted requirements defined at individual TAB connectors and OTA requirements defined at RIB.\nThe figure depicts the NCR type 1-H downlink and uplink interface, illustrating the various components and connections involved in the downlink and uplink transmission of a 5G network. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, with key components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure also illustrates the layered architecture of the optical backbone, with redundancy paths and core switches, ensuring failover reliability.\nFigure 3.1-3: NCR type 1-H downlink and uplink interface\nNOTE 1:\tthe NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd may have the same or separate TAB connectors.\nNCR type 2-O: network-controlled repeater including both NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd operating at FR2 with a requirement set consisting only of OTA requirements defined at the RIB.\nThe figure depicts a NCR (Network Control Room) type 2-O interface, which is a crucial component in a 5G network. It illustrates the downlink and uplink interfaces, showcasing the various components and their connections. The figure highlights the importance of proper network control and management in ensuring efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure 3.1-4: NCR type 2-O downlink and uplink interface\nNOTE 1:\tthe NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd may have the same or separate RIB.\noperating band: frequency range in which NR operates (paired or unpaired), that is defined with a specific set of technical requirements.\npassband edge: Frequency at the edge of the passband.\nport: A particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is considered as a port (see Figure 3.1-1).\nFigure 3.1 - 5: Examples of ports in a 5G network. In this figure, we see various types of ports, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 3.1-5: Examples of ports\nrepeater type 1-C: Repeater operating at FR1 with a requirement set consisting only of conducted requirements defined at individual antenna connectors.\nrepeater type 2-O: Repeater operating at FR2 with a requirement set consisting only of OTA requirements defined at the RIB.\nradiated interface boundary: operating band specific radiated requirements reference where the radiated requirements apply.\nsignal/control port: port intended for the interconnection of components of an EUT, or between an EUT and associated equipment and used in accordance with relevant functional specifications (for example for the maximum length of cable connected to it).\nsingle-band connector: Repeater type 1-C antenna connector supporting operation either in a single operating band only, or in multiple operating bands but does not meet the conditions for a multi-band connector\nspatial exclusion zone: range of angles where no tests of radiated immunity are made for repeater type 2-O (i.e. half sphere around the EUT's radiating direction).\ntelecommunication port: ports which are intended to be connected to telecommunication networks (e.g. public  switched telecommunication networks, integrated services digital networks), local area networks (e.g. Ethernet, Token Ring) and similar networks.\nNOTE:\tTelecommunication port is called \"wired network port\" in CISPR 32 [5] and ETSI EN 301 489-1 [21].\ntransient phenomena: pertaining to or designating a phenomena or a quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 [20]).\n",

This test shall be performed on a representative configuration of repeater.\nFor repeater type 2-O, the radiated emission is covered by radiated spurious emission requirement in TS 38.106 [2], conforming to the test requirement in TS 38.115-2 [4].\nThis test assesses the ability of repeater to limit unwanted emission from the enclosure port.\na)\tA test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM.329 [19] shall be used. The repeater shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads. One of the following two alternative measurement methods shall be used:\n1)\tField strength method measurement\nThe test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 5. The field strength measurements shall be performed on a test site that is validated according to the methods and requirements of CISPR 16-1-4 [25].\nUnless otherwise stated, measurements are conducted at 3 m or 10 m on an open area test site (OATS) or semi anechoic chamber (SAC) for frequencies up to 1 GHz, or at 3 m on a free space open area test site (FSOATS) or fully-anechoic room (FAR) for frequencies above 1 GHz. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done with RMS detector and with the -3 dB bandwidth of the measuring filter equal to the reference bandwidth in table 8.2.1.3-1.\nNOTE 1:\tTest site validation methods for radiated emissions tests are defined in CISPR 16-1-4 [25], clause 6 and 7. Examples of test site validation methods are listed below:\n-\t30 - 1000 MHz frequency range: Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA), Reference Site Method (RSM).\n-\t1 - 18 GHz frequency range: SVSWR standard test procedure, SVSWR reciprocal test procedure.\n2)\tSubstitution method measurement (also called a substitution method)\nMean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at which a component is detected, the repeater shall be rotated and the height of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement. The measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in the orthogonal polarization plane. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).\nNOTE 2:\tEffective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant difference of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p, as defined in ITU-R SM.329 annex 1 [19].\ne.r.p. (dBm)  EIRP (dBm)  2.15\nb)\tThe repeater shall transmit with maximum power declared by the manufacturer with all transmitters active. Set the repeater to transmit a signal as stated in clause 4.5.\nc)\tThe received power shall be measured over the frequency range from 30 MHz to FDL,low - ΔfOBUE and from FDL,high + ΔfOBUE up to 12750 MHz. For some operating bands, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5th harmonic limit of the downlink operating band, as specified in ITU-R SM.329 [19]. The video bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution bandwidth. If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver, it shall be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).\nThe frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [19] and SM.1539-1 [26].\nThe repeater type 1-C shall meet the limits below:\nTable 8.2.1.3-1: Limits for radiated emissions from Repeater\n\nThe interpretation of the results recorded in a test report for the radiated emission measurements described in the present document shall be as follows:\n-\tthe measured value related to the corresponding limit will be used to decide whether an equipment meets the requirements of the present document;\n-\tthe value of the measurement uncertainty for the measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report;\n-\tthe recorded value of the measurement uncertainty shall be, for each measurement, equal to or lower than the figures in table 8.2.1-4-1 for repeater.\nTable 8.2.1.4-1 specifies the maximum measurement uncertainty of the test system. The test system shall enable the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.\nA confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a population of test equipment.\nTable 8.2.1.4-1: Maximum measurement uncertainty (Repeater)\n\nNOTE:\tIf the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty greater than that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1, this equipment can still be used, provided that an adjustment is made follows:\nAny additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the test requirements, i.e. making the test harder to pass.\nThis procedure will ensure that a test system not compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT that would otherwise have failed a test if a test system compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1 had been used.\n",
