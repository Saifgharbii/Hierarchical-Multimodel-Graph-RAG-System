Figure 4.7.3-1 provides an example control plane flow for NR satellite access.\nThe figure depicts a 3-1 C-plane procedure for satellite access, illustrating the steps involved in accessing a satellite signal. The procedure includes the use of a C-plane, which is a key component in satellite communication systems. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the procedure, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 4.7.3-1: C-plane procedure (example for NR satellite access)\nThe detailed assumption of each step as shown in Figure 4.7.3-1 is provided in Table 4.7.3-1. The evaluation is for UL data transfer. It is understood that the evaluation results for DL data transfer can be further reduced because UE processing delay in Step 6 for DL data transfer does not need to handle UL grant receiving, and therefore can be reduced compared to the case of UL data transfer.\nNOTE: The delay values shown below do not include the waiting time for DL/UL subframe.

The following mechanisms for SS/PBCH block, SIB1 and paging are assumed for the evaluation.\nFor SS/PBCH block transmission, the following configurations are considered in evaluation in FR1.\n-\tOne SS/PBCH block occupies 4 OFDM symbols with 20 RBs in one slot.\n-\tOne or multiple SS/PBCH block(s) compose an \"SS burst set\" (SSB set).\n-\tDenote L as the number of SS/PBCH blocks in an SSB set, where L can be 1~ 64. For below 3 GHz, the maximum value of L is 4; for below 7.125 GHz, the maximum value of L is 8.\n-\tOne SSB set transmission is confined to a half radio frame (5 ms) window\n-\tThe SSB set periodicity (PSSB) can be configured to be {5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160} ms\n-\tThe following mapping is used in a half radio frame for 15 and 30 kHz SCS\n-\t2 SS/PBCH blocks are transmitted in one slot.

In the evaluation, the offset value that allows the closest SIB1 transmission to SS/PBCH block transmission is selected.\nFor paging occasion,\n-\tThe periodicity of paging occasion is the same as that of SSB set, and it is FDMed with an SS block.\nFigure 4.8.2.1-1 illustrates NR SS/PBCH block and SIB1 transmission which employs the above-mentioned mechanism.\nThe figure depicts a block diagram of the NR SS/PBCH (Single-Sideband/Passband) and SIB1 (Single-Input Single-Output) transmission in a 5G network. The diagram illustrates the block structure, including the SIB1 transmitter, the NR SS/PBCH receiver, and the SIB1 modulation scheme. The figure also shows the transmission path and the corresponding signal strength.\nFigure 4.8.2.1-1 Illustration of NR SS/PBCH block and SIB1 transmission.\nBased on the above mechanisms, the sleep ratio per slot basis and per symbol basis are given as follows,\n(4.8.2.2-1)\n(4.8.2.2-2)\nwhere  indicates the ceiling of x,  is the numerology (as defined in TS 38.211 [3], e.g., =0 for 15 kHz SCS and =1 for 30 kHz SCS), L is the number of SS/PBCH blocks in one SSB set, PSSB is the SSB set periodicity, PSIB1 is the RSMI periodicity, and .\nEvaluation results are shown in Table 4.8.2.2-1 and Table 4.8.2.2-2, respectively, for slot level and symbol level sleep ratio. It is observed that with SSB set period of 5ms, more than 80% of sleep ratio can be obtained by NR satellite access network; with SSB set period of larger than 10ms, more than 90% of sleep ratio can be obtained by NR satellite access network. Higher sleep ratio is expected with finer sleep granularity, e.g., in symbol level. Note that a subset of configurations in terms of number of SSB per set is used to derive the results.\nTherefore, NR network can achieve high sleep ratio in unloaded case.\nTable 4.8.2.2-1 NR satellite access network sleep ratio in slot level\n\nTable 4.8.2.2-2 NR satellite access network sleep ratio in symbol level\n\nBased on the above mechanisms, evaluation results of sleep duration are provided in Table 4.8.2.2-1. It is observed that with SSB set period of 160 ms, more than 150ms sleep duration can be obtained by NR satellite access network. Therefore, NR network can achieve long sleep duration in unloaded case.\nTherefore, NR meets network side energy efficiency requirement.\nTable 4.8.2.3-1 NR satellite access network sleep duration (ms) in slot level\n\n",

                            "text_content": "The sleep ratio and sleep duration for NR satellite access UEs under unloaded case are evaluated.\nFor NR, DRX is supported for UEs in idle, inactive and connected states.\nFor idle state and inactive state, the UE should monitor one paging occasion per discontinuous reception (DRX) cycle (which equals to the paging cycle), and the UE can use DRX to reduce power consumption. Before paging receiving, the SSB monitoring is needed. Also, RRM measurement(s), including intra- and inter-cell shall be performed.\nThe DRX cycle for idle state / inactive state UE consists of an \"On Duration\" during which the UE should perform SSB monitoring, paging monitoring and RRM measurement, and an “Off Duration” during which the UE can skip reception of downlink channels to save energy. It is illustrated in Figure 4.8.3.2-1.\nTherefore, the sleep ratio is determined by the length of \"On Duration\" and the length of one paging cycle.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a connected state in a distributed relaying system, specifically highlighting the DRX cycle. The cycle involves the relay nodes (RUs) and the relay switches (RSs) in a connected state, where the relay nodes are responsible for relaying the data to the relay switches, which then relay the data to the destination nodes. The figure illustrates the process of data transmission and the role of the relay nodes and relay switches in maintaining the connected state.\nFigure 4.8.3.2-1 Illustration of DRX cycle in connected state\nWhen DRX is used, the UE wakes up and receives SSB for synchronization, listens to PDCCH only on specific paging occasion defined in-terms of paging frame and subframe within period of NPC_RF radio frames defined by the DRX cycle (paging cycle) of the cell and performs RRM measurement. The UE can remain in sleep mode for remaining duration within DRX cycle.\nFor synchronization, one SSB-burst set is assumed for short paging cycle (e.g., 320ms). Further, it is assumed that synchronization signal can be located in the same slot as paging-on slot and UE can finish network synchronization before paging monitoring. For longer paging cycle, one SSB-burst can still be assumed. In addition, to improve synchronization accuracy, the case of two SSB-burst sets is also evaluated. In this case, UE needs additional time up to one SSB cycle for SSB reception.\nFor paging monitoring, a paging occasion can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. slot or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent. In the evaluation, it is assumed that one paging occasion consists of one slot. On the other hand, one paging cycle consists of one or multiple Paging Frames. One Paging Frame may contain one or multiple paging occasion(s) or starting point of a PO. In the evaluation, it is assumed that one Paging Frame contains one paging occasion and time for paging monitoring is no longer than that of one SSB burst.\nRRM measurement is based on SS/PBCH. In the evaluation, it is assumed that RRM measurement takes place in “On Duration” time, and the RRM measurement time is assumed to be 3ms for FR1 (see TS 38.133 [4]).\nIn addition to the above procedure, transition time is needed for UE to switch on / off its components. 10ms transition time is assumed for evaluation; but further reduced value is possible.\nBased on the above analysis, the idle mode sleep ratio is evaluated with the configurations shown in Table 4.8.3.2-1. It is observed that more than 90% sleep ratio is achieved in idle mode by NR device.\nTable 4.8.3.2-1 NR satellite access device sleep ratio in slot level (for idle / inactive mode)\nNOTE:\tFor SSB period, \"--\" is assumed that SSB reception is during DRX-On time.\nFor connected state, if there is no data transmission in either downlink or uplink direction, the DRX mode is switched on.\nThe DRX cycle for connected state UE consists of an “On Duration” during which the UE should perform SSB monitoring, PDCCH monitoring (reflected as DRX-onDurationTimer), and RRM measurement, and an \"Off Duration\" during which the UE can skip reception of downlink channels to save energy. Also, transition time is assumed in \"On Duration\". The connected mode sleep ratio for different DRX cycles is shown in Table 4.8.3.2-2. Therefore, NR device can achieve high sleep ratio for both idle/inactive state and connected state in unloaded case.\nTable 4.8.3.2-2 NR satellite access device sleep ratio in slot level (for connected mode)\nNOTE:\tFor SSB period, \"--\" is assumed that SSB reception is during DRX-On time.\nThe sleep duration for NR satellite access UE in idle mode is 2546ms for paging cycle of 2560ms with the assumed parameters.\nThe sleep duration of NR satellite access UE in connected state is 8627ms for paging cycle of 10240ms with the assumed parameters.\nConsequently NR satellite access device can achieve very long sleep duration in both idle mode and connected mode.\nIt is therefore concluded that NR satellite access meets device side energy efficiency requirement.\n",

Therefore, UL data packet transmission is kept during beam pair switching at different slots.\nBased on the above analysis, the UE can keep exchanging user plane packets with gNB during the mobility transitions without cell and satellite change.

The QoS evaluated is that a 32-byte packet is successfully received.\nThe Full-buffer system-level simulation approach followed by link level simulation (referred to as “full buffer system level simulation” below) has been used for the evaluation, following the methodology and principles outlined in section 7.1.3 of Report ITU-R M.2412 [9], adapted accordingly for satellite deployment.\nIn a first step this evaluation method employs a full buffer system level simulation to derive the uplink SINR distribution. In a second step link level simulation are performed to determine the uplink spectral efficiency and data rate as functions of SINR. When combined these three functions supports the calculation of the expected long-term time-frequency resources required for each SINR to support the specified traffic model.\nConnection density is in a final step conceptually derived by the system bandwidth, declared for the candidate technology, divided by the average required frequency resource. The requirement is fulfilled if the recorded connection density exceeds the 500 devices/km2, while the time resource, i.e. the packet delay, at the 99th percentile per user is less than 10 seconds and the utilized total bandwidth does not exceed 30 MHz.\nThis evaluation method is targeted to evaluate the connection density in terms of the capability of uplink data transmission. The capacity calculation is based on an assumption of ideal resource allocation among the multiple packets and users (e.g., there is no collision on resource allocation). The packet delay calculation does not consider the delays introduced by the connection access procedure. It also does not model synchronization and system information acquisition, control channel and downlink data channel performance.\n",

Detailed calibration parameters and assumptions are found in Section 6 of 3GPP TR 38.821. It should be noted that these parameters are used for calibration purpose only. It worth also noting that two additional tiers of beams for FRF 1 and three additional tiers of beams for FRF 3 are simulated for intra-satellite interference modelling. However, only the statistics of the UEs connecting to the inner 19 beams were collected (see Fig. 6.1.1.1.1 [TR 38.821] for the beam layout based on FRF configurations). For the calibration purpose, the ionospheric scintillation loss shall be considered equal to zero (i.e., the Ues are located between 20 and 60 degrees of latitude). The atmospheric absorptions loss shall be considered.\nFourteen 3GPP entities provided the calibration results, including ZTE, Thales, DOCOMO, Huawei, vivo, Nokia, CCU, ITRI, Qualcomm, Ericsson, CATT, Panasonic, CEWiT, and OPPO. The detailed assumptions and results for the calibration simulations can be found in the attached document \"B_Calibration.zip\".\nThe calibration results for the Rural eMBB-s environment with FRF1 and FRF3 are shown through Figure B-1 to Figure B-4, respectively.
