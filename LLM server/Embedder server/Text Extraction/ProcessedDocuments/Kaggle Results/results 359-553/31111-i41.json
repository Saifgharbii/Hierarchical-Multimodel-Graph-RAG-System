Any internal technical realization of either the UICC or the ME are only specified where these reflect over the interface. The present document does not specify any of the security algorithms which may be used.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, references to clauses of ETSI TS 102 223 [32] include all the clauses of that clause, unless specifically mentioned.\nThe target specification ETSI TS 102 223 [32] contains material that is outside of the scope of 3GPP requirements and the present document indicates which parts are in the scope and which are not.\nA 3GPP ME may support functionality that is not required by 3GPP, but the requirements to do so are outside of the scope of 3GPP.\n",

The operation is aborted.\nThe \"Bearer description\" provided in the command gives recommended values for parameters that the ME should use to establish the data link. However if the ME or network does not support these values, the ME selects the most appropriate values.\nThe procedures defined in ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 6.4.27.2 apply, understanding that:\n-\t\"packet data service\" means GPRS, UTRAN packet service, E-UTRAN, Satellite E-UTRAN, NG-RAN or Satellite NG-RAN,\n-\t\"activation of packet data service\" means activation of a PDP context or EPS PDN connection or PDU session.\nThe UICC provides to the terminal a list of parameters necessary to activate a packet data service. The UICC has three ways to indicate to the ME the QoS it requires:\n-\teither use a Bearer Description called \"Bearer description for GPRS/UTRAN Packet Service/E-UTRAN\", which is valid for GPRS, UTRAN packet service, E-UTRAN and Satellite E-UTRAN.\n-\tor use a Bearer Description called \"Bearer description for UTRAN Packet Service with extended parameters and HSDPA\" which is valid for a UTRAN packet service, HSDPA, E-UTRAN and Satellite E-UTRAN.\n-\tor use a Bearer Description called \"Bearer description for E-UTRAN and mapped UTRAN packet service\", which is valid for UTRAN packet service, E-UTRAN and Satellite E-UTRAN.\nFor NG-RAN and Satellite NG-RAN, Quality of Service parameters are not applicable\nUpon receiving this command, the ME shall decide if it is able to execute the command.\nIf the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\", and the UE is not configured with indication that Bearer Independent Protocol is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service (see Annex S), then the ME shall send the TERMINAL RESPONSE (ME currently unable to process command) immediately.

The operation is aborted.\nThe \"Bearer description\" provided in the command gives recommended values for parameters that the ME should use to establish the data link. However if the ME or network does not support these values, the ME selects the most appropriate values.\nIf class \"ai\" is supported, the \"Bearer description\" provided in the command shall indicate a Non-IP PDP Type in order to establish a Non-IP data link. The UICC shall provide the Network Access Name data object.\nSee ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 6.4.27.3.\nSee ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 6.4.27.4.\nAdditionally, if the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\", and the UE is not configured with indication that Bearer Independent Protocol is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service (see Annex S), then the ME shall send the TERMINAL RESPONSE (ME currently unable to process command) immediately.

The UICC shall provide the Network Access Name data object.\n\nThis clause applies if class \"e\" is supported.\nUpon receiving this command, the ME shall decide if it is able to execute the command. The UICC shall indicate whether the ME should establish the link immediately, in background mode or upon receiving the first transmitted data (on demand).\nThe UICC provides to the ME a list of parameters necessary to activate a (I-)WLAN service.\nThe ME shall attempt at least one (I-)WLAN service activation.\nUpon receiving this command, the ME shall decide if it is able to execute the command. Examples are given below, but the list is not exhaustive:\n-\tif immediate or background (I-)WLAN service activation is requested and the ME is unable to set-up a channel using the exact parameters provided by the UICC, the ME sets up the channel according to TS 24.234 [42] for a I-WLAN service activation or according to TS 24.302 [63] for a WLAN service activation and rms the UICC of the I-WLAN identifier or the WLAN identifier respectively and the modified parameters using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed with modification);\n-\tif immediate (I-)WLAN service activation is requested and the ME is unable to activate the I-WLAN service with the network using the exact parameters provided by the UICC, the ME rms the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Network currently unable to process command).

The operation is aborted;\n-\tif the command is rejected because the ME has no channel left with the requested bearer capabilities, the ME rms the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Bearer independent protocol error). The operation is aborted;\n-\tif the user does not accept the channel set-up, the ME rms the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (User did not accept the proactive command). The operation is aborted;\n-\tif the user has indicated the need to end the proactive UICC session, the ME rms the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Proactive UICC session terminated by the user). The operation is aborted;\n-\tif background mode (I-)WLAN service activation is requested, the ME allocates buffers, starts activation of (I-)WLAN service, rms the UICC and reports the channel identifier immediately using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed successfully). At the end of activation, the ME shall send a channel status event (link established or link not established - no further ).\nThe ME shall rm the UICC that the command has been successfully executed using TERMINAL RESPONSE:\n-\tif immediate (I-)WLAN service activation is requested, the ME allocates buffers, activates the (I-)WLAN service and rms the UICC and reports the channel identifier using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed successfully);\n-\tif on demand (I-)WLAN service activation is requested, the ME allocates buffers, rms the UICC and reports the channel identifier using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed successfully).\nIf the ME is able to set up the channel on the serving network, the ME shall then enter the confirmation phase described hereafter; optionally, the UICC may include in this command an alpha-identifier. The use of this alpha-identifier by the ME is described below:\n-\tif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is not a null data object, the ME shall use it during the user confirmation phase. This is also an indication that the ME should not give any other rmation to the user during the user confirmation phase. If an icon is provided by the UICC, the icon indicated in the command may be used by the terminal to rm the user, in addition to, or instead of the alpha identifier, as indicated with the icon qualifier (see clause 6.5.4);\n-\tif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is a null data object (i.e. length = '00' and no value part), this is an indication that the ME should not give any rmation to the user or ask for user confirmation;\n-\tif the alpha identifier is not provided by the UICC, the ME may give rmation to the user;\nA terminal of type ND shall ignore any alpha identifier provided together with this command. The terminal shall respond with \"command performed successfully\" upon successful completion of the command. A terminal of type ND shall also ignore any icon provided together with this command. The terminal shall respond with \"command performed successfully but requested icon could not be displayed\" upon successful completion of the command.\n-\tif the user doesn't reject the channel, the ME shall then set up a channel. A terminal of type NK or type ND may not alert the user and may open the channel without explicit confirmation by the user;\n-\tif the user does not accept the channel or rejects the channel, then the ME rms the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (user did not accept the proactive command). The operation is aborted;\n-\tif the user has indicated the need to end the proactive UICC session, the ME shall send a TERMINAL RESPONSE with (Proactive UICC session terminated by the user) result value;\n-\toptionally, during packet data service activation, the ME can give some audible or display indication concerning what is happening;\n-\tif the user stops the (I-)WLAN service activation attempt before a result is received from the network, the ME rms the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (user cleared down call before connection or network release).\nSee ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 6.4.27.6.\nSee ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 6.4.27.5.\nThe following applies if classes \"e\" and \"t\" are supported.\nAfter a successful registration to IMS specified in TS 24.229 [52] and after the ME has informed the UICC of this successful registration, the UICC may attempt to open a channel to communicate with the IMS.\n\nThe UICC will include in the OPEN CHANNEL for IMS command the IARI representing an active application installed on the UICC.  This IARI shall be known to the ME and populated in the EFUICCIARI as specified in TS 31.102 [14].\n\nThe ME shall encapsulate all subsequent SIP communications intended for the IMS application running on the UICC.  The ME shall decapsulate all subsequent messages received from the IMS application running on the UICC.  Once the application is no longer available for SIP communications the UICC shall send the CLOSE CHANNEL command for the current channel ID.\nIf network conditions changed after a successful IMS registration, upon receiving this command, the ME shall decide if it is able to execute the command. If the ME is unable to process the command (the list is not exhaustive)\n-\tif the command is unable to proceed due to the absence of an active IMS PDP/PDN context, the ME shall inform the UICC using the TERMINAL RESPONSE (network currently unable to process command) upon receipt of this failure cause, the UICC shall wait until the next IMS registration event before sending another OPEN CHANNEL for IMS command to the ME.\n-\tif the command is unable to proceed due to the inability to contact IMS, the ME shall inform the UICC using the TERMINAL RESPONSE (network currently unable to process command) upon receipt of this failure cause, the UICC shall wait until the next IMS registration event before sending another OPEN CHANNEL for IMS command to the ME.\n-\tIf the command is unable to proceed because there is no channel available, the ME shall inform the UICC using the TERMINAL RESPONSE (Bearer Independent Protocol error -  no channel available).\nThe ME shall rm the UICC that the command has been successfully executed using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed successfully)\n",

If the parameter is present and length is not null, it provides an IP address that identifies the USAT application in the address area applicable to the PDN. If local address length is null, dynamic local address allocation is required for the USAT application. If parameter is not present, the ME may use the ME default local address configuration.\nIf the UICC/ME interface transport level is present in the command, then the ME shall provide the requested transport layer protocols under the channel and shall use this object containing a set of parameters required to make the transport connection. The data that is exchanged at the UICC/ME interface in the RECEIVE DATA/SEND DATA commands are SDUs. When the USAT application sends an SDU, the transport layer within the ME is in charge to add the transport header to the SDU in order to build the Transport-PDU. When the USAT application requests to receive an SDU, the transport layer within the ME is in charge to remove the transport header of the Transport-PDU, and to forward the SDU to the USAT. If the parameter is not present, the UICC/ME interface is the bearer level (serial link or packet link), and the USAT application is in charge of the network and transport layer.\nThe Data destination address is the end point destination address of sent data. This data destination address is requested when a UICC/ME interface transport is present, otherwise it is ignored. The data destination address is a data network address (e.g. IP address).\nText Attribute applies to the Alpha Identifier. It may be present only if the Alpha Identifier is present.\n\n",

In the case that the user does not give approval for the execution of the proactive command, it shall not be executed by the ME and the terminal response \"user did not accept the proactive command\" shall be returned by the ME to the UICC;\n-\tthe user cleared down the call, before the call connected (CONNECT received from network, as defined in TS 24.008 [9]) or before the network released the call;\n-\taction in contradiction with the current timer state. This is where the UICC requests an action for a timer to be taken by the ME and the state of the timer does not allow that action;\n-\tinteraction with call control by USIM, temporary problem. This is sent by the ME to indicate that call control modified the type of request indicated in the proactive command, and that the action requested by call control encounters a temporary problem.\nPermanent problems are defined as in ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 6.7, with the addition of:\n-\tSS Return Error. This is given to the UICC when the network returns a SS error in response to a previous SS command. Specific cause values are the same as given by the network in the Return Error message;\n-\tUSSD Return Error. This is given to the UICC when the network returns a USSD error in response to a previous USSD command. Specific cause values are the same as given by the network in a Return Error message;\n-\tSMS RP-ERROR. This is given to the UICC when the network returns an error in response to the ME trying to send a short message. Specific cause values are the same as the cause value of RP-Cause in an RP-ERROR message;\n-\tinteraction with MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem. This is sent by the ME to indicate that:\nMO short message control by USIM does not allow the action corresponding to the proactive command; or\nMO short message control by USIM has modified the type of request indicated in the proactive command and that the action requested by call control encounters a permanent problem.\n",

It is then mandatory for the ME to perform the supplementary service or USSD operation in accordance with the data from the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires a supplementary service or USSD operation that is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall not perform the supplementary service or USSD operation at all.\n-\tIf, as a result of the procedure, the UICC supplies a number stored in EFECC, this shall not result in an emergency call.\nThis procedure is applicable also in the case where the call is originated over IMS and the service \"communication control for IMS by USIM\" is not available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]). If the call is originated over IMS and the service \"communication control for IMS by USIM\" is available in the USIM Service Table, only the procedure for IMS communications establishment (clause 7.3.1.9) shall be used.\nIn the case where the initial call set-up request results from a proactive command SET UP CALL:\n-\tif the call control result is \"not allowed\", the ME shall rm the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE \"interaction with call control by USIM or MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem; action not allowed\";\n-\tif the call set-up request is changed by call control in a supplementary service or USSD operation, and if the supplementary service or USSD operation is within the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall send this request to the network.

However, in that case, the TERMINAL RESPONSE shall contain the response data given in the response to ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) and a second Result TLV identical to the one given in response to the proactive command equivalent to the action requested by call control (i.e. SEND SS or SEND USSD). The mapping between the general result in the first Result TLV and the general result in the second Result TLV is given below:\nthe general result \"command performed, but modified by call control by USIM\" shall be given in the first Result TLV if the general result of the second Result TLV is '0X' or '1X';\nthe general result \"interaction with call control by USIM, temporary problem\" shall be given in the first Result TLV if the general result of the second Result TLV is '2X';\nthe general result \"interaction with call control by USIM or MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem\" shall be given in the first Result TLV if the general result of the second Result TLV is '3X';\n-\tif the call set-up request is changed by call control into a supplementary service or USSD operation, and if the supplementary service or USSD operation is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall send back a TERMINAL RESPONSE to the SET UP CALL command, without performing the supplementary service or USSD operation at all. In that case, the TERMINAL RESPONSE shall contain the response data given in the response to ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) and a second Result TLV identical to the one given in response to the proactive command equivalent to the action requested by call control (i.e. SEND SS or SEND USSD). The mapping between the general result in the first Result TLV and the general result in the second Result TLV is given below:\nthe general result \"interaction with call control by USIM or MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem\" shall be given in the first Result TLV, and the general result \"command beyond ME's capabilities\" shall be given in the second Result TLV.\nThe ME shall then follow the call set-up procedure defined in TS 24.008 [9] or the supplementary service or USSD operation procedure defined in TS 24.080 [11].\nIf the service \"call control\" is available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]), then for all supplementary service and USSD operations (including those resulting from a SEND SS or SEND USSD proactive UICC command), the ME shall first pass the supplementary service or USSD control string (corresponding to the supplementary service or USSD operation and coded as defined in TS 22.030 [2], even if this SS or USSD operation has been performed via a specific menu of the ME) to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command defined below. The ME shall also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the current serving cell.\nThe UICC shall respond in the same way as for mobile originated calls. The ME shall interpret the response as follows:\n-\tif the UICC responds with '90 00', the ME shall send the supplementary service or USSD operation with the rmation as sent to the UICC;\n-\tif the UICC responds with any status code indicating an error, the ME shall not send the supplementary service or USSD;\n-\tif the UICC responds with '93 00', the ME shall not send the supplementary service or USSD operation and may retry the command;\n-\tif the UICC provides response data, then the response data from the UICC shall indicate to the ME whether to send the supplementary service or USSD operation as proposed, not send the SS or USSD operation, send the SS or USSD operation using the data supplied by the UICC, or instead set up a call using the data supplied by the UICC. It is mandatory for the ME to perform the supplementary service or USSD operation or the call set-up request in accordance with the data from the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires a call set-up or supplementary service or USSD operation that is beyond the ME's capabilities (e.g. the UICC maps a USSD operation to a data call, and the ME does not support data calls), then the ME shall not the perform the call set-up request or supplementary service or USSD operation at all.\nIn the case where the initial SS or USSD request results from a proactive command SEND SS or SEND USSD:\n-\tif the call control result is \"not allowed\", the ME shall rm the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (\"interaction with call control by USIM or MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem; action not allowed\");\n-\tif the SS or USSD request is changed by call control in a call set-up request, then the ME shall set up the call using the data given by the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires a call set-up that is beyond the ME's capabilities (e.g. the UICC maps a USSD operation to a data call, and the ME does not support data calls), then the ME shall not set up the call at all. The ME shall send back a TERMINAL RESPONSE to the initial proactive command at the same time it would have done for the proactive command equivalent to the action requested by call control (i.e. SET UP CALL). However, in that case, the TERMINAL RESPONSE shall contain the response data given in the response to ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) and a second Result TLV identical to the one given in response to the proactive command equivalent to the action requested by call control (i.e. SET UP CALL). The mapping between the general result in the first Result TLV and the general result in the second Result TLV is the same as the one described in clause 7.3.1.1.\nIf the ME supports the Outgoing Call Information service, the ME shall update EFOCI with the supplementary service or USSD control string corresponding to the initial user request.\nThe ME shall then follow the supplementary service or USSD operation procedure defined in TS 24.080 [11] or the call set-up procedure defined in TS 24.008 [9].\nThe UICC may optionally include an alpha-identifier in the response data to the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) message, in order to rm the user at the time the response is received by the ME. The use of this alpha identifier by the ME is described below:\n-\tif the UICC responds with \"allowed, no modification\", then:\nif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is not a null data object, the ME shall use it to rm the user during the PDP/PDN context activation, PDU session establishment or call set-up;\nif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is a null data object (i.e. length = '00' and no value part), this is an indication that the ME should not modify the display corresponding to the initial user request;\nif the alpha identifier is not provided by the UICC, the ME may give rmation to the user concerning what is happening;\n-\tif the UICC responds with \"not allowed\", then:\nif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is not a null data object, the ME shall use it to rm the user. This is also an indication that the ME should not give any other rmation to the user on the reason of the barring;\nif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is a null data object (i.e. length = '00' and no value part), the ME may give rmation to the user concerning what is happening;\nif the alpha identifier is not provided by the UICC, the ME may give rmation to the user concerning what is happening.\n-\tif the UICC responds with \"allowed, with modifications\", and the modified request is within the ME's capabilities, then:\nif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is not a null data object, the ME shall use it to rm the user. The ME shall then not display the destination address or SS string given by the UICC. This is also an indication that the ME should not give any other rmation to the user on the changes made by the UICC to the initial user request;\nif the alpha identifier is provided by the UICC and is a null data object (i.e. length = '00' and no value part), this is an indication that the ME should not give any rmation to the user on the changes made by the UICC to the initial user request. The ME shall not display the destination address or SS string given by the UICC. The ME should not modify the display corresponding to the initial user request;\nif the alpha identifier is not provided by the UICC, the ME may indicate to the user that the initial user request has been changed.\n-\tif the UICC responds with \"allowed, with modifications\" to a user-initiated request (i.e. a request not initiated by a proactive command), and the modified user request is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME may give rmation to the user on the modified request and the fact that the modified request is beyond the ME's capabilities, optionally using the alpha identifier, if one is provided by the UICC;\n-\tif the UICC responds with \"allowed, with modifications\" to a request by a proactive command SET UP CALL, SEND SS, SEND USSD or OPEN CHANNEL where GPRS is selected, and the modified request is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall not give any rmation to the user on the fact that the modified request is beyond the ME's capabilities, and shall give a TERMINAL RESPONSE to the proactive command (i.e. SET UP CALL, SEND SS, SEND USSD or OPEN CHANNEL) as detailed in clauses 7.3.1.1, 7.3.1.2 and 7.3.1.3. The responsibility to rm the user in this case lies with the UICC application which sent the proactive command.\nA terminal of type ND shall ignore any alpha identifier provided together with the response data to the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) message.\nThe procedure defined in ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 7.3.1.4 for calls applies. In addition, it shall apply in the same way for supplementary service operations, the supplementary service control string being checked as if it was a called number.\nThe ME shall check the number (or the supplementary service control string) in accordance with TS 22.101 [34].\nWhen the called address is an IMS URI, the ME shall check the destination address using the FDN stored in EFFDNURI, in addition to the EFFDN entries, following the same principle as defined in the Fixed Dialling Number description in TS 22.101 [34] applied to URIs, and as described in TS 31.102[14] clause 4.2.97.\nThe procedure defined in ETSI TS 102 223 [32] clause 7.3.1.5 for calls applies. In addition, it shall apply in the same way for supplementary service operations, the supplementary service control string being checked as if it was a called number.\nThe ME shall check the number (or the supplementary service control string) in accordance with TS 22.101 [34].\nWhen the called address is an IMS URI, the ME shall check the destination address using the BDN stored in EFBDNURI, in addition to the EFBDN entries, following the same principle as defined in the Barring Dialling Number description in TS 22.101 [34] applied to URIs, and as described in TS 31.102[14] clause 4.2.98.\nDirection: ME to UICC.\nThe command header is specified in TS 31.101 [13].\nCommand parameters/data.\n\n\n-\tDevice identities: the ME shall set the device identities to:\nsource:\tME;\ndestination:\tUICC.\n-\tAddress or SS string or USSD string or PDP context activation parameters or EPS PDN connection activation parameters or IMS URI or PDU session establishment parameters: only one data object shall be sent to the UICC:\nfor a call set-up, the address data object is used and holds the Called Party Number, as defined in TS 24.008 [9], to which the ME is proposing setting up the call;\nfor a supplementary service, the SS string data object is used and holds the corresponding supplementary service;\nfor a USSD operation, the USSD string data object is used and holds the corresponding USSD control string;\nUSIM Applications and MEs should take into account that early implementations of USAT use the SS string data object for coding of USSD control strings (instead of the USSD string data object). This behaviour is only possible for USSD control strings consisting of digits (0-9,*,#). The UICC can identify MEs having this early implementation by evaluating the indication \"USSD string data object supported in Call Control\" in the TERMINAL PROFILE. The ME can identify USIMs having this early implementation by evaluating the indication \"USSD string data object supported in Call Control\" in the USIM Service Table.\nFor a PDP context activation, the Activate PDP context request parameters are used, as defined in TS 24.008 [9]. Except for the following parameters:\n-\tRequested QoS;\n-\tAccess Point Name; and\n-\tProtocol configuration options,\nthe UICC should not modify any other parameters included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message as defined in TS 24.008 [9] to avoid that the UE sends a value of any of these parameters that is not compliant to TS 24.008 [9];\nfor an EPS PDN connection activation, the PDN Connectivity Request parameters are used, as defined in TS 24.301 [46]. Except for the following parameters:\n-\tAccess Point Name; and\n-\tProtocol configuration options,\nthe UICC should not modify any other parameters included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as defined in TS 24.301 [46] to avoid that the UE sends a value of any of these parameters that is not compliant to TS 24.301 [46];\nfor an IMS communication establishment, the IMS Request-URI field is used and the IMS URI data object holds the SIP URI or tel URI, as defined in TS 24.229[52], to which the ME is proposing setting up the communication. If the URI is longer than the maximum length that can be transmitted to the UICC, then the URI shall be truncated to the maximum length that can be transmitted to the UICC and the request shall contain a URI truncated tag.\nfor a PDU session establishment, the PDU Session Establishment Request parameters are used, as defined in TS 24.501 [70]. Except for the following parameters:\n-\tSM PDU DN request container; and\n-\toperator specific parameters in Extended Protocol configuration options,\nthe UICC should not modify any other parameters included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message as defined in TS 24.501 [70] to avoid that the UE sends a value of any of these parameters that is not compliant to TS 24.501 [70].\n-\tCapability configuration parameters: Only used for a call set-up, this contains the Bearer capabilities that the ME is proposing to send to the network. The first capability configuration parameters corresponds to the bearer capability 1 rmation element of a mobile originating SETUP message, as defined in TS 24.008 [9]. The second capability configuration parameters correspond to the bearer capability 2 rmation element of a mobile originating SETUP message, as defined in TS 24.008 [9]. If no capability configuration parameters are present, this shall indicate a speech call.\n-\tSubaddress: Only used for a call set-up, this contains the called party subaddress that the ME is proposing to send to the network. If one is not present, this shall indicate that the ME is proposing not to send this rmation element to the network.\n-\tLocation rmation: This data object contains the identification (MCC, MNC, LAC/TAC, Cell Identity) of the current serving cell of the UE. The comprehension required flag of this data object in this command shall be set to '0'. This data object shall be present if the call is performed over GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN, Satellite E-UTRAN, NG-RAN or Satellite NG-RAN.\n-\tMedia Type: This data object indicates the type of media the ME is proposing using to set up the communication. If the type of media to be used by the ME is one of those listed in the Terminal Profile and if the \"Media Type support\" service is allocated and activated in the USIM or ISIM Service Table, the Media Type data object shall be present.\n-\tURI truncated: This data object indicates that the URI in the request was truncated because too long to be transmitted to the UICC.\nResponse parameters/data.\nIt is permissible for the UICC to provide no response data, by responding with SW1/SW2 = '90 00'. If the UICC does not provide any response data, then this shall have the same meaning as \"allowed, no modification\".\n\n\n-\tCall control result:\nContents:\n-\tThe command that the UICC gives to the ME concerning whether to allow, bar or modify the proposed call (or supplementary service operation);\nCoding:\n-\t'00' = Allowed, no modification;\n-\t'01' = Not allowed;\n-\t'02' = Allowed with modifications.\n-\tAddress or SS string or USSD string or PDP context/EPS PDN connection activation parameters or IMS URI or PDU session establishment parameters: Only one data object may be included if the UICC requests the call (or supplementary service or USSD operation or PDP context/EPS PDN connection activation or IMS communication establishment or PDU session establishment parameters) details to be modified:\nfor a call set-up, if the address data object is not present, then the ME shall assume the Dialling number is not to be modified;\nif the SS string data object or address data object is present and the ME receives wild values according to TS 31.102 [14], then the ME shall not process the command.\nFor a supplementary service, if the SS string data object is not present, then the ME shall assume that SS is not to be modified;\nfor a USSD operation, if the USSD string data object is not present, then the ME shall assume that the USSD operation is not to be modified;\nfor a PDP context activation, if the PDP context activation parameters object is not present, then the ME shall assume that the PDP context activation is not to be modified;\nfor an EPS PDN connection activation, if the EPS PDN connection activation parameters object is not present, then the ME shall assume that the EPS PDN connection activation is not to be modified;\nfor an IMS communication establishment, if the IMS URI data object is not present, then the ME shall assume that neither the SIP URI nor the tel URI are to be modified.\nfor a PDU session establishment, if the PDU session establishment parameters object is not present, then the ME shall assume that the PDU session establishment is not to be modified.\n-\tCapability configuration parameters: Only used for a call set-up, this data object is only required if the USIM application requests the call details to be modified. The first capability configuration parameters corresponds to the bearer capability 1 rmation element of a mobile originating SETUP message, as defined in TS 24.008 [9]. The second capability configuration parameters corresponds to the bearer capability 2 rmation element of a mobile originating SETUP message, as defined in TS 24.008 [9]. If the capability configuration parameters are not present, then the ME shall assume the parameters are not to be modified.\n-\tSubaddress: Only used for a call set-up, this data object is only required if the USIM application requests the call details to be modified. If the subaddress is not present, then the ME shall assume the called party subaddress is not to be modified. If the subaddress supplied by the USIM application is a null data object, then the ME shall not provide a called party subaddress to the network. A null data object shall have length = '00' and no value part.\n-\tAlpha identifier: this data object is only required if the UICC requests a particular indication to be given to the user. The handling of this data object by the ME is described in clause 7.3.1.3. The comprehension required flag of this data object shall be set to '0'.\n-\tBC repeat indicator: indicates how the associated bearers shall be interpreted. The change of bearer occurs on a network event. This BC repeat indicator is conditioned to the presence of the second capability configuration parameters and is coded as defined in TS 24.008 [9].\n-\tMedia Type: this data object is only required if the UICC requests the media type of the call to be modified. If the Media Type is not present then the ME shall assume the media type of the call is not to be modified.\nIt is mandatory for the UICC to provide at least one of the optional data objects if it has set the Call control result to \"allowed with modifications\".\nIf the service \"call control on GPRS by USIM\" is available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]), then for all PDP Context activation (including those resulting from a OPEN CHANNEL proactive UICC command where GPRS is selected), the ME shall first pass the corresponding Activate PDP Context message (see TS 24.008 [9]) to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command defined below. The ME shall also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the current serving cell.\nWhen the ME performs an emergency PDP context activation, the ME shall not send the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command to the UICC.\nThe UICC shall respond in the same way as for mobile originated calls. The ME shall interpret the response as follows:\n-\tif the UICC responds with '90 00', the ME shall send the Activate PDP Context message with the rmation as sent to the UICC;\n-\tif the UICC responds with '93 00', the ME shall not the Activate PDP Context message and may retry the command;\n-\tif the UICC provides response data, then the response data from the UICC shall indicate to the ME whether to send the Activate PDP Context message as proposed, not send the Activate PDP Context message or send the Activate PDP Context message using the data supplied by the UICC. It is mandatory for the ME to perform the PDP Context Activation in accordance with the data from the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires PDP Context Activation that is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall not perform PDP Context Activation at all.\nIn the case where the initial PDP Context Activation request results from a proactive command OPEN CHANNEL where GPRS is selected:\n-\tif the call control result is \"not allowed\", the ME shall rm the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (\"interaction with call control by USIM or MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem; action not allowed\");\n-\tif the PDP Context Activation data is changed by call control, then the ME shall activate the PDP context using the data given by the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires a PDP Context Activation that is beyond the ME's capabilities (e.g. the UICC requests a QoS that the ME cannot handle ), then the ME shall not activate the PDP context at all.\nIf the service \"call control on EPS PDN connection by USIM\" is available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]), then for all EPS PDN connection activation (including those resulting from a OPEN CHANNEL proactive UICC command where E-UTRAN/Satellite E-UTRAN is selected), the ME shall first pass the corresponding PDN Connectivity Request message (see TS 24.301 [46]) to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command defined above. The ME shall also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the current serving cell.\nWhen the ME performs an emergency EPS PDN connection activation, the ME shall not send the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command to the UICC.\nThe UICC shall respond in the same way as for mobile originated calls.

It is mandatory for the ME to perform the EPS PDN Connection Activation in accordance with the data from the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires EPS PDN Connection Activation that is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall not perform EPS PDN Connection Activation at all.\nIn the case where the initial PDN Connectivity Request results from a proactive command OPEN CHANNEL where E-UTRAN/Satellite E-UTRAN is selected:\n-\tif the call control result is \"not allowed\", the ME shall rm the UICC using TERMINAL RESPONSE (\"interaction with call control by USIM or MO short message control by USIM, permanent problem; action not allowed\");\n-\tif the EPS PDN Connection Activation data is changed by call control, then the ME shall activate the EPS PDN Connection using the data given by the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires a EPS PDN Connection Activation that is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall not activate the EPS PDN Connection at all.\nIf the service \"communication control for IMS by USIM\" is available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]), then for all IMS communication establishment, the ME shall first pass the corresponding IMS Request-URI contained in SIP INVITE message  (see TS24.229 [52]) to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command defined above. The ME shall also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the current serving cell if the IMS communication is established over GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN, Satellite E-UTRAN, NG-RAN or Satellite NG-RAN. If the type of media to be used by the ME is one of those listed in the Terminal Profile and if the \"Media Type support\" service is allocated and activated in the USIM or ISIM Service Table, the ME shall pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the media type of the SIP communication session it is setting up.\nThis procedure replaces the call control by USIM using the Address TLV (clause 8.1) when the call is originated over IMS and the service \"communication control for IMS by USIM\" is available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]).\nWhen the ME detects that an IMS emergency call is being initiated, the ME shall set up an emergency call without sending the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command to the UICC.\nThe UICC shall respond in the same way as for mobile originated communications. The ME shall interpret the response as follows:\n-\tif the UICC responds with '90 00', the ME shall send the SIP INVITE message with the rmation as sent to the UICC;\n-\tif the UICC responds with '93 00', the ME shall not send SIP INVITE message and may retry the command;\n-\tif the UICC provides response data, then the response data from the UICC shall indicate to the ME whether to send the SIP INVITE message as proposed, not send the SIP INVITE message  or send the SIP INVITE message using the IMS-Request URI supplied by the UICC. It is mandatory for the ME to perform the SIP INVITE request in accordance with the data from the UICC, if it is within the ME's capabilities to do so. If the UICC requires SIP INVITE request that is beyond the ME's capabilities, then the ME shall not send SIP INVITE request at all.\nIf the service \"call control on PDU session by USIM\" is available in the USIM Service Table (see TS 31.102 [14]), then for all PDU session establishment (including those resulting from a OPEN CHANNEL proactive UICC command where NG-RAN or Satellite NG-RAN is selected), the ME shall first pass the corresponding PDU Session Establishment Request message (see TS 24.501 [70]) to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command defined above. The ME shall also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the current serving cell.\nWhen the ME performs an emergency PDU session establishment, the ME shall not send the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command to the UICC.\nThe UICC shall respond in the same way as for mobile originated calls.

For the TERMINAL RESPONSE to the UICC, the responses from the MT and the TE have to be combined as follows:\n-\tThe MT shall check if it is able to set up the events it supports itself. If the MT is currently unable to process command or if the set up of the events would fail, the MT shall send this result in the TERMINAL RESPONSE without forwarding the command to the TE.\n-\tIf the MT is capable of setting up the MT events, the list of TE events shall be forwarded to the TE and the TE shall send its TERMINAL RESPONSE.\n-\tIf the TE command was successful, the MT shall set up its events and report that the command was performed in the TERMINAL RESPONSE. If the MT or the TE or both have performed the command with partial comprehension or with missing information, this shall be reflected in the TERMINAL RESPONSE; if one reported partial comprehension and the other missing information, the MT response takes precedence.\n-\tIf the TE reports that it is currently unable to process command or the command failed, the MT shall report this in the TERMINAL RESPONSE.\n-\tREFRESH shall be routed to all entities supporting the command to inform them about modified Efs; only the MT shall perform other activities indicated in the command (e.g. UICC reset). For the TERMINAL RESPONSE to the UICC, the responses from the MT and the TE have to be combined as follows:\n-\tThe MT shall check if it is able to perform the REFRESH. If the MT is currently unable to process the command or the command would fail, the MT shall send this result in the TERMINAL RESPONSE without forwarding the command to the TE.\n-\tIf the MT is capable of performing the REFRESH, the command shall be forwarded to the TE and the TE shall send its TERMINAL RESPONSE, but if there is a refresh action to be performed by the MT (e.g. USIM initialisation), the MT shall send its response to the TE's TERMINAL RESPONSE only after the refresh action has started to avoid that the TE tries to access the UICC before the refresh action.\n-\tIf the TE command was successful, the MT shall perform the REFRESH and report that the command was performed in the TERMINAL RESPONSE. If the MT or the TE have performed the command with a limitation (partial comprehension, missing information, additional Efs read, requested icon could not be displayed or USIM/ISIM was not active) this shall be reflected in the TERMINAL RESPONSE; if both reported different limitations, the MT response takes precedence.\n-\tIf the TE reports that it is currently unable to process command or the command failed, the MT shall report this in the TERMINAL RESPONSE.\n-\tOPEN CHANNEL shall be routed according to the indicated bearer type. To avoid conflicts in channel identifier assignment, the MT shall replace the destination device identity by an available channel identifier and the entity providing the bearer type shall use this channel identifier in its response.\n-\tSubsequent BIP commands shall be routed according to the channel identifier.\n",
