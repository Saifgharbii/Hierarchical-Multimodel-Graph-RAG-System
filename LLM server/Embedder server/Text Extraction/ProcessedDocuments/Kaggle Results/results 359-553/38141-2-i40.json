For conformance testing the requirements are translated to the input or output of a co-location test antenna (CLTA).\nA CLTA is a practical antenna which can be used to test conformance to the co-location requirements.\nA co-location test antenna is a practical passive antenna that is used for conformance testing of the co-location requirements and is based on the definition of the co-location reference antenna. A CLTA shall comply with the requirements specified in table 4.12.2.2-1.\nTranslation of the requirements to other test antennas are not precluded but suitable translations between the co-location reference antenna and test antenna must be provided to demonstrate that the method is within the specified MU.\nNOTE:\tThe currently defined CLTAs are suitable for testing BS type 1-O implemented with a planar antenna array. The method for testing BS with other antenna array implementations is not covered by the present release of this specification.\nTable 4.12.2.2-1: CLTA characteristics\n\nThe alignment between the NR BS under test and the co-location test antenna is described in table 4.12.2.3-1 and figure 4.12.2.3-1. The same physical alignment applies to in-band and out-of-band co-location requirements.\nTable 4.12.2.3-1: CLTA alignment tolerances\n\nThe figure depicts the alignment of a Radio Base Station (NR BS) and a Cognitive Load Aggregation Terminal (CLTA) in a 5G network. The diagram illustrates the physical layout of the network, with the NR BS positioned at the center and the CLTA at the bottom. The figure highlights the importance of proper alignment to ensure efficient signal transmission and reduce interference.\nFigure 4.12.2.3-1: Alignment of NR BS and CLTA\n",

In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the BS channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE). The OTA Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink operating band plus the frequency ranges ΔfOBUE above and ΔfOBUE below each band. OTA Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions requirement.\nThe maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the operating band edge is ΔfOBUE. The value of ΔfOBUE is defined in table 6.7.1-1 for BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O for the NR operating bands.\nTable 6.7.1-1: Maximum offset ΔfOBUE outside the downlink operating band\n\nThe OTA unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured using TRP, directional requirements or co-location requirements as described per requirement.\nThere is in addition a requirement for OTA occupied bandwidth.\n",

In addition, for a RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements shall apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for a multi-band RIB, the requirements shall apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.\nFor BS type 2-O, for a RIB operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the requirements apply to the frequencies starting from the edge of the contiguous transmission bandwidth. In addition, for a RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block gap.\nThe minimum requirement for BS type 1-O is defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause 9.7.4.2.\nThe minimum requirement for BS type 2-O is defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause 9.7.4.3.\nThis test measures the emissions of the BS, close to the assigned channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the BS is in operation.\nTest environment: normal; see annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.\nBase Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:\n-\tBRFBW, MRFBW and TRFBW in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;\n-\tBRFBW_T'RFBW and B'RFBW_TRFBW in multi-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.\nDirections to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).\nThe following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. When calibrated and operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 [29] the measurement methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the test facility.\n1)\tPlace the BS at the positioner.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the BS with the test system.\n3)\tThe measurement devices characteristics shall be:\n-\tmeasurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.4.5.\n-\tdetection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.\nAs a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.2-1 for FR1 and Table 4.1.2.2-2 for FR2.\n4)\tFor single carrier operation, set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared rated carrier output power (Prated,c,TRP).\nFor a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation, use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.\n5) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).\n6)\tSweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges with the specified measurement bandwidth.\n7)\tRepeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid needed for TRPEstimate (see annex I).\n8)\tCalculate TRPEstimate using the measurements made in step 6.\n9) For BS type 1-O and multi-band RIB and single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.\nThe emission measurement result shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3, where:\n-\tf is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is the offset to the frequency ΔfOBUE MHz outside the downlink operating band.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor a multi-band RIB inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with Wgap < 2*ΔfOBUE, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The test requirement for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in the tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor a multi-band RIB, the operating band unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is applied in the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted and\n-\tIn case the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted is less than 2*ΔfOBUE, f_offsetmax shall be the offset to the frequency ΔfOBUE MHz outside the outermost edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.\n-\tIn other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (fmax), shall apply from ΔfOBUE MHz below the lowest frequency, up to ΔfOBUE MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted.\nFor a multicarrier single-band RIB or a single-band RIB configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified frequency band.\nIn addition inside any sub-block gap for a single-band RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub block is specified in the tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n6.7.4.5.1.1\tWide

For general description of co-location requirements, refer to clause 4.12.\nThe co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted output(s).\n6.7.5.5.4.2\tProcedure\n1)\tSelect and place the NR BS and CLTA as described in clause 4.12, with parameters as specified in table 4.12.2.2-1 and table 4.12.2.3-1.\n2)\tSeveral CLTAs might be required to cover the whole co-location spurious emission frequency ranges.\n3)\tPlace test antenna in reference direction at far-field distance, aligned in all supported polarizations (single or dual) with the NR BS as depicted in annex E.1.3.\n4)\tThe test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same frequency range as the NR BS for co-location spurious emission test case.\n5)\tConnect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as depicted in annex E.1.3.\n6)\tOTA co-location spurious emission is measured as the power sum over all supported polarizations at the CLTA conducted output(s).\n7)\tThe measurement device (signal analyzer) characteristics shall be:\n-\tDetection mode: True RMS.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.2-1.\n8)\tSet the BS type 1-O to transmit:\n-\tSet the NR BS to transmit maximum power according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.\n-\tFor the NR BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation, set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured.\n9)\tMeasure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified measurement bandwidth.\nIn addition, for multi-band RIB, the following steps shall apply:\n10)\tFor multi-band RIB and single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.\n6.7.5.5.5.1\tTest requirement for BS type 1-O\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same class.\nNOTE:\tFor co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.\nThis requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9, in TS 38.104 [2], the power levels are specified at the CLTA output.\nThe output of the CLTA of any spurious emission shall not exceed the test limit in table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1.\nFor a multi-band RIB, the exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.7.5.5.5.1-1: BS type 1-O OTA spurious emissions limits for BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 do not apply for the frequency range extending ΔfOBUE immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see table 5.2-1 in TS 38.104 [2]). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [27].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 in TS 38.104 [2] would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\n",

The performance requirements assume that the precedent preamble of MsgA is correctly detection. The performance requirements of assume no HARQ retransmission.\nThese requirements are applicable for wide area and medium range BS that support 2-step RA type. The requirements are not applied for a local area BS that supports 2-step RA type.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.\nFor BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 [2] clause 11.2.1.9.\nFor BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 [2] clause 11.2.1.4.\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect MsgA PUSCH under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment:\tNormal, see annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested:\tM; see clause 4.9.1.\nRF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: MBW Channel CA; see clause 4.9.1.\nDirection to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).\n1)\tPlace the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in annex E.3.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the BS with the test system.\n3)\tSet the BS in the declared direction to be tested.\n4)\tConnect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).\n5)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table 8.2.9.4.2-1.\nTable 8.2.9.4.2-1: Test parameters for testing MsgA PUSCH for 2-step RA type\n\n6)\tThe channel emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex J. Unless stated otherwise, the MIMO correlation matrices for the gNB are defined in annex J.2.3  for low correlation.\n7)\tAdjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.2.9.5.1 and 8.2.9.5.2 for BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O respectively, and that the SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.\nThe power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.2.9.4.2-2.\nTable 8.2.9.4.2-2: AWGN power level at the BS input\n\n8)\tThe test signal generator sends a MsgA including a preamble and PUSCH signal and the receiver tries to detect the MsgA signal contents. The MsgA signal is sent with timing offset as described below. The following statistics are collected: the number of incorrectly decoded MsgA PUSCH transmitted during the MsgA signal transmission.\nThe timing offset base value for MsgA signal with 15 kHz SCS is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.2 us for BS type 1-O with 15 kHz SCS, until the end of the tested range, which is 3.8 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-1.\n\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 8.2.9.4.2-1: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 1-O with 15 kHz SCS,\" depicts a timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission in a 5G network. The figure illustrates the timing offset scheme for a BS type 1-O with 15 kHz SCS, which is a key component in the 5G network architecture. The scheme is designed to ensure reliable and efficient transmission of data, with the timing offset being a critical factor in the overall system performance.\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-1: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 1-O with 15 kHz SCS\nThe timing offset base value for MsgA signal with 30 kHz is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1 us for BS type 1-O with 30 kHz SCS, until the end of the tested range, which is 2 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-2.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 8.2.9.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 1-O with 30 kHz SCS,\" depicts a timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission in a 5G network. The figure illustrates the timing offset scheme for a specific transmission type, specifically for a BS type 1-O with a 30 kHz SCS. The scheme is crucial for ensuring the proper timing of the transmission, which is essential for the efficient operation of the 5G network.\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 1-O with 30 kHz SCS\nThe timing offset base value for MsgA signal with 60 kHz is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1 us for BS type 2-O with 60 kHz SCS, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.6 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-3.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 8.2.9.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 2-O with 60 kHz SCS,\" depicts a timing offset scheme for a specific transmission method. The figure illustrates the timing offset scheme for a message transmission between a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE) in a 2-O network. The scheme is designed to ensure reliable and efficient transmission of data, with a 60 kHz SCS (Signal to Common-Signal) clock synchronization. The figure provides a visual representation of the timing offset scheme, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the communication system.\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 2-O with 60 kHz SCS\nThe timing offset base value for MsgA signal with120 kHz is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1 us for BS type 2-O with 120 kHz SCS, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.5 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-4.\nThe given telecommunication figure depicts a timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for a BS type 2-O with 120 kHz SCS.

For AWGN, TDLC300-100, TDLA30-10,  TDLA30-300, TDLA30-650, and TDLA10-650, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.\nTable 8.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN, TDLC300-100, TDLA30-10, TDLA30-300, TDLA30-650 and TDLA10-650\n\nThe test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1 and A.6-2.

This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed preambles.\nThe figure depicts a PRACH preamble test pattern, which is a key component of a 5G network's radio interface. The pattern is used to test the functionality of the radio interface and ensure that it is functioning correctly. The figure shows the different components of the PRACH preamble, including the start symbol, stop symbol, and the carrier frequency. The presence of the carrier frequency is crucial for the proper functioning of the radio interface in a 5G network.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern\nUnless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is presented in Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.\nThe figure depicts a timing offset scheme for the PRACH preamble format 0, which is used in 5G communication systems. The scheme is crucial for ensuring accurate timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. The figure illustrates the timing offset values for each phase of the preamble, which are essential for the proper functioning of the communication system.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0\nUnless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0.

The scheme is used to adjust the timing offset of the preamble, ensuring that the signal is transmitted at the correct time.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1 A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 using 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz, and 120 kHz SCS\nFor test requirement specified in Table 8.4.1.6.2-1, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.48us, until the end of the tested range, which is 4.8us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format C2 is presented in Figure 8.4.1.4.2-4.\nThe figure depicts a timing offset scheme for the PRACH preamble format C2, which is used in 5G communication systems. The scheme is crucial for ensuring accurate timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. The figure illustrates the timing offset in relation to the carrier frequency, with the offset represented by the vertical axis and the carrier frequency represented by the horizontal axis. The scheme is based on the assumption that the carrier frequency is constant, and the offset is adjusted to compensate for any variations in the carrier frequency. This scheme is used in 5G communication systems to ensure reliable and accurate timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-4: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format C2\n\nFor test requirements with 480 kHz SCS, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A2, B4, and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.4us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0.

The scheme involves a 480 kHz SCS clock, which is used to synchronize the timing of the preamble with the carrier frequency. This scheme ensures that the preamble is transmitted at the correct time, allowing for accurate timing synchronization in the PRACH protocol.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-5: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A2, B4, and C2 using 480 kHz SCS\n\nPfa shall not exceed 0.1%.

The RF conditions inside the chamber are absorptive and capable of dissipating the power of the BS when radiating. A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field response is measured. For this method test components are exposed to the full temperature range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc. may change as a function of temperature.\nUsing the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near filed) test range to obtain Pmax,c,EIRP.\nThe figure B.7.2-1 illustrates a measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy using the difference method. It shows a setup with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 100-ohm coaxial cable, and a 100-ohm coaxial cable, with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 100-ohm coaxial cable, and a 100-ohm coaxial cable, with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 100-ohm coaxial cable, and a 100-ohm coaxial cable, with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 100-ohm coaxial cable, and a 100-ohm coaxial cable, with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 100-ohm coaxial cable, and a 100-ohm coaxial cable, with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 100-ohm coaxial cable, and a 100-ohm coaxial cable, with a 100-ohm coaxial cable, a 1\nFigure B.7.2-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy using difference method\nMeasurements from the test antenna/probe are taken under nominal conditions and extreme conditions to calculate (Δsample). The difference between the nominal and extreme conditions (Δsample) is then used along with the nominal EIRP measurement (Pmax,c,EIRP) made in the appropriate far field or near field chamber and compared against the extreme requirement. As follows:\nPmax,c,EIRP, extreme = Pmax,c,EIRP + Δsample.\nMeasure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.\n\n\n\nThe test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification TS 38.104 [2] using the test tolerances (TT) defined here. When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.\nThe TTOTA values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TTOTA values may sometimes be set to zero.\nThe TTOTA values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).\nNote that a formula for applying TTOTA values is provided for all OTA tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined TTOTA value in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.\n",

Pre-scan does not provide an accurate TRP estimate or over-estimate of TRP. Pre-scan is a fast but coarse method that is used to identify the spurious emission frequencies with emission power as described in annex I.13. A sequential measurement is then made at the emission frequencies, to assess the TRP as described in annex I.2 to annex I.9.\nWhen making TRP measurements the alignment between EUT and measurement antenna is important to achieve expected measurement uncertainty:\n1.\tThe measurement antenna needs to be aligned tangential to the measurement surface forming a sphere around the EUT, in order to correctly measure the TRP properly.\n2.\tTest methods described in clauses I.5.1, I.5.2, I.10, I.11 and I.12 require angular alignment between the selected measurement grid and EUT radiation pattern in order to measure peak values in the main beams.

Using the data from these two mandatory cuts, a conditional pattern multiplication can be used.\n3)\tThe third optional cut is a vertical cut orthogonal to the first and the second cut.\nWhen alignment is not required, the cuts can be aligned arbitrarily.\nOnce the number and the orientation of the cuts are decided, the total EIRP is measured on the orthogonal cuts and the TRP is then calculated as follows: First the contributions from each cut is calculated as\n\nwhere P is the number of sampling points in the cut.

The time difference between the reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (J.4-1). The timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (TA 31)1664Tc for 15 KHz SCS, Δτ - (TA 31)1632Tc for 30 KHz SCS and Δτ - (TA 31)168Tc for 120 KHz SCS. The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving propagation conditions are shown in Table J.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a moving propagation condition in a 5G network, illustrating how signals propagate in different directions. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure J.4-1: Moving propagation conditions\n(J.4-1)\nTable J.4-1: Parameters for UL timing adjustment\n\nNOTE:\tDoppler shift is not taken into account in UL TA scenario Y and scenario Z.\n\nAs the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (PUEM) for co-location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure relative noise change instead of absolute noise level. For the situation where the noise level is stable, the noise level change can be identified by a relative noise measurement method. This method measures the relative noise change extracted from when the test object is operating and when the power is disconnected.

                            "text_content": "A statistical test is characterized by test time, selectivity and confidence level. The outcome of the statistical test is a decision. This decision may be correct, i.e., BSs whose BLER is greater than 0.001% being declared to fail, and BSs whose BLER is smaller or equal to 0.001% being declared to pass, or in-correct (as detailed above). The Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability that the decision is a correct one. The complement is the wrong decision probability (risk) D = 1-CL.\nWhen testing BLER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are observed and the numbers of correctly and erroneously received blocks are recorded. For a \"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are observed, and a pass/fail decision is made based on the number of observed errors being above/below a threshold. This threshold is based on the targeted BLER and the design target CL. There is always some risk of a statistical variation leading to an incorrect pass/fail decision. The greater the number of samples that are recorded, the lower is the risk of such an error. The number of samples that are observed in a standard test is dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low risk of error (i.e., an acceptable high confidence level) for BS that just meet the BLER limit.\nThe standard test works well where the BLER level is relatively high and confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a comparable order of magnitude). However, for ultra-low BLER testing the length of time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve a 99.999% confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the BS will in fact have a much lower true BLER than the limit, i.e., design target of the test, (in which case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence that the BLER is lower than the limit is much smaller) or, if failing the requirement will have a much higher true BLER (in which case, errors occur more frequently and it can be demonstrated that the BS is above the BLER limit with fewer samples).\nTo avoid long test times, an alternative test method called early pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error is encountered, a decision is made on whether the BS can be passed/failed with 99.999% CL or the test needs to continue until another error is encountered. In the case of very good BSs, the test can also be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error event is reached and no error event is recorded.  Pass/Fail is decided based on the total number of observed samples and errors, and a statistical calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative distribution. The calculation involves one parameter, one variable and the result:\n-\tParameter: d (per step decision probability).\n-\tVariable: ne (number of observed errors).\n-\tResult: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on which one is calculated).\nThe per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each test of a large number of tests on a large number of BSs that exactly meet the BLER limit is D=0.001% (and hence the CL 99.999%).\nIt should be noted that d is determined separately considering early pass and early fail testing.\nFor a marginal BS (i.e., a BS almost exactly meeting the BLER), the unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to distinguish whether the BS has just passed or just failed the BLER (ε→0), and can thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid this undecided result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device factor\" (M) is introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor biases the decision towards avoiding failing good BS.\n",
