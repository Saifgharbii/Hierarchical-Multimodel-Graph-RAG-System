UAE layer assists on the mapping and traffic steering of UAS traffic to different DNAI based on the deployment of the USSs in different edge/cloud networks.\nIn multi-USS scenarios, each USS can be physically located in different clouds, and it is also possible that a USS is deployed at the edge. In such multi-USS/LUN scenarios, the interaction with the communication network for supporting a UAS session which requires the interaction to more than one USS e.g. due to UAV mobility to different geographical area covered by different edge cloud, needs to be specified.\nOne example is shown below, where USSs are deployed in different edges/clouds and are clustered in different LUNs. In these cases, the interaction with 5GS can be via different DNAIs, and the UAV/UAV-C can be travelling to any location which is allowed to be based on the UAV route and the UAS operator wishes/restrictions.\nThe figure depicts a multi-USS deployment in a 4G network, illustrating the use of multiple base stations (BSs) to enhance network coverage and capacity. The deployment consists of a central base station (C-BS) and several secondary base stations (S-BSs), each equipped with a user equipment (UE) and a scatterer. The figure highlights the importance of network slicing and network slicing technologies in managing network resources and enhancing user experience.\nFigure 7.4.2.1-1: Example multi-USS deployment\nFigure 7.4.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the change of USS.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe UAV has performed the UAS UE registration procedure.\n-\tUAE client and UAE server have indicated Multi-USS support.\nThe figure depicts a 4.2.2-1 layer assisted change of USS in the UAE, illustrating the process of network transformation. The figure includes various elements such as the network topology, network elements, and network changes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the network transformation process.\nFigure 7.4.2.2-1: UAE layer assisted change of USS\n1.\tThe UAE server has performed the USS management procedure of clause 7.3.2.3.1; however at the Multi-USS management request, UAE server also receives from UAS application specific server the USS service areas (geographical) for all allowed USSs, and optionally the USS to DNAI mapping and a USS list per given Local USS network (LUN).\nNOTE:\tIf USS to DNAI mapping is not provided in step 1, it is assumed that such mapping is available / pre-configured at UAE server (e.g. mapping of geographical area to DNAI).\n2.\tThe UAE server maps each USS with different topological areas based on the USS to DNAI mapping (based on step 1), for all USSs which are allowed for a target area where the UAV is allowed to fly (this for example can be within the LUN). Then it also maps and stores all pairs of <USS x, DNAI y> per LUN or for the areas of interest for the UAV (e.g. based on the allowable routes).\n3.\tThe UAE server tracks the location of the UAV, by requesting on-demand location monitoring from SEAL LMS (acting as VAL server in procedure of clause 9.3.4 or clause 9.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5]) or via subscribing for monitoring the UAV location deviation (discussed in clause 9.3.11 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5]).\n4.\tThe UAE server if detects an expected UAV location change to an area covered by a different USS (based on SEAL LMS monitoring subscription/request as in step 3), it generates a trigger event indicating that the UE moves to an area where the USS is overlapping with other USS or another overlapping USS within LUN area is not available.\nIf it is an overlap, the UAE server checks whether the performance of serving USS is expected to get impacted (e.g. by requesting DN performance analytics for the target area) or if the serving USS is not supported at target area, checks what is the best available USS and whether this can provide the same services. The criteria for the best available USS are mainly the location of the UAV, but it can be also the priorities of the USS (based on the policies received) at the target area and the capabilities (services) provided by the target USS to be equivalent.\n5.\tThe UAE server sends to the UAS application specific server a trigger message indicating the recommendation for a USS change for the UAS and provides the target USS ID or just a need for changing USS. Alternatively, the trigger message indicates a UAV mobility event, based on steps 3/4.\n6/7. The UAS application specific server, based on the trigger and after coordinating with source and target USSs (coordination is out of scope) sends to the UAS application specific server a USS change command message indicating the new USS information for the UAS.\n8.\tThe UAE server translates this to a UP path change and interacts with NEF as AF for influence UP path (switching to target DNAI). In particular UAE server (acting as AF) checks whether it can serve the target DNAI corresponding to the target USS based on the mapping of USS to DNAI which was performed in step 3. Interaction with 5GC is performed according to functionality for application function influence on traffic routing, see 3GPP TS 23.502 [8] clause 4.3.6.3.\n9.\tThe UAE server sends a USS change command to the UAV, indicating the UAV (UAE client) ID, a new serving USS information and optionally USS change authorization information.\n10.\tThe UAE server receives a positive or negative acknowledgement for the USS change.\n11.\tThe UAE server sends a USS change notification to the UAS application specific server upon successful USS change.\n",

This solution addresses also Key Issue #3 since the outcome of such solution can trigger some coordination between PC5 and Uu for C2 mode switching.\nThe network-assisted mode (in-direct) is used to facilitate the C2 communication in BLOS; however when the PC5 is feasible/available UAVs needs to switch to direct fast and without any loss of data. The feasibility/availability of PC5 can be e.g. when the UAV returns towards the UAV-C or when the expected QoS over PC5 is better than Uu (due to possible congestions/QoS degradation/resource starvation in one or both Uu links).\nThe PC5 availability/feasibility indication for a C2 communication, will provide the awareness to the UAE server to switch to direct C2 communication if it is possible. The PC5 availability/feasibility can be captured at the UAV/UAV-C, e.g. the UAV-C can periodically broadcast signals in different frequencies, and upon reception of an ACK from the UAV to understand (based on the received signal) whether direct C2 is possible. The UAE server based on this indication can perform the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.255 [3] for C2 mode switching if possible.\nNOTE:\tThis solution will not be considered for normative work unless SA2 provides the required functionality that aligns with this solution.\nFigure 7.5.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports C2 direct mode feasibility checking.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe UAV has performed the UAS UE registration procedure.\n- \tThe UAV and UAV-C are both connected to 3GPP network and operate in network-based C2 mode.\n-\tUAE Server has performed the C2 mode switching/selection capability initiation as in clause 7.4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.255 [3].\nThe figure depicts a support for C2 direct mode feasibility reporting, which is a crucial aspect of network planning and design.

By the policy for multi-USS configuration parameters, the USS will decide the level of control the UAE layer can take on behalf of the USS.\nSolution #2 re-use the management and policy-framework from solution #1, with additions for mapping between USS service areas and 3GPP infrastructure information (i.e., DNAI).\nSolution #1 and solution #2 complements each other to address both bullet a) and bullet b) using a common policy framework.\nA policy-based approach with the execution as requested by the USS via the UAE Client / UAE server in solution #1 and a UAE Server centric approach in solution #2 are compatible with each other and can be combined into a “UAE layer assisted / USS controlled” based solution covering all possible scenarios and requirements of key issue #2.

This is based on the policy from the USS. The USS can initiate change of USS if this is required.\n5)\tThe UAE client notifies the UAE server when, based on policy from the USS, it detects condition for change of USS. The UAE server provides an indication to the USS to enable the USS to make the decision of change of USS.\nThe UAE client may also trigger an immediate/autonomous change of USS, but only in emergency situations.\n6)\tThe UAE server can, based on UAV tracking information from SEAL LMS and detection of UAV mobility to the DNAI associated with the USS, inform the USS about possible change of USS. Based on this, the USS can initiate a change of USS.\n7)\tFor cases where UAE server cannot determine the conditions for change of USS, the UAE server relies on UAE client assistance as above.\n8)\tThe UAE server performs traffic influence for the change of USS.\n",
