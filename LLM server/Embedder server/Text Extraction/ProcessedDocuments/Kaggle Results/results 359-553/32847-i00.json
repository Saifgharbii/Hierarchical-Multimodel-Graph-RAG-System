                    "text_content": "GSMA 5GJA has specified in NG.116 [6] the concept of Generic Network Slice Template (GST) from which several Network Slice Types (NESTs) can be derived by assigning values to applicable attributes defined in the GST.\nAs per  TS 23.501 [7] is the network slice a logical network that provides specific network capabilities and network characteristics, and GSMA tailored the network slice based on the specific requirements adhered to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) agreed between Network Slice Customer (NSC) and Network Slice Provider (NSP).\nMultiple roles related to network slicing are defined by GSMA and displayed in figure 4.1-1, based on some roles specified in TS 28.530 [8] and described in TR 32.845 [2].\nThe Charging model will fulfil the following used roles:\n-\tCommunication Service Customer (CSC): Uses communication services, e.g. end user, tenant, vertical.\n-\tCommunication Service Provider (CSP): Provides communication services. Designs, builds and operates its communication services. The CSP provided communication service can be built with or without network slice.\n-\tNetwork Operator (NOP): Designs, builds and operates networks and provides related services, including network services and network slices.\n-\tNetwork Slice Customer (NSC): The CSP or CSC who uses Network Slice as a Service.\n-\tNetwork Slice Provider (NSP): The CSP or NOP who provides Network Slice as a Service.\nDepending on the scenarios an organisation can play one or several roles simultaneously, and apply charging models based on corresponding business relationship, e.g.:\n-\tCharging models for CSP to charge CSC for using communication services\n-\tCharging models for NOP to charge CSP for using their Networks and related Network services\n-\tCharging models for NOP playing NSP Role to charge CSP playing NSC Role for using their Networks and related network slices\nFigure 4.1-1 illustrates the model roles in network slicing, highlighting the various components and their interactions. Key roles include the network slicing controller (NSC), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NSP), network slicing service provider (NS\nFigure 4.1-1: Model roles in network slicing\nThe GST is a set of generic attributes that can characterise a type of network slice/service and is not tied to any specific network deployment.\nThe NEST is a GST filled with values. The attributes and their values are assigned to fulfil a given set of requirements derived from a network slice customer use case. The NEST is an input to the network slice preparation performed by NSP. NEST-related attributes can be differentiated by a Service Category.  For instance, when an attribute of a NEST includes a Service Category parameter and the UE subscription information includes a parameter value associated with that Service Category, then the UE will be subject to the differentiated service associated with the Service Category in the network slice.\nFigure 4.1-2 places the GST and NEST in the context of the network slice lifecycle. As first step, the NSC provides the service requirements for the use case that it would like to fulfil, to the NSP. The NSP maps the service requirements into the attributes of the GST with the appropriate values generating a NEST.\nThe figure depicts the GST (Global Service Gateway) and NEST (Network Edge Service) in the context of the network slice lifecycle. The GST is a service that provides a single point of contact for network services, while NEST is a service that provides a single point of contact for network services at the edge of the network. The figure illustrates the lifecycle of network slices, including the initial creation of a network slice, the deployment of services, and the eventual removal of the slice.\nFigure 4.1-2: GST and NEST in context of the network slice lifecycle\nIn GSMA 5GJA NG.116 [6], there are two attributes the maximum number of UEs and the maximum number of PDU sessions, which characterising the network slice (one S-NSSAI) and defined as the maximum number of UEs and the maximum number of PDU sessions that can use the network slice simultaneously.\nThe Network Slice Instance (NSI) concept is as used in TS 28.202 [3].\n",

The max. number of UEs that can use the network slice simultaneously is one criteria for usage control of network slice, it is therefore an aspect to be considered for converged charging. Since the maximum number of simultaneous UEs can part of the offering and in the extension part of the price for the offering, then also the number of UEs that use the network slice simultaneously can be a criterion for the charging (i.e. rate and cost). For example, if during a period it never goes above a specific number of simultaneous UEs one price and if it does go above another price.\nThis investigation covers the following:\n-\tdetermination of \"number of UEs\"/max. number of UEs per slice that can use the network slice simultaneously to be used as a criteria for converged charging service;\n-\tidentification of the main charging information to be collected in addition to \"number of UEs\"/max. number of UEs;\n-\tdetermination of the main interactions with the NF or service usage to obtain the network slice authorization and usage based on \"number of UEs\"/max. number of UEs;\n- \tdetermination of all needed charging information for online and offline charging methods.\nFor the sake of simplification, \"number of UEs\" refers to \"number of UEs that can use the network slice simultaneously\".\n",

While NSACF counts all UE registrations in S-NSSAI as received from the AMF(s), the CHF/5G Converged Charging System functionalities provide the charging service and quota management capabilities to this NSACF.\nThe CHF receives and stores the \"Maximum Number of UEs\"  via the ConvergedCharging service, as specified in TS 28.202 [3] clause 5.1.3 \"Network Slice Management charging information\" and 6.2.1.3 Definition of Service profile charging information. The \"max. Nb of Reg UEs\" is used in the following clause.\n\nAs described in TS 23.501 [7] clause 5.15.11.0, , the NSACF is configured with \"max Nb of Reg UEs\".\n\nA new NetworkSliceConvergedCharging service is introduced for this Network Slice quota management between the CHF and the NSACF and its use is described in following clause. In this context, the Network Slice quota (NS_quota) handled by the CHF relates to quota of \"Nb of Reg UEs\", with a CCS defined maximum referred to as \"NS Reg UEs Quota limit\".\n\nIn this solution, the \"NS Reg UEs Quota limit\" may be above the \"max Nb of Reg UEs\".\n\nDuring the UEs registration, the NSACF provides the network slice admission control for all AMF(s) by counting the number of registered UEs against the \"max Nb of Reg UEs\", and once this maximum is reached NSACF will trigger a request for more quota under NetworkSliceConvergedCharging service to CHF.\n\n\nThe following figure 6.1.1.1-1 represents the high-level entities involved in the solution.\n\n\nThe figure depicts a high-level functional solution overview for a 1.1-1 high-speed optical network, showcasing key components such as optical line terminals (OLTs), distributed nodes, and core switches.

The system is designed to ensure efficient allocation of resources and to facilitate the smooth operation of the network.\nFigure 6.1.1.2-1: NetworkSlice quota management - registration\nThe steps are with the following additions:\n0ch.

The number of max. number of PDU sessions is one criteria for usage control of network slice, it is therefore an aspect to be considered for converged charging. Since the maximum number of simultaneous PDU sessions can be part of the offering and in the extension part of the price for the offering, then also the number of PDU sessions that use the network slice simultaneous can be a criterion for the charging (i.e. rate and cost). For example, if during a period it never goes above a specific number of simultaneous PDU sessions one price and if it does go above another price.\nThis investigation covers the following:\n-\tdetermination of number of simultaneous PDU sessions/max. number of PDU sessions per slice that can use the network slice simultaneously to be used as a criteria for converged charging service;\n-\tidentification of the main charging information to be collected in addition to number of simultaneous PDU sessions/max. number of PDU sessions;\n-\tdetermination of the main interactions with the NF or service usage to obtain the network slice authorization and usage based on max number of PDU sessions;\n- \tdetermination of all needed charging information for online and offline charging methods.\n",

This association is achieved by UE CCS responsible for individual UE charging consuming this new charging service exposed by the Tenant CCS.\nIn this solution, the volume is the charging information used for this association: when individual UE PDU session volume charging starts, the \"UE allowed volume\" as determined by UE-CCS is sent to the Tenant CCS, and the Tenant CCS is then able to aggregate UEs PDU sessions volume per S-NSSAI per Tenant. When the individual UE PDU session volume charging terminates, the \"UE consumed volume\" is sent to the Tenant CCS which recalculates the aggregation.\nThere is a possible option for intermediate reporting of \"UE allowed volume\" and \"UE consumed volume\" to the Tenant CCS for a better volume control by the Tenant CCS.\nWhen Communication Service Provider (CSP) and Network Slice Provider (NSP) are the same in the model roles of network slicing defined in clause 4.1, deployments can choose to collocate Tenant CCS with UE CCS.\nThe figure depicts a distributed charging architecture in reference point representation, illustrating the various components and their interconnections.

Also the AAA framework includes accounting functionality used by this separate infrastructure to address sub-set of charging capabilities. With the same rationale, the AAA-P is not appropriate.\n",
