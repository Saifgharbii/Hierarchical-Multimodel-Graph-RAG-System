The deployment and commercialization of URLLC service are of great significance to network operators. Efforts to build URLLC service oriented to vertical industries may become a potential growth point to increase revenue.\nIn order to satisfy the requirements of URLLC service, 3GPP has defined many features to decrease latency and increase reliability to guarantee the SLA of URLLC service. However, only principle and implementation mode of each feature are defined in 3GPP specifications, and it is not indicated that how to manage the features to enable URLLC service in actual network deployment. Consequently, the management of URLLC related features need to be studied to achieve the service requirements of URLLC defined in TS 22.261 [3].\nThe characteristics of URLLC are mainly reflected in several aspects such as delay/latency, reliability and availability.

These features with different functions and different effects are distributed in different specifications, which bring complexity to the invocation and management when deploying URLLC service.

                            "text_content": "Under the new definition of 5G application scenarios, there are coexistence scenarios of URLLC and eMBB services, and 3GPP specifications also contains related contents of eMBB and URLLC multiplexing mechanisms.\nCo-existence Scenario\nURLLC UEs and eMBB UEs can co-exist in a cell when the cell provides both services, which can be achieved by different slices. According to TS 38.300 [8], hardware/software resource isolation is up to implementation. Each slice may be assigned with either shared, prioritized or dedicated radio resource up to RRM implementation and SLA as in TS 28.541 [12]. Consequently, URLLC UEs and eMBB UEs can share the resource in the same cell even the two kinds of services allocated to different slices.\nResource Multiplexing/Pre-emption\nURLLC service has more stringent requirement on latency and pre-emption may happen when the resource for URLLC is not enough under co-existence scenario. When URLLC service arrives, gNB can reuse the radio resource which is already allocated for eMBB to URLLC in order to guarantee the on-demand transmission of URLLC service.\nSeveral features are defined in TS 38.213 [6] for URLLC to achieve inter-UE resource multiplexing, such as CI(cancellation indication), PB(power boosting) and PI(preemption indication). Detailed description about the features are listed in the following paragraph.\nTaking the uplink service scenario as an example, TR 38.824 [11] evaluates the performance of URLLC and eMBB services under enhanced UL inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing mechanisms, and proposes potential enhancements for UL inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing, which includes UE UL cancelation mechanisms and enhanced UL power control.\nCorresponding to the UE UL cancelation mechanisms, there is a definition of Cancellation Indication (CI) in TS 38.213 [6]. The Cancellation Indication instructs other UE services to cancel their transmissions, which can realize resource preemption for different services in the uplink transmissions. Corresponding to enhanced UL power control, there is a related definition of power boosting (PB). By increasing the uplink transmission power of the UE, it can resist the interference caused by the transmission of other UEs.\nAt the same time, preemption indication (PI) is also defined for resource preemption of different services in the downlink transmission, and PI can be used to indicate to other UEs that their resources are preempted.\nAt present, the network resource load is mainly evaluated through resource usage-related measurements. Referring to TS 28.552 [13], the evaluation measurements are mainly PRB usage rate-related measurements, which measures usage (in percentage) of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Although these measurements can evaluate the overall resource load of the cell, they cannot effectively evaluate the resource load of the URLLC service under the eMBB and URLLC multiplexing scenarios considering the on-demand transmission requirement.\nFor example, in a statistical time period, the PRB usage rate of the network is low. Because the URLLC service has high requirements for latency, it needs to be transmitted immediately. If the URLLC service has data transmission requirements on the resources scheduled by eMBB, the URLLC service will preempt eMBB service resources. In this case, since the PRB usage rate only reflects the overall resource load of the cell, it cannot reflect the situation that the resources of the URLLC service are insufficient at this time.\nTherefore, the existing PRB related measurements cannot effectively evaluate the actual congestion of URLLC services at the transmission occasion under eMBB and URLLC multiplexing scenarios. And what this issue needs to solve is to propose measurement method for evaluating the resource load of URLLC services at the transmission occasion in eMBB and URLLC multiplexing scenarios.\n",

When resource preemption occurs under eMBB and URLLC multiplexing scenarios, they cannot effectively evaluate the resource load of URLLC services. Therefore, this solution proposes an approach to better evaluate the resource load of URLLC services under co-existence scenario by counting the ratio of multiplexing features (CI, PB and PI).\nThe requirements for performance management of radio network providing URLLC services is:\n-\tThe OAM should have the capability of performing measurement on DL (DownLink) and UL(UpLink) resource load of URLLC services under eMBB and URLLC multiplexing scenarios.\nIn Downlink, PI (Preemption Indication) in TS 38.213 [6] is defined for URLLC to achieve inter-UE multiplexing when radio resource is not sufficient. If the feature is triggered, it indicates that downlink resource for URLLC is not enough. So it proposes to calculate the ratio of PI to representing the resource load of URLLC. The detailed description is as follows: Calculate the ratio between the number of time domain resource that uses PI feature and the number of time domain resource with DL data transmitted.\nIn Uplink, CI (Cancellation Indication) in TS 38.213 [6] is defined for URLLC to achieve inter-UE multiplexing when radio resource is not sufficient. If the feature is triggered, it indicates that uplink resource for URLLC is not enough. So it proposes to calculate the ratio of CI to representing the resource load of URLLC.

In order to guarantee the performance of URLLC, the performance of 5G network which provides URLLC service needs to meet certain target for reliability accordingly.\nAnnex F in TS 22.104 [2] depicts relation of reliability and communication service availability. It has the following description, \"Communication service availability addresses the availability of a communication service. This definition follows the vertical standard IEC 61907 [7]. On the other hand, reliability is a 3GPP term and addresses the availability of a communication network.\"\nThe issue mainly focuses on the 5G RAN network that provides URLLC service. In particular, the measurements on communication network performance need to be investigated.\nReliability is a typical network performance measurement used to evaluate whether the 5G network which provides URLLC services meets the corresponding performance requirements. As for 5G network, it is the radio network including air interface that mainly restricts the reliability and latency performance. Therefore, more attentions should be paid to the reliability and latency performance measurement for radio network from the perspective management. However, the reliability performance measurements for radio network are not totally enough.\nThe definition of reliability is specified in TS 22.261 [3]:\n-\treliability: in the context of network layer packet transmissions, percentage value of the packets successfully delivered to a given system entity within the time constraint required by the targeted service out of all the packets transmitted.\nAccording to the above definition, when trying to calculate the reliability of a network, time constraint (a required maximum time) needs to be considered. Neither PER defined in TS 28.552 [13] nor reliability KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [14] seem to totally match the definition of URLLC reliability in RAN.\nURLLC performance management on reliability and latency should be supported by 5G management system and the measurement method should be studied.\n",

End to end latency is an important attribute used to describe the requirement for URLLC service. Latency in RAN is part of end to end latency and the corresponding attribute can be used to specify the maximum allowed delay in RAN including the air interface. The definition of latency in RAN is specified in ITU-R M.2410. The description is as follows:\n4.7.1 User plane latency\nUser plane latency is the contribution of the radio network to the time from when the source sends a packet to when the destination receives it (in ms). It is defined as the one-way time it takes to successfully deliver an application layer packet/message from the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU ingress point to the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU egress point of the radio interface in either uplink or downlink in the network for a given service in unloaded conditions, assuming the mobile station is in the active state. This requirement is defined for the purpose of evaluation in the eMBB and URLLC usage scenarios.\nAccording to the definition above, the latency in RAN should contain the delay over the air interface which is a crucial part of end to end latency. In TS 28.541 [12], the attribute \"dlLatency\" and \"ulLatency\" in RANSliceSubnetProfile only represent the packet processing latency in gNB excluding that of air interface. The performance of delay over the air interface cannot be evaluated simply through the existing latency configuration. Consequently, the issue is that the existing attributes in RANSliceSubnetProfile cannot match the configuration requirement for latency when taking air interface into consideration.\n",
