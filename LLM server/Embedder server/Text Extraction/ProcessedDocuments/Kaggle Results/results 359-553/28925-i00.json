The NG-RAN architecture is introduced in 3GPP TS 38.300 [4], as follows.\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture of the 5G network, specifically focusing on the non-radio (NG-RAN) part. It illustrates the various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the presence of redundancy paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network slicing and network function virtualization.\nFigure 4.4.1.2-1: NG-RAN Overall Architecture\nNOTE:\tThe ng-eNB node provides E-UTRA user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards the UE, and connects via the NG interface to the 5GC.\nIn order to provide management support for NG-RAN, the 3GPP management system needs to support the management for gNB, ng-eNB and 5GC. There are potential 2 management options to support, as follows.\nNG-RAN management Option#1\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture for 5G networks, specifically highlighting the role of the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Controller (NFC). The figure illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the NFV Controller, the NFV Stack, and the NFV Stack Management Interface (NSMI). The figure also includes a diagram of the NFV Stack, showing the various layers and components, such as the NFV Stack Management Interface (NSMI), the NFV Stack, and the NFV Stack Management Interface (NSMI). The figure provides a clear and concise overview of the NFV architecture, highlighting the importance of NFV in modern 5G networks.\nFigure 4.4.1.2-2: NG-RAN management Option#1\nIn the NG-RAN management Option#1:\n-\tThe gNB management domain provides MnS (including MnS component type A, B and C) for the management of gNB.\n-\tThe ng-eNB management domain provides IRP (including interface IRP and NRM IRP) for the management of ng-eNB.\n-\tThe 5GC management domain provides MnS (including MnS component type A, B and C) for the management of 5GC.\nNG-RAN management Option#2\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture, specifically highlighting the role of the Network Functions Virtualization Controller (NFVC). It illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Controller, the Network Functions Virtualization Engine (NFVE), and the Network Functions Virtualization Platform (NFVP). The figure provides a clear visual representation of the NFVC's role in managing the network functions, enabling efficient and scalable network operations.\nFigure 4.4.1.2-3: NG-RAN management Option#2\nIn the NG-RAN management Option#2:\n-\tThe gNB management domain provides MnS(including MnS component type A, B and C) for the management of gNB\n-\tThe ng-eNB management domain provides MnS ((including MnS component type A, B and C) for the management of ng-eNB. In this case, ng-eNB NRM used as MnS component type B, which means the YAML/YANG solution set for ng-eNB needs to be provided.\n-\tThe 5GC management domain provides MnS (including MnS component type A, B and C) for the management of 5GC.\nNG-RAN supports Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) operation whereby a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is connected to two different nodes, one providing NR access and the other one providing either E-UTRA or NR access. One node acts as the MN and the other as the SN. The MN and SN are connected via a network interface and at least the MN is connected to the core network (e.g. EPC).\nThe following figure illustrates the MR-DC with EPC (i.e. EN-DC) architecture in 3GPP TS 37.340 [5].\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture of an EN-DC (Electrical Distribution Circuit) system, illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The diagram includes a 3-phase power supply, a 1-phase power supply, and a 1-phase distribution unit (DU). The EN-DC system is designed to distribute electrical power to various loads, ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply. The figure also includes a 3-phase power supply, a 1-phase power supply, and a 1-phase distribution unit (DU). The EN-DC system is designed to distribute electrical power to various loads, ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply.\nFigure 4.4.1.3-1: EN-DC Overall Architecture\nNOTE:\tThe en-gNB node provides NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards the UE, and acts as Secondary Node in EN-DC.\nIn order to provide management support for EN-DC, 3GPP management system needs to provide the management for en-gNB, eNB and EPC. There are also potential 2 management options to support, as follows.\nEN-DC management Option#1\nThe figure depicts a 3-2 EN-DC management option, which is a crucial component in the electrical distribution system. It illustrates the various management options available for the EN-DC (Electrical Distribution Circuit) system, including the 3-2 configuration, which allows for the control of the electrical distribution circuit through a single switch. This configuration is particularly useful in large buildings or complex networks, as it simplifies the management process and reduces the number of switches required. The figure also includes a visual representation of the switch, which is essential for understanding the functionality of the EN-DC management option.\nFigure 4.4.1.3-2: EN-DC management option#1\nIn EN-DC management option#1:\n-\tThe en-gNB management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B and C) for management of en-gNB.\n-\tThe eNB management domain provides IRP (including interface IRP and NRM IRP) for the management of eNB.\n-\tThe EPC management domain provides IRP (including interface IRP and NRM IRP) for the management of EPC.\nThe figure depicts a 3-3 configuration with EN-DC management Option#2, illustrating the various management options available for the electrical distribution system.\nFigure 4.4.1.3-3: EN-DC management Option#2\nEN-DC management Option#2\nIn EN-DC management option#2:\n-\tThe en-gNB management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B and C) for management of en-gNB.\n-\tThe eNB management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B and C) for management of eNB.
