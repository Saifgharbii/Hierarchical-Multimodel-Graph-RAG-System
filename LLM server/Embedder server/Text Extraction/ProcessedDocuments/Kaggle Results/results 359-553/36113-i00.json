                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].\nAncillary equipment: Equipment (apparatus), used in connection with a receiver, transmitter or transceiver is considered as an ancillary equipment (apparatus) if:\n-\tthe equipment is intended for use in conjunction with a receiver, transmitter or transceiver to provide additional operational and/or control features to the radio equipment, (e.g. to extend control to another position or location); and\n-\tthe equipment cannot be used on a stand-alone basis to provide user functions independently of a receiver, transmitter or transceiver; and\n-\tthe receiver, transmitter or transceiver to which it is connected, is capable of providing some intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub-unit of the main equipment essential to the main equipment basic functions).\nBase Station equipment: Radio and/or ancillary equipment intended for operation at a fixed location and powered directly or indirectly (e.g. via an AC/DC converter or power supply) by AC mains network, or an extended local DC mains network.\nChannel bandwidth: The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.\nContinuous phenomena (continuous disturbance): Electromagnetic disturbance, the effects of which on a particular device or equipment cannot be resolved into a succession of distinct effects (IEC 60050-161 [8]).\nMaximum throughput: The maximum achievable throughput for a reference measurement channel.\nMulti-band Base Station: Base Station characterized by the ability of its transmitter and/or receiver to process two or more carriers in common active RF components simultaneously, where at least one carrier is configured at a different non-overlapping operating band than the other carrier(s).\nNB-IoT In-band operation: NB-IoT is operating in-band when it utilizes the resource block(s) within a normal E-UTRA carrier\nNB-IoT guard band operation: NB-IoT is operating in guard band when it utilizes the unused resource block(s) within a E-UTRA carrier's guard-band.\nNB-IoT standalone operation: NB-IoT is operating standalone when it utilizes its own spectrum, for example the spectrum currently being used by GERAN systems as a replacement of one or more GSM carriers, as well as scattered spectrum for potential IoT deployment.\nRadio communications equipment : Telecommunications equipment which includes one or more transmitters and/or receivers and/or parts thereof for use in a fixed, mobile or portable application. It can be operated with ancillary equipment but if so, is not dependent on it for basic functionality.\nRadio equipment: Equipment which contains Radio digital unit and Radio unit.\nRadio digital unit: Equipment which contains base band and functionality for controlling Radio unit.\nRadio unit: Equipment which contains transmitter and/or receiver.\nreceiver exclusion band: Band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made, and is expressed relative to the BS receive band.\nPort: A particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is considered as a port (see Figure 3.1.1).\nReceiver exclusion band: The receiver exclusion band is the band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made. The exclusion band for receivers is expressed relative to the base station receive band.\nRepeater: A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from the base station to the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from the mobile to the base station). In operating bands specified with only down-link or up-link, only the up-link or down-link as specified for the operating band is repeated.\nSignal and control: Port which carries information or control signals, excluding antenna ports.\nTelecommunication port: Ports which are intended to be connected to telecommunication networks (e.g. public switched telecommunication networks, integrated services digital networks), local area networks (e.g. Ethernet, Token Ring) and similar networks.\nNOTE:\tTelecommunication port is called \"wired network port\" in CISPR 32 [25].\nThroughput: The number of payload bits successfully received per second for a reference measurement channel in a specified reference condition.\nTransient phenomena: Pertaining to or designating a phenomena or a quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 [8]).\nTransmitter exclusion band: Band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made and is expressed relative to the carrier frequencies used (the carrier frequencies of the base stations activated transmitter(s)).\nFigure 3.1.1 illustrates various types of ports commonly found in telecommunication networks, such as Ethernet, Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH), and Fiber-to-the-Building (FTTB). These ports are essential for data transmission and are typically used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. The figure highlights the importance of proper port selection and configuration to ensure reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 3.1.1: Examples of ports\n\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with a single BS (base station) solution, highlighting the signal propagation in a 5G network. The figure shows the signal path, including the base station, user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 3.1.2:  BS with single enclosure solution\nThe figure depicts a 3G network with multiple enclosures, illustrating the various solutions used to accommodate the signal propagation in a 3G network.\nFigure 3.1.3:  BS with multiple enclosure solution\n",

The BS or Repeater shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads.\nMean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at which a component is detected, the BS or Repeater shall be rotated and the height of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement.

Where cables have to be connected to these ports, or interconnecting cables have to be extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or extension of these cables;\n-\tImmunity tests on the entire base station shall be performed by establishing communication links at the air interface (e.g. with the mobile simulator) and the S1 interface (e.g. with an EPC simulator) and evaluating the throughput (see Figure 9.2.1);\n-\tImmunity tests shall be performed on both the Uplink and Downlink paths. The tests shall also include both the air interface and S1 interface. Throughput evaluation may be carried out at either interface, where appropriate, and the measurements for the Uplink and Downlink paths may be carried out as a single path looped at either the air interface or S1 interface. In case of looping is used care have to be taken that the throughput information doesn't change due to looping.\n-\tFor BS capable of multi-band operation, communication links shall be established in such a way that all operating band(s) are activated during the test according to the applicable test configurations in subclause 4.6. Performance assessment may be done separately for each operating band.\n\nThe figure depicts a communication link set up for BS (base station) immunity measurement, illustrating the various components and their arrangement. The BS is equipped with a communication link, which is connected to a power supply unit (PSU) and a signal generator. The PSU is responsible for providing power to the communication link and the signal generator for generating the required signals. The communication link is connected to a network analyzer, which is used to measure the BS's immunity against various signals. The network analyzer is connected to the communication link and the PSU, allowing for the measurement of the BS's immunity against different types of signals. The figure also includes a schematic representation of the communication link, which provides a clear visual representation of the components and their connections.\nFigure 9.2.1: Communication link set up for BS immunity measurement\n",
