If the operating SNR is smaller than 30dB, then the percentage of UE meet the target SNR will increase.

The throughput gain is derived from comparing whether the 256QAM is allowed. The results are shown in below:\n\n\nFigure 5.2.1.4-2 proportion and performance gain for 256 QAM\n\nFor the indoor scenario, PC1 UE can have obvious performance gain, and about 70% UE is once scheduled with 256QAM during the simulation time, but for other power classes, the throughput performance even become worse, this is because the SINR for these UE cannot support such high MCS and the BLER is bad. For the Uma scenario, even though there are many UEs scheduled with 256 QAM, the performance gain is tiny.\nObservation 2:\n-\tFor the indoor scenario, only PC1 shows obvious throughput gain, and about 69.3%UEs are scheduled with 256 QAM.\n-\tFor the Uma scenario, the performance gain of all PC UEs is tiny.\n\nR4-2301569\nThe simulation assumption for SLS was revised to add minimum EIRP and power control formula, and our simulation results based on such new assumptions are shown in Figure 5.2.1.4-3.

So, in the simulations the ideal beam management was assumed, and the impairment offset of 10 dB was added in the last stage.\nBy looking at the results, we can see that around 30% of UEs can achieve the operating SNR of 30 dB for FTP with 30% load and around 35% of UEs can achieve the operating SNR of 30 dB for FTP with 10% load, which means that 256 QAM for PC1 UEs in FR2-1 and 29 GHz carrier frequency is feasible.\nR4-2302734\n2.1\t29GHz carrier frequency\n2.1.1\tIndoor scenario for PC2/PC5\n\n\nObservation 1: For 29GHz carrier frequency, indoor scenario and PC2/PC5, around 60% of users with FTP 10% load and 15% of users with FTP 30% load can reach the operating SNR of 28dB.\n2.1.2   UMa scenario for PC2/PC5\n\nObservation 2: For 29GHz carrier frequency, UMa scenario and PC2/PC5, around 30% of users with FTP 10% load and 28% of users with FTP 30% load can reach the operating SNR of 28dB.\n2.2\t39GHz carrier frequency\n2.2.1\tIndoor scenario for PC2/PC5\n\nObservation 3: For 39GHz carrier frequency, indoor scenario and PC2/PC5, around 50% of users with FTP 10% load and 12% of users with FTP 30% load can reach the operating SNR of 30dB.\n2.2.2   UMa scenario for PC2/PC5\n\nObservation 4: For 39GHz carrier frequency, UMa scenario and PC2/PC5, around 17% of users with FTP 10% load and 15% of users with FTP 30% load can reach the operating SNR of 30dB.\n2.2.3\tIndoor scenario for PC1\n\nObservation 5: For 39GHz carrier frequency, indoor scenario and PC1, around 55% of users with FTP 10% load and 12% of users with FTP 30% load can reach the operating SNR of 30dB.\n2.2.4\tUMa scenario for PC1\n\nObservation 6: For 39GHz carrier frequency, UMa scenario and PC1, around 50% of users with FTP 10% load and 38% of users with FTP 30% load can reach the operating SNR of 30dB.\n\nR4-2301620\nIn last meeting, it is verified that the UL 256QAM for PC1 UE of 29GHz is feasible based on system simulation, but whether UL 256QAM for PC2/5 UE of 29GHz and PC1/2/5 UE of 39GHz can achieve target SNR at BS side need further confirm by system simulation.

                            "text_content": "\nThe phase noise profiles in TS 38.803 [3] (“UE example 1” and “UE example 2”) don’t have good enough EVM for higher modulations, i.e., 256QAM with the typical 3.5% EVM requirement. In the discussion progress, some candidate phase noise profiles for 29GHz and 39GHz for UL 256QAM are proposed as following options:\nFor 29GHz:\nOption1: Example 1 in TR38.803 for 29 GHz.\nOption 2: Example 2 in TR38.803.\nNew phase noise model using the pole-zero method based on following function:\n\nOption 3: Parameters from Qualcomm\n\nOption 4: Parameters from  MTK\n\nFor 39GHz:\nOption 1: Example 1-based using following function:\n\nParameters from vivo\n\nParameters from Anritsu\n\nOption 2: Example 2 in TR38.803.\nNew phase noise model using the pole-zero method based on following function:\n\nOption 3: Parameters from MTK\n\nOption 4: Adopt min(example1, example2) as the phase noise profile for UL256QAM, where ‘example2’ refers to the example phase noise profiles in TR38.803 and ‘example1’ refers to Example 1-based for 39GHz.\nR4-2308805/R4-2318876\nBased on the agreed simulation assumptions and candidate phase noise profiles, the EVM floor is further evaluated for CP- OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM.\nFor 29GHz:\nTable 5.2.3.3-1 EVM floor and benefit for with PTRS CP-OFDM at 29GHz\n\nTable 5.2.3.3-2 EVM floor and benefit for with PTRS DFT-s-OFDM at 29GHz\n\nFrom table 5.2.3.3-1 and table 5.2.3.3-2 for 29GHz, we can see no matter for CP- OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM:\nThe EVM floors for new phase noise profiles from QC and MTK are reduced obviously compared to Example 1 and Example 2.\nFurther compared new phase noise profiles from QC and MTK, we can see the EVM floor of MTK’s phase noise profile is lower than Qualcomm’s when without PTRS correction. And they have similar EVM floor when adding PTRS correction. Since the CPE (common phase error) impacts is closely related to the performance of phase noise profile, it will get less benefit from PTRS correction if the phase noise profile introduce less CPE (common phase error).\nTherefore, we can’t only judge the phase noise profile according to the net benefit but also need consider the performance without PTRS correction.\nThese two new phase noise profiles have similar performance after PTRS correction for both of CP-OFDM and DFT-S-OFDM, from this point, both of them can be used in MPR simulation.\nFor 39GHz:\nTable 5.2.3.3-3 EVM floor and benefit for with PTRS CP-OFDM at 39GHz\n\nTable 5.2.3.3-4 EVM floor and benefit for with PTRS DFT-s-OFDM at 39GHz\n\nFrom table 5.2.3.3-3 and table 5.2.3.3-4 for 39GHz, we can see no matter for CP- OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM:\nThe EVM floors of Example 1-based from vivo and Anritsu is better than example 2, but still worse than -29.1 dB EVM requirement for 256QAM.\nAnd the EVM floors of the new phase noise profiles that adopting min(Example 1-based, Example 2) and from MTK are reduced obviously compared to Example 1-based and Example 2.\nFurther compared new phase noise profiles from adopting min(Example 1-based, Example 2) and MTK, we can see the EVM floor of MTK’s phase noise profile is better a little than that adopting min(Example 1-based, Example 2) a little when without PTRS correction. But the EVM floor of MTK’s phase noise profile is worse a little than that adopting min(Example 1-based, Example 2) when with PTRS correction.\nThese two new phase noise profiles that adopting min(Example 1-based, Example 2) and from MTK have better EVM floor than -29.1 dB EVM requirement for 256QAM whether adding PTRS correction or not for both of CP-OFDM and DFT-S-OFDM, from this point, both of them can be used in MPR simulation.\nBut considering phase noise profiles that adopting min(Example 1-based, Example 2) hasn’t clearly physical description, we can use the new phase noise profile from MTK in MPR simulation.\nR4-2308227\nIn the simulation, distortion other than phase noise is not considered, e.g., PA non-linearity, transceiver impairment, etc., to ensure the results only show the feasibility of different phase noise profiles.\nThe simulation results for 29GHz bands are shown in Table 5.2.3.4-1\n\nTable 5.2.3.4-1 simulation results for 29GHz band\n\nBased on the simulation results, we have the following observations:\nObservation 1: The phase noise profile described in option 1 and option 2 is not feasible for the 29GHz band.\nObservation 2: CP-OFDM can benefit from PTRS correction in UL 256QAM but DFT-s-OFDM can’t.\nThe simulation results for 39GHz are shown in Table 5.2.3.4-2.\nTable 5.2.3.4-2 simulation results for the 39GHz band\n\nIt is noted that only phase noise is considered in the simulation and when other distortion needs to be counted in MPR evaluation, even under option 3 or option 4 phase noise, it is still challenging to achieve the 29.1 dB EVM requirement for UE.\nObservation 5: Either option 3 or option 4 may still be infeasible for MPR evaluation in the 39GHz band.\nR4-2307043\nThe figure depicts a comparison of simulation results for a 5G network, showing the impact of different parameters on signal strength and interference. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the differences in signal quality and interference levels across different scenarios.\nFigure 5.2.3.5-1 Comparison of simulation results\n\nTable 5.2.3.5-1: Simulation results for UE example 2 phase noise profile.\n\nThe phase noise profiles from MediaTek and Qualcomm improves the SNR by about 3.5dB compare to the case of the Example 1 and Example phase noise profiles.\nObservation 1: Both the MediaTek and Qualcomm phase noise profiles allow UL 256QAM to be feasible in terms of phase noise profile at 29.55GHz.\nThe figure depicts a comparison of simulation results for the second set of results, showing the performance of the proposed system under different conditions. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, allowing for easy interpretation and comparison.\nFigure 5.2.3.5-2 Comparison of simulation results – 2nd set of results\n\nTable 5.2.3.5-2 Simulation results for UE example 2 phase noise profile.\n\nUsing Min() phase noise profile improves the SNR by about 3.5dB compare to the case of the Example 1 and Example phase noise profiles. The phase noise profile by MediaTek is also giving about 2.5dB improvement of the SNR.\nObservation 2: Both the MediaTek and Qualcomm phase noise profiles allow UL 256QAM to be feasible in terms of phase noise profile at 39GHz.\nR4-2307931\nTo isolate the EVM impact of phase noise, no other types of impairments were added to the waveform. Table 5.2.3.6-1 and Table 5.2.3.6-2 show the initial simulated results.\nTable 5.2.3.6-1 Benefit of PTRS in 256QAM, 64RB, 100MHz, SCS= 120kHz, CP-OFDM @29GHz\n\nTable 5.2.3.6-2 Benefit of PTRS in 256QAM, 64RB, 100MHz, SCS= 120kHz, CP-OFDM @39GHz\n\nFrom Table 5.2.3.6-1, we can find that the EVM performance with our proposed phase noise profile is very close to Qualcomm’s proposal at 29GHz after PTRS processing. Therefore, our proposal and Qualcomm’s proposal for the phase noise profile can be used in 256QAM MPR evaluation for FR2-1.\nObservation 1: EVM performance with our proposed phase noise profile is very close to Qualcomm’s proposal at 29GHz after PTRS processing.\nR4-2308223\nTable 5.2.3.7-1 simulation assumption for phase noise\n\nTable 5.2.3.7-2 CP-OFDM [29 GHz, 120KHZ, 100 MHz, 64RBs, (L=1, K=2)]\n\nTable 5.2.3.7-3 CP-OFDM [39 GHz, 120KHZ, 100 MHz, 64RBs, (L=1, K=2)]\n\nWe simulate EVM according to phase noise profiles and simulation results are shown in table 5.2.3.7-2 and table 5.2.3.7-3.\nFor 29 GHz simulation results, we can observe the feasibility in case 1, case 2 and case 3. But, case 2 and case 3 phase noise profiles can achieve more EVM margin than case 1.\nObservation 1: For 29 GHz simulation results, we can observe the feasibility in case 1, case 2 and case 3. But, case 2 and case 3 phase noise profiles can achieve more EVM margin than case 1.\nFor 39 GHz simulation results, we can observe the feasibility in only case 6. Case 4 and case 5 can not achieve below 3.5% EVM.\nObservation 2: For 39 GHz simulation results, we can observe the feasibility in only case 6. Case 4 and case 5 can not achieve below 3.5% EVM.\nR4-2309028\nMultiple phase noise models have been proposed in the last few RAN4 meetings, and their contribution to the EVM noise floor based on the agreed simulation assumption in [1] is provided in table 5.2.3.8-1. Only results for 120 kHz SCS (64 RB) at 28 GHz are presented here, but other combinations of numerologies show a similar trend.\nTable 5.2.3.8-1 The EVM performance with different phase noise profile in [1] for 120 kHz SCS at 28 GHz\n\nReusing example 1 in TR 38.803 may cause an excessive EVM floor, which is not feasible for MPR evaluation for 256 QAM in our view. In addition, we shall notice that the 256 QAM is mainly targeted for FWA/CPE type of devices, which shall be capable of taking advantage of better-performed RF components than mobile handsets. Meanwhile, to leave sufficient EVM margin for other components, e.g., PA. IQ imbalanced, it is necessary for the device to strive to achieve a better phase noise performance.\nObservation 1: the phase noise examples in TR38.803 does not leave enough EVM margin for 256QAM evaluation.\nPhysical-wise, the phase noise at different frequency offsets is usually dominated by various components inside a PLL, including the VCO, the reference clock, and other associated circuitry. In our view, combining different phase noise profiles is physically viable. Therefore, it is proposed to adopt the improved phase noise model as a baseline for MPR evaluation.\nR4-2300707\nThe penalties from PTRS corrections work against any benefit the PTRS brings in reducing the impact of phase noise. The benefit is a strong function of the phase noise profile, due to the nature of PTRS corrections. The variable benefit cannot be generalized across implementations. The net benefit is the EVM benefit when PTRS processing is enabled despite the penalties discussed previously. The phase noise profiles used below are merely examples for calibration across companies, neither seems particularly worthy of 256QAM.\nIn the presence of phase noise, the DMRS symbols themselves have some CPE associated with them. The EVM algorithm can either ignore them and find the best channel estimate despite the phase noise, or it can de-rotate each DMRS symbol to nominal phase, along with the PUSCH symbols around the DMRS symbol. This latter variant is termed ‘DMRS based CPE removal’ in the tables below.\nTables 5.2.3.9-1 and -2 shows the net impact of PTRS calculations in the presence of phase noise for CP-OFDM with 64 RBs.\nTable 5.2.3.9-1: Net benefit for CP-OFDM with PTRS correction, DMRS based CPE removal\n\nTable 5.2.3.9-2: Net benefit for CP-OFDM with PTRS correction\n\nTable 5.2.3.9-3: 30 GHz EVM floor in relation to -29.2 dB EVM requirement for 256QAM\n\nTables5.2.3.9-4 and -5 shows the net impact of PTRS calculations in the presence of phase noise for DFT-s-OFDM. These projections are somewhat revised from earlier estimates due to algorithm development.\nTable 5.2.3.9-4: Net benefit for DFT-s-OFDM with PTRS correction, DMRS based CPE removal\n\nTable 5.2.3.9-5: Net benefit for DFT-s-OFDM with PTRS correction\n\nTable 5.2.3.9-6: 30 GHz EVM floor in relation to -29.2 dB EVM requirement for 256QAM\n\nR4-2304601\nIn R4-2300707, we proposed an UL256QAM-worthy phase noise profile out of the profiles in TR38.803 as follows:\nFhybrid(f) = min[Fex1(f),Fex2(f)]\nThe WF R4-2303491 also recorded another phase noise profile as a candidate, referred to simply as ‘option 2’ for brevity. Figures 2.1-1 shows the proposed profiles in relation to the phase noise profile in the TR.\nThese profiles were evaluated with test signals with no impairment other than phase noise. While impractical, this simplification is useful to isolate the EVM impact due to phase noise and associated processing. Tables below summarize findings. Constellation diagrams are included in the Annex.\n\n\n\nGiven the EVM requirement of -29.1 dB, FR2-1 UEs that can reasonably support UL256QAM seem to be limited to 24-30 GHz. It further appears that the ‘Option 2’ profile has too much high-offset phase noise to support 256QAM. We therefore propose to adopt the only phase noise profile that seems able to support UL256QAM among the WF options. A further consideration is to use the favorable 30 GHz phase noise assumption to establish requirements that advanced UEs in the future can support in higher bands.\nObservation 1: UL256QAM looks infeasible with the ‘Option 2’ profile [WF R4-2303491] even for n257, n258 and n261.\nR4-2304689\nThere were two new phase noise models proposed in last meeting, one is to adopt (example 1, example 2), and the other one is to adopt new parameters based on the multi-pole/zero model. By considering the existing two ones, there are four phase noise model alternatives as below:\nAlternative 1. example 1 defined in 38803\nAlternative 2. example 2 defined in 38803\nAlternative 3. min(example 1, example 2)\nAlternative 4. example 1 defined in 38803 with parameters updated\nFigure 5.2.3.10-1shows the phase noise profiles for different alternatives.\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 5.2.3.10-1,\" depicts a phase noise profile comparison between different alternatives. The figure illustrates the impact of various factors on the phase noise of a communication system, such as the number of antennas, the distance between the antennas, and the power levels of the signals. The comparison is made by comparing the phase noise levels of the different alternatives, which are represented by different colors and shapes. The figure provides valuable insights into the design and performance of communication systems, particularly in the context of 5G networks.\nFigure 5.2.3.10-1. Phase noise profile comparison between different alternatives\nFrom figure 5.2.3.10-1 we can find that lower phase noise can be achieved by alternative 3 and alternative 4 compared to the example 1 and example 2. In table 5.2.3.10-1, we compare the EVM performance for the above alternatives for CP-OFDM@45GHz, which is same conditions as in companies’ paper in last meeting.\nTable 5.2.3.10-1 EVM comparison between different alternatives\nFrom table 5.2.3.10-1 we can find that alt 3 can achieve much smaller phase noise which means much smaller EVM can be expected @ 45GHz. Although the simulation is for 45GHz, it is reasonable to expect that the same results can be applied for other millimeter wave frequency.\nFor alt 3, although smallest phase noise can be achieved, the logic to minimize both example 1 and example 2 may not be clear. As explained in TS38.803, example 1 is based upon measurements made on a prototype CMOS device, with a larger PLL bandwidth, and example 2 is based on recent research on technology capabilities for UE and BS where CMOS is considered for the UE and GaAs is considered for the BS, so a lower PLL bandwidth than example 1 can be assumed for example2. It is clearly that Example 2 distinguishes UE and BS while example 1 is the common model for both UE and BS, from this perspective, the reasons for directly taking the minimum value of both, min(Ex 1, Ex 2), are not very clear. Nevertheless, we still believe the lower phase noise can not only improve the EVM performance, but also improve the MPR requirements.\nObservation 1: Smallest phase noise can be achieved for Alt 3, i.e. min(Ex1, Ex2), and lower EVM caused by phase noise can be expected.\n\nCP-OFDM:\n\nDFT-s-OFDM:\n\nCP-OFDM\n\nDFT-s-OFDM\n\n",

In this clause, the simulated MPR values of PC2 UL 256QAM according to the phase noise profile are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. It was found that the MPR value for 29 GHz can be improved by 0~1 dB by using the phase noise profile of case 2 and case 3 compared to the exisiting case1.\nObservation 3: The MPR value for 29 GHz can be improved by 0~1 dB by using the phase noise profile of case 2 and case 3 compared to the case 1.\nR4-2312237 MPR simulation for PC2 with low AM-PM distortion PA\nTable 5.2.4.2-10 phase noise profiles\n\nWe recognize the AM-PM distortion is the key factor for the MPR value based on our mmWave transceiver system. So, we performed MPR simulation with low AM-PM distortion PA. The low AM-PM distortion PA has only few degrees distortion until the AM-AM drops. The MPR result comparison between general PA and Low AM-PM distortion PA are showed in table 2 for 29 GHz and table 3 for 39 GHz.\n-DFT-s-OFDM for 100 MHz CBW\nMPR value with Option2 phase noise profile and low AM-PM distortion PA is improved about 1~1.5 dB over MPR with Option2 phase noise profile only.\n-CP-OFDM for 100 MHz CBW\nMPR value with Option2 phase noise profile and low AM-PM distortion PA is improved about 0.5~1 dB over MPR using only Option2 phase noise profile.The CP-OFDM waveform has a high PAPR, so the AM-AM distortion is more critical to the MPR value. That’s why the MPR improvement is less than DFT-s-OFDM when the lower AM-PM distortion PA is applied.\n\n-DFT-s-OFDM for 400 MHz CBW\nThe MPR value with Option2 phase noise profile and low AM-PM distortion PA is improved about 0~0.5 dB. The limiting factor for 400 MHz DFT-s-OFDM is IBE&EVM, so it has low improvement.\n-CP-OFDM for 400 MHz CBW\nThe MPR value with Option2 phase noise profile and low AM-PM distortion PA is improved about 0~1 dB over MPR using only Option2 phase noise profile.\nObservation 1: The lower MPR value with low AM-PM distortion PA than MPR value with general PA is observed.\nTable 5.2.4.2-11 Simulated MPR results for 29 GHz PC2 UL256QAM\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\n\nTable 5.2.4.2-12 Simulated MPR results for 39 GHz PC2 UL256QAM\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\nTable 5.2.4.2-13 MPR results for 29 GHz PC2 UL256QAM with margin\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\nTable 5.2.4.2-14 MPR results for 39 GHz PC2 UL256QAM with margin\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\nTable 4 and table 5 show the MPR value with the margin. We observed the MPR values using Low AM-PM distortion PA are lower than MPR value with general PA model. But, the characteristic of low AM-PM distortion PA is from our mmWave products, so we need to more margin for the MPR valu with low AM-PM distortion. So, we propose the MPR value as the average of the MPR results using the general PA and the MPR results using the low AM-PM distortion PA.\nR4-2315540 MPR simulation for PC1 with low AM-PM distortion PA\nAt the last RAN4#108 meeting, we provided our MPR simulation results R4-2312237 for FR2-1 UL256QAM PC2. We also ran the MPR simulation for PC1 in a similar manner, and the results are shown in Table  5.2.4.2-15 and  5.2.4.2-16.\nObservation 1: The lower MPR value with low AM-PM distortion PA than MPR value with general PA is observed.\n\nTable  5.2.4.2-15 Simulated MPR results for 29 GHz PC1 UL256QAM\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\nTable  5.2.4.2-16 Simulated MPR results for 39 GHz PC1 UL256QAM\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\n\nTable  5.2.4.2-17 MPR results for 29 GHz PC1 UL256QAM with margin\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\n\nTable  5.2.4.2-18 MPR results for 39 GHz PC1 UL256QAM with margin\n\n[start RB position, allocated RB number]\nTable 5.2.4.2-17 and table 5.2.4.2-18 show the MPR value with the margin. We observed the MPR values using Low AM-PM distortion PA are lower than MPR value with general PA model. But, the characteristic of low AM-PM distortion PA is from our mmWave products, so we need to more margin for the MPR valu with low AM-PM distortion. So, we propose the MPR value as the average of the MPR results using the general PA and the MPR results using the low AM-PM distortion PA.\nR4-2311665 simulation results for DFT-s-OFDM PC1/PC2/PC5\nTo simulate the MPR we used the maximum allocation placed at the center of the channel. The phase noise is expected to increase with increasing size of the allocation, and the effect of the IQ imbalance is maximized at the center of the channel.\nIn the simulations we use the multi-zero/pole model with Qualcomm’s parameters.\nIn all cases in the tables below we see the transmit power is limited by the EVM. This explains why the MPR is very similar for all the simulated power classes.\nThe MPR simulation results with different PCs are provided in Tables 1-3, and the EVM budget is provided in Table 4.\nTable 5.2.4.3-1. MPR simulation results for 256QAM with PC1.\n\nTable 5.2.4.3-2. MPR simulation results for 256QAM with PC2.\n\nTable 5.2.4.3-3. MPR simulation results for 256QAM with PC5.\n\nTable 5.2.4.3-4. EVM budget for DFT-s-OFDM at 29 GHz. RB start position 0, number of RBs 64, SCS 120 kHz.\n\nR4-2315265 simulation results for CP-OFDM PC1/PC2/PC5\nTo simulate the MPR we used the full allocation as the phase noise is expected to increase with increasing size of the allocation.\nIn the simulations at 29 GHz we use the multi-zero/pole model with Qualcomm’s parameters. We do not use PTRS.\nIn all cases in the tables below we see the transmit power is limited by the EVM. This explains why the MPR is very similar for all the simulated power classes.\nThe MPR simulation results with different PCs are provided in Tables 5.2.4.3-5 to 5.2.4.3-7, and the EVM budget is provided in Table 5.2.4.3-8.\nTable 5.2.4.3-5 MPR simulation results for 256QAM with PC1 at 29 GHz.\n\nTable 5.2.4.3-6 MPR simulation results for 256QAM with PC2 at 29 GHz.\n\nTable 5.2.4.3-7 MPR simulation results for 256QAM with PC5 at 29 GHz.\n\nTable 5.2.4.3-8 EVM budget for CP-OFDM at 29 GHz. RB start position 0, number of RBs 64, SCS 120 kHz.\n\nWe notice that the backoff values from our simulations are smaller than other companies. This could result from differences in the linearity of the used power amplifier. We also studied the effect of the IQ imbalance that affects the EVM quota left for PA non-linearity and other transmitter impairments. For our results above we used IQ imbalance of -37.3dBc and carrier leakage of -31.6 dBc. When we used -36 dBc for both we obtained about 0.5 dB larger MPR values for CP-OFDMA.\nWe also studied the phase noise contribution to EVM at 39 GHz without PTRS. We used the phase noise model from MTK. The results are presented in Table 5.2.4.3-9.\nTable 5.2.4.3-9 Contribution of phase noise to EVM at 39 GHz. RB start position 0, number of RBs 64, SCS 120 kHz.

However, considering the challenge for real wideband device design, e.g., the droop effect at the bandwidth edge, the EVM of 400MHz may be further degraded which leads to higher MPR than previous simulation results, so it is proposed to reserve 1.5 dB margin for 400MHz case compared to 200MHz.\nObservation 3: The 256QAM MPR simulation results are insensitive to the channel bandwidth but the challenge of wideband device design should be considered in MPR requirement.\nR4-2315808\nIn the last meeting, many simulation results of FR2 256QAM are provided, but one interesting issue was raised in the last meeting R4-2314677:\n\nNew issue: What’s about the MPR for 39GHz?\nProposals\nOption 1: Defined the same MPR with 29GHz\nOption 2: Consider some margin for 39GHz because the phase noise profile performance between 29GHz and 39GHz is different\nOption 3: Others\nAgreement:\nFFS\nFor other lower modulation orders, either PTRS configuration or phase noised is not considered in MPR evaluation and the evaluation results can be frequency agnostic, but in FR2 256QAM, the phase noise, which is closely related to the frequency, is inserted, so the MPR value may be different for different band.\nObservation 1: The phase noise is not considered in the modulation order other than 256QAM in FR2.\nObservation 2: The phase noise profile is closely related to the frequency.\nTo compare the difference, the MPR simulation results are shown in following figures:\nThe figure depicts the simulation results of a 256QAM modulation scheme without phase noise, showing the performance of the MPR (Maximum Permissive Ratio) in a 5G network.

If we don’t redefine the RB allocation regions, the MPR values for outer allocation, region 1 inner allocation and region 2 inner allocation are almost same.\nDue to time constraints, we don’t finish the simulation for PC1 all RB allocations of 39GHz, to compare the MPR difference of 39GHz with 29GHz due to the difference of phase noise profiles, we only give simulation results for some RB allocations based CP-OFDM of 200MHz channel bandwidth with 120kHz SCS, Table 2.1-5 gave the simulation results based on different IQ images:\nTable 5.2.4.6-6 MPR values of 39GHz and 29GHz for PC1\n\nDue to we used 28GHz PA model, the MPR values are larger for 39GHz than the values of 29GHz. In additional, we simulation the MPR values for 39GHz with different IQ image values, from table 2.1-5, we can see, the MPR value will be reduced when we using smaller IQ image. So, the MPR values of 39GHz are related not only to phase noise profile but also to PA model. Therefore, the MPR values of 39GHz could be modified by choosing suitable PA model.\nR4-2313190 simulation results for PC1\nTo investigate the feasibility of confining the MPR for UL 256QAM, the MPR for CP-OFDM for 100 MHz and 400 MHz BW are simulated for PC1 with 120 kHz SCS.

The MPR simulation results for CP-OFDM with 120 kHz SCS for PC1\n\nBased on the simulated results, it can be observed that for 400 MHz, the MPR values are well below the “64QAM MPR + 3dB” range. Though not all cases (inner region of 100 MHz) can be well-fitted within the proposed range, the values are not far from the proposed limits for narrower BW. In addition, it is worth mentioning that no advanced linearity technologies, e.g., DPD or APD, have been included in such a simulation. Therefore, it can be expected that the MPR confinement, as mentioned above, is feasible to be used to define the MPR values for 256 QAM.\nR4-2315561 simulation results for PC1\nThe MPR for CP-OFDM for 100 MHz and 400 MHz BW are simulated for PC1 with 120 kHz SCS.

In general, the results without PTRS for CP-OFDM are 1 to 0.5 dB worse than the PTRS configuration (L-PTRS = 1 K-PTRS =2).\nTable 5.2.4.7-2 The MPR simulation results for CP-OFDM with 120 kHz SCS for PC1 with PTRS L-PTRS = 1 K-PTRS =2\n\nTable 5.2.4.7-3 The MPR simulation results for CP-OFDM with 120 kHz SCS for PC1 without PTRS\n\nR4-2313417 simulation results for PC2\nIn the Tx, the EVM performance is determined by many factors including baseband clipping and quantization, transmitter non-linearity, IQ imbalance, phase noise, PA non-linearity, etc. In RAN4 #106, the approved agreement for EVM budget is listed below:\nEVM budget for MPR evaluation:\n-\tOnly consider the total value of 3.5% for Tx EVM\n-\tCompanies need to clarify the components of Tx EVM in their simulation results, including\n-\tPhase noise\n-\tValue for IQ imbalance\n-\tPA and transmitter non-linearity\n\nTable 5.2.4.8-1 EVM budget for FR2-1 UL 256QAM MPR at 29GHz and 39GHz\n\nIn the FR2-1 UL 256QAM MPR simulation, we propose the EVM budget with approved phase noise profiles in the last meeting summarized in Table 1. With current 39GHz phase noise profile, it should be noted that the phase noise performance of 39GHz dominates the EVM budget for 3.5% EVM. PA requires more back-off power to compensate the quality of the transmitting signal. In our initial simulations, MPR for 29GHz UL 256QAM could achieve reasonable MPR value. However, the MPR value for 39GHz UL 256QAM could be too large and this will result in insufficient dynamic range.\nObservation 1: With current 39GHz phase noise profile, it should be noted that the phase noise performance of 39GHz dominates the EVM budget for 3.5% EVM. PA requires more back-off power to compensate the quality of the transmitting signal. In our initial simulations, MPR for 29GHz UL 256QAM could achieve reasonable MPR value. However, the MPR value for 39GHz UL 256QAM could be too large and this will result in insufficient dynamic range.\nIn FR1, the MPR of 256QAM is entirely determined by the EVM. This could be also expected for FR2-1. Therefore, in this contribution, we provide our initial MPR simulation for the EVM by using our phase noise model and Qualcomm’s phase noise model with full RB allocation in 100 MHz BW with 120 kHz SCS.\nTable 5.2.4.8-2. PC2 MPR simulated results\n\nR4-2315559 simulation results for PC1 and PC2/5\nIn the last meeting, RAN4 reached an agreement that there would be no PTRS configuration for EVM testing in both DFT-S-OFDM and CP-OFDM. In R4-2313417, and we also presented our initial MPR simulation by utilizing both MTK's phase noise model and Qualcomm's phase noise model, with full RB allocation in a 100 MHz bandwidth and 120 kHz SCS. Based on the simulation results, we observed that the MPR requirements, without PTRS compensation, using both MTK's and Qualcomm's phase noise models, were almost identical. Therefore, for further MPR evaluation, we just considered MTK's phase noise model.\nObservation 1: For MPR requirements without PTRS compensation, both MTK's and Qualcomm's phase noise models are nearly identical. It is sufficient to just use one of these two models for further evaluation.\nMPR simulations were conducted for both CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM with 100 MHz and 400 MHz bandwidth for PC1/2/5 using a 120 kHz SCS. In our simulation, it is important to note that the MPR requirements for 256QAM are solely determined by the EVM. Additionally, if taking into account droop effects from the circuits between the baseband BB, IF, and RF, a 1.5dB MPR margin should be reserved for the 400 MHz bandwidth.\nObservation 2: MPR requirements for 256QAM are solely determined by the EVM.\nBased on the simulation results and analysis, we propose the FR2-1 256QAM MPR values for PC1/2/5 as shown in Table 2-5.\nTable 5.2.4.8-3 MPRWT for power class 1, BWchannel ≤ 200 MHz\n\nTable  5.2.4.8-4 MPRWT for power class 1, BWchannel = 400 MHz\n\nTable  5.2.4.8-5 MPRWT for power class 2/5, BWchannel ≤ 200 MHz\n\nTable  5.2.4.8-6 MPRWT for power class 2/5, BWchannel = 400 MHz\n\nR4-2315054 simulation results for PC1/PC5\nIn the discussion below, we assume mass producible and commercially feasible UEs assuming best possible design practices.  In this context, among current UL waveforms, 256QAM remains distinct from the others on account of the proximity of the EVM requirement (-29.1 dB) to the floors introduced by multiple impairment mechanisms in the Tx chain. In contrast, lower modulation complexity waveforms are limited principally by PA distortion. The aforementioned sensitivities to various assumptions like phase noise floor, image levels, and various floors from stages preceding the PA can cause large variation in MPR projections for 256QAM. This effect is demonstrated below in figure 5.2.4.9-1 for PC5 CP-OFDM 256QAM UL. See Annex for calibration details.\n\n\nFrom the examples above, projected MPR can vary from ~8 dB to ~ 12 dB just by manipulating image suppression levels between 36 and 38 dBc and substituting a conservative (padded) estimate of implementation-worthy phase noise in place of the profile RAN4 has identified as suitable for 256QAM [5]. Further variation is likely when varying assumptions for other impairment floors are considered.\nObservation 1: MPR projections for 256QAM can be very sensitive to estimates of impairment floors from multiple mechanisms in the Tx chain of the UE.\nObservation 1 demonstrates that MPR determination from UE performance projections can be even more challenging than for other modulation types. It may be necessary to view each proposal paired with the associated floor assumptions. For the remainder of the contribution, we assume implementation quality impairments (image level and other floors are chosen from realistic projections).\nPC5\nFigures 5.2.4.9-2 and -3 shows the MPR difference between 256QAM and 64QAM for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM respectively for devices limited to 23 dBm TRP (includes PC5 as well as PC2/3/4/6).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interesting observation is that it takes less than 3 dB of additional back off to seemingly improve EVM 6 dB (the difference between the EVM requirements for 64 and 256 QAM). To resolve this potentially problematic observation, we studied the gating mechanisms for each case, and found that they indeed change. In the 64QAM case, the MPR allowance is driven by IBE compliance for some corner waveforms and for 256, MPR allowance is driven by EVM compliance. i.e the results do not imply inconsistency or other unphysical behavior.\nObservation 2: With implementation-grade assumptions for a UE limited to 23 dBm TRP, the additional MPR for 256QAM over that of 64 QAM is 3 dB or less.\nPC1\nFigures 5.2.4.9-4 and -5 shows the MPR difference between 256QAM and 64QAM for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM respectively for devices limited to 35 dBm TRP (example: PC1).\n\n\n\n\nIt is evident that for PC1, the pattern of variation is like that of PC5.\nObservation 3: With implementation-grade assumptions for a UE limited to 35 dBm, the additional MPR for 256QAM over that of 64 QAM can be conservatively considered to be 3 dB or less.\nAnnex, calibration condition for PA model\nThe calibration condition for the PA used for MPR projections is shown below – 20RB23 DFT-s-QPSK is expected to operate with no more than 23 dBm TRP for PC5 and 35 dBm for PC1. This is a worst-case scenario for SEM compliance.\n\n\n\nR4-2316379 simulation results for PC1\nWe use the following EVM budget for our further MPR simulation.\nTable 5.2.4.10-1 EVM budget in MPR simulation for 256QAM\n\nThe simulation results is shown in Table 5.2.4.10-1.\nTable 5.2.4.10-1: MPR simulation for 256QAM\n\nBased on the simulation results from companies, below tables list the average values for 29GHz PC1/PC2/PC5 MPR:\nTable 5.2.4.11-1 PC1 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 29 GHz with BWchannel ≤200 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nTable 5.2.4.11-2 PC1 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 29 GHz with BWchannel =400 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nTable 5.2.4.11-3 PC2 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 29 GHz with BWchannel ≤ 200 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nTable 5.2.4.11-4 PC2 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 29 GHz with BWchannel =400 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nTable 5.2.4.11-5 PC5 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 29 GHz with BWchannel ≤200 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nTable 5.2.4.11-6 PC5 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 29 GHz with BWchannel =400 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nBased on the simulation results from companies, below tables list the values for 39GHz PC1 MPR:\nTable 5.2.4.12-1 PC1 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 39 GHz with BWchannel ≤200 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\nTable 5.2.4.12-2 PC1 UL 256QAM MPR summary for 39 GHz with BWchannel =400 MHz and 120kHz SCS\n\n",

                            "text_content": "R4-2304601\nThe desired waveform was 256QAM of various allocation sizes and 120 kHz SCS. To isolate the EVM impact of phase noise, no AWGN, image, LO or non-linear distortion products accompanied the signal. The phase noise profile is chosen as the hybrid 30G profile (Proposal 1: Adopting min(example1, example2) as the phase noise profile for UL256QAM, where ‘example’ refers to the example phase noise profiles in TR38.803 for n257, n258 and n261.)\nCP-OFDM\nFor CP-OFDM, PTRS density ranged from no correction to frequency density k=2 and k = 4. Time density was fixed at L = 1. Table 5.2.5.1-1 summarizes the EVM\n\nTable 5.2.5.1-1: EVM penalty for CP-OFDM with PTRS correction\n\nResults show that PTRS corrections seem to help the EVM floor in proportion to the density of PTRS. The effectiveness tapers off for wider allocations, so there is room for optimization in the field.\nObservation 2: A fixed PTRS configuration of K=2, L=1 benefits EVM for CP-OFDM waveforms with the phase noise profile of proposal 1.\nDFT-s-OFDM\nFor DFT-s-OFDM, the configuration ([Nsampgroup, NPT-RSgroup]) are chosen amongst this set: {[4 2], [4 4], [4 8]}. The # of groups was maximized while ensuring there were fewer PTRS data symbols than PDSCH symbols. For all cases, number of PTRS samples per group was limited to 4.The group count is recorded in that tables below.\nTable 5.2.5.1-2: EVM penalty for DFT-s-OFDM with PTRS correction\n\nResults show that PTRS corrections in the configuration above only help narrow allocations (~ 20 or less) of DFT-s-OFDM. PTRS seems like wasted overhead for medium sized allocations (20-64) and can be detrimental for very wide allocations. Here too there is room for optimization in the field.\nObservation 3: Assuming the phase noise profile of proposal 1, only narrow allocations of DFT-s-OFDM waveforms (~20RB or narrower) benefit from PTRS.\nObservation 4: Assuming the phase noise profile of proposal 1, the network is better off not configuring PTRS for allocations wider than 20 RBs.\nThe analysis assumed a certain strategy of how the number of PTRS groups must be reduced in keeping with narrower allocations. Specifically, the total number of symbols available per OFDM symbol is 12*LCRB. Of these, Nsampgroup, * NPT-RSgroup symbols are occupied by PTRS symbols. When the latter product gets comparable to the total number of symbols available per OFDM symbol, PTRS starts to represent a significant overhead. It is also self-evident that 4 symbols per group and 8 groups per OFDM symbol is physically impossible to fit into a 2RB allocation. RAN4 must therefore determine this strategy.\nObservation 5: Unlike CP-OFDM, it is not clear how to adjust PTRS parameters when the number of symbols in each OFDM symbol (12*LCRB) starts to become comparable to the product Nsampgroup, * NPT-RSgroup.\nR4-2308227\nTo further investigate PTRS configuration under different RB allocations, the simulation is performed and the results are shown in Table 5.2.5.2-1. Considering that Option 1 and Option 2 are not feasible, only Option 3 and Option 4 are evaluated.\nTable 5.2.5.2-1 PTRS correction benefit evaluation for different RB allocation\n\nObservation 3: Even under narrow RB allocation, the DFT-s-OFDM still hard to benefit from PTRS correction.\nTake the 8RB case as an example, we further evaluated DFT-s-OFDM with different PTRS configurations, and the simulation results are shown in Table 5.2.5.2-2:\n\nTable 5.2.5.2-2 PTRS correction benefit evaluation for DFT-s-OFDM with narrow RB allocation under different PTRS configurations.\n\nObservation 4: Only configuration L-PTRS = 1, (N_group = 4, N_samp = 4) can make narrow RB allocation benefit from PTRS correction.\nR4-2308805/R4-2318876\nTo further evaluate the effects of different PTRS configurations for CP- OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM, the simulations are done for different RBs allocation (4RBs, 16RBs, 64RBs) separately.\nTable 5.2.5.3-1 and table 5.2.5.3-2 show the simulation results for CP- OFDM at 29GHz and 39GHz. Table 5.2.5.3-3 and table 5.2.5.3-4 show the simulation results for DFT-s- OFDM at 29GHz and 39GHz.\nFor CP- OFDM:\nTable 5.2.5.3-1 EVM floor and benefits with different PTRS configurations for CP-OFDM at 29GHz\nTable  5.2.5.3-2 EVM floor and benefits with different PTRS configurations for CP-OFDM at 39GHz\nFrom Table 5.2.5.3-1 and table  5.2.5.3-2 for CP-OFDM, we can see although the benefits are different for different phase noise profile:\n-\tThe benefits with PTRS correction for all candidate phase noise profiles are monotonously increased with the increase of the density of PTRS configurations.\n-\tThe benefits with PTRS correction for all candidate phase noise profiles are monotonously increased with the number of RBs allocation. For the narrow RBs allocation, the benefits with PTRS correction is comparable with 64RBs allocation for 120kHz SCS.\nFor DFT-S-OFDM:\nTable  5.2.5.3-3 EVM floor and benefits with different PTRS configurations for DFT-S-OFDM at 29GHz\nTable  5.2.5.3-4 EVM floor and benefits with different PTRS configurations for DFT-S-OFDM at 39GHz\n\nFrom Table 5.2.5.3-3 and table 5.2.5.3-4 for DFT-s-OFDM at 29GHzand 39GHz, we can see although the benefits are different for different phase noise profile:\nThe benefits with PTRS correction for all candidate phase noise profiles are monotonously increased with the increase of the density of PTRS configurations.\nThe benefits with PTRS correction for all candidate phase noise profiles are monotonously reduced with the number of RBs allocation.\nThere is obvious benefit with PTRS correction only for example 2 new phase noise profiles.\nThere is no obvious benefits with PTRS correction for the RBs allocation larger than 10RBs for new phase noise profiles from Qualcomm and MTK, even some PTRS configurations have the penalty for the new phase noise profiles.\nThere is obvious benefits with PTRS correction for the RBs allocation less than 10RBs for new phase noise profiles from Qualcomm and MTK, especially for (N_group = 4, N_samp = 4) PTRS configuration, i.e., 1dB and 0.7dB benefits for 29GHz for 4RBs allocation for 120kHz SCS, 0.8dB and 0.6dB for 39GHz for 4RBs allocation for 120kHz SCS.\nAs we know, introducing PTRS will increase the data code rate, especially for narrow RB allocation. In order to check the impact of PTRS, we further compare the BLER performance between PTRS off and PTRS on with different RB allocation for DFT-S-OFDM waveform. The simulation assumption is same with the agreed for evaluation of phase noise profiles in lasting meeting and QC phase noise profile at 29GHz is applied. The background noise is set to -35dB. As we can see from above simulation results, the BLER increase for both 4RB and 64RB allocation when PTRS is configured shown as Table 5.2.5.3-5. For 4RB allocation, although there is EVM benefit as previous analyzation, the BLER increase due to high PTRS overhead. For 64RB, the BLER increase due to the joint effect of EVM penalty and overhead of PTRS. For 10RB, maybe there is a trade-off between PTRS overhead and EVM benefit, the BLER is same for PTRS on/off. In short, except for the case that example 2 phase noise profile is applied for MPR simulation, it may not be recommended to configure PTRS.\nTable  5.2.5.3-5 the BLER for different RBs allocation with/without PTRS corrections\n\nR4-2312686/R4-2318876\nFor CP-OFDM, based on the submitted simulation results in last meeting [R4-2308805], we can see the benefits with PTRS correction are monotonously increased with the number of RBs allocation. If adopting the fixed PTRS configuration of L-PTRS = 1 K-PTRS =2, it is good for full RBs allocation in EVM test, but the overhead for partial RBs allocation need consider.\nTable 5.2.5.3-6: PT-RS group pattern as a function of scheduled bandwidth\n\nFor DFT-s-OFDM, based PTRS group pattern in Table 5.2.5.3-6, we introduced more simulation cases and the simulation results for some PTRS configurations under different RB allocations are shown in Table 5.2.5.3-7 and Table 5.2.5.3-8.\nTable 5.2.5.3-7 EVM floor and benefits with different PTRS configurations for DFT-S-OFDM at 29GHz\nTable 5.2.5.3-8 EVM floor and benefits with different PTRS configurations for DFT-S-OFDM at 39GHz\n\nFrom above tables for DFT-s-OFDM at 29GHzand 39GHz, we can see:\n-\tThe benefits with PTRS correction are monotonously increased with the increase of the density of PTRS configurations.\n-\tThe benefits with PTRS correction are monotonously reduced with the number of RBs allocation.\n-\tThere is no obvious benefits with PTRS correction for the RBs allocation larger than 10RBs, even some PTRS configurations have the penalty.\n-\tThere is obvious benefits with PTRS correction for the RBs allocation less than 10RBs, especially for (N_group = 4, N_samp = 4) PTRS configuration.\n\nR4-2314619\nFor DFT-s-OFDM waveform, the results for EVM comparison between different RB allocations are summarized in Table 5.2.5.4-1, in which the phase noise model for 29GHz (i.e. option 1.) agreed in the WF R4-2310260 is used.\nTable 5.2.5.4-1 EVM comparison between different configurations for DFT-s-OFDM waveform\n\nFrom table 5.2.5.4-1, it can be seen that the net benefit of CPE is only 0.1dB for full RB allocation, however, for partial RB allocation, even negative net benefits is found. It would be foreseen that this tendency can be applied to all the start allocation for the partial RB. Therefore, we think PTRS for CPE will not provide EVM benefit for all RB allocation cases for DFT-s-OFDM.\nObservation 1: Introducing PTRS for CPE for DFT-s-OFDM may not improve EVM or the improvement is very small.\nWith regard to the PTRS configuration for EVM test for CP-OFDM, we can see that the difference between the two options is whether to configure PTRS for EVM test based on the UEs declaration or to configure the same PTRS without considering UE declaration. Currently, how UEs declare whether they need PTRS or not is FFS. In our contribution[R4-2304689], we compared net benefit of PTRS for CPE for different UE phase noise model alternatives for CP-OFDM, we copy the results in table 5.2.5.4-2 for convenience.\nTable 5.2.5.4-2. EVM comparison between different alternatives\n\nThe four phase noise options in the above table are:\n-\tAlt 1. example 1 defined in 38803\n-\tAlt 2. example 2 defined in 38803\n-\tAlt 3. min(example 1, example 2)\n-\tAlt 4. example 1-based\nIn table 5.2.5.4-2, when the low phase noise model (i.e. alt 3.) is adopted, the net benefit of PTRS is promising. But companies have different views of the PTRS configuration, e.g., some companies prefer to use PTRS for all device and others prefer to use PTRS if UE declare to use it. From the contributions [3][4]provided by companies we can see that PTRS based CPE can improve EVM at least for CP-OFDM waveform. If most companies believe that PTRS based CPE can improve EVM for CP-OFDM waveform, then we tend to use the same PTRS configuration for all devices.\nObservation 2: Introducing PTRS for CPE can improve EVM for CP-OFDM waveform.\n\nFor CP-OFDM at 29GHz:\nTable 5.2.5.5-1: For CP-OFDM at 29GHz\n\nFor DFT-s-OFDM at 29GHz:\nTable 5.2.5.6-1: For DFT-s-OFDM at 29GHz\n\n\n",

However, these bands are also subject to challenging propagating conditions such as high path loss, absorption from the environment, penetration losses to name a few. To overcome these, beam management procedures have been defined in 3GPP and beam correspondence is one of the main aspects of beam management. Beam correspondence is the ability of the UE to determine its uplink transmit beam based on downlink measurements on one or more Rx beams. UE beam correspondence functionality for RRC_CONNECTED, RRC_INACTIVE and initial access in IDLE have already been specified in the RAN1 and RAN2 specifications in Release 15 but FR2 UE beam correspondence requirements have not yet been defined for RRC_INACTIVE and initial access in IDLE.\nWithout UE beam correspondence requirements for initial access and RRC_INACTIVE it is not possible to ensure good UE Random access Msg1/Msg A performance and uplink coverage in FR2 deployments due to varying UE performances.\nRel-15 RRC_INACTIVE and Rel-17 Small data transmission (SDT) have a large potential in UE power efficiency, latency and signalling overhead reduction. RRC_INACTIVE allows for reduced latency and UE power saving, while SDT further enhances this for small data sessions. Considering that UE power savings are especially important for successful FR2 operations and good end-user experience, it would be important that the networks could efficiently utilize RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmissions for FR2 as well.\nSmall data transmission procedures have been defined in 3GPP Rel-17 for SDT-RA for both two step and four step RA during RRC Inactive with a view of providing power saving opportunities and reducing overhead signalling. Without well performing UE beam correspondence support, wide usage of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission may not be feasible in practical FR2 deployments. To enable efficient use of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission in FR2 deployments to save UE power with reasonable latencies it is important to develop FR2 UE beam correspondence requirements for RRC_INACTIVE in Rel-18.\n",

                    "text_content": "One of the main characteristics of 5G NR beam management procedures is using directive beams hence requiring beam alignment between the UE and the base station. In FR2, the UE uses the beam refinement procedure to have narrow highly directive beams towards the gNodeB thereby increasing the uplink coverage. During a Random access procedure, the UE could use both the rough and fine beams. An example of UE simulated at 28 GHz (band n257) with 1x4 array placed on the sides of a smart phone in free space (no user presence). We assume all the UE surroundings, UE model, and antenna model are the same, only change the beam width. The simulation results in Figure 6.2-1 and Figure 6.2-2 show the EIRP coverage curves (using different simulation assumptions, UE surroundings, UE model, and antenna model may cause different results).\n\nThe figure depicts a spherical coverage map for single and multiple broad beams, highlighting the coverage area for Nokia's EIPR technology. The map shows the coverage of the EIPR system in different scenarios, including single and multiple broad beams, with different beam widths and angles. The coverage area is represented by the radius of the sphere, and the coverage is depicted by the area of the sphere. The figure provides a visual representation of the coverage distribution for Nokia's EIPR technology, allowing for a better understanding of the system's performance in different scenarios.\nFigure 6.2-1. EIPR spherical coverage for single and multiple broad beams (Nokia)\n\nThe figure depicts a spherical coverage for an envelope of narrow beams, which is a key concept in the field of wireless communication. The figure illustrates the coverage area of a narrow beam, which is essential for efficient communication in dense urban environments. The coverage area is represented by the envelope of the narrow beam, which is a mathematical representation of the signal strength distribution in the environment. The figure is used to understand the spatial distribution of the signal strength and to optimize the placement of the narrow beam to maximize the coverage area.\nFigure 6.2-2: EIRP spherical coverage for envelope of narrow beams (Nokia)\n\nIn this example, the current requirements in RRC_CONNETED mode of 11.5 dBm EIRP at 50MHz CBW and at 50%-ile is represented with the grey box. In Figure 6.2-1, the blue curve, purple curve, and red curve represent the spherical coverage of a broad beam from one panel, the sum of spherical coverages of 2 broad beams from two 2 panels, and the sum of spherical coverages of 3 broad beams from two 3 panels. In Figure 6.2-2, the blue curve represents the envelope of narrow beams with a single panel with 4 elements active. The purple curve represents the sum of envelopes of narrow beams from two 2 panels, and each with 4 elements active. The red curve represents the sum of envelopes of narrow beams from two 3 panels, and each with 4 elements active.\nAs illustrated above, the spherical coverage at the 50%-ile is 16.5 – 19 dBm in Figure 6.2-1 and 21.4 – 24.2 dBm in Figure 6.2-2. The choice of using narrow beams and using broad beams has a big impact to the EIRP spherical coverage of a UE. We can also observe that the EIPR spherical coverage increases as the number of panels increases.\nDuring random access procedure for Initial access or even handovers, cell reselection and other scenarios where Random access is required, the 3GPP standards do not mandate the beam type the UE used. This is up to UE implementation if a rough beam or a narrow beam is to be used and how to achieve beam refinement.\nWhen UE needs to use a refined beam towards the gNodeB to increase the uplink coverage, UE can use SSB during the beam refinement procedure, which is periodically broadcasted every 20 ms. Alternatively, some companies think that UE can also use Tracking reference signal (TRS) signals defined in 3GPP Rel-17 in IDLE and INACTIVE modes. The TRS has a QCL relation to the SSB which can be configured in SIB17. The highest configurable allocation of TRS is two consecutive slots with 2 symbols per slot TRS for IDLE mode and a periodicity of 10 slots, which amounts to 4 occasions to refine UE beam every 1.25 ms in FR2 120 KHz SCS. UE has many more occasions to refine its beams using the IDLE/INACTIVE mode TRS as compared to when it uses SSB.\n",

                            "text_content": "In RRC connected state, beam correspondence requirement is considered as fulfilled if the UE meets the corresponding minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirement for that power class with its chosen UL beams with or without relying on uplink beam sweeping. Beam correspondence tolerance requirement could also be considered for UE supporting beam management relying on UL beam sweeping.\nWhile in initial access and RRC_INACTIVE state, UL beam sweeping is not available. The focus is how to specify UE beam correspondence requirements for SSB-based beam correspondence without UL beam sweeping as well as the implication to legacy UE capabilities.\nRAN4 discussion is mainly focused on minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirement for beam correspondence in initial access and RRC_INACTIVE state in R18. Since the UE behavior for beam management in initial access, RA-SDT and CG-SDT in RRC_INACTIVE state is the same, common set of beam correspondence requirement can be defined to well accommodate these scenarios. To save test effort, the beam correspondence requirement only needs to be tested for initial access based on Msg1 which is thought to be the most critical scenario.\n1.\tMinimum peak EIRP\nSSB based beam correspondence requirement for minimum peak for RRC_CONNECTED state is based on fine beam implementation which is considered as too restrictive and not applicable for initial access from the perspective of addressing different beam type implementation.\nMinimum peak EIRP will not be considered for initial access.\n2.\tSpherical coverage requirement at 50%-tile\nSSB-based spherical coverage requirement in RRC_CONNECTED state is considered as the starting point for beam correspondence requirement in initial access. The impact of power control is further considered for beam correspondence requirement in initial access.\nPower tolerance is not considered in existing beam correspondence requirements. The main reason is the existing beam correspondence tests are specified in CONNECTED STATE, where there are multiple UL transmission opportunities and closed-loop power control is also available. In this case, UE has sufficient opportunity during the test to ramp up the power and make MOP accurate.\nIn contrast, only open loop power control is possible for random access during initial access and UE may not have opportunity to transmit and complete the power control, i.e., precisely transmit at MOP, before sending Msg1.\nA simulation is performed to show the impact of power accuracy. Assuming that the maximum power deviation ∆P is 3.5 dB with a uniform distribution, the results show that when ∆P~U (-3.5, 3.5), the performance degradation of 50%-tile spherical coverage is 0.3 dB.\nThe figure depicts a spherical coverage with ∆P~U (-3.5, 3.5) in a 5G network, illustrating the coverage area and the impact of the 5G signal on the environment. The figure highlights the importance of 5G signal propagation in enhancing network coverage and reducing latency.\nFigure 6.3.1-1 Spherical coverage with ∆P~U (-3.5, 3.5)\n\nTo accommodate this concern, RAN4 agreed that the spherical coverage requirement for beam correspondence in initial access is specified the same as the requirements in TABLE 6.2.1.3-3 in TS 38.101-2 with 2 dB power tolerance (e.g., min EIRP at 50%-tile CDF in initial access is up to 2dB less than the requirements specified in table 6.2.1.3-3 with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping).\nThe related feature is defined as mandatory for R18 onward UE.\nSide conditions\nFor the beam correspondence in initial access and RRC_INACTIVE, UE shall meet the spherical coverage requirement with the same side conditions for the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence.\n",

                    "text_content": "Unlike traditional RF requirements defined in the RRC_CONNECTED state, beam correspondence for initial access needs to be verified in RRC_IDLE, and several potential testability issues were raised during the discussion. The following aspects of test related issues were identified:\n-\tVerification in RRC_IDLE\nIn general, the power test needs to be averaged over a period, which requires the UE to remain in RRC_IDLE and multiple PRACH transmission need to be triggered, so testing mode including holding RAR should be considered. The accumulative period of measurement for PRACH transmission shall be at least 1 ms.\n-\tMaximum output power for PRACH\nTo guarantee stable test results, the requirement is defined and verified under maximum output power (MOP). Since the open loop power control is used for PRACH, how to ensure that the UE reaches and maintains MOP is a problem that has to be faced. During the initial access, the UE measures the RSRP and estimates the PL based on the broadcasted DL RS power at first. The required power for PRACH transmission will be calculated based on the estimated PL and the target Rx power at gNB and compares with the Pcmax if configured. The power control for PRACH is defined in [1] as:\n[dBm],\nwhere  is a pathloss calculated by the UE in dB as referenceSignalPower – higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm, and referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower. The parameter  is the PRACH target reception power PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER provided by higher layers as specified in clause 5.1.3 of [2]:\nThe MAC entity shall, for each Random Access Preamble:\n-\t1> if PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER is greater than one; and\n-\t1> if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been received from lower layers; and\n-\t1> if LBT failure indication was not received from lower layers for the last Random Access Preamble transmission; and\n-\t1> if SSB or CSI-RS selected is not changed from the selection in the last Random Access Preamble transmission:\n-\t2> increment PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER by 1.\n-\t1> select the value of DELTA_PREAMBLE according to clause 7.3;\n-\t1> set PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER to preambleReceivedTargetPower + DELTA_PREAMBLE + (PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER – 1) × PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP + POWER_OFFSET_2STEP_RA;\nUE can ramp up its power when RAR is held since it will trigger PRACH retransmission, and adjusting each individual RA response window may affect the overall test time. UE may also achieve MOP quickly by setting the preambleReceivedTargetPower properly with as few as possible PRACH re-transmission. Based on the analysis above, The PRACH can achieve MOP by holding RAR with well-defined parameters. In addition, during the initial access, UE might start transmitting preamble once it detects the SSB RSRP higher than preconfigured threshold on one RX beam, even if this RX beam is not the optimal one that UE could form, so the test function need to be considered. The details of test function and the details of the parameter configured in the test can be left to RAN5.\n-\tBeam lock function\nCurrently, the beam lock function is only available in the RRC_CONNECTED state, and if the beam lock function is absent during the verification in RRC_IDLE, many complex issues will appear, e.g., when the RAR is held to trigger PRACH retransmission, UE may attempt other beams since the RAR is not received which may lead to unstable test. It also will be difficult to measure the θ (or φ) component EIRP under φ (or θ) link polarization without beam lock function. In [3], the LS from RAN5 concludes it is feasible to introduce beam lock function for RRC_IDLE, so the concern above can be solved. RAN4 concludes that dedicated beam lock function for RRC_IDLE state is needed, and the details of new beam lock function design can be left to RAN5.\n-\tImpact of power control accuracy\n[TBA]\n\n\n\n",
