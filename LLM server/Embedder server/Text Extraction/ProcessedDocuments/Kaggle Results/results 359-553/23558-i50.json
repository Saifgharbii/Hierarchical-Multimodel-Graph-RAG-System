In such deployments, EDGE-10 interface is used both for exchanging of ECS profile during ECS discovery and for exchanging EDN configuration information during service provisioning information retrieval.\nThe figure depicts a federation architecture for support, illustrating the various components and their interconnections.

This configuration includes the necessary address information for the EEC to establish connection with the EES(s).\nIf the ECS deployed by MNO is contracted with one or more ECSP(s), the ECS provides EES configuration information of MNO owned and ECSP owned EESs via MNO ECS as described in clause 8.3.3.3.3.\nIf the ECS is deployed by a non-MNO ECSP, the ECS endpoint address may be configured with the EEC. An EEC that is aware of multiple ECSP's ECS endpoint addresses may perform the service provisioning procedure per ECS of each ECSP multiple times.\nFigure 8.3.1-1 illustrates an overview of service provisioning. Service provisioning procedures support the following models:\n-\tRequest/Response model; and\n-\tSubscribe/Notify model.\n\nThe figure depicts an overview of service provisioning in a 5G network, illustrating the various stages and components involved in the service delivery process. Key elements include the network slicing, network slicing service, and network slicing service provider. The figure highlights the importance of network slicing in enabling flexible and efficient network management, as well as the role of network slicing service providers in providing tailored services to end users.\nFigure 8.3.1-1: Overview of Service provisioning\nThe UE is given configuration information enabling it to connect to the ECS. The UE can then request initial provisioning from the ECS to obtain configuration required to connect to the EDN. Once provisioned, the EEC of the UE registers with the selected EES(s) from the list of provisioned EES(s) it received from the ECS(s), if the EEC registration configuration in EES profile indicates that EEC registration is required. The UE further consumes the edge computing services and performs various operations such as EAS discovery, Edge application communications, ACR, etc. While the UE is consuming the edge computing services, the UE or ECS may be triggered to re-request service provisioning.\nThe triggers for service provisioning are classified as:\na.\tTriggers at UE - Some examples are:\n-\tAC related updates available at the EEC due to AC installation/re-installation, AC requesting application server access (e.g. via internet browser);\n-\tEEC supporting one or more ACs may be updated due to EEC re-installation; and\n-\tLifetime of EDN Configuration Information is expired or the EEC detects that the UE moves out of EDN Service Area in the EDN Configuration Information.\nb.\tTriggers at ECS – Some examples are:\n-\tEES updates received due to EAS installation/re-installation/re-location; and\n-\tECS receives the EDN/DNAI change notification of the UE from 5GC when the ECS subscribes to the user plane path management events as specified in clause 8.10.2.\n",

The figure also shows the steps for service provisioning, including the requestor's identity, the service to be provided, and the service provider's response.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.2-1: Service provisioning – Request/Response\n1.\tThe EEC sends a service provisioning request to the ECS. The service provisioning request includes the security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure and may include the UE identifier such as GPSI, connectivity information, UE location, EEC service continuity support and AC profile(s) information. EEC may provide its desired ECSP identifier(s) in the service provisioning request based on EEC preference.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. The ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If the UE serving PLMN identifier is not provided by the EEC in the connectivity information of the service provisioning request, the ECS may invoke the NEF monitoring event API as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [43] and 3GPP TS 23.682 [17] to obtain the UE roaming status and serving PLMN identifier. If the UE is roaming, the ECS may use the serving PLMN identifier to determine the roaming partner ECS (i.e. V-ECS) information to be provided to the EEC in the service provisioning response. If AC profile(s) are provided by the EEC, and the Application group profile is not provided, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE location.\nWhen Application group profile is provided in the request,\n-\tif the ECS-ER is not available, then\n-\tthe ECS identifies EES(s) based on the information contained in the request (e.g.AC profile, Application group profile, UE location);\n-\tif the ECS-ER is available, and:\n-\tEES information is not available corresponding to the Application Group ID, then the ECS identifies EES(s) and stores the identified EES(s)'s information and related Application group ID into the ECS-ER; or\n-\tEES information is available corresponding to the Application Group ID, then the ECS retrieves the EES (s) information corresponding to the Application Group ID from the ECS-ER.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is up to the ASP or the EES to determine validity of the application group.\nThe ECS may take Group Geographical Service Area information and KPI requirements of the AC to determine the EES(s) corresponding to the Application group ID.\nWhen neither Application group profile nor AC profiles(s) are provided, then:\n-\tif available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the ECS and the UE location;\n-\tECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nFurthermore, the ECS may identify the EES based on the EEC service continuity support information and EES service continuity support information.\nNOTE 3:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the ECS is out of scope.\nNOTE 4:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nIf desired ECSP identifier(s) is provided by the EEC, the ECS identifies the EES(s) to be sent in step 3 based on registered ECSP identifier in EES profile and the desired ECSP identifier(s).\nNOTE 5:\tFor EEC desired ECSP identifier usage, it is assumed that the ECSP providing the EES and PLMN operator are the same organization and an ECSP providing the EES (desired by the EEC) registers its EES in ECS provided by another ECSP based on service agreement to provide services to EEC.\nThe ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned, e.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.\nIf ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration available at the ECS and UE's location, the ECS determines a partner ECS that may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use preconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or ECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause 8.17.2.3 or both.\nIf required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning information retrieval procedure as specified in clause 8.17.2.4 to obtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\nNOTE 6:\tECSP policies can restrict sharing partner ECSP's information with the EEC.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes EAS bundle identifier, the ECS identifies all the EES(s) providing the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the ECS identifies the one or more EES which support all of the EASs within the same EDN based on the EDN information obtained in the EES profile.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds to the EEC's request with a service provisioning response. If the ECS has identified the relevant EES(s) information, the service provisioning response includes a list of EDN configuration information, e.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service area, and the required information (e.g. URI, IP address) for establishing a connection to the EES.\nThe ECS may provide associated EES(s) information (one or more EES information) in the service provisioning response along with the bundle EAS information.\nIf the alternative ECS(s) has been identified in step 2, the ECS sends a successful response including the Redirect information element containing the list of ECS(s) configuration information indicating that alternative ECS(s) is available for service provisioning request. The response may include information such as DNN and S-NSSAI for roaming UEs to establish a PDU session with the ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\nIf the ECS is not provisioned with any EDN configuration information or is unable to determine either the EES information or the partner ECS information using the inputs in service provisioning request, UE-specific service information at the ECS or the ECSP's policy, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.\nIf the service provisioning response contains a list of ECS configuration information, the EEC may initiate service provisioning procedure with one or more ECS(s) provided in the response. If the UE is roaming to a V-PLMN and the ECS configuration information includes V-PLMN ID in the list of Supported PLMN ID(s), the EEC establishes a connection with the V-ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20]. The connection with the V-ECS can be a HR-SBO PDU session or an LBO PDU session based on the information received from the ECS.\nIf the EDN configuration information includes an LADN DNN as an identifier for the EDN, the EEC considers the LADN as the EDN. Therefore, the service area of EDN is the LADN Service Area which can be discovered using the UE Registration Procedure.\nThe EEC may cache the service provisioning information (e.g. EES endpoint) for subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is included in the Service provisioning response, then the EEC may cache and reuse the Service provisioning information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, without the need to repeat step 1.\nIf the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support of individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when selecting an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively.\nIf for multiple EES(s), the instantiable EAS information IE for an EAS is not available or the instantiable EAS information IE is set to instantiated or instantiable, the EEC can select one or more such EES to perform EAS discovery. For EAS discovery to mitigate the waste of EDN resources EEC considers the instantiable EAS information and the associated instantiation criteria, the EEC selects one EES, if the EAS instantiation status corresponding to the EASID requested by AC/EEC is instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. no instantiated EAS).\nNOTE 7:\tIf the service provisioning request fails, the EEC can resend the service provisioning request again, taking into account the received failure cause.\nNOTE 8:\tEven after the EEC establishes a connection to the EES using information received in step 3, the EES can issue AF request to influence traffic routing from EEC to EES as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.6.7.\nNOTE 9:\tIf the EAS instantiation fails based on the selected EES, the EEC may retry the EAS discovery request to another EES (e.g. selecting another one EES based on the instantiable EAS information).\nClause 8.3.3.2.3.2 and clause 8.3.3.2.3.3 together illustrate the service provisioning procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.\nClause 8.3.3.2.3.4 illustrates the service provisioning update procedure.\nClause 8.3.3.2.3.5 illustrates the service provisioning unsubscribe procedure.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.2-1 illustrates the service provisioning subscription procedure between the EEC and the ECS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has been pre-configured or has discovered the address (e.g. URI) of the ECS;\n2.\tThe EEC has been authorized to communicate with the ECS as specified in clause 8.11;\n3.\tThe UE Identifier is either preconfigured or resulted from a successful authorization;\n4.\tThe ECS is configured with ECSP's policy for service provisioning; and\n5.\tThe EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be used in its subscriptions to notifications.\nNOTE 1:\tDetails of ECSP's policy are out of scope.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the EEC acquires the notification target address or a notification channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of this release. The notification target address can terminate at the EEC (e.g. in an IoT device) if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or it can terminate at a push notification service. Details of the push notification service are out of scope of this release.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning subscription, with various service levels and subscription types, such as Basic, Standard, and Premium, along with their corresponding prices and terms. It also includes a graphical representation of the subscription process, including the steps to activate, renew, and manage the subscription.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.2-1: Service provisioning subscription\n1.\tThe EEC sends a service provisioning subscription request to the ECS. The service provisioning subscription request includes the security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure and Notification Target Address (e.g. URL) and may include the UE identifier such as GPSI, connectivity information, proposed expiration time and AC Profile information. EEC may provide its desired ECSP identifier(s) in the service provisioning request based on EEC preference.\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC, the EEC may include the EEC Triggering Request information element instead of the Notification Target Address in the request message.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If required, the ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location or user plane management event notification service if available) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If the request is authorized, the ECS creates and stores the subscription for provisioning.\nNOTE 3:\tThe ECS can monitor the user plane path change for EDGE-1 traffic toward EES(s) by utilizing the user plane management event notification service specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. Based on target DNAI reported from 5GC the ECS can notify more suitable EES(s) to the EEC.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds with a service provisioning subscription response, which includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC shall send a Service provisioning subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a Service provisioning subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the ECS shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\nIf the ECS is unable to determine the EES information using the inputs in service provisioning subscription request, UE-specific service information at the ECS or the ECSP policy, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning subscription request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the service provisioning subscription request fails, the EEC can resend the service provisioning subscription request again, taking into account the received failure cause.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.3-1 illustrates the service provisioning notification procedure between the EEC and the ECS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information as specified in clause 8.3.3.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning notification system, showing a sequence of steps for service provisioning. It includes a notification system, a notification server, and a notification client. The system uses a notification server to send notifications to the notification client, which then sends notifications to the service providers. The system also includes a notification client to receive notifications from the service providers. The figure illustrates the flow of notifications and the communication between the different components of the system.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.3-1: Service provisioning notification\n1.\tAn event occurs at the ECS that satisfies trigger conditions for updating service provisioning of a subscribed EEC. If UE's location information is not available, the ECS may obtain the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If the UE serving PLMN identifier is not provided by the EEC in the connectivity information of the service provisioning request, the ECS may invoke the NEF monitoring event API as described in 3GPP TS 29.522 [4] and 3GPP TS 29.122 [5] to obtain the UE roaming status and serving PLMN identifier. If the UE is roaming, the ECS may use the serving PLMN identifier to determine the partner ECS information to be provided to the EEC in the service provisioning notification. If AC profile(s) were provided by the EEC during subscription creation, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE location. If AC profiles(s) were not provided, then:\n-\tif available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the ECS and the UE location;\n-\tECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nNOTE 1:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the ECS is out of scope.\nNOTE 2:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nIf desired ECSP identifier(s) provided by the EEC, the ECS identifies the EES(s) to be sent in step 2 based on registered ECSP identifier in EES profile and the desired ECSP identifier(s).\nNOTE 3:\tFor EEC desired ECSP identifier usage, it is assumed that the ECSP providing the EES and PLMN operator are the same organization and an ECSP providing the EES (desired by the EEC) registers its EES in ECS provided by another ECSP based on service agreement to provide services to EEC.\nThe ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned, e.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.\nIf ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration available at the ECS and UE’s location, the ECS determines a partner ECS that may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use preconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or ECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause 8.17.2.3 or both. If required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning information retrieval procedure as specified in clause 8.17.2.4 to obtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\nNOTE 4:\tECSP policies can restrict sharing partner ECSP's information with the EEC.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf bundle EAS information included EAS bundle identifier, the ECS identifies all the EES(s) providing the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the ECS identifies the one or more EES which support all of the EASs within the same EDN based on the EDN information obtained in the EES profile.\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC as indicated in EEC Triggering Request IE of the Service Provisioning Subscription Request, then the ECS performs the EEC triggering service as described in the clause 8.16.1 and skips the step 2.\n2.\tThe ECS sends a provisioning notification to the EEC. If the ECS has identified the relevant EES(s) information, the service provisioning notification includes the list of EDN configuration information determined in step 1. If the ECS has determined suitable partner ECS(s), the service provisioning notification includes a list of ECS configuration information and may include information for roaming UEs to establish PDU session with the ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20]. The ECS may provide associated EES(s) information (one or more EES information) in the service provisioning response along with the bundle EAS information.\nIf the service provisioning notification contains a list of ECS configuration information, the EEC may initiate service provisioning procedure with one or more ECS(s) provided in the notification. If the UE is roaming to a V-PLMN and the ECS configuration information includes V-PLMN ID in the list of Supported PLMN ID(s), the EEC establishes a PDU session with the V-PLMN to access the ECS in the visited network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\nIf the EDN configuration information in the service provisioning notification includes an LADN DNN as an identifier for the EDN, the EEC considers the LADN as the EDN. Therefore, the service area of EDN is the LADN Service Area, which can be discovered using the UE Registration Procedure.\nIf the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support of individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when selecting an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively.\nNOTE 5:\tEven after the EEC establishes a connection to the EES using information received in step 2, the EES can issue AF request to influence traffic routing from EEC to EES as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.6.7.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.4-1 illustrates the service provisioning subscription update procedure between the EEC and the ECS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information as specified in clause 8.3.3.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning subscription update, showing the process of updating a subscription in a telecommunications network. The update includes the necessary steps to ensure the correct information is sent to the subscriber, such as the new service plan, pricing, and any other relevant details. The figure provides a visual representation of the process, making it easier for users to understand and follow the steps involved in updating their subscription.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.4-1: Service provisioning subscription update\n1.\tThe EEC sends a service provisioning subscription update request to the ECS. The service provisioning subscription update request includes the security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure along with the subscription identifier and may include the UE identifier such as GPSI, connectivity information, proposed expiration time for the updated subscription and AC profile(s).\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If required, the ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If authorized, the ECS updates the stored subscription for provisioning as requested in step 1.\n3.\tThe ECS responds with a service provisioning subscription update response, which may include the expiration time, indicating when the updated subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC shall send a Service provisioning subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a Service provisioning subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the ECS shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.5-1 illustrates the service provisioning unsubscribe procedure between the EEC and the ECS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information as specified in clause 8.3.3.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning unsubscribe process, illustrating the steps involved in unsubscribing from a service. The process is divided into three main steps: 3, 2, and 3.5, with 3 being the most important step. The figure includes a visual representation of the service provisioning process, with arrows indicating the flow of information. The steps are labeled and numbered, making it easy to understand the sequence of actions. The figure also includes a list of steps, which can be helpful for users who need to follow the process step by step. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the service provisioning unsubscribe process.\nFigure 8.3.3.2.3.5-1: Service provisioning unsubscribe\n1.\tThe EEC sends a service provisioning unsubscribe request to the ECS. The service provisioning unsubscribe request includes the security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure along with the subscription identifier.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If authorized, the ECS cancels the subscription for provisioning as requested in step 1.\n3.\tThe ECS responds with a service provisioning unsubscribe response.\nThe following information flows are specified for service provisioning:\n-\tService provisioning request and response;\n-\tService provisioning subscription request and response;\n-\tService provisioning notification;\n-\tService provisioning update request and response; and\n-\tService provisioning unsubscribe request and response.\nTable 8.3.3.3.2-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning request from the EEC to the ECS.\nTable 8.3.3.3.2-1: Service provisioning request\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.3-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning response from the ECS to the EEC.\nTable 8.3.3.3.3-1: Service provisioning response\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.3-2: EDN configuration information\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.4-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning subscription request from the EEC to the ECS.\nTable 8.3.3.3.4-1: Service provisioning subscription request\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.5-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning subscription response from the ECS to the EEC.\nTable 8.3.3.3.5-1: Service provisioning subscription response\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.6-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning notification from the ECS to the EEC.\nTable 8.3.3.3.6-1: Service provisioning notification\n\nNOTE:\tWhen SEAL NMS is used, Service provisioning notification is the Notification data in SEAL Notification message of clause 17.3.2.4 in 3GPP TS 23.434 [13].\nTable 8.3.3.3.7-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning subscription update request from the EEC to the ECS.\nTable 8.3.3.3.7-1: Service provisioning subscription update request\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.8-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning subscription update response from the ECS to the EEC.\nTable 8.3.3.3.8-1: Service provisioning subscription update response\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.9-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning unsubscribe request from the EEC to the ECS.\nTable 8.3.3.3.9-1: Service provisioning unsubscribe request\n\nTable 8.3.3.3.10-1 describes the information elements for service provisioning unsubscribe response from the ECS to the EEC.\nTable 8.3.3.3.10-1: Service provisioning unsubscribe response\n\nTable 8.3.3.4.1-1 illustrates the API for service provisioning.\nTable 8.3.3.4.1-1: Eecs_ServiceProvisioning API\n\nAPI operation name: Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Request\nDescription: The consumer requests for one time service provisioning information.\nInputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.2.\nOutputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.3.\nSee clause 8.3.3.2.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Subscribe\nDescription: The consumer subscribes for service provisioning information.\nInputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.4.\nOutputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.5.\nSee clause 8.3.3.2.3.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Notify\nDescription: The consumer is notified with service provisioning information.\nInputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.6.\nOutputs: None.\nSee clause 8.3.3.2.3.3 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_UpdateSubscription\nDescription: The consumer updates an existing subscription for service provisioning information.\nInputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.7.\nOutputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.8.\nSee clause 8.3.3.2.3.4 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Unsubscribe\nDescription: The consumer cancels an existing subscription for service provisioning information.\nInputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.9.\nOutputs: See clause 8.3.3.3.10.\nSee clause 8.3.3.2.3.5 for details of usage of this operation.\n",

The procedure also enables initialization, update and removal of the EEC context information at the EES. The context may be further used for edge-specific operations or processing, e.g. analytics.\nAn EEC may be registered with one or more EESs on behalf of one or more ACs simultaneously.\nIn deployments with bundled EAS(s) registered to different EESs, to perform EEC registration (if needed) the EEC sends the EEC registration message to all the associated EES for the EAS bundle.\nFollowing are supported for EEC registration:\n-\tEEC registration procedure;\n-\tEEC registration update procedure;\n-\tEEC de-registration procedure; and\n-\tEEC Context relocation procedure.\nNOTE:\tIn this version of specification, each registration procedure provides for registering a single EEC per UE.\nFigure 8.4.2.2.2-1 illustrates EEC registration procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC is authorized to access the EES for the purpose of performing registration and has received relevant security credentials as specified in clause 8.11; and\n2.\tThe EEC has received service provisioning information from the ECS, including information for accessing the EES.\nThe figure depicts the EEC (End-to-End Certification) registration procedure, which is a crucial step in ensuring the proper functioning of a communication system. The figure shows a flowchart with various steps, such as selecting the correct EEC registration method, obtaining the necessary information, and submitting the registration form. The steps are visually represented by arrows and boxes, making it easy to understand the sequence and the required actions. The figure is essential for ensuring that the communication system is properly certified and meets the required standards.\nFigure 8.4.2.2.2-1: EEC registration procedure\n1.\tThe EEC sends EEC registration request to the EES. The request from the client includes the security credentials received after successful authorization for edge computing services and may include a proposed expiration time. The request also optionally includes information indicating to the EES how the EEC expects to use the services of the EES. The EEC may include indication for UE mobility support requirement to the EES.\nIf the EEC is moving to this EES from the purview of another EES, called S-EES, the request from the EEC may include the identity and endpoint of the S-EES and an EEC context ID that was provided by the S-EES to maintain continuity of the EEC context and to authorize EEC context relocation. If the EEC registration is being performed as part of ACR, the EEC shall not include the S-EES endpoint and the EEC context ID.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the registration request and verifies the security credentials. The EES further determines whether the requirements that were indicated in the AC Profile(s) can be fulfilled e.g., without failing to meet the requirements of the already registered EECs, and reserves corresponding resources (e.g., for EASs). If the AC Profile(s) include EAS bundle information the reserved EAS resources are apportioned among the EASs in the bundle, based on the indicated requirements and local policies.\nNOTE 1:\tResource reservation at EEC registration ensures that the EES provides services for the duration of the registration.\nIf the EEC provides in the registration request the EAS selection request indicator and based on EES local policies, the EES selects EASs providing the capabilities required by the AC Profile(s), reserves the corresponding resources, and provides the information to the EEC in the registration response.\nIf bundle EAS information (either as EAS bundle identifier or as a list of EASIDs) is included and the EAS selection request indicator is set, then the EES determines whether all or a subset of the EAS(s) in the bundle are registered and instantiated. If only a subset of bundle EASs is found, the EES may determine whether instantiable but not yet instantiated EASs match the subset of remaining (i.e. not yet found) bundle EASs and performs the dynamic EAS instantiation triggering procedure in clause 8.12 for this subset.\nIf the EEC provides in the registration request a UE type, the EES may use this information to apply UE-type-specific local policies.\nNOTE 2:\tWithout any indication from UE (either EAS selection request indication or UE type), the EES handling is as per R17 procedure.\nNOTE 3:\tThe \"UE type\" IE as present in EEC registration request message can be used by EES to identify \"constrained device\".\n3.\tUpon successful validation of the request, if the received EEC registration request contains an EEC context ID and a S-EES Endpoint, the EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2) from the S-EES. The source and target EES perform EEC Context handling as detailed in clause 8.9.1.\nNOTE 4:\tOnly a single EEC Context ID may be provided in the EEC registration request.\nNOTE 5:\tIn this version of specification, each registration procedure relocates a single EEC context.\nNOTE 6:\tStep 3 is executed when EEC determines to change its connection from S-EES to T-EES and ACR is not required.\nIf the EEC registration request fails after the EEC Context Pull relocation, e.g., the EES cannot reserve the necessary resources while meeting the capability requirements of the existing registered EECs, the EES shall determine the EEC Context information stale and send a failure response with a corresponding cause.\n4.\tThe EES sends a successful EEC registration response, which includes the registration ID and may include a newly assigned EEC context ID. If the EEC registration request contains AC Profile(s), and the EES determines that the requirements indicated in the AC profile(s) cannot be fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the EES shall include the list of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and may include appropriate reasons. If step 3 was executed, the EEC registration response also includes EEC context retrieval result. The EEC stores the new EEC context ID and uses it if and when it registers with another EES. The EES may also provide an expiration time to indicate to the EEC when the registration will automatically expire. To maintain the registration, the EEC shall send a registration update request prior to the expiration. If a registration update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly de-registered.\nIf the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC performs the required EDGE-1 subscriptions at the T-EES.\n\nFigure 8.4.2.2.3-1 illustrates EEC registration update procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tEEC has already registered with the EES.\nThe figure depicts the EEC registration update procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's operation. It illustrates the steps taken by the network to update the EEC (Energy Efficiency Certificate) status of a device. The figure shows the network's control center, the device, and the EEC registration server, with the device's EEC status being updated in real-time. This process ensures that the network's energy consumption is optimized and that devices are compliant with energy efficiency regulations.\nFigure 8.4.2.2.3-1: EEC registration update procedure\n1.\tThe EEC sends EEC registration update request to the EES. The request from the client includes the security credentials received after successful authorization for edge computing services and may include a proposed expiration time and AC profile(s) parameters, including new or updated selected EAS information. The EEC may include indication for UE mobility support requirement to the EES.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the registration update request and verifies the security credentials.\n3.\tUpon successful validation of the request, the EES sends a successful registration update response, which may include updated expiration time to indicate to the EEC when the updated registration will automatically expire. If the EEC registration update request contains AC Profile(s), and the EES determines that the requirements indicated in the AC profile(s) cannot be fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the EES shall include the list of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and may include appropriate reasons. To maintain the registration, the EEC shall send a registration update request prior to the expiration time. If a registration update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly de-registered.\nFigure 8.4.2.2.4-1 illustrates EEC de-registration procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tEEC has already registered with the EES.\nThe figure depicts the de-registration procedure for EEC (Energy-Efficient Communication) in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps involved in deactivating energy-efficient communication (EEC) services, which are essential for reducing energy consumption and improving network performance. The figure shows the process of deactivating EEC services, including the steps to disable the services, the impact on the network, and the steps to reactivate the services. The figure is crucial for network operators to understand the deactivation process and ensure that EEC services are properly deactivated to optimize network performance and energy efficiency.\nFigure 8.4.2.2.4-1: EEC de-registration procedure\n1.\tThe EEC sends EEC de-registration request to the EES. The request from the client includes the security credentials received after successful authorization for edge computing services.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the de-registration request and verifies the security credentials.\n3.\tUpon successful authorization, the EES sends a successful de-registration response.\nThe following information flows are specified for EEC registration:\n-\tEEC registration request and response;\n-\tEEC registration update request and response; and\n-\tEEC registration de-registration request and response.\nTable 8.4.2.3.2-1 describes information elements in the EEC registration request from the EEC to the EES.\nTable 8.4.2.3.2-1: EEC registration request\n\nTable 8.4.2.3.3-1 describes information elements in the EEC registration response from the EES to the EEC.\nTable 8.4.2.3.3-1: EEC registration response\n\nTable 8.4.2.3.4-1 describes information elements in the EEC registration update request from the EEC to the EES.\nTable 8.4.2.3.4-1: EEC registration update request\n\nTable 8.4.2.3.5-1 describes information elements in the EEC registration update response from the EES to the EEC.\nTable 8.4.2.3.5-1: EEC registration update response\n\nTable 8.4.2.3.6-1 describes information elements in the EEC de-registration request from the EEC to the EES.\nTable 8.4.2.3.6-1: EEC de-registration request\n\nTable 8.4.2.3.7-1 describes information elements in the EEC de-registration response from the EES to the EEC.\nTable 8.4.2.3.7-1: EEC registration update response\n\nTable 8.4.2.4.1-1 illustrates the API for EEC registration.\nTable 8.4.2.4.1-1: Eees_EECRegistration API\n\nAPI operation name: Eees_EECRegistration_Request\nDescription: The consumer requests to register the EEC on the EES.\nInputs: See clause 8.4.2.3.2.\nOutputs: See clause 8.4.2.3.3.\nSee clause 8.4.2.2.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_EECRegistration_Update\nDescription: The consumer requests to update the registered information of the EEC on the EES.\nInputs: See clause 8.4.2.3.4.\nOutputs: See clause 8.4.2.3.5.\nSee clause 8.4.2.2.3 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_EECRegistration_Deregister\nDescription: The consumer requests to de-register the EEC from the EES.\nInputs: See clause 8.4.2.3.6.\nOutputs: See clause 8.4.2.3.7.\nSee clause 8.4.2.2.4 for details of usage of this operation.\n",

The discovery of the EASs is based on matching EAS discovery filters provided in the request.\nWhen multiple EASs are discovered for a specific AC, the EEC may select one or more EASs to enable AC communication with one of the selected EASs. The selection algorithm is outside the scope of this specification. Once the EAS is selected, the EEC may subscribe for the ACR event notifications at the EES of the selected EAS, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2. The EDN configuration information received from ECS may be used for establishing a connection to EAS(s).\nEAS discovery may be initiated by the EEC when a certain trigger condition at the UE is met. Some examples are as follows:\n-\tAC related updates available at the EEC (e.g. due to AC installation/re-installation/activation), AC requesting application server access;\n-\tLifetime received via EAS discovery response specified in clause 8.5.3 is expired; or\n-\tEEC detects the need of application context relocation as in clause 8.8.\nNOTE:\tWhen the EEC decides to perform EAS discovery is up to EEC implementation.\nIf the EASs consisting of the EAS bundle register to different EESs and if the Bundle Type of the  EAS bundle is set to Direct bundle, then the EEC sends the EAS discovery request message to the associated EES for the bundle EAS information.\n",

If UE's location information is not already available, the EES obtains the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If EAS discovery filters are provided by the EEC, but it does not contain Application group profile, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes EAS bundle identifier, the EES identifies all or part of the EAS(s) associated with the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the EES identifies the EASs which are all or part of the EAS bundle.\nIf the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, when identifying the EAS, the EES shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC, the EEC, the EES and the EAS and which of these are preferred by the AC into consideration. The EES may select one EAS and determine whether to perform application traffic influence for this AC based on AC's service KPI or EAS’s service KPI in desired response time, when the EAS does not perform traffic influence in advance.\nWhen EAS discovery filters are not provided, then:\n-\tif available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the EES and the UE location;\n-\tEES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nWhen EAS discovery filters contain Application group profile, the EES checks whether information about common EAS and related Application Group ID is available or not. If the common EAS information related to the Application Group ID is:\n-\tnot available, then based on the policy if EES needs to select the common EAS, the EES identifies an EAS for the Application Group ID based on the provided EAS discovery filters such as KPIs, UE-specific service information or the ECSP policy. Furthermore, the EES stores the common EAS information and related Application Group ID.\n-\tavailable at the EES, then the EES provides information of that EAS as result for EAS discovery.\nNOTE 2:\tThe EES may have previously determined and stored the common EAS for Application group ID, or the EES may have received the common EAS selection information for Application group ID during the common EAS announcement procedure.\nWhen the ECS-ER is not available and the EES selects the common EAS, the selected common EAS shall be announced to other EES(s) as per procedure specified in clause 8.19.\nWhen the ECS-ER is available and common EAS information corresponding to the Application Group ID is not available, then the EES identifies one EAS for the group and interacts with the ECS-ER to store the common EAS information as described in clause 8.20.2.3. If common EAS information is already available corresponding to the Application Group ID in the repository, then the ECS-ER returns the common EAS information to the EES as described in clause 8.20.2.3.\nNOTE 3:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the EES is out of scope.\nNOTE 4:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES may also collect edge load analytics from ADAES (as specified in clause 8.8.2 of TS 23.436 [28]) or performance data from OAM to find whether the EAS(s) satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs.\nUpon receiving the request from the EEC, if the EEC does not indicate EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS Discovery request, the EES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS that matches with EAS discovery filter IEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause 8.12.\nOtherwise, upon receiving the request from the EEC, if the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS Discovery request and the EES supports such capability, the EES determines not triggering the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS and may determine Instantiable EAS Information for EAS(s) that are instantiable but not yet instantiated and match the EAS discovery filter IEs. Instantiable EAS Information is provided in the EAS Discovery response and includes the EASID(s) and, for each EASID, the status indicating whether the EAS is instantiated or instantiable but not yet instantiated.\nIf the EEC provides in the EAS discovery request the EAS selection request indicator, the EES selects EAS satisfying the EAS discovery filter or based on other information (e.g. ECSP policy) as described above (if no EAS discovery filter received), and then provides the selected EAS information to the EEC in the discovered EAS list of EAS discovery response.\nNOTE 5:\tWithout EAS selection request indication, the EES handling is as per R17 procedure.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS discovery response to the EEC, which includes information about the discovered EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. For discovered EASs, this includes endpoint information. Depending on the EAS discovery filters received in the EAS discovery request, the response may include additional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g. service permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support, ACR scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery response may contain a list of EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters containing a Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route, included in the EAS discovery request by the EEC. When the discovered EAS is for a certain application group, then the Application Group ID is also included in the response message. If the discovered EAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the discovered EAS is registered is also included in the response message.\nWhen the EES determines to trigger the EAS instantiation, then the response may indicate that the EAS instantiation is in progress so that the detailed EAS profile information will be available later. When EEC receives the EAS instantiation in progress indication, the EEC may send EAS discovery subscription request message or send EAS discovery request message later to the EES for obtaining updated EAS information.\nIf the EES is unable to determine the EAS information using the inputs in the EAS discovery request, UE-specific service information at the EES or the ECSP policy, the EES shall reject the EAS discovery request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.\nIf the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the EEC to perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall include an appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response indicating that EEC registration is required.\nIf the UE location and predicted/expected UE locations, provided in the EAS discovery request, are outside the Geographical or Topological Service Area of an EAS, then the EES shall not include that EAS in the discovery response. The discovery response may include EAS(s) that cannot serve the UE at its current location if a predicted/expected UE location was provided in the EAS discovery request.\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery response, if the EEC selects an EAS which is instantiated (i.e., an EAS profile was provided), the EEC uses the endpoint information for routing of the outgoing application data traffic to EAS(s), as needed, and may provide necessary notifications to the AC(s). The EEC may use the border or overlap between EAS Geographical Service Areas for service continuity purposes. The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is included in the response, the EEC may cache the EAS information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE.\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery response, if the EEC selects an EAS which is instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. an EAS profile is not provided), the EEC sends the EAS information provisioning request indicating the selected EASID as in clause 8.15.\nNOTE 6:\tWithin the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, the cached EAS Profile can be updated (e.g. according to notifications from the EES for changes of EAS information due to EAS status change) or the cached EAS Profile can be invalidated due to new EAS information discovery (e.g. due to UE mobility). The EEC can update or invalidate the cached EAS information (e.g. on PDU Session Release or Modification Command).\nNOTE 7:\tThe AC can cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use. In the case of the cached information needing to be updated or invalidated, the mechanisms for the EEC to notify the AC is up to implementation and is not specified in the current release of the present document.\nNOTE 8:\tThe EEC can use the EAS information provided by the discovery procedure to perform service continuity planning, for example when ultra-low latency ACR is required.\nIf the EAS discovery request fails, the EEC may resend the EAS discovery request, taking into account the received failure cause. If the failure cause indicated that EEC registration is required, the EEC shall perform an EEC registration before resending the EAS discovery request.\nNOTE 9:\tAs long as a proper EAS (e.g. considering expected AC service KPIs included in EAS discovery request) is discovered and selected by the EES, EEC of a constraint UE can stop sending EAS discovery to rest candidate EES(s), and provide the selected EAS information to AC.\nClause 8.5.2.3.2 and clause 8.5.2.3.3 together illustrate the EAS discovery procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.\nClause 8.5.2.3.4 illustrates the EAS discovery update procedure.\nClause 8.5.2.3.5 illustrates the EAS discovery unsubscribe procedure.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.2-1 illustrates the EAS discovery subscription procedure between the EEC and the EES. This subscription enables EES to inform EEC of various EAS discovery related events of interest to EEC (e.g. EAS discovery notification and EAS dynamic information).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to the EES;\n2.\tThe EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it to communicate with the EES as specified in clause 8.11;\n3.\tThe EES is configured with ECSP's policy for EAS discovery; and\n4.\tThe EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be used in its subscriptions to notifications.\nNOTE 1:\tDetails of ECSP's policy are out of scope.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the EEC acquires the notification target address or a notification channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of this release. The notification target address can terminate at the EEC (e.g. in an IoT device) if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or it can terminate at a push notification service. Details of the push notification service are out of scope of this release.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of an EAS (Electronic Attack Suppression) subscription, showing the various subscription levels and their corresponding features. The subscription levels are labeled as \"1,\" \"2,\" \"3,\" and \"4,\" with each level offering different levels of protection against electronic attacks. The figure also includes a graphical representation of the subscription's subscription status, which is indicated by the color-coded status bar. The status bar displays the current subscription status, with green indicating a successful subscription and red indicating a failed subscription. The figure is a useful tool for understanding the different subscription levels and their corresponding features, making it easier to select the appropriate subscription for a given EAS system.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.2-1: EAS discovery subscription\n1.\tThe EEC sends an EAS discovery subscription request to the EES. The EAS discovery subscription request includes the EECID along with the security credentials, Event ID, and may include EAS discovery filters and EAS dynamic information filters to subscribe to information about particular EAS(s) or a category of EASs (e.g. gaming applications) or dynamic information about EAS(s).\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC, the EEC may include the EEC Triggering request information element instead of the Notification Target Address in the request message.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is authorized to subscribe for information of the requested EAS(s). The authorization check may apply to an individual EAS, a category of EASs or to the EDN, i.e. to all the EASs. The EES may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If the request is authorized, the EES creates and stores the subscription for EAS discovery.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS discovery subscription response to the EEC, which includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC shall send an EAS discovery subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If an EAS discovery subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\nIn the case of subscription to an EAS availability change event, if there is no instantiated EAS that matches the requested EAS discovery filters and such EAS is instantiable based on the information about instantiable EASs, the request is treated as successful. If the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering in the EAS discovery subscription request and the EAS instantiation is not in progress for the requested EASID, the EES may trigger dynamic instantiation of the EAS as specified in the clause 8.12; if the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS discovery subscription request, the EES determines not triggering the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS and Instantiable EAS Information (e.g. instantiated, instantiable but not be instantiated yet) is provided; otherwise, the EES does not trigger the EAS instantiation nor returns the Instantiable EAS Information.\nIn the case of subscription to an EAS dynamic information change event, if the EES is unable to determine the instantiated EAS information using the inputs in the EAS discovery subscription request, UE-specific service information at the EES or the ECSP policy, the EES shall reject the EAS discovery subscription request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.\nIf the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the EEC to perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall include an appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response indicating that EEC registration is required.\nIf the EAS discovery subscription request fails, the EEC may resend the EAS discovery subscription request again, taking into account the received failure cause. If the failure cause indicated that EEC registration is required, the EEC shall perform an EEC registration before resending the EAS discovery subscription request.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.3-1 illustrates the EAS discovery notification procedure between the EEC and the EES.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the EES for the EAS discovery information as specified in clause 8.5.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a schematic of an EAS (Electronic Attack System) discovery notification system, showing the various components and their connections. The system includes a central controller, a network of sensors, and a communication network. The central controller is responsible for managing the EAS system, while the sensors monitor the environment for potential threats. The communication network connects the central controller to the network of sensors, allowing for real-time updates and notifications.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.3-1: EAS discovery notification\n1.\tAn event occurs at the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for notifying (e.g. to provide EAS discovery information or EAS dynamic information) a subscribed EEC. If UE's location information is not already available, the EES obtains the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If EAS discovery filters were provided by the EEC during subscription creation, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location.\nFor EAS dynamic information change event, the EES, based on local policy, may use received EAS endpoints from EEC or all registered EAS endpoints to get edge load analytics information from ADAES services (e.g. as specified in clause 8.8 of TS 23.436 [27]) to monitor EAS service status like EAS status and EAS schedule.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf EAS bundle identifier was provided, the EES identifies all or part of the EAS(s) associated with the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf a list of EASIDs is provided, the EES identifies the EASs which are all or part of the EAS bundle.\nIf the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, the EES shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC and the EEC and which of these are preferred by the AC into consideration.\nIf EAS discovery filters were not provided, then:\n-\tif available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the EES and the UE location;\n-\tEES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nIf EAS discovery filters contain Application group profile, the EES checks whether information about common EAS and related Application Group ID is available or not. If the common EAS information related to the Application Group ID is available at the EES, then the EES provides information of that EAS as result for EAS discovery.\nNOTE 1:\tThe EES may have previously determined and stored the common EAS for Application group ID, or the EES may have received the common EAS selection information for Application group ID during the common EAS announcement procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the EES is out of scope.\nNOTE 3:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nIf the UE is located outside the Geographical or Topological Service Area of an EAS, then the EES shall not include this EAS in the EAS discovery notification.\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC as indicated in EEC Triggering Request IE of the EAS Discovery Subscription Request, then the EES performs the EEC triggering service as described in the clause 8.16.1 and skips the step 2.\n2.\tThe EES sends an EAS discovery notification to the EEC with the EAS information determined in step 1, which includes information about the discovered EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. For discovered EASs, this includes endpoint information. Depending on the event type and EAS discovery filters received in the EAS discovery subscription request, the notification may include additional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g. service permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support, ACR scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery notification may contain a list of EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters containing a Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route, included in the EAS discovery subscription request by the EEC. When the discovered EAS is for a certain application group, then the Application Group ID is also included in the notification message. If the discovered EAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the discovered EAS is registered is also included in the notification message.\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery notification, if the EEC selects an EAS which is instantiated (i.e., an EAS profile was provided), the EEC uses the endpoint information for routing of the outgoing application data traffic to EAS(s), as needed, and may provide necessary notifications to the AC(s). The EEC may use the border or overlap between EAS Geographical Service Areas for service continuity purposes. The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use. If the Lifetime IE is included in the notification, the EEC may cache the EAS information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE.\nNOTE 4:\tWithin the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, the cached EAS Profile can be updated (e.g. according to notifications from the EES for changes of EAS information due to EAS status change) or the cached EAS Profile can be invalidated due to new EAS information discovery (e.g. due to UE mobility). The EEC can update or invalidate the cached EAS information (e.g. on PDU Session Release or Modification Command).\nNOTE 5:\tThe AC can cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use.

It shows the steps involved in updating the subscription status of an EAS (Electronic Attack Suppression) system. The figure includes various components such as the EAS system, the subscription database, and the update process. The update process involves updating the subscription status, which is essential for maintaining the security of the EAS system. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the EAS discovery subscription update process, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.4-1: EAS discovery subscription update\n1.\tThe EEC sends an EAS discovery subscription update request to the EES. The EAS discovery subscription update request includes the security credentials and the subscription identifier. It may also include EAS discovery filters, EAS dynamic information filters and/or proposed expiration time for the updated subscription.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is authorized to update the subscription information. The EES may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If the request is authorized, the EES updates the stored subscription for EAS discovery.\n3.\tThe EES sends an EAS discovery subscription update response to the EEC, which may include the expiration time, indicating when the updated subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC shall send an EAS discovery subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If an EAS discovery subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.5-1 illustrates the EAS discovery unsubscribe procedure between the EEC and the EES.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the EES for notification (e.g. EAS discovery information and EAS dynamic information) as specified in clause 8.5.2.3.2\nThe figure depicts a simplified schematic of an EAS (Electronic Attack System) discovery and unsubscribe process, illustrating the steps involved in identifying and removing an EAS from a network. The figure includes various components such as the EAS, the network, and the EAS discovery and unsubscribe process. The figure is a simplified representation, highlighting the key steps and components involved in the process.\nFigure 8.5.2.3.5-1: EAS discovery unsubscribe\n1.\tThe EEC sends an EAS discovery unsubscribe request to the EES. The EAS discovery unsubscribe request includes the security credentials of the EEC along with the subscription identifier.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If authorized, the EES cancels the subscription for provisioning as requested in step 1.\n3.\tThe EES responds with an EAS discovery unsubscribe response.\n",

The UE location API exposed by the EES relies on the 3GPP core network capabilities as specified in clause 8.10.3.\nThe EAS can request UE location API for one-time reporting to check current UE location and for continuous reporting to track UE's location.\nThe UE location API supports both request-response for one-time queries (in order to check UE's current location) as well as subscribe-notify models for providing UE's location to EAS on a continuous basis and enabling the EAS to track UE's location (as UE location changes).\nFigure 8.6.2.2.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the EAS for one-time location report.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE location API provided by the EES.\n2.\tThe EES is authorized to use Nnef Event Exposure API for UE location, based on service level agreement with MNO.\n3.\tUE Identifier between EAS and the EES is authorized for the UE location API.\nThe figure depicts a request-response model for the location of an UE (User Equipment) in a 5G network. It illustrates the communication between the UE and the network, with the UE making a request to the network for the location of its own device, and the network responding with the location of the UE. The figure shows the network's response to the UE's request, with the UE's location being provided in response to the network's response.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.2-1: UE location API request-response model\n1.\tThe EAS sends UE location request to the EES. The UE location request shall include the UE Identifier. It may also include location granularity to indicate requested format of the location e.g. GPS Coordinates, Cell ID, Tracking Area ID, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.), which can be understood by the EAS and location QoS.\nNOTE 1:\tThe trigger condition of the UE location API is up to application service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.\n2.\tThe EES checks the UE location:\na.\tIf the UE location request from the EAS includes the location granularity, the EES considers the location granularity parameter for checking the location of the UE.\nb.\tIf the EES has a valid locally cached location of the UE, the EES may use this cached UE location to respond to the EAS. Otherwise, the EES utilizes the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3.\nc.\tThe EES may modify the format of the UE location to fit to the location granularity requested from the EAS in the step 1, if supported. For example, if the EES receives the UE location in a format of tracking area ID or cell ID, the EES can modify the representation of the location information to the GPS Coordinates, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.) as requested by the EAS.\nNOTE 2:\tFormat modification mechanism of the UE location to fit the location granularity is outside the scope of this specification. Step 2.c. can be performed if the EES is deployed by the PLMN operator.\n3.\tIf successful, the EES responds to the EAS with the location of the UE, and optionally the timestamp of the location.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the subscribe operation between the EAS and the EES for continuous UE location reporting.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE location API provided by the EES;\n2.\tThe EES is authorized to use 3GPP network exposure capability (e.g. Nnef Event Exposure API) for UE location, based on service level agreement with MNO; and\n3.\tUE Identifier or UE Group ID between EAS and the EES is authorized for the UE location API.\nThe figure depicts a user's location API subscription operation, with the user's location represented by a red dot, and the location API represented by a green dot. The figure shows the user's location in relation to the location API, with the user's location being closer to the location API than the location API being closer to the user.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.2-1: UE location API: Subscribe operation\n1.\tThe EAS sends UE location subscribe request to the EES for tracking a UE's location continuously. The UE location subscribe request shall include the UE Identifier or UE Group ID and may include proposed expiration time. It may also include location granularity to indicate requested format of the location e.g. GPS Coordinates, Cell ID, Tracking Area ID, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.), which can be understood by the EAS and location QoS.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the request from the EAS is authorized. If authorized, the EES sends success response to the EAS and utilizes the UE location exposure capability of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. The EES requests continuous location reporting from the 3GPP system to have up to date location information of the UE(s).\n3.\tThe EES may subscribe to UE expected behaviour analytics (UE mobility) as described in 3GPP TS 23.288 [18].\n4.\tThe response includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EAS shall send a UE location subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a UE location subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EAS as implicitly unsubscribed. If it is not authorized, the EES sends failure response with rejection cause.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.3-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and the EAS for continuous location.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.\nThe figure depicts a user-defined location API endpoint for UE location notifications. The API is designed to notify the UE when a new location is detected, allowing for efficient and real-time location updates.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.3-1: UE location API: Notify operation\n1.\tThe EES detects the location of a UE e.g., receiving location of a UE from the 3GPP system. The EES may cache the detected location information locally with timestamp as the latest location information of the UE(s) and start the notification aggregation for a group of UEs. The EES decides whether to aggregate and the aggregation period based on the analytics result received from the 3GPP Core Network, local policy and UE location subscription information received from the EAS. The EES determines to notify the location information of the UE(s) to the EAS which has subscribed for UE(s)'s location.\n2.\tThe EES sends UE location notification to the EAS. The EES includes the location of the UE(s). Each UE location includes UE ID and location type and may include the location accuracy and the timestamp of the location.\nThe EES may modify the format of location information to fit to the location granularity requested from the EAS during the subscribe operation, if supported. For example, if the EES receives the UE location in a format of tracking area ID or cell ID, the EES can modify the representation of the location information to the GPS Coordinates, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.) as requested from the EAS.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.4-1 illustrates the subscription update operation between the EAS and the EES.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.\nThe figure depicts a user-interface for an application that allows users to update their subscription location. The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clear and concise interface that guides users through the process of updating their subscription location. The figure includes a map-like representation of the user's location, with the application's location API being represented by a red dot. The application's location API is updated in real-time, ensuring that users can access the most up-to-date information about their subscription location.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.4-1: UE location API: Subscription update operation\n1.\tThe EAS sends UE location subscription update request to the EES. The request includes the subscription identifier of the subscription to be updated. The UE location subscription update request may also include proposed expiration time for the updated subscription, updated Location granularity and Location QoS.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the request from the EAS is authorized. If authorized, the EES updates the subscription request and may update the UE location subscription in the 3GPP Core Network.\n3.\tThe EES may update the subscription to the UE expected behaviour analytics.\n4.\tThe EES sends the UE location subscription update response to the EAS.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe operation between the EAS and the EES to stop the UE location notifications.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for an application that allows users to unsubscribe from a specific user location. The application uses a location API to retrieve the user's location information. The figure shows the user interface with a list of locations, a button to unselect the location, and a confirmation message to confirm the action.\nFigure 8.6.2.2.3.5-1: UE location API: unsubscribe operation\n1.\tThe EAS sends the UE location unsubscribe request to the EES.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the EAS is authorized or not. If authorized, the EES terminates the subscription of the EAS and unsubscribes the UE location from the 3GPP Core Network.\n3.\tThe EES unsubscribes from the UE expected behaviour analytics, if applicable.\n4.\tThe EES responds to the EAS.\nThe following information flows are specified for UE location API:\n-\tUE location request and response; and\n-\tUE location subscription, notification, subscription update and unsubscribe.\nTable 8.6.2.3.2-1: UE location request\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.3-1: UE location response\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.4-1: UE location subscribe request\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.5-1: UE location subscribe response\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.6-1: UE location notification\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.7-1: UE location subscription update request\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.8-1: UE location subscription update response\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.9-1: UE location unsubscribe request\n\nTable 8.6.2.3.10-1: UE location unsubscribe response\n\nTable 8.6.2.4.1-1 illustrates the API for UE location.\nTable 8.6.2.4.1-1: Eees_UELocation API\n\nAPI operation name: Eees_UELocation_Get\nDescription: The consumer requests one time report of a UE's location.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.2.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.3.\nSee clause 8.6.2.2.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_UELocation_Subscribe\nDescription: The consumer subscribes for continuous reporting of a UE's location.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.4.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.5.\nSee clause 8.6.2.2.3.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_UELocation_Notify\nDescription: The consumer is notified with report of the UE's location.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.6.\nOutputs: None.\nSee clause 8.6.2.2.3.3 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_UELocation_UpdateSubscription\nDescription: The consumer updates an existing subscription for continuous reporting of a UE's location.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.7.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.8.\nSee clause 8.6.2.2.3.4 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_UELocation_Unsubscribe\nDescription: The consumer cancels an existing subscription for continuous reporting of a UE's location.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.9.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.2.3.10.\nSee clause 8.6.2.2.3.5 for details of usage of this operation.\n",

                            "text_content": "The EES exposes ACR management event notifications of one or more UEs to an EAS. EES also uses ACR management event notifications to inform the EAS of the need to start an ACT or cancel a previously started ACT. ACR management event notifications exposed by the EES may rely on the NEF northbound API for monitoring event of user plane path management event.\nThis capability exposed by the EES supports:\n-\t\"User plane path change\". This event supports to detect user plane path change for the application traffic and report the corresponding notification with user plane path change to the EAS.\n-\t\"ACR monitoring\". This event supports to detect user plane path change for the application traffic, discover the T-EAS(s), and report the corresponding notification with the discovered T-EAS(s).\n-\t\"ACR facilitation\". This event supports to detect user plane path change for the application traffic, make the decision for ACR, discover the T-EAS(s), influence the traffic for the selected T-EAS and report the corresponding notification with the selected T-EAS.\n-\t\"ACT start/stop\". This event informs the EAS the need to start or stop an ACT towards or from another EAS for a particular UE. The \"ACT start\" can also inform the EAS of the ACR parameters.\n-\t\"ACR Selection\". This event informs the EAS about the selected ACR scenario list for each AC using the EAS.\nThe availability of the ACR management event notifications relying on the user plane path management event notification service exposed by 5GC may change due to UE mobility between 5GC and EPC. If an EES exposes ACR event notifications to EAS(s) for a UE by relying on the 3GPP Core Network northbound API for user plane path management notifications, the EES monitors the availability of the northbound API for UE(s) served by the EAS (e.g. by utilizing Nnef_APISupportCapability as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) and provides the availability information to the EAS accordingly. If CAPIF is supported, the EES determines if the ACR management event API is available and able to be exposed to the EAS for a UE via the Availability of service APIs event notifications provided by the CAPIF core function as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nFigure 8.6.3.2.2-1 illustrates the subscribe operation between the EAS and the EES for ACR management event notifications.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of an ACR (Access Control Resource) management event API, which is used to subscribe to the operation of an ACR. The figure includes a series of numbered boxes, each representing a step in the process, and a label indicating the step number. The boxes are connected by lines, indicating the flow of data between them. The figure is labeled with the figure name \"Figure 8.6. 3 .2 . 2 -1:  ACR  management event API: Subscribe  o peration,\" which provides a clear and concise description of the figure's content.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.2-1: ACR management event API: Subscribe operation\n1.\tThe EAS sends ACR management event subscribe request (e.g. tracking the UE's user plane path change continuously). The EAS shall include UE Identifier or UE Group ID for \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\" events.\na.\tThe EAS may include the \"user plane path change\" event to indicate the EES to notify the EAS when the EES detects there is a user plane path change for the application traffic and the EAS may include Subscription Type (Early and/or Late notification defined in clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]) and/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement in the event subscription.\nb.\tThe EAS may include the \"ACR monitoring\" event to indicate the EES to notify the EAS when the EES detects there is a need for the ACR (e.g. when T-EAS is available at the target DNAI). The EAS may also include the Event Filters to specify the conditions to match for notifying the event, e.g., inter-EDN mobility, intra-EDN mobility.\nc.\tThe EAS may include the \"ACR facilitation\" event to request the EES to make the decision for ACR, discover the T-EAS(s), influence the traffic for the selected T-EAS and notify the S-EAS of the selected T-EAS. If required, the EAS can add an indication to request service continuity planning.\nd.\tThe EAS may include the \"ACT start/stop\" event to indicate the EES to notify the EAS of the need for start or stop ACT to or from another EAS for a particular UE. The EES may also use \"ACT start\" event to notify the EAS of the ACR parameters.\ne.\tThe EAS may include the “ACR Selection” event to indicate the EES to notify the EAS of the selected ACR scenario list applicable to ACs using the EAS.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation.\nIf authorized, and if the subscription in step 1 includes at least one of the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\" events, the EES may invoke the PFD management procedure with the 3GPP Core Network as described in 3GPP TS 23.682 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [8] with an application id. The traffic filter information sent by the EAS is used in requesting PFD management service. Further the EES provides the same application id for requesting user plane path management event service.\nNOTE 1:\tPFD management can be optionally supported in MNO. If EES cannot invoke step 2a, it responds EAS with appropriate error.\nNOTE 2:\tThe EES can map the EASID into the application id that is used to invoke the PFD management procedure.\n3.\tIf the subscription in step 1 includes at least one of the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\" events, the EES checks if there exists a subscription with the 3GPP core network for the user plane path management event notifications corresponding to the UE information obtained in step 1 as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], which may be triggered by other EAS for the same UE. The EES checks the availability of the user plane path management event service for the UE(s).\na.\tif a subscription with 3GPP core network does not exist, then the EES subscribes with the 3GPP core network (PCF, NEF or SCEF+NEF) for the user plane path management event notifications of the UE(s) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] If the EAS provides Subscription Type and/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement, the EES include the type of subscription and/or the indication of \"AF acknowledgement to be expected\" as information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events within the AF Request;\nb.\tif a subscription with 3GPP core network exists, then the EES uses the locally cached user plane path management event notification information of the UE(s) to respond to the EAS.\nThe EES stores the subscription related to the EAS.\n4.\tIf the event is \"user plane path change\", the EES may subscribe to UE expected behaviour analytics (UE mobility and UE communication) for the group of UEs as described in 3GPP TS 23.288 [18].\n5.\tIf EAS is authorized, the EES responds with ACR management event subscribe response. If EAS is not authorized, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.\nIf the target UE(s) and the 3GPP network support mobility between 5GC and EPC, the EES monitors the availability of the user plane path management event notification from the 3GPP network by utilizing Nnef_APISupportCapability or Availability of service APIs event notifications provided by the CAPIF core function.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.3-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and the EAS for continuous ACR management event notifications.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of an ACR (Access Control Resource) management event API, which is a crucial component of a network's security infrastructure. The API is responsible for managing access control resources, such as user accounts, network resources, and security policies. The figure shows the API's interface, including the various APIs and their corresponding event types, such as \"Notify operation,\" which indicates that the API is currently in the \"Notify operation\" state. This figure provides a visual representation of the API's functionality and helps to understand how it interacts with the network's security infrastructure.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.3-1: ACR management event API: Notify operation\n1.\tThe EES detects the ACR management event of a UE (e.g. receiving User plane path management event notification for a UE from the 3GPP core network) , or receiving ACR request from the EEC, or when the selected ACR scenario list for a particular AC changes.\na.\tIf \"user plane path change\" Event is subscribed, the EES may cache the detected User plane path management event notification locally with timestamp as the latest information of the UE(s) and start the notification aggregation for a group of UEs. The EES decides whether to aggregate and the aggregation period based on the analytics result received from the 3GPP Core Network, local policy and User Plane path management subscription information received from the EAS. The EES determines to notify the user plane path management event notification information (e.g., DNAI) to the EASs which has subscribed for the \"user plane path management\" event.\nb.\tIf \"ACR monitoring\" Event is subscribed, based on the detected user plane path change report sent from the 3GPP core network, the EES checks whether the target DNAI is in the EAS profile of the subscribing EAS, if not it further checks whether a T-EAS is available at the target DNAI as described in steps 2-4 of clause 8.8.3.2. If a T-EAS is available, the EES notifies the EAS with T-EAS endpoint; otherwise this event notification will not be sent. Also, when the EES receives the ACR request from the EEC, the EES decides to send the notification to the EAS.\nc.\tIf \"ACR facilitation\" Event is subscribed, based on the detected user plane path change report sent from the 3GPP core network, the EES checks whether the target DNAI is in the EAS profile of the subscribing EAS, if not it further checks whether a T-EAS is available at the target DNAI as described in steps 2-4 of clause 8.8.3.2. If a T-EAS is available, the EES selects the T-EAS from the discovered EAS list and applies the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the selected T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network. The EES also notifies the S-EAS with the selected T-EAS endpoint.\nd.\tIf \"ACT start/stop\" event is subscribed, during the ACR launch if the EEC indicates the need to notify the EAS in the ACR request as described in clause 8.8.3.4, the EES shall send notification to the EAS to inform it about the need to start or stop the ACT to or from another EAS. The EES may include a service continuity planning indication so that the EES will monitor UE location. The notification message includes ACR identity (ACID, UE ID, S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint).\ne.\tIf “ACR Selection” event is subscribed, the EES shall send notification to the EAS to update the selected ACR scenario list applicable for a particular AC (ACID, UE ID) if an update was received as described in clause 8.15.2.2.\n2.\tThe EES sends ACR management event notification to the EAS. The EES includes the ACR management event notification information of the UE(s) and optionally the timestamp. If the event triggering the notification is DNAI change, the timestamp can be included to indicate the age of the user plane path management event notification information. The EES may only provide part of information included in the user plane path management event notification from 3GPP network (e.g. target DNAI). If the EAS had provided \"Indication of EAS acknowledgement\", the EES waits for acknowledgement from the EAS before it sends AF acknowledgement to the 3GPP core network.\nIf the event is \"ACT start/stop\", the notification shall include the endpoint address of the other EAS and the UE ID. The \"ACT start\" notification may include ACR parameters as per clause 8.8.3.9. Upon receiving the notification about the start of the ACR execution with \"ACT start\" event, the S-EAS avoids triggering a second ACR execution for the same identity (ACID, UE ID, S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint) until the current ACR execution is completed.\nNOTE:\tHow long the detection entity should wait for current ACT to complete in order to start to detect or to decide another ACR is up to the implementation.\nIf the event is “ACR Selection”, the notification shall include the selected ACR scenario list, ACID and UE ID. Upon receiving the notification, the EAS determines if it should perform ACR detection and/or ACR decision for a particular AC (ACID, UE ID).\n3.\tIf the EAS had included Indication of EAS Acknowledgement within ACR management event subscribe request described in clause 8.6.3.2.1, the EAS sends EAS Acknowledgement as a response to ACR management event notification to the EES either immediately or after the required ACT is completed. The EAS may reply in negative, e.g., the EAS may determine not to perform ACR. Then, the EES sends the AF acknowledgement to the 3GPP core network.\nIf the EAS had included Indication of EAS acknowledgement for service continuity planning within ACR management event subscribe request described in clause 8.6.3.2.1, the EAS sends EAS Acknowledgement as a response to ACR management event notification for service continuity planning of which detailed procedure is described in step 4 of clause 8.8.3.9.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.4-1 illustrates the subscription update operation between the EAS and the EES for ACR management event notifications.\nThe figure depicts an ACR (Access Control Resource) management event API, specifically focusing on the subscription update operation. It illustrates the process of updating an ACR subscription, which is an essential component of network management and security. The figure includes various elements such as the ACR, subscription, and update operation, as well as the API interface and the response status. This figure provides a clear and concise representation of the ACR management event API, making it easier for network administrators to understand and manage their ACR subscriptions.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.4-1: ACR management event API: Subscription update operation\n1.\tThe EAS sends ACR management event subscription update request to update an existing subscription. The subscription update request may include Event ID, Event Filter, Event Report, Subscription Type (Early and/or Late notification defined in clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]) and/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the EAS is authorized for the operation.\nIf authorized and if the subscription in step 1 includes only \"ACT start/stop\" event, the EES stores the updated subscription related to the EAS and step 3 is skipped.\nIf authorized, and if the subscription in step 1 includes at least one of the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\" events, the EES checks if there exists a subscription with the 3GPP core network for the user plane path management event notifications corresponding to the updated information obtained in step 1 as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], which may be triggered by other EAS for the same UE.\na.\tif a subscription with 3GPP core network does not exist corresponding to the updated information, then the EES subscribes with the 3GPP core network (PCF, NEF or SCEF+NEF) for the user plane path management event notifications of the UE(s) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] If the EAS provides Subscription Type and/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement, the EES includes the type of subscription and/or the indication of \"AF acknowledgement to be expected\" as information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events within the AF Request;\nb.\tif a subscription with 3GPP core network exists corresponding to the updated information, then the EES uses the locally cached user plane path management event notification information of the UE(s) to respond to the EAS.\nThe EES stores the updated subscription related to the EAS.\n3.\tThe EES may update the subscription to the UE expected behaviour analytics.\n4.\tThe EES responds with ACR management event subscription response.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe operation between the EAS and the EES for ACR management event notifications.\nThe figure depicts an ACR (Access Control Resource) management event API, specifically the Unsubscribe operation, which is used to manage access control resources. The figure shows the API interface, including the request and response formats, as well as the status of the operation. The figure also includes a visual representation of the API's flow, showing how the request is processed and the response is returned.\nFigure 8.6.3.2.5-1: ACR management event API: Unsubscribe operation\n1.\tThe EAS sends ACR management event unsubscribe request to the EES to cancel the ACR management event subscription.\n2.\tThe EES checks if another EAS requires to track the UE's user plane path change or not. If not, the EES unsubscribes the user plane path management event notifications from the 3GPP core network for the corresponding UE.\n3.\tThe EES unsubscribes from the UE expected behaviour analytics, if applicable.\n4.\tThe EES checks if the EAS is authorized for the operation. If authorized, the EES removes the subscription related to the EAS and sends ACR management event unsubscribe response to the EAS.\nThe following information flows are specified for ACR management event API:\n-\tACR management event subscription, notification, subscription update and unsubscribe.\nTable 8.6.3.3.2-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event subscribe request from the EAS to the EES.\nTable 8.6.3.3.2-1: ACR management event subscribe request\n\nTable 8.6.3.3.3-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event subscribe response from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.3.3.3-1: ACR management event API subscribe response\n\nTable 8.6.3.3.4-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event notification from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.3.3.4-1: ACR management event notification\n\nTable 8.6.3.3.5-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event subscribe request from the EAS to the EES.\nTable 8.6.3.3.5-1: ACR management event subscription update request\n\nTable 8.6.3.3.6-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event subscription update response from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.3.3.6-1: ACR management event subscription update response\n\nTable 8.6.3.3.7-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event unsubscribe request from the EAS to the EES.\nTable 8.6.3.3.7-1: ACR management event unsubscribe request\n\nTable 8.6.3.3.8-1 describes the information elements for an ACR management event unsubscribe response from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.3.3.8-1: ACR management event unsubscribe response\n\nTable 8.6.3.4.1-1 illustrates the API for ACR management event.\nTable 8.6.3.4.1-1: Eees_ACRManagementEvent API\n\nAPI operation name: Eees_ACRManagementEvent_subscribe\nDescription: The consumer subscribes to receive an ACR management event.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.2.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.3.\nSee clause 8.6.3.2.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_ACRManagementEvent_Notify\nDescription: The consumer is notified of an event by the EES.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.4.\nOutputs: None.\nSee clause 8.6.3.2.3 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_ACRManagementEvent_UpdateSubscription\nDescription: The consumer updates an existing subscription for an ACR management event.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.5.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.6.\nSee clause 8.6.3.2.4 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_ACRManagementEvent_Unsubscribe\nDescription: The consumer unsubscribes for the previously subscribed events.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.7.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.3.3.8.\nSee clause 8.6.3.2.5 for details of usage of this operation.\n",

                            "text_content": "EES exposes UE Identifier API to the EAS and EEC in order to provide an identifier uniquely identifying a UE. This API is used by an EAS or EEC to obtain the identifier of the UE if the EAS or EEC does not have it (e.g. hasn't already cached). This identifier, called UE ID and defined in clause 7.2.6, is used by the EAS to invoke capability APIs specific to UEs over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending on the UE ID type.\nThe EAS's direct invocation of the UE Identifier API of the EES may result in UE ID not found response (e.g. if the NATed UE's public IPv4 address can't be resolved by the core network). Under such circumstances, the EAS may choose to signal its AC to trigger the UE ID query onto the EEC over EDGE-5 (see clause 8.14.2.6). In turn, the EEC would invoke the EES's UE Identifier API using the UE's CN assigned IP addresses (i.e. IPv4 and/or IPv6) which should result in return of the UE ID to the EEC and from thereon to the AC and the EAS.\nNOTE 1:\tTo overcome CN UE's assigned private IP address reuse issue (e.g. UE's private IPv4 reuse by 5GC), the EES would need to be pre-configured with the public IP address range (used by the NAT function over N6) and its associated IP domain.\nNOTE 2:\tEEC retrieval of the UE's IP address from the device is out of scope.\nFigure 8.6.5.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the EAS or EEC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS or EEC is authorized to discover and to use UE Identifier API provided by the EES.\n2.\tWhen the EEC is used to invoke the UE Identifier API with the UE IPv6 address as the input parameter, the UE IPv6 address may or may not be NATed. If NATed however, the IPv6 may not be reused (i.e. assigned to more than one UE simultaneously). If the EEC already has the UE ID (GPSI as per clause 7.2.6), and it needs the Edge UE ID to share with an AC/EAS, this procedure can still be used to retrieve Edge UE ID.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for an application that allows users to identify their device's unique identifier (UE ID) in a 6.5 GHz spectrum. The interface includes a dropdown menu for selecting the desired frequency range, a button for submitting the request, and a confirmation message indicating the successful submission. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different options available for selecting the frequency range.\nFigure 8.6.5.2-1: UE Identifier API\n1.\tThe EAS or EEC invokes UE Identifier API exposed by the EES. If it is the EAS invoking the API and it recognizes that the UE’s IP address is a public IP address, i.e., the UE is behind a NAT, the Port Number and associated IP address should be included in user information.\n2.\tThe EES uses the received user information in the step 1 (e.g. IP address) and obtains the UE identifier by interacting with NEF as specified in clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]. If it is the EEC invoking the API with only UE IP address, it shall be interpreted by EES that EEC is requesting the UE ID for interaction with EES (hence EES shall use its own AF Identifier towards NEF and consequently the UE ID is EES specific). When the EES needs to interact with the NEF's Nnef_UEId_Get (see TS 23.502 clause 4.15.10 \"AF specific UE ID retrieval\") as per EAS request, the EES may use either its own AF Identifier or EASID as AF Identifier instead of its own AF Identifier.\n3.\tThe EES provides the UE identifier to the EAS or to EEC (i.e. whichever invoked the API). The UE identifier returned in the response which is referred to as UE ID may be the 3GPP Core Network assigned UE ID (aka AF-specific UE ID; see TS 23.502 clause 4.15.10) or the EES-generated Edge UE ID as defined in clause 7.2.9. If UE ID (GPSI as per clause 7.2.6) is included in the request received from EEC, the EES can provide the Edge UE ID based on the received UE ID and step 2 can be skipped. For EEC requesting the UE ID for interaction with EES, the EES returns its 3GPP Core Network assigned UE ID (aka AF specific UE ID, which is a GPSI in the form of an External ID as per clause 7.2.6) to the EEC.\nEditor's note:\t[SA3] Whether and how user's consent is obtained to share the UE identifier with a particular EAS or EEC is SA3's responsibility.\n4.\tThe EAS uses the UE ID received in step 3 to invoke capability exposure API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending on the UE ID type. The EEC can use the UE ID which is EES specific received in step 3 to invoke API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-1 reference point.\nNOTE:\tUE ID of type CN-assigned can be used over EDGE-1, EDGE-3 and EDGE-7 whereas the UE ID of type EES-generated Edge UE ID can be used over EDGE-3 only.\nThe following information flows are specified for UE Identifier API:\n-\tUE Identifier request and response.\nTable 8.6.5.3.2-1: UE Identifier API request\n\nEditor's note: [SA3] It is FFS whether the IP address (i.e. User information) provided in the request can be verified that is indeed the UE’s and whether the UE provided infomation (IP Address) can be trusted.\nEditor's note: It is FFS to determine if EASID (clause 7.2.4) definitions need to be updated in order to be consistent with its use (as per EAS ID list IE) as an AF ID in UE Identifier API.\nTable 8.6.5.3.3-1: UE Identifier API response\n\nTable 8.6.5.4.1-1 illustrates the APIs for UE Identifier.\nTable 8.6.5.4.1-1: Eees_UE_Identifier API\n\nAPI operation name: Eees_UEIdentifier_Get\nDescription: The consumer requests identifier of a UE.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.5.3.2.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.5.3.3.\nSee clause 8.6.5.2 for details of usage of this operation.\n",

                            "text_content": "The EES exposes the Session with QoS API to the EAS in order to support the setup of a data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and the modification of the QoS of this data session.\nThe Session with QoS API exposed by the EES relies on the northbound Policy Authorization Service API exposed by the PCF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], if the EES is connected to the PCF via the N5 reference point, or on the northbound AF Session with QoS Service API exposed by the NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], if the EES is connected to the PCF via an NEF.\nThis API supports to apply the required QoS for both ongoing session and future session for a UE or a group of UEs.\nThe level of support of the Session with QoS API may change due to UE mobility between 5GC and EPC. E.g. QoS monitoring is only applicable in 5GC. If an EES exposes the Session with QoS API to EAS(s) for a UE, the EES monitors such changes and provides the available information to the EAS.\nAlternatively to using the API described in the following clauses, the EAS may also act as an AF and directly access the 3GPP Core Network capabilities to request an AF session with QoS (see clause 8.7.2). For any data session between AC and EAS, the EAS shall use only one of these alternatives.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.2-1 illustrates the session with QoS create operation between the EAS and the EES. It is used to request reservation of resources for a data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and to subscribe to certain session with QoS event notifications.\nThe figure depicts a session with the QoS API, where a user can create an operation to set up a session with the QoS API. The figure includes a user interface with various options for creating a new operation, such as selecting the type of operation (e.g., create, update, delete), specifying the parameters (e.g., operation name, operation type, operation type, etc.), and selecting the QoS API to use (e.g., QoS API, QoS API, etc.). The figure also includes a visual representation of the user interface elements, such as buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, to guide the user through the process of creating a new operation.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.2-1: Session with QoS API: create operation\n1.\tThe EAS requests establishment of a data session between the AC and the EAS with a specific QoS (either QoS reference or bandwidth). If the data session can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations, the request may include a list of alternative QoS references in a priority order. The EAS shall include the UE's IP address, UE ID or UE Group ID, the DNN and S-NSSAI used for the data session between AC and EAS. With the same request the EAS subscribes to receive certain session with QoS event notifications (e.g. notifications related to QoS monitoring, usage monitoring for sponsored data connectivity and/or QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled).\n2.\tThe EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation for the UE. If authorized, then the following services of 3GPP CN may be used by the EES:\na.\tthe EES invokes the PFD management procedure with the 3GPP Core Network as described in 3GPP TS 23.682 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [8] with an application id. At least one of the IP flow description, domain description or URI sent by the EAS is used for requesting PFD management service. Further the EES provides the same application id for requesting data session with specific QoS in step 2c or step 4.\nNOTE 1:\tPFD management can be optionally supported in MNO. If EES cannot invoke step 2a, it responds EAS with appropriate error.\nNOTE 2:\tThe EES can map the EASID into the application id that is used to invoke the PFD management procedure.\nb.\tthe EES invokes the Event Monitoring service for PDU session status with the 3GPP Core Network, as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nc.\tthe EES invokes the Policy Authorization Create service or the AF Session with QoS service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], providing the specific QoS (QoS reference or bandwidth) to the PCF as described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], clause 6.1.3.22. Additionally, the EES may subscribe to notifications of resource allocation outcome and to other events described in clause 6.1.3.18 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], e.g. notifications of when the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled.\nThe usage of step 2b and step 2c is as follows:\n-\tIf the request is for a group of UEs identified by the UE Group ID or for a single UE identified by the UE ID, then EES executes step 2b. If UE (single UE or UE group member) already has ongoing PDU session, then UE IP address is retrieved in step 2b. Further the EES executes step 2c; otherwise the EES waits for further notification for PDU session status in step 4.\n-\tIf the request is for a single UE identified by the IP address, then EES executes step 2c.\n3.\tIf the operation in step 2 is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a Result. The Context ID is to be used by the EAS for further requests (e.g. session with QoS update requests) pertaining to the same UE. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens during the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.\n4.\tWhen the EES receives the corresponding UE IP address for the single UE or UE group member from the PDU session status notification sent by the 3GPP Core Network, the EES requests data session with specific QoS as described in step 2c.\nNOTE 3:\tThe EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the successful allocation of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data session, with a separate session with QoS notify operation (see TS 23.503 [12], clause 6.1.3.18).\nFigure 8.6.6.2.3-1 illustrates the session with QoS update request operation between the EAS and the EES. It is used to request a modification of the QoS of the data session between AC and EAS.\nThe figure depicts a session with the QoS API, where an update operation is being performed. The session includes a session ID, a session key, and a session ID value. The update operation involves updating the session key and session ID value.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.3-1: Session with QoS API: update operation\n1.\tThe EAS requests a modification of the QoS of the data session between the AC and the EAS, e.g. by including a different QoS reference or different bandwidth value. The EAS shall include the Context ID.\nThe EAS may also request a modification of the event monitoring by subscribing to new events and updating or removing subscriptions to existing events.\n2.\tThe EES checks if there is a context for the Context ID available and whether the EAS is authorized for this operation. If yes and the UE IP address is known by the EES, the EES invokes the Policy Authorization Update service or AF Session with QoS Update service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], providing the updated information to the PCF or NEF, respectively. The EES may subscribe to additional events or unsubscribe to certain events, if necessary.\n3.\tIf the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens during the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.\nNOTE:\tThe EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the successful modification of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data session, with a separate session with QoS notify operation (see 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], clause 6.1.3.18).\nFigure 8.6.6.2.4-1 illustrates the session with QoS revoke operation between the EAS and the EES. It is used to revoke the data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and to unsubscribe to the related session with QoS event notifications.\nThe figure depicts a session with the QoS API, specifically the revoke operation, which is used to manage and control the quality of service (QoS) of a session. The session involves a user interacting with a QoS API, which is a key component of the QoS API. The figure shows the user's interaction with the API, including the request and response, as well as the status of the operation. The figure also includes a visual representation of the session, such as the user's interaction with the API and the response from the API. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the QoS API and its operation.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.4-1: Session with QoS API: revoke operation\n1.\tThe EAS requests a revoke of the data session with QoS between the AC and the EAS. The EAS shall include the Context ID.\n2.\tThe EES checks if there is a context for the Context ID available and whether the EAS is authorized for this operation. If yes, then the EES unsubscribes from the PDU session status monitoring (if applicable) and invokes the Policy Authorization Delete service or AF Session with QoS Revoke service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]. This deletes the application session context at the PCF or NEF and removes the subscription to any session with QoS event notifications.\n3.\tIf the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens during the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.5-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and the EAS for session with QoS event notifications.\n\nThe figure depicts a session with the QoS API, where the user is notified of the operation status.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.5-1: Session with QoS API: notify operation\n1.\tThe EES detects a user plane event associated with the established session (i.e. it receives a Policy Authorization Notify operation from the PCF or an AF Session with QoS Notify operation from the NEF as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]). The EES determines to notify the session with QoS event notification information (e.g., resource allocation outcome or information that the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled) to the EASs which have subscribed to the session with QoS event notification.\n2.\tThe EES sends a session with QoS event notification to the EAS. The EES includes the session with QoS event notification information of the UE.\nThe following information flows are specified for Session with QoS API:\n-\tSession with QoS create request and response;\n-\tSession with QoS update request and response;\n-\tSession with QoS revoke request and response; and\n-\tSession with QoS event notification.\nTable 8.6.6.3.2-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS create request from the EAS to the EES.\nTable 8.6.6.3.2-1: Session with QoS create request\n\nTable 8.6.6.3.3-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS create response from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.6.3.3-1: Session with QoS create response\n\nTable 8.6.6.3.4-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS update request from the EAS to the EES.\nTable 8.6.6.3.4-1: Session with QoS update request\n\nTable 8.6.6.3.5-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS update response from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.6.3.5-1: Session with QoS update response\n\nTable 8.6.6.3.6-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS revoke request from the EAS to the EES.\nTable 8.6.6.3.6-1: Session with QoS event API revoke request\n\nTable 8.6.6.3.7-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS revoke response from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.6.3.7-1: Session with QoS revoke response\n\nTable 8.6.6.3.8-1 describes the information elements for a Session with QoS event notification from the EES to the EAS.\nTable 8.6.6.3.8-1: Session with QoS event notification\n\nTable 8.6.6.4.1-1 illustrates the API for Session with QoS.\nTable 8.6.6.4.1-1: Eees_SessionWithQoS API\n\nAPI operation name: Eees_SessionWithQoS_Create\nDescription: The consumer requests a data session with the UE with a specific QoS and may also subscribe to certain event notifications related to the user plane traffic.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.2.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.3.\nSee clause 8.6.6.2.2 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_SessionWithQoS_Update\nDescription: The consumer requests a modification of the QoS of the data session with the UE and may also update event notifications related to the user plane traffic.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.4.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.5.\nSee clause 8.6.6.2.3 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_SessionWithQoS_Revoke\nDescription: The consumer requests a revoke of the data session with QoS with the UE and unsubscribes to all related event notifications.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.6.\nOutputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.7.\nSee clause 8.6.6.2.4 for details of usage of this operation.\nAPI operation name: Eees_SessionWithQoS_Notify\nDescription: The consumer is notified by the EES of an event related to the user plane traffic.\nInputs: See clause 8.6.6.3.8.\nOutputs: None.\nSee clause 8.6.6.2.5 for details of usage of this operation.\n",

ACR execution starts with T-EAS discovery, which can be triggered by EEC, EAS and EES.\nNOTE 3:\tAfter a decision that another EAS is to serve the UE, the S-EAS can decide if the existing Application Context is transferred to the new EAS.\nThe EAS may utilize the following capabilities provided by the EES for supporting service continuity at the application layer:\n-\tSubscribe to service continuity related events and receive corresponding notifications;\n-\tDiscover the T-EAS; and\n-\tACR from a S-EAS to a T-EAS.\nThe EES can utilize the following capabilities provided by the ECS for supporting service continuity at the application layer:\n-\tRetrieve the T-EES.\nThe EEC may determine if the ACR is required by detecting that the UE moved or is predicted or expected to move outside the service area (see clause 7.3.3). The service area can be provided to the EEC by either the ECS during Service Provisioning or EES during EAS Discovery. For the PDU Session of SSC mode 3, if the UE receives PDU Session Modification Command as specified in clause 4.3.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], the EEC may determine that the ACR is required. For IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC may determine that ACR is required if the UE is notified of the existence and availability of a new IPv6 prefix as specified in clause 4.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 4:\tFor IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC can be aware of the notification about the IPv6 prefix configuration due to change of PSA UPF based on the UE implementation.\nAfter successful ACR:\n-\tThe EES is informed of the completion by the EAS; and\n-\tThe EEC is informed of the completion by the EES.\nIn general, a number of steps are required in order to perform ACR. The potential roles of an edge enablement layer in ACR include:\n-\tproviding detection events;\n-\tselecting the T-EAS(s); and\n-\tsupporting the transfer of the application context from the S-EAS(s) to the T-EAS(s).\nIf the UE is connected to the 5GC, the EES/EAS acting as AF may utilize AF traffic influence functionality from the 3GPP CN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nA high level overview of ACR is illustrated in Figure 8.8.1.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a high-level overview of ACR (Automatic Call Rejection), a crucial component in a telecommunications network. It illustrates the various components and their interactions, such as the call center, the call center server, and the call center application. The figure provides a visual representation of the flow of calls, the routing of calls, and the interaction between different systems. It highlights the importance of ACR in maintaining call quality and reducing call wait times.\nFigure 8.8.1.1-1: High level overview of ACR\nACR can be performed for service continuity planning, which means that the first three steps in Figure 8.8.1.1-1 detection, decision and execution, are performed as defined in clause 8.8.1.2, e.g. when the UE is predicted to move outside the service area of the serving EAS. In such a case the T-EAS is to service the UE when it moves to the expected location.\nEES can handle multiple ACR requests simultaneously. When there are multiple simultaneous ACR, the ACR shall be uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint.\nService continuity planning is an Edge Enabler Layer value-add feature of providing support for seamless service continuity, when information about planned, projected, or anticipated behaviour is available at EESs or provided by EECs.\nTo implement this functionality an EES may utilize:\n-\tinformation provided by the EEC e.g., AC Schedule, Expected AC Geographical Service Area, Expected AC Service KPIs, Preferred ECSP list; and\n-\t3GPP core network capabilities utilized by EES as described in clause 8.10.3.\nIn service continuity planning, the Application Context may be duplicated and sent from the S-EAS to the T-EAS before the UE moves to the expected location. In this case, the Application Contexts in S-EAS and T-EAS are synchronized when the Application Context is updated until the AC connects to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 1:\tThe information elements of the Application Context and how the Application Context is synchronized between the S-EAS and the T-EAS is up to implementation of the application.\nNOTE 2:\tIn the case of EELManagedACR, the Application Context synchronization is accomplished using the same mechanism as when transferring the context from the S-EES to the T-EES.\nFor additional details on service continuity planning for ACR, see clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6.\nThe interval between ACT initiation and ACR status update message from EAS to EES (i.e. taking the context into use) can be significant (e.g. in the predicted case). During this interval, the following events are possible:\na)\tThe UE remains communicating with the S-EAS, e.g. the UE does not move to the service area of the T-EAS; or\nb)\tThe UE moves to a service area served by a different T-EAS (other than the T-EAS towards which the ACR was initiated).\nFor the ACRs initiated by the EEC, in case of events a) and b) the EEC should re-send an ACR request with the information of the current ACR and the updated information as described in clause 8.8.3.4 and defined in clause 8.8.4.4. For a) if the action is initiation the EEC sets T-EAS endpoint under ACR initiation action to indicate the S-EAS. For b) if the action is initiation the UE sets T-EAS endpoint under ACR initiation action to the new T-EAS.\nNOTE:\tTimeouts if required for discarding unused contexts for ACR scenarios can be specified in stage 3.\nDuring an ACR for service continuity planning, the circumstances can change which results in the changes in the parameters related to ACR. In such cases modification of the ACR will be required. For example, the EEC or EES can monitor the UE’s mobility and obtain updates in the predicted location or other ACR parameters e.g. prediction expiration time.\nFor ACRs initiated by the S-EES, the S-EES may detect a change of the expected UE behaviour. In particular, S-EES acting as AF, may receive a UE location report or a monitoring event report from 5GC (assuming that S-EES has subscribed to consume 5GC services like LCS or NEF monitoring events related to UE actual location, or UE mobility analytics from NWDAF). In case of a change in ACR parameters, e.g. prediction expiration time, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.9 to send the updated parameters to T-EES and T-EAS\nFor the ACRs initiated by the EEC, the EEC/AC may detect a change of the expected UE location. For example, EEC may detect the UE location update as a result of a UE mobility event or obtain an indication from the AC that the expected UE location or UE mobility or both are changed. In this case, in case of a change in ACR parameters, e.g. prediction expiration time, the EEC launches ACR with action \"ACR modification\" with the information identifying the current ACR and the updated parameters as described in clause 8.8.3.4 and defined in clause 8.8.4.4. If the request is to the S-EES, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.9 to send the updated parameters to T-EES and T-EAS.\nIf the ACR modification requires the change of T-EAS, this case is described in clause 8.8.1.3.\nService continuity between CAS and EAS can be supported with CES or without CES, corresponding to the architecture options described in clause 6.2d and 6.2c.\nACR scenarios between CAS and EAS are described in clause 8.8.2A and clause 8.8.2B.\nThis clause describes solution of relocating EASs in a bundle together instead of individual relocation for AC-EAS sessions one by one. To avoid ACR being triggered for each EAS in a bundle with different initiators (e.g. EAS 1 and EAS 2 in a bundle trigger ACR simultaneously), a main EAS may be used and a main EES is used correspondingly. The main EAS or EES is responsible for ACR detection and initiation in the network side. The main EAS information is sent to EEL and the main EES is the EES registering the main EAS.\nNOTE 1:\tASP can have requirement of the dependencies between bundled EAS(s) when provisioning them for any deployment scenario, and indicate whether the affinity between them as strong (co-deployment is essential) or weak (co-deployment is only \"nice to have\").\nNOTE 2:\tIt is possible that some EASs in a bundle do not need relocation because the UE can still be served by these EASs. A deployment example is both EASs providing services covering the whole city and EASs providing services covering city district are serving the AC as an EAS bundle, and when UE moves from one district to another district in the city, only EASs serving the district from where UE is moving out need relocation.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the proxy type of bundle, the main EAS is the connecting EAS serving the AC.\nNOTE 4:\tIn current release of the specification, the main EAS is selected by ASP.\n",

The scenarios in this clause are different with regards to\na)\twhether the EEC is involved in the detection phase and decision phase or detection and decision involve the S-EAS or S-EES only;\nb)\twhether T-EAS discovery is performed between EEC and T-EES or between S-EES and T-EES;\nc)\twhether the EEC sends an Application Context Relocation Request towards the S-EES, the T-EES or none at all; and\nd)\twhether the Application Context is pushed from the S-EAS to the T-EAS or pulled by the T-EAS from S-EAS.\nGenerally, AC, EEC, EES and EAS implementations will support only a subset of these scenarios; therefore, during EAS discovery and T-EAS discovery the S-EES and T-EES shall take the ACR scenarios supported by the AC and EEC and any preferences indicated by the EEC for specific ACR scenarios into account when identifying the EAS(s) for the EAS discovery response, as specified in clause 8.5.2.2 and clause 8.8.3.2, or for the EAS discovery notification, as specified in clause 8.5.2.3.3.\nFurthermore, when the EEC performs EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, the EES or T-EES shall inform the EEC about the ACR scenarios which are supported by the EAS or T-EAS, respectively.\nThe EEC shall take the information about supported ACR scenarios provided by the ECS, S-EES and T-EES into account when selecting an EES for EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively, and when selecting an EAS for edge services.\nFor clarity of description, scenarios in clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6 describe the relocation of a single application context to a new EAS. Multiple ACs can be active in the UE and relocation can be executed for each AC (or group of ACs) that requires service continuity.\nFor each of the scenarios in clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6, ACR for one or more ACs can result in the same EEC receiving services from more than one EES, which have the registration for the required EASs that can serve the ACs. In scenarios described in clause 8.8.2.4 and clause 8.8.2.5, a successful EEC context relocation procedure enables the EEC to become implicitly registered to the target EES without the EEC sending an EEC registration request.\nIf selected ACR scenario list exists, the ACR scenarios are initiated based on this list.\nIn this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE expecting to move to, a new location which is outside the service area of the serving EAS. The EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause 8.14.2.4.\nThis scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) and EAS Discovery (as specified in clause 8.5) procedures to discover the T-EES and EAS that shall serve the AC as a result of the UE's new location, and that shall receive the Application Context from the serving EAS.\nThis scenario relies on the EDGE-5 interface between the EEC and AC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC in the UE already has a connection to a corresponding S-EAS;\n2.\tThe preconditions listed in clause 8.3.3.2.2 with regards to the EEC are fulfilled; and\n3.\tThe EEC is triggered when it obtains the UE's new location or is triggered by another entity such as an ECS notification or AC trigger.\nNOTE 1:\tThis scenario is applicable only for an Edge-aware AC and EAS.\n\nThe figure depicts a communication system with a focus on the ACR (Access Control Register) initiated by the EEC (European Economic Community) and AC (Access Control). The ACR is a crucial component in the communication system, responsible for managing and controlling access to the network. The figure shows the ACR in a graphical format, with the EEC and AC represented by different colored lines and symbols. The ACR is initiated by the EEC, which is a regulatory body responsible for the regulation of the European telecommunications market. The AC is a component of the communication system that allows for the transmission of data between devices. The figure provides a visual representation of the communication system's structure and components, making it easier to understand and interpret.\nFigure 8.8.2.2-1: ACR initiated by the EEC and AC\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe EEC detects the UE location update as a result of a UE mobility event and is provided with the UE's new location as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The EEC can also detect an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the EEC is triggered by an external entity such as by a notification from the ECS, a list of new EESs (to be used as T-EESs) is provided by that notification and step 3 below is skipped.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tEither the AC or the EEC makes the decision to perform the ACR. If the EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 3:\tWhich applications require ACR can be decided based on the application profile, e.g. requirement of service continuity of the application.\nIf the change in UE's location does not trigger a need to change the serving EAS, steps 3 onwards are skipped. The EEC remains connected to the serving EES(s) and the AC remains connected to its corresponding serving EAS.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has changed, the Service Provisioning procedure results in a list of T-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location in the Service Provisioning procedure (as specified in clause 8.3) contains the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location.\nIf Service Provisioning results in no T-EES, and if ACR to CAS is supported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause 8.8.2A.2.\n4.\tThe EEC performs EAS discovery (as specified in clause 8.5) for the desired T-EASs by querying the T-EESs that were established in step 3 (or provided in the notification from the ECS – if it was the trigger). If EEC registration configuration for the EESs established in step 2 indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs EEC registration with the EESs (as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2) before sending the EAS discovery request. Step 5 is skipped if EAS discovery procedure results in only one discovered T-EAS.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and the \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied EAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches respective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the IE.\n5.\tThe AC and EEC select the T-EAS to be used for the application traffic.\nNOTE 4:\tSeveral EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\n6.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (without the need to notify the EAS). When the S-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC, then the S-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in clause 8.8.3.4. If the EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is expected that the AC will inform EAS about UE location monitoring is not needed\n7.\tIf the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\n8.\tThe AC is triggered by the EEC to start ACT. The AC decides to initiate the transfer of application context from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. There may be different ways of transferring context and they are all outside the scope of this specification.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning has been triggered, the AC connects to the T-EAS when the UE moves to the predicted location. Otherwise, the rest of this step is skipped.\nAfter the ACT is completed, the AC remains connected to the T-EAS and disconnects from the S-EAS; the EEC is informed of the completion.\nNOTE 6:\tWhether and how the AC initiates the ACT is out of scope of the present document\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the expected/predicted location the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 7:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 8:\tIt is out of scope of this specification how the AC informs the S-EAS and T-EAS that ACT was part of service continuity planning. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 9 and 10 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform the Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 9:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n9.\tThe S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8.\n10.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 10:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 11:\tSteps 9 and 10 can occur in any order.\n11.\tIf the status in step 9 indicates a successful ACT, for non-planning case the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 9 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nIn this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause 8.14.2.4. Figure 8.8.2.3-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the S-EES.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS; and\n2.\tThe EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of the execution of the Enhanced Early Correction (EEC) and Advanced Early Correction (AEC) algorithms in a communication system. The EEC algorithm is executed in the first phase, while the AEC algorithm is executed in the second phase. The figure illustrates the steps involved in the execution of these algorithms, including the use of a feedback loop to correct errors in the received signal. The figure also shows the communication paths between the transmitter and receiver, as well as the use of error correction codes to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 8.8.2.3-1: EEC executed ACR\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe EEC decides to proceed required procedures for triggering ACR. If the EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or performing service provisioning procedure per clause 8.3 of the present document. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location in the Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) procedure contains the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location. If the UE is within the service area of the T-EES, upon selecting T-EES the UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the target EDN. If EEC registration configuration for the T-EES indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs EEC registration with the selected T-EES as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2. The EEC can then discover and select T-EAS by performing EAS Discovery with the T-EES per clause 8.5.2 of the present document.\nIf service provisioning results in no T-EES, and if ACR to CAS is supported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause 8.8.2A.3.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and the \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied EAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches respective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the IE.\nNOTE 1:\tSeveral EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\n4a.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES authorises the request from the EEC. The S-EES decides to execute ACR based on the information received from the EEC, EEC context and/or EAS profile. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable) and sends the ACR management notification for the \"ACT start\" event to the S-EAS, as described in clause 8.6.3, to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. In ACT start, the S-EES includes indication of service continuity planning if the S-EES determine to monitor UE mobility. If the EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\n4b.\tIf the ACR request in step 4a includes ACR parameters, e.g. Prediction expiration time, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure by sending the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES as described in clause 8.8.3.9.\n5.\tIf the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\n6.\tThe S-EAS transfers the application context to the T-EAS at implementation specific time. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 2:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 7 and 8 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform the Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n7.\tThe S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8.\n8.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 6:\tSteps 7 and 8 can occur in any order.\n9.\tIf the status in step 7 indicates a successful ACT, for non-planning case the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case, if the EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 7 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nIn this scenario, the S-EAS may detect the need of ACR locally or is notified by the S-EES via ACR management notifications or UE location notifications. The S-EAS make the decision about whether to perform the ACR, and starts the ACR at a proper time.\nNOTE 1:\tFor this clause, S-EAS either supports ACR detection capability or performs subscription for ACR management event to EES.Pre-conditions:\n1.\tThe S-EAS may depend on the receipt ACR management events from the S-EES, e.g. \"user plane path change\" events or \"ACR monitoring\" events as described in clause 8.6.3, to detect the need for an ACR. The S-EAS may also depend on the receipt of UE location notification from the S-EES as described in clause 8.6.2.2.3, to detect the need for an ACR. For the following procedure it is assumed that the S-EAS has subscribed to continuously receive the respective events from the S-EES; and\n2.\tThe EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for target information notification events and ACR complete events from the S-EES, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of an S-EAS decision algorithm, which is used to determine the appropriate action to take in a given situation. The algorithm is based on the ACR (Acceptance Cost Ratio) and is used to make decisions in the context of a communication system. The figure shows the flow of information from the source to the destination, with the ACR being the key metric used to determine the best action to take.\nFigure 8.8.2.4-1: S-EAS decided ACR\nS-EAS decided ACR is outlined with four main phases: detection, decision, execution and clean up.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe S-EAS either receives ACR management notifications from source Edge Enabler Sever indicating that ACR may be required (\"ACR monitoring\" event), or self detects the need for ACR (e.g. upon receipt of a \"user plane path change\" event or UE location notification). If the ACR management notification indicates \"ACR monitoring\" event, then the notification will also contain the T-EAS information (see clause 8.6.3.2.3). The S-EAS may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the S-EAS self detects the local need for ACR is outside the scope of this specification.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe S-EAS makes the decision to perform the ACR If the S-EAS has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again. per clause 8.6.3.2.3.\nNOTE 3:\tHow the S-EAS determines when to start the ACR is outside the scope of this specification. The ASP can have service agreement with ECSP regarding which EES API to use for ACR detection.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe S-EAS discovers the T-EAS as described in clause 8.8.3.2. When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, then UE Location and Target DNAI values in the Retrieve T-EES procedure contain the expected UE Location and expected Target DNAI. After S-EAS determines the T-EAS to use, the S-EAS may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\nIf T-EAS discovery results in no T-EAS, and if ACR to CAS is supported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause 8.8.2A.4.\n4.\tThe S-EAS sends selected T-EAS declaration message to S-EES, to inform S-EES the determined T-EAS to use as described in clause 8.8.3.7. The S-EAS may send the ACID and Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area to the EES. When the EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EAS, then the EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility.\n5.\tIf the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\n6.\tBased on the T-EAS selection information received from the S-EAS, the S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3. The selected T-EES may be included in the target information and the ACID which corresponds to the selected target EAS is included in the notification sent to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 6 can be performed after step 4. The S-EES can send target information notification to the EEC immediately after having the target information in order to avoid EEC to initiate another ACR with the same identity.\n7.\tThe S-EAS transfers the application context to the T-EAS selected in step 3. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 5:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 6:\tWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 8 and 9 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 7:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR clean up\n8.\tThe S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8.\n9.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 8:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 9:\tSteps 8 and 9 can occur in any order.\n10.\tIf the status in step 8 indicates a successful ACT, for non-planning case the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 8 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nFigure 8.8.2.5-1 illustrates the S-EES detecting, deciding and executing ACR from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. This may include EELManagedACR by S-EES when initiated by S-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.6. The EEC or the S-EAS may also detect the ACR as illustrated in figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nNOTE 1:\tFor this clause, S-EAS either supports ACR detection capability or performs subscription for ACR management event to EES.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS;\n2.\tThe EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES;\n3.\tThe EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for target information notification events and ACR complete events from the S-EES, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2;\n4.\tThe S-EAS optionally subscribed to receive ACR management notifications for \"ACR facilitation\" events to the S-EES, in order to enable detection at S-EAS.\n5.\tIn case of EELManagedACR, the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACT status notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.3.\n\nThe figure depicts a 5G network scenario with various elements such as base stations (BSs), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The figure also shows the fiber-optic backbone architecture, which is a key component of 5G networks, providing redundancy and failover reliability.\nFigure 8.8.2.5-1: S-EES executed ACR\n1.\tThe S-EAS may initiate EELManagedACR with S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.6. The S-EAS and S-EES negotiate an address of the Application Context storage to S-EES. The S-EAS puts the Application Context at this address which can be further accessed by the S-EES when the ACT is required.\nIn the EELManagedACR case, the S-EES executes steps 2 (i.e., S-EES is the detection entity), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14. Rest of steps are skipped.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n2.\tDetection entities (S-EAS, S-EES, EEC) detect that ACR may be required and identify the ACID and Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The detection by the S-EES may be triggered by the User Plane path change notification received from the 3GPP Core Network due to S-EAS request for \"ACR facilitation\" event (see clause 8.6.3) or due to step 1.\nThe detection entity may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n3.\tThe detection entity performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) with the ACR action indicating ACR determination and the corresponding ACR determination data. If the EEC or S-EAS detect the ACR event, the EEC or S-EAS may inform S-EES with ACID, and predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area in the ACR launching procedure.\n4.\tThe S-EES authorises the message if received. The S-EES decides to execute ACR based on the information received or local detection, and the information of EEC context or EAS profile, and then proceed the below steps. When the S-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC or the EAS in ACR determination, or the S-EES received service continuity planning from EAS in ACR facilitation event subscription, then the S-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. If S-EES has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.6.3.2.3.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n5a.\tThe S-EES determines T-EES and T-EAS via the Discover T-EAS procedure in clause 8.8.3.2 of the present document. When in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, then UE Location and Target DNAI values provided in the Retrieve T-EES procedure contain the expected UE Location and expected Target DNAI. The S-EES may decide not to perform ACR if T-EAS is not available.\nIf T-EAS discovery results in no T-EAS, and if ACR to CAS is supported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause 8.8.2A.5.\n5b.\tIf required, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure by sending the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES as described in clause 8.8.3.9. For example, when the ACR is for service continuity planning, and the S-EES has received it in ACR launch in step 2, the S-EES sends ACR parameter information request which includes Prediction expiration time.\n6.\tIf the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\n7.\tThe S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 7 can be performed after step 5. The S-EES can send target information notification to the EEC immediately after having the target information in order to avoid EEC to initiate another ACR with the same identity\n8.\tThe S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\n9.\tThe S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification for \"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause 8.6.3 or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS.\n10.\tThe Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the T-EAS at implementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES accesses the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the S-EES and T-EES engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the T-EAS (obtained as per step 5) in a secure way. Further the T-EAS accesses the Application Context made available by the T-EES. If S-EAS performs the ACT directly with T-EAS, the specification of such process is out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Application Context is encrypted and protected by the application layer. The S-EES and the T-EES engage in the packet level transport of the Application Context and they have no visibility to the content of the Application Context.\nWhen in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 12 and 13 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted or expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n11.\tIn case of EELManagedACR, once the ACT is successful, the T-EES sends an ACT status notification to the T-EAS as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.4, indicating that the Application Context is available.\n12.\tThe S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8.\n13.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 7:\tSteps 12 and 13 can occur in any order.\n14.\tIf the status in step 12 indicates a successful ACT or in the EELManagedACR case, the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 12 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 8:\tThe Application Client mechanism to support switchover of the application traffic to T-EAS is out of scope of the specification.\nIn this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause 8.14.2.4. Figure 8.8.2.6-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the T-EES.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe EEC has the S-EAS information that serves the AC.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of an electrical energy conversion (ECC) system, specifically an ACR (Active Current Reduction) circuit. The circuit is executed through a T-EES (Tunnel-Equivalent Energy Storage) system, which is a key component in the design. The figure illustrates the flow of electricity through the circuit, with the T-EES system acting as a buffer to store energy and provide a stable power supply to the ECC system. The circuit is executed in a 6-1 configuration, with the ACR circuit being executed in the 6th position and the T-EES system in the 1st position.\nFigure 8.8.2.6-1: EEC executed ACR via T-EES\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe EEC decides to proceed with required procedures for ACR. If the EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 1:\tIf supported, the AC can be involved in the decision. It is out of scope of the present document how the AC is involved.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or performing service provisioning procedure per clause 8.3. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location used in the service provisioning procedure contain the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location. If the UE is within the service area of the T-EES, upon selecting the T-EES the UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the target EDN. If EEC registration configuration for the T-EES indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs registration with the selected T-EES as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2. The EEC performs EAS Discovery with the T-EES per clause 8.5.2.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and the \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied EAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches respective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the IE.\nNOTE 2:\tSeveral EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\n4.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the T-EES with predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to notify the EAS). When the T-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC, then the T-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. If the received ACR initiation request contains an EEC context ID and the S-EES Endpoint, the T-EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2). The T-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable). Then the T-EES sends the ACR management notification with \"ACT start\" event message to the T-EAS, the T-EES includes indication of service continuity planning if the T-EES determines to monitor UE mobility during post-ACR phase. If the ACR request in ACR launching procedure includes ACR parameters, e.g. Prediction expiration time, the T-EES includes the ACR parameters in the notification to T-EAS. The EEC also subscribes to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the T-EES, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\n5.\tThe T-EAS initiates ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before the T-EAS performs the Post ACR Clean up step 6 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR clean up\n6.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\n7.\tThe T-EES immediately sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3 for non-planning case. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when T-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 6 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nIf the procedure fails after step 4, it will be terminated with an appropriate cause in the ACR information notification to the EEC in step 7. The EEC may then proceed attempting to obtain services from the T-EAS discovered in step 3 without service continuity support. Alternatively, the EEC may resume the present procedure starting with step 4 and selecting a different T-EES discovered in step 3 with EAS service continuity support.\nNOTE 7:\tThe support of ACR between EDNs operated by different ECSPs is dependent on business agreement between the ECSPs.\nIn this scenario, the EEC executes necessary ACR for AC-EAS service session(s) in a bundle, and it follows the scenario described in clause 8.8.2.3 with the following differences:\n-\tall T-EAS(s) in a bundle requiring service continuity are discovered and selected during step 3. If the affinity is set to strong, then T-EASs are from the same EDN.\nNOTE:\tT-EAS(s) should be within the same EDN as preferred if EAS affinity is preferred, or different EDNs if no T-EAS(s) in same EDN available, if the EAS affinity is set to weak.\n-\tall bundled T-EAS endpoints are sent to the corresponding S-EES(s) in the ACR request and the S-EES(s) may apply AF traffic influence for the received T-EAS(s) in step 4a.\n-\tEach associated EES (i.e. EES serving bundle EASs) aggregates ACR status update from its served and bundled EASs in step 7 and step 8 and sends ACR complete notification to the EEC in step 9.\n-\tThe EEC collects ACR complete notifications in step 9 and completes the ACR for the EAS bundle.\nIn this scenario, the main S-EAS executes and triggers necessary ACR for all AC-EAS service session(s) in a bundle.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.4-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe main S-EAS may depend on the receipt of ACR management events from its S-EES, e.g. \"user plane path change\" events or \"ACR monitoring\" events as described in clause 8.6.3, to detect the need for an ACR. The main S-EAS may also depend on the receipt of UE location notification from its S-EES as described in clause 8.6.2.2.3, to detect the need for an ACR. For the following procedure it is assumed that the main S-EAS has subscribed to continuously receive the respective events; and\n2.\tThe EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for target information notification events and ACR complete events from S-EESs serving the EAS bundle, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nThe figure depicts a S-E A S executed ACR (Automatic Call Rejection) for an EAS (Enhanced Automatic Switching) bundle, illustrating the process of identifying and rejecting unwanted calls.\nFigure 8.8.2.8-1: S-EAS executed ACR for EAS bundle\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tACR is detected, the procedure is same as step 1 of clause 8.8.2.4.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe main S-EAS performs ACR decision for bundled EASs.\nNOTE 1:\tThe main S-EAS is aware of all bundle EASs service area and/or DNAIs so it can decide whether to perform ACR for the corresponding EASs.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe main S-EAS discovers from all candidate T-EAS(s) in EAS bundle as described in clause 8.8.3.2. If the affinity is set to strong, then T-EASs are from the same EDN. The main S-EAS may apply AF traffic influence for all bundled T-EAS(s).\nNOTE:\tT-EAS(s) should be within the same EDN as preferred if EAS affinity is preferred, or different EDNs if no T-EAS(s) in same EDN available, if the EAS affinity is set to weak.\n4.\tThe procedure is same as step 4 to step 6 of clause 8.8.2.4. The main S-EAS sends selected T-EAS declaration message to the main S-EES with the selected T-EASs, the main S-EES sends selected T-EAS(s) to the EEC.\n5.\tThe main S-EES informs associated S-EESs with bundled T-EASs. Then ACT starts between the S-EAS(s) and T-EAS(s) in a bundle requiring service continuity.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n6.\tDuring post-ACR, all S-EASs and T-EASs send ACR status update to S-EES and T-EES, respectively, as described in step 8 and step 9 of clause 8.8.2.4. The EEC collects ACR complete notifications from all S-EESs and ACR for EAS bundle is completed.\nIn this scenario, a main S-EES (serving a main S-EAS) executes and triggers necessary ACR for AC-EAS service session(s) in a bundle.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.5-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe AC at the UE already has a connection with S-EASs in a bundle;\n2.\tThe EEC subscribes to receive ACR information notifications for target information notification events and ACR complete events from S-EESs serving the EAS bundle, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2;\n3.\tThe main S-EAS may subscribe to receive ACR management notifications for \"ACR facilitation\" events to the main S-EES, in order to enable ACR detection at the main S-EES.\n\nThe figure depicts a scenario where S-E ES executed ACR (Automatic Call Rejection) for an EAS (Enhanced Automatic Switching) bundle. The EAS bundle is a crucial component in a telecommunications network, responsible for managing and routing calls. The ACR process involves identifying and rejecting calls that are not intended for the intended recipient. This can help in reducing call traffic and improving network efficiency. The figure shows the process in action, with the EAS bundle being the central focus, and the ACR system in action to ensure the correct calls are routed to the intended recipients.\nFigure 8.8.2.9-1: S-EES executed ACR for EAS bundle\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe main S-EES detects the need for ACR, the procedure is same as step 2 of clause 8.8.2.5.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe main S-EES performs ACR decision for bundled EASs.\nNOTE 1:\tThe main S-EES is aware of all bundle EASs service area and/or DNAIs so it can decide whether to perform ACR for the corresponding EASs.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe main S-EES discovers all candidate T-EAS(s) in EAS bundle as described in clause 8.8.3.2.

The main S-EES sends selected T-EAS(s) to the EEC, triggers application traffic influence for T-EAS(s) and notifies the main S-EAS with selected T-EAS of the same EAS service. The main S-EES may notify more S-EAS(s) with selected T-EAS of the corresponding EAS service.\n5.\tThe main S-EES performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data to the associated S-EES(s).\n6.\tThe associated S-EES(s) notifies the corresponding bundled S-EAS(s) and ACT starts between the S-EAS(s) and T-EAS(s) in a bundle requiring service continuity.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n7.\tDuring post-ACR, all S-EASs and T-EASs send ACR status update to S-EES and T-EES, respectively, as described in step 12 and step 13 of clause 8.8.2.5.

The ACR can be triggered by a change or expected change in UE location or in case of an overload situation or maintenance aspects in the S-EAS or EDN if no suitable target EAS is found as described in clause 8.8.1.1 depending on the scenario.\nTo facilitate future ACRs from the CAS back to EAS, the EEC may request and receive an AF-specific UE ID or Edge UE ID from the S-EES as described in clause 8.6.5, which can be used by the CAS to perform EAS discovery on the S-EES when there is an ACR from CAS back to an EAS. The EEC may also request to subscribe to notifications from the S-EES via the SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 to receive ACR notifications if the EEC is no longer within reach from the S-EES.\nIn this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE expecting to move to, a new location which is outside the service area of the serving EAS. It further relies on the EEC being triggered as a result of the UE's movement.\nThis scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) and DNS procedures to discover the CAS that shall serve the AC as a result of the UE's new location, and that shall receive the Application Context from the serving EASs. The scenario below describes the relocation of a single application context to a CAS. However, it should be repeated for each active AC in the UE for which EAS or EDN is not available on that UE location.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.2-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an EAC (Enhanced Access Control) system is being enabled using CAS (Conditional Access Services) to enhance security and manage access to the network. The EAC system initiates the process by using regular EAS Discovery, which is a method of identifying and managing access to the network. This enables the EAC system to control access to the network based on the user's identity and the type of access required.\nFigure 8.8.2A.2-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\t Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has changed, this procedure results in unavailability of T-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE.\n4.\tIf the change in the UE's location triggers a need to change the S-EAS but the EEC is not provided with a T-EAS, the EEC informs the AC of the unavailability of a suitable EDN for the new location of the UE.\n5.\tThe AC triggers the UE to perform DNS resolution for the CAS relevant for the AC. The UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the CAS.\n6.\tThe AC sends ACR request to the EEC and the EEC responds ACR response to the AC.\n7.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (along with the details of the CAS and without the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in clause 8.8.3.4. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10.\n8.\tThe AC is triggered by the EEC to start ACT. The AC decides to initiate the transfer of application context from the S-EAS to the CAS.\nAfter the ACT is completed, the AC remains connected to the CAS and disconnects from the S-EAS; the EEC is informed of the completion of the ACT.\nThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context (e.g. based on monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n9.\tSame as step 9 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\n10.\tSame as step 11 described for figure 8.8.2-1.\nIn this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in clause 8.8.1.1. Figure 8.8.2A.3-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the S-EES.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.3-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nThe figure depicts a schematic of an ACR (Access Control Router) with CAS (Certificate Authority) enabled, illustrating the process of enabling S-EES (Security Enhanced Egress) for secure communication. The figure includes various components such as EEC (Egress Encapsulation Controller), S-EES, and E-EES (Egress Encapsulation). The diagram highlights the importance of CAS in ensuring secure communication, with the EEC and S-EES playing crucial roles in the process.\nFigure 8.8.2A.3-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - EEC executed ACR via S-EES\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\t Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has changed, this procedure results in unavailability of T-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE. Service provisioning or discovery of relevant T-EAS may not result in EES configuration or T-EAS is not discovered respectively. If no T-EES is available based on service provisioning response, the AC or EECtriggers the UE to perform DNS resolution for the cloud application server relevant for the AC as described in clause 8.14.2.5.3, 8.14.3.12 and 8.14.3.15. The UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the CAS.\n4.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (along with the details of the CAS and with the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES authorises the request from the EEC. The S-EES decides to execute ACR based on the information received from the EEC and/or EAS profile. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable) and sends the ACR management notification for the \"ACT start\" event to the S-EAS, as described in clause 8.6.3, to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the CAS. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10. If the EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\n5.\tThe S-EAS transfers the application context to the CAS at implementation specific time. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nNOTE 1:\tThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n6.\tSame as step 7 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\n7.\tSame as step 9 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nNOTE 2:\tThe CAS can perform capability exposure subscription with 3GPP CN directly, upon receiving the application context, which may be helpful for handling future ACR scenarios e.g. ACR from cloud to edge.\nIn this scenario, the S-EAS may detect the need of ACR locally or is notified by the S-EES via ACR management notifications for \"ACR monitoring\" events. The S-EAS make the decision about whether to perform the ACR, and starts the ACR at a proper time.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.4-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an ACR (Access Control Router) is enabled with CAS (Conditional Access Service) to manage network access based on the user's identity. The figure shows the various components involved in the setup, including the ACR, CAS, and S-EAS (Security-Enhanced Access Service). The figure also includes a diagram of the network topology, highlighting the connections between the ACR, CAS, and S-EAS.\nFigure 8.8.2A.4-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - S-EAS decided ACR scenario\nS-EAS decided ACR is outlined with four main phases: detection, decision, execution and clean up.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\t Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tIf the ACR required is self detected, the S-EAS requests the S-EES to discover the targets. When S-EES determines that no relevant EAS is available for the UE's location, the discovery response returns T-EAS discovery failure. After S-EAS determines to use CAS and performs the DNS query/discovery, the S-EAS may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\n4.\tThe S-EAS sends selected CAS declaration message to S-EES, to inform S-EES the determined CAS to use as described in clause 8.8.3.7, where T-EAS in that procedure is assumed to be CAS. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10.\n5.\tBased on the CAS selection information received from the S-EAS, the S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.\n6.\tThe S-EAS transfers the application context to the CAS selected in step 3. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nNOTE 1:\tThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n7.\tSame as step 8 described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\n8.\tSame as step 10 described for figure 8.8.2-1.\nNOTE 2:\tThe CAS can perform capability exposure subscription with 3GPP CN directly, upon receiving the application context, which may be helpful for handling future ACR scenarios e.g. ACR from cloud to edge.\nFigure 8.8.2A.5-1 illustrates the S-EES detecting, deciding and executing ACR from the S-EAS to the CAS. This may include EELManagedACR by S-EES when initiated by S-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.6.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.5-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.5-1, with the clarification that T-EAS is CAS and pre-condition 5 for EELManagedACR is not applicable.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an enabling ACR (Access Control Resource) is executed with CAS (Client Authentication Service). The ACR is enabled using S-EES (Security Enabling Environment) and CAS, which are executed in the context of an ACR. The figure illustrates the process of enabling ACR with CAS, highlighting the steps and the use of S-EES and CAS.\nFigure 8.8.2A.5-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - S-EES executed ACR\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n2.\tSame as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n3.\t Same as step 3 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\n4\t Same as step 4 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n5.\tThe S-EES determines the targets via the Discover T-EAS procedure in clause 8.8.3.2.\nIf T-EAS discovery fails, then S-EES triggers DNS query message using the endpoint information (e.g., FQDN) in the S-EAS profile.\nBased on the determination of CAS, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10. For EELmanagedACR, the CAS subscribe to S-EES to receive ACT status notifications.\n6.\tSame as step 7 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\n7.\tThe S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\n8.\tThe S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification for \"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause 8.6.3 or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the CAS.\n9.\tThe Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the CAS at implementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES accesses the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the S-EES either engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the CAS (obtained as per step 5) in a secure way. Further the CAS accesses the Application Context. The S-EAS may also perform the ACT directly with CAS, the specification of such process is out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Application Context is encrypted and protected by the application layer. The S-EES engages in the packet level transport of the Application Context and has no visibility to the content of the Application Context.\nNOTE 2:\tThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n10.\tSame as step 11 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\n11.\tSame as step 12 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\n12.\tIf the status in step 11 indicates a successful ACT, the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Application Client mechanism to support switchover of the application traffic to CAS is out of scope of the specification.\nIn this scenario, the CAS detects the need for ACR and makes the decision about whether to perform the ACR and starts the ACR at a proper time.\nDuring the ACR execution phase, the CAS may need to determine an EES in the service area of the EEC before continuing with T-EAS discovery. The CAS may send the EAS discovery request to the S-EES that selects an appropriate T-EES and T-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.2 where the CAS acts as a S-EAS.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe CAS has a business relationship with the ECSP, otherwise, the EES will reject the CAS request during authorization.\n-\tPrior to being connected to the CAS, the EEC was connected to an S-EES that may still hold its context and the CAS knows the S-EES (e.g. as in clause 8.8.3.10 when ACR is performed from EAS to CAS).\n-\tAC has obtained the UE ID as per clause 8.14.2.6 and forwarded it to the CAS while performing ACR from EAS to CAS as described in clause 8.8.2A.1 or the CAS knows UE ID having used the procedure defined in clause 8.6.5.\nThe figure depicts a complex network architecture, specifically highlighting the role of the Access Control (ACR) system in determining the access to the Enhanced Early Access Service (EAS) through the use of the Service-to-Early Access Service (S-EES) mechanism. The figure illustrates the various components involved in the ACR process, including the Access Control List (ACL), the Access Control Rules (ACR), and the Service-to-Early Access Service (S-EES). The figure also shows the use of the Service-to-Early Access Service (S-EES) mechanism, which allows ACR to determine the access to EAS based on the ACR. The figure is crucial for understanding the ACR system's role in ensuring the security and reliability of the network.\nFigure 8.8.2A.6-1: CAS decided ACR with T-EAS Discovery via S-EES\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe CAS detects the need for ACR. The CAS either receives ACR management notifications from S-EES indicating that ACR may be required (\"ACR monitoring\" event), or self detects the need for ACR (e.g. upon receipt of a \"user plane path change\" event).\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe CAS makes the decision to perform the ACR.\nPhase III: ACR Execution\n3.\tSame as steps 3 to 5 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS and it may provide the UE ID in the T-EAS discovery request for the S-EES to identify the UE during discovery. If ACR monitoring event is used in step 1, the T-EAS discovery in step 3 of clause 8.8.2.4 is skipped by the CAS.\n4.\tIf the S-EES can communicate with the EEC, step 6 from clause 8.8.2.4 is performed to notify the EEC of the selected T-EES. Otherwise, the notification is sent to the EEC via the SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 if the EEC has subscribed to receive notifications from the S-EES or via Application Triggering via core network.\n5.\tSame as step 7 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS.\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\n6.\tSame as step 8 to step 9 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS.\n7.\tIf the S-EES can communicate with the EEC, step 10 from clause 8.8.2.4 is performed.

This procedure may be utilized by a S-EAS, which undertakes the transfer of application context information to a T-EAS directly, or can be invoked by the S-EES itself on deciding to execute ACR.\nT-EAS discovery procedure also supports EAS retrieval which enables a S-EAS to obtain T-EAS(s) serving the application group so that the S-EAS can start communication with obtained EAS(s) for EAS synchronization.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tInformation related to the EES is available with the S-EAS, if the procedure is triggered by the S-EAS.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of T-EAS, a technology that enables the efficient transmission of data over a wide range of distances. The figure illustrates the various components and their connections, including the transmitter, the antenna, the receiver, and the optical fiber. The T-EAS technology is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional wireless communication systems, allowing for faster data transmission and improved network performance.\nFigure 8.8.3.2-1: Discover T-EAS\n1a.\tThe S-EAS sends the EAS discovery request to the S-EES or the S-EES decides to execute the ACR. The EAS discovery request from the S-EAS includes the requestor identifier [EASID] along with the security credentials and includes EAS discovery filter matching its EAS profile. If target DNAI is available at the S-EAS via User Plane Path change event, the S-EAS provides the S-EES with the target DNAI. The S-EAS also includes an EAS service continuity support indicator indicating that the S-EAS decided ACR according to clause 8.8.2.4 is to be used for the ACR. The S-EAS includes the bundle ID and bundle type indicating the proxy bundle case to which the S-EAS belongs to. The request may include prediction expiration time.\nThe EAS may send EAS discovery request with EAS ID, Application Group ID and EAS synchronization support, which indicates the request to obtain EAS(s) currently serving the Application Group ID with the requested EAS ID in order to perform EAS synchronization.\nNOTE 1:\tThe trigger condition to invoke the Discover T-EAS API is up to application service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.\n1b.\tThe S-EES either receive the target DNAI for T-EES discovery from the step 1a or by the user plane management event notification from the core network.\n2.\tIf the request is received from the S-EAS, the S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform the discovery operation.\nIf Application Group ID and EAS synchronization support in EAS characteristics are received and the ECS-ER is available, the S-EES checks with the ECS-ER with the received EAS ID and Application Group ID and obtains a list of EAS(s) supporting EAS synchronization and serving the application group for the desired application service identified by the EAS ID as described in clause 8.20. Step 2 to step 4 are skipped.\nIf the UE location is not known to the S-EES or provided by the S-EAS request, then the S-EES may interact with 3GPP core network to retrieve the UE location. If the S-EES decided to execute the ACR or when the requesting EAS is authorized, the S-EES checks if there exists a T-EAS information (registered or cached) that can satisfy the requesting EAS information, additional query filters and the Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum required AC Service KPIs if received from the EEC during the EAS discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1. In this case, the S-EES may collect Edge load performances from ADAES or OAM to find T-EAS(s) that satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs. The S-EES may determine the use of statistics or prediction for evaluating KPIs based on the situation of the T-EAS discovery. If the S-EES finds the T-EAS(s) in the cached or registered information, the flow either continues with step 5 for the S-EAS triggered discovery or stops for the S-EES decided ACR execution, else the S-EES retrieves the T-EES address from the ECS as specified in clause 8.8.3.3 and continues with step 3.\n3.\tThe S-EES invokes the EAS discovery request on the T-EES retrieved from the ECS. The EAS discovery request includes the requestor identifier [EESID] along with the security credentials and includes EAS discovery filter. In the EAS discovery filter, the S-EES may include prediction expiration time, the Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum required AC Service KPIs if received from the EEC during the EAS discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1.\nThe S-EES also includes the EEC service continuity support indicator received from the EEC during EAS discovery. If in step 1 the S-EES received an EAS service continuity support indicator from the S-EAS, then the S-EES includes this EAS service continuity support indicator and its own EES service continuity support indicator indicating the ACR scenarios supported by the EES. If in step 1 the S-EES decided to execute the ACR, the S-EES includes the EAS service continuity support indicator received from the S-EAS during EAS registration and includes an EES service continuity support indicator indicating that the S-EES executed ACR according to clause 8.8.2.5 is to be used for the ACR.\nUpon receiving the request, the T-EES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the T-EAS that matches with EAS discovery filter IEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause 8.12.\n4.\tThe T-EES discovers the T-EAS(s) and responds with the discovered T-EAS information to the S-EES. To filter T-EAS(s), the T-EES utilizes the discovery filters (e.g. Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum required AC Service KPIs) and the indications which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC, the EEC, the T-EES and the S-EAS. If T-EES gets the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs, the T-EES may collect edge load analytics from ADAES (as specified in clause 8.8.2 of TS 23.436 [28]) or performance data from OAM to find T-EAS(s) that satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs. The T-EES may determine the use of statistics or prediction for evaluating KPIs based on the situation of the T-EAS discovery. The S-EES may cache the T-EAS information.\nWhen the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) is provided and the bundle type indicating the direct bundle, and the S-EES received associated T-EES(s) along with part of EAS ID list in the step2 from the ECS, then the S-EES discover the target direct bundle EAS(s) which belongs to same EDN for all the associated S-EES(s). The request message contains direct bundle EAS(s) information (i.e. list of EASID and direct bundle type). Then the S-EES receives the direct bundle T-EAS(s) information from each associated T-EES(s).\nNOTE 2:\tT-EES(s) may belongs to same EDN.\nNOTE 3:\tThe edge load analytics from ADAES can be either statistics or predictions on the T-EAS.\nNOTE 4:\tThe statistical KPI value can be used for both normal ACR and service continuity planning.\n5.\tIf the request was received from the S-EAS, the S-EES responds to the S-EAS with the discovered T-EAS Information.\nFor responding S-EAS requesting EAS serving the application group, only EAS endpoint and EAS ID are included in EAS profile of Discovered EAS list.\nFigure 8.8.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the S-EES to retrieve the T-EES information from the ECS.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe S-EES has been pre-configured with the address of the ECS; and\n2.\tThe AC at the UE already has on-going application traffic with the S-EAS.\nThe figure depicts a T-EES procedure, which stands for \"T-EES\" in the context of telecommunication. The figure shows a step-by-step process for retrieving T-EES information, including the steps to initiate the procedure, the steps to retrieve the T-EES data, and the steps to analyze and interpret the data. The figure is a visual representation of the T-EES procedure, making it easy to understand and follow.\nFigure 8.8.3.3-1: Retrieve T-EES procedure\n1.\tThe S-EES sends the Retrieve EES request (UE location information or UE identity, EASID of the S-EAS, bundle ID, bundle type (i.e. proxy bundle case), target DNAI and UE connectivity information) to the ECS in order to identify the T-EES which has an EAS available to serve the given AC in the UE. For obtaining announcement EES list, the Retrieve EES request includes application group id. The request message may also contain the AC, EEC service continuity support information.\n2.\tIf the request contains the UE identity (e.g. GPSI) but the UE location is not known to the ECS, then the ECS interacts with 3GPP core network to retrieve the UE location. The ECS determines T-EES(s) as per the parameters (e.g. EASID, target DNAI) in the request and the UE location information. If the request message contains the AC, EEC service continuity support information, then the ECS may identify the T-EES taking the AC, EEC, T-EES service continuity support into consideration. When the bundle ID and is provided and bundle type indicating the proxy bundle case then the ECS can identify the T-EES based on the bundle ID in the EES profile and in the request message to ensure T-EAS is able to invoke the required proxy bundle EAS(s) as the S-EAS does.\nIf no ECS-ER is available and when the Retrieve EES request includes application group id to the ECS then the request EES list retrieval is for the announcement of common EAS, ECS determines the list of EESs serving the EASs (with same EASID) for the Group ID included in the Retrieve EES request.\nIf the ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration available at the ECS and UE’s location, the ECS determines a partner ECS that may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use preconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or ECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause 8.17.2.3 or both.\nIf required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning information retrieval procedure as specified in clause 8.17.2.4 to obtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then if bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, then the ECS identifies the one or more T-EES associated with the same EDN which support all of the EASs within the same EDN based on the EES EDN information obtained in the EES profile.\nNOTE 1:\tT-EES(s) may belongs to same EDN.\n3.\tThe ECS sends the Retrieve EES response. If the ECS has determined the EDN configuration information, the retrieve EES response includes the list of EDN configuration information to the S-EES. The list of EDN configuration information includes the EDN details with the endpoint information of T-EES(s) as described in table 8.3.3.3.3-2. If the ECS has determined suitable partner ECS(s) instead, the retrieve EES response includes a list of ECS configuration information.\nThe ECS may provide associated T-EES(s) information (one or more T-EES information) to the S-EES in the Retrieve T-EES response along with the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASIDs). When S-EES receives multiple associated T-EES(s), then each associated T-EES information is provided along with the part of the EAS ID list.\nIf the retrieve EES response contains a list of ECS configuration information, the S-EES may initiate retrieve T-EES procedure with one or more ECS(s) listed in the retrieve EES response.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Retrieve EES request initiated by the S-EES can be restricted only to its registered ECS.\nFigure 8.8.3.4-1 illustrates the ACR launching procedure by the EEC or the S-EAS or the S-EES.\nIf this procedure is triggered by the EEC, depending on the ACR action indicated in the ACR request, the procedure is used for ACR initiation, ACR determination or ACR modification which is described in clause 8.8.1.4. The procedure of the ACR initiation can be re-sent as described in clause 8.8.1.3 to cancel an ACR.\nIf this procedure is triggered by the S-EAS, the procedure is used for ACR determination.\nIf this procedure is triggered by the S-EES to the associated S-EES(s), this procedure is used for the direct bundle EAS case.\nPre-condition:\nFor EEC as consumer:\n1.\tThe EEC has been authorized to communicate with the EES as specified in clause 8.11, if the procedure is triggered by the EEC.\nFor S-EAS as consumer:\n1.\tInformation related to the S-EES is available with the S-EAS.\nFor EES as consumer:\n1.\tThe S-EES obtained the associated S-EES(s) information as specified in clause 8.15.2.2.\nThe figure depicts the ACR (Automatic Call Rejection) launching procedure, which is a crucial step in the call termination process. The diagram illustrates the various components involved in the ACR process, including the ACR server, the ACR controller, and the ACR client. The figure also shows the communication between the server and the client, as well as the communication between the server and the ACR controller. The ACR controller is responsible for processing the incoming call and determining whether to accept or reject it. The ACR client is the device that initiates the call and sends the call to the ACR server. The ACR server then processes the call and sends the call back to the ACR client. The diagram is important for understanding the flow of the ACR process and for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.\nFigure 8.8.3.4-1: ACR launching procedure\n1.\tThe EEC or the S-EAS sends an ACR request message to the EES in order to start ACR. The ACR request message may include Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area to indicate that the EES should detect whether the UE has moves to the Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area or not in ACR clean-up phase. The ACR request message includes ACR action to indicate either ACR initiation request or ACR determination request. If the procedure is triggered by the S-EAS, the ACR request message is only for ACR determination.\nAn ACR request for ACR initiation sent by the EEC:\n-\tincludes an indication of whether the EEC requests the EES to perform EAS notification; and\n-\tprovides information used by EES to perform AF traffic influence as in 3GPP TS 23 501 [2].The EEC sent ACR request for ACR initiation shall include the simultaneous EAS connectivity information in service continuity (see table 8.8.4.4-1) if previously received as part of the AC profile.\nAn ACR request for ACR determination sent either by the EEC or the EAS informs the EES that the need for ACR has been detected by the requestor.\nAn ACR request for ACR modification sent by the EEC:\n-\tincludes IDs to identify the ACR that is requested to be modified; and\n-\tincludes the ACR parameters to be modified.\nAn ACR request for direct bundle EAS case sent by the S-EES:\n-\tincludes direct bundle T-EAS(s) received in step 4 in 8.8.3.2 related to the associated S-EES(s) based on the EASID, which EASID of the associated S-EES is corresponding to the direct bundle T-EAS(s) profile.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the requestor is authorized for this operation. If authorized, the EES processes the request and performs the required operations.\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR initiation:\n-\tthe EES may use information provided in the request to apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.6.7.1; and\nNOTE:\tThe simultaneous EAS connectivity information sent by EES is used to maintain both S-PSA and T-PSA in supporting simultaneous connectivity with both S-EAS and T-EAS during the service continuity as described in clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\nEditor's note:\tSince the 3GPP CN only supports simultaneous PSA connectivity in SSC mode 3 or session breakout, it is FFS whether EES should firstly know PDU session capability before invoking AF traffic influence API.\n-\tif the EAS notification indication in ACR initiation data is provided in the step 1 request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification, the EES shall notify the EAS indicated in the ACR initiation data about the need to start ACR by sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT start\" event, as described in clause 8.6.3.\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR determination, the EES decides to execute ACR as described in clause 8.8.2.5.\nIf the request in step 1 includes Previous T-EAS Endpoint:\n-\tif the previous EAS notification indication is provided in the step 1 request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification, the EES shall notify the EAS about the cancellation of the ACR with the previous T-EAS by sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT stop\" event, as described in clause 8.6.3.\n-\tThe EAS will inform the remote EAS about application context cancellation, which is outside the scope of this specification. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES which will include failed result with an appropriate cause indicating the reason for the failure.\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR modification:\n-\tthe EES identifies the ACR to be modified based on the ID parameters in the request in step 1. If the request in step 1 is to the S-EES, the S-EES performs the ACR parameter information procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.9. If the request in step 1 is to the T-EES, and if the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACR notifications, the T-EES shall notify the T-EAS by sending an ACR management notification, with \"ACT start\" event including ACR parameters from the request in step 1, e.g. Prediction expiration time.\nIf the request in step1 is for direct bundle EAS case, then the associated T-EES may use received direct bundle T-EAS(s) for ACR.\n3.\tThe EES responds to the requestor's request with an ACR response message.\nIn case of re-sending ACR initiation, if serving EES was changed and EEC context was relocated, the T-EES can clean up any relocated EEC context either indicated in the re-sent ACR request for scenario described in clause 8.8.2.6 or upon reception of the ACR status update with failed result from T-EAS for other scenarios.\nClause 8.8.3.5.2 and clause 8.8.3.5.3 together illustrate the ACR information procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.\nThe ACR information procedure is utilized as a building block for a part of Post-ACR Clean up in clause 8.8.2 and Target information notification.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.2-1 illustrates the ACR information subscription procedure between the EEC and the EES.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to the EES;\n2.\tThe EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it to communicate with the EES as specified in clause 8.11; and\n3.\tThe EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be used in its subscriptions to notifications.\nNOTE:\tHow the EEC acquires the notification target address or a notification channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of this release. The notification target address can terminate at the EEC (e.g. in an IoT device) if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or it can terminate at a push notification service. Details of the push notification service are out of scope of this release.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with various elements such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The figure also shows the fiber-optic backbone architecture, which is crucial for ensuring reliability and failover.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.2-1: ACR information subscription\n1.\tThe EEC sends an ACR information subscription request to the EES. The request from EEC may include the ACIDs to indicate to the EES which ACs are served by the EEC that need to receive ACR information via EEL.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is authorized to subscribe ACR information about the requested EAS(s). If the request is authorized, the EES creates and stores the subscription for ACR information.\n3.\tThe EES sends an ACR information subscription response to the EEC, which includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC shall send an ACR information subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If an ACR information subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.3-1 illustrates the ACR information notification procedure between the EEC and the EES, which can be used by the EES to notify the EEC of the following:\n-\ttarget information, i.e. the details of the selected T-EAS and, if required, the selected T-EES, during ACR as described in clauses 8.8.2.4 and 8.8.2.5;\nNOTE:\tThe T-EAS and T-EES information can be used to determine the PDU session(s) to provide connectivity to the T-EAS and the T-EES. If the ACR does not require change in EES, i.e. T-EES is same as S-EES, then the T-EES information can be skipped.\n-\tACR complete events.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths for failover reliability. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.3-1: ACR information notification\n1.\tAn event (e.g. ACR complete, or Target information notification) occurs at the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for providing ACR information to a subscribed EEC.\n2.\tThe EES sends an ACR information notification to the EEC with the ACR information determined in step 1. The ACR information notification may include ACID to indicate the application context relocation of the AC is complete. If the S-EES has received the successful EEC Context Push response from T-EES, along with registration ID and the registration expiration time in the EEC Context Push relocation procedure, then the ACR information notification towards EEC also includes the registration ID and registration expiration time under EEC context relocation status (for successful status). Upon receiving the target information notification to indicate start of the ACR execution, the EEC avoids triggering a second ACR execution for the same ACR identity (ACID, UE ID, S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint) until the current ACR execution is completed.\nIf during the ACR the EES has received the successful EEC Context Push response from the T-EES and the EEC Context Push response includes T-EES selected ACR scenario list in the EEC Context Push relocation procedure, then the ACR information notification towards the EEC includes the list from T-EES as the selected ACR scenario list under EEC context relocation status (for successful status). Upon receiving the ACR complete notification, if the selected ACR scenario list is not available (for successful status), the EEC may either select ACR scenario considering the supported ACR scenarios of AC, EEC, T-EES and T-EAS or request T-EES to select list of ACR scenarios as specified in clause 8.15.\nAfter the ACR complete notification with successful ACR, if the ACR complete notification indicates that EEC context relocation has failed the EEC can trigger EAS Information provisioning procedure to perform a re-selection of the ACR scenarios.\nIf EEC context does not exist, after the ACR complete notification with successful ACR, the EEC can trigger EAS Information provisioning procedure to select the ACR scenarios.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.4-1 illustrates the ACR information subscription update procedure between the EEC and the EES.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nThe figure depicts a 5G network with various elements such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It illustrates the signal propagation in a 5G network, highlighting the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The figure also shows the fiber-optic backbone architecture, which is a key component of 5G networks.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.4-1: ACR information subscription update\n1.\tThe EEC sends an ACR information subscription update request to the EES.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is authorized for the operation. If authorized, the EES updates the subscription.\n3.\tThe EES sends an ACR information subscription update response to the EEC.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.5-1 illustrates the ACR information unsubscribe procedure between the EEC and the EES.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nThe figure depicts a 5-1 ACR information unsubscribe, which is a crucial component of a 5G network. It illustrates the process of unsubscribing from the ACR (Access Control List) information, which is essential for network security. The figure shows the various steps involved in the process, including the user's interaction with the network, the network's response, and the user's confirmation. This figure is crucial for ensuring that users can access the network securely and efficiently.\nFigure 8.8.3.5.5-1: ACR information unsubscribe\n1.\tThe EEC sends an ACR information unsubscribe request to the EES.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is authorized for the operation. If authorized, the EES terminates the subscription of the EEC.\n3.\tThe EES sends an ACR information unsubscribe response to the EEC.\nThis clause introduces a procedure for ACR performed by the Edge Enabler Servers.\nWhen S-EES receives a request for EELManagedACR from S-EAS, the S-EES performs the service operations for the service continuity including detecting the event which may trigger the ACR, making the ACR decision, discovering the T-EAS, accessing and transferring the Application Context to the T-EES/T-EAS, notifying the T-EAS about the available Application Context, notifying the 3GPP network about ACR information, notifying the EEC about the T-EAS information (as per EEC subscription).\nThe EELManagedACR procedure is designed as an asynchronous operation wherein the S-EES will generate notifications (e.g. failure of any ACR related operation) to the S-EAS while performing the ACR operations.\nThis clause describes the procedures for S-EAS to request for EELManagedACR and for T-EAS to subscribe for ACT status notification.\nFigure 8.8.3.6.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for EELManagedACR performed by the Edge Enabler Servers.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tInformation related to the S-EES is available with the S-EAS.\n2.\tThe T-EAS has subscribed to the ACR related event from the T-EES.\n3.\tThe EEC has subscribed to the ACR related event from the S-EES.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for the ACR (Automatic Call Rejection) procedure, which is a crucial step in the call center's call handling process. The figure illustrates the various steps involved in the ACR procedure, including the initial call, the call being answered, the call being transferred, and the call being rejected. The figure is a visual representation of the process, making it easier for the call center staff to understand and follow the procedure.\nFigure 8.8.3.6.2.2-1: ACR procedure\n1.\tThe S-EAS sends an EELManagedACR service request (UE identifier, EAS characteristics for ACR) to request the S-EES to handle all the service operations of the ACR. The S-EAS may initiate this request with S-EES based on different triggers (e.g. when Application Client is connecting to the S-EAS). An address for accessing the Application Context may be provided if available, which allows the S-EES to access the Application Context generated by the S-EAS for ACT.\n2.\tThe S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform the operation. If it is authorized, the S-EES responds with an EELManagedACR service response. If no address for accessing Application Context is provided by S-EAS in step 1, then the S-EES provides an address for storing the Application Context by S-EAS.\nNOTE:\tHow the EES accesses the Application Context related to the EAS from the address of the Application Context storage is up to implementation and outside the scope of the present document.\n3.\tThe S-EES determines the EELManagedACR operations to be executed as specified in clause 8.8.2.5.\nFigure 8.8.3.6.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for T-EAS to subscribe for ACT status during EELManagedACR.\nThe figure depicts the ACR procedure, which is a crucial step in the process of analyzing and correcting errors in telecommunication signals. The figure shows a step-by-step guide to perform the ACR (Automatic Corrective Reaction) on a specific signal, highlighting the importance of this step in ensuring the quality and reliability of communication.\nFigure 8.8.3.6.2.3-1: ACR procedure\n1.\tThe T-EAS sends an ACT status subscription request to the T-EES.\n2.\tThe T-EES checks whether the requesting T-EAS is authorized to perform the operation. If it is authorized, the T-EES creates the subscription.\n3.\tThe T-EES responds with the ACT status subscription response\nFigure 8.8.3.6.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for T-EES to notify the T-EAS about the status of ACT during EELManagedACR.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tACT between the S-EES and T-EES has been completed.\nThe figure depicts an ACR procedure, which stands for Automatic Control Room Procedure. It illustrates the steps involved in controlling the ACR system, including the initiation of the procedure, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the ACR, the initiation of the\nFigure 8.8.3.6.2.4-1: ACR procedure\n1.\tThe T-EES sends ACT status notification to the T-EAS, notifying about the status of the ACT between the Application Context received from the S-EES.\n2.\tOn receiving a notification about successful ACT, the T-EAS may initiate the ACR status update procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.8.\nFigure 8.8.3.7-1 illustrates the interactions between the S-EAS and the S-EES for the selected T-EAS declaration.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe S-EAS has discovered and selected the T-EAS as described in clause 8.8.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for selecting and declaring an EAS target, including the necessary steps and criteria for successful EAS operation.\nFigure 8.8.3.7-1: Selected target EAS declaration procedure\n1.\tThe S-EAS sends Selected target EAS declaration request message to the S-EES. The request includes the information of the selected T-EAS and may include ACID to indicate which AC the T-EAS is intended for.\n2.\tThe S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform operation. If authorized, the S-EES responds to the received request with Selected target EAS notification declaration response message. The S-EES also determines the selected T-EES based on the declared T-EAS selection, then S-EES checks whether the EEC (serving the ACs) has subscribed for ACR related information.\nFigure 8.8.3.8-1 illustrates the procedure for ACR status update, which is triggered by the S-EAS or the T-EAS. In the post-ACR clean up phase of service continuity scenarios described in clause 8.8.2, this procedure may be used by EAS to indicate the status of ACT to their registrar EESs; or used by the T-EAS to update the notification target address and allow the T-EES to indicate the status of EDGE-3 subscription relocation to the T-EAS including subscription ID update for EDGE-3 subscriptions; or both.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe ACT procedure between the S-EAS and the T-EAS is either successfully completed or failed.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for updating the ACR status in a network. It includes a diagram of the network, a list of steps, and a flowchart to guide the user through the process.\nFigure 8.8.3.8-1: ACR status update procedure\n1.\tThe EAS sends ACR status update request message to the EES, the request may include the ACT result (success or failure). When sent by the T-EAS, the request may include a list of EDGE-3 subscription ID(s) and Notification Target Address for which the T-EAS wants to update. In case of EELManagedACR, the ACT result is not included by the T-EAS.\n2.\tIf the request is authorized by the EES, the EES processes the request. When sent by the T-EAS, if the EDGE-3 subscriptions are available in the T-EES or were successfully relocated during the EEC context relocation procedure, the T-EES updates the Notification Target Address if provided by the T-EAS and may update the list of EDGE-3 subscription ID(s) for the EDGE-3 subscriptions.\nWhen the ACR status update request message of step 1 includes the ACT result, it shall also include the UEID and endpoint information of the other EAS involved in the ACT. The EES uses UEID and EAS endpoint information to identify the corresponding ACR. In cases where the ACT result indicates failure of the ACR (i.e. failure with a cause indicating cancellation of the ACR), the T-EES which receives the ACR status update request message removes the transferred EEC context.\n3.\tThe EES responds with ACR status update response message to the EAS.If the EEC context has been established and during the ACR the T-EES has provided the Selected ACR Scenario list to the S-EES as a result of a successful push context response as per clause 8.9.2.3, after the successful ACR the T-EES updates the Session Context IE within the EEC Context in Table 8.2.8-1 by replacing Selected ACR scenario list with the Selected ACR Scenario list in the push context response. The T-EES may send the ACR Selection notification to the T-EAS if the T-EAS has subscribed to such a notification.\nNOTE:\tIf EES is not changed during ACR, the T-EES and S-EES are the same server.\nFigure 8.8.3.9-1 illustrates the procedure for sending ACR parameters from S-EES to the T-EES and T-EAS. The procedure may be used by the S-EES at the beginning of the ACR execution to provide ACR parameters, e.g. prediction expiration time, to the T-EES and T-EAS. The procedure may also be used during an ongoing ACR to update ACR parameters.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe ACR has been launched to the S-EES.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for analyzing the ACR parameter information in a 9-1-3 ACR (Automatic Control Room) system. The figure includes a flowchart, a list of steps, and a legend to guide the user through the process. The ACR system is designed to provide real-time monitoring and control of the system, ensuring that it operates efficiently and safely.\nFigure 8.8.3.9-1: ACR parameter information procedure\n1.\tThe S-EES sends the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES.\n2.\tThe T-EES checks if the requestor is authorized for this operation. If authorized, the T-EES processes the request.\n3.\tIf the request is authorized and if the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACR notifications, the EES shall notify the T-EAS by sending an ACR management notification, with \"ACT start\" event including ACR parameters from the request in step 1, e.g. Prediction expiration time.\n4.\tIn case of service continuity planning, if the T-EAS had included indication of EAS Acknowledgement within ACR management subscribe request, the T-EAS sends EAS Acknowledgement as a response to the ACR management notification. In the Acknowledgement, the T-EAS indicates the acceptance or rejection of the ACT considering ACR parameters (e.g. prediction expiration time).\nNOTE:\tThe T-EAS can use the ACR parameters to handle the ACR. For example, the T-EAS can consider prediction expiration time in deciding whether and for how long to wait for the AC of the UE to connect to it. If the ACT is performed, and the AC does not connect to the T-EAS by \"Prediction expiration time\", the EAS can send ACT failure with the appropriate cause to the EES. In that case, the T-EAS can delete the transferred application context.\n5.\tThe EES responds to the requestor's request with an ACR parameter information response message.\nThe selected EES declaration request is triggered when an ACR is performed from EAS to CAS.\nFigure 8.8.3.10-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the CAS for the selected EES declaration.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA serving EES is selected for the EEC and the serving EES decides to inform CAS. The serving EES is the last EES serving the EEC during the ACR from EAS to CAS.\n2.\tAC has requested and forwarded the UE ID as per clause 8.14.2.6 while performing ACR from EAS to CAS as described in clause 8.8.2A or the CAS knows UE ID using procedure defined in clause 8.6.5.\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for selecting the E ES declaration in a 10-100 Mbps Ethernet network. The procedure includes steps for selecting the E ES, defining the E ES, and defining the E ES configuration. The figure also includes a flow diagram to illustrate the process.\nFigure 8.8.3.10-1: Selected EES declaration procedure\n1.\tThe EES sends Selected EES declaration request message to the CAS. The request includes the information of the selected EES and may include ACID to indicate which AC the EES is intended for.\n2.\tThe CAS checks whether the requesting EES is authorized to perform operation. If authorized, the CAS stores the received information.\n3.\tThe CAS responds the request with Selected EES notification declaration response message.\nThe CAS, after knowing the selected EES for the UE, may subscribe to receive ACT status notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.3 for EELManagedACR, or trigger service continuity procedures towards the selected EES.\n",

The EEC Context may include information about the EEC-hosting UE and the ACs to which the EEC provides services. The EEC Context information may be collected and maintained at the EES in an EDN while the respective ACs are connected to EASs in that EDN.\nEEC Context relocation procedures allow the EEC Context information to be shared between EESs (via EDGE-9 interactions).\nThe EEC Context information may contain List of EDGE-1 subscriptions (i.e., list of subscription IDs for an EEC). The corresponding EDGE-1 subscription information includes EEC ID, Event ID, subscription ID, 3GPP CN subscription information (optional), notification target address (optional) and filter information (optional).\nAn EEC Context shall be created for each registered EEC, after a successful registration, by the receiver EES, as follows:\n-\tIf the EEC registration request does not include a previously assigned EEC Context ID value, the receiver EES creates an EEC Context as described in clause 8.2.8. The receiver EES shall assign an EEC context ID and set the source EES Endpoint to its own Endpoint. The EEC ID and UE Identifier shall be set based on the corresponding registration request parameters.\n-\tIf the EEC registration request contains an EEC context ID and source EES Endpoint, the receiver (i.e., target) EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2). After a successful EEC Context relocation, the target EES updates the source EES Endpoint with its own Endpoint. The target EES may preserve the EEC Context ID received in the request or assign a new EEC Context ID, subject to EES implementation and local policies.\nIf the EEC Context relocation is not successful, the target EES creates an EEC Context as described in clause 8.2.8. The target EES shall assign an EEC context ID and set the source EES Endpoint to its own endpoint. The EEC ID and UE ID shall be set based on the corresponding registration request parameters.\nAfter a successful EEC Context Relocation procedure is performed at EEC (re-)registration to a target EES, the source EES shall determine to be stale the EEC Context identified by the EEC Context ID included in the request (i.e., relocated) and the EEC to be de-registered.\nAn EEC Context shall be updated when EEC Registration update requests targeting the corresponding EEC ID are received.\nAn EEC Context, including the list of Service Session Context(s) information, shall be determined to be stale after a successful EEC de-registration procedure.\nNOTE:\tStale EEC Context(s) are subject to information persistence policies and privacy policies. Mechanisms for re-use of stale EEC Context(s) are not in scope of the current version of specification.\nThe EEC Context provided to a target EES in an EEC Context Pull relocation or an EEC context Push relocation shall be stored at the target EES, as follows:\n-\tIf an EEC context with the same EEC ID, EEC Context ID and source Endpoint already exists at the target EES, the EEC Context is updated.\n-\tIf an EEC context with the same EEC ID, EEC Context ID and source Endpoint does not exist at the target EES, the EEC Context is stored.\nAfter a successful EEC Context Relocation procedure is performed at ACR, the source EES shall determine to be stale the element(s) of the list of Service Session Context(s) information included in the request (i.e., relocated). If all Service Session Context(s) information in the EEC Context are stale, the EEC Context is determined to be stale and the EEC to be de-registered.\nElements of the list of Service Session Context(s) information shall be created by the EES when it determines that a registered EAS is providing services to an AC on the served EEC.\nElements of the list of Service Session Context(s) information shall be determined to be stale when the EES determines that a registered EAS is no longer providing services to an AC on the served EEC.\nNOTE:\tIn this version of specification, mechanisms used by EES to determine that a registered EAS is no longer providing services to an AC on a served EEC are implementation-dependent.\nAn EEC Context shall be updated as follows:\n-\tWhen EEC Context(s) are created, either after a registration request or based on EEC Context relocation procedure, the EES shall check whether the UE Identifier corresponds to an existing EEC Context and update the EEC Context accordingly.\n-\tWhen EEC subscription requests corresponding to the EEC ID are processed, the \"List of EDGE-1 subscriptions\" shall be updated accordingly\n",

The figure shows the EES (Energy-Efficient Control) context, which is a crucial component in the context relocation process. The relocation is initiated by the source EES, ensuring that the context is moved to a new location that is more energy-efficient and reduces the energy consumption of the system. The figure provides a visual representation of the context relocation procedure, allowing for a better understanding of the process and its importance in the overall energy-efficient control of the system.\nFigure 8.9.2.3-2: EEC Context relocation procedure initiated by source EES\n1.\tThe source EES determines to forward EEC Context for relocation to a target EES.

The target EES uses the EEC Context ID provided to authorize the EEC Context to be stored and managed. Then the target EES sends an EEC Context response indicating success. The T-EES performs implicit registration and creates the registration ID for the registration and includes it in the EEC context push response message for S-EAS decided ACR or S-EES executed ACR scenarios. The S-EES stores the registration details, and when required, notifies the EEC about registration details while sending ACR information notification.\nIf the request in step 2 includes the list of selected ACR scenarios within the EEC context, and if the list cannot be supported by T-EES or T-EAS, new list of selected ACR scenarios needs to be selected based on the request from S-EES. The T-EES selects a list of selected ACR scenarios based on T-EES and T-EAS capabilities and \"EEC Service Continuity Support\" if the IE has been provided in the EEC context and includes it in the Push EEC context response.\nNOTE:\tIn this release, ACR scenario list transfer is not supported if EEC is not registered. The EEC can perform EEC Context establishment and ACR scenario selection with the target EES.\n",

The ECS configuration information configured in the AC is based on the service agreement.\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tIf the request is successfully validated, the EEC registers the information provided in the request and responds back to the AC with AC registration response. The AC registration response includes the list of EEC's services that AC is authorized for.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mechanisms used for authentication and authorization between AC and EEC is out of scope of this specification. EEC can use local policies, user preferences, ASP services agreement(s) (see Annex B) to authorize the request from the AC.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the ECS configuration information is provided from an AC, the EEC can use the ECS configuration for initial service provisioning for the AC that provided the ECS configuration information if there is no ECS configuration information is provided from the 5GC.\nFigure 8.14.2.2.3-1 illustrates AC registration update procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAC is registered with the EEC.\nThe figure depicts the AC registration update procedure, which is a crucial step in the network's operation. It illustrates the steps involved in updating the AC registration, including the use of a registration update tool, the identification of the AC registration, and the execution of the update process. This figure is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the network's AC registration, ensuring that the network operates efficiently and securely.\nFigure 8.14.2.2.3-1: AC registration update procedure\n1.\tThe AC sends an AC registration update request to the EEC.

The figure shows a series of steps, including the identification of the EAS, the request for the EAS, and the response from the EAS. The figure is important for understanding the EAS system's functionality and how it works in real-world scenarios.\nFigure 8.14.2.3-1: EAS discovery request procedure\n1.\tThe AC sends an EAS discovery request to the EEC. The request includes AC profile and AC's security credentials and may include EAS discovery filters.\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tIf the request is successfully validated, the EEC determines if the required EAS is available or not. The EEC may use information cached or preconfigured at the EEC or may use the EAS discovery procedures to query the EES. If step 1 includes the AC profile or EAS discovery filters, then the EEC may utilize the provided AC profile and filters, to form the EAS discovery request towards EES. If step 1 does not include any of the optional IEs of the AC profile and EAS discovery filters, and AC registration was performed, the EEC may utilize the AC profile provided by the AC during AC registration. The EEC also needs to take user privacy requirements, e.g., regarding the disclosure of location information towards the network into account. If required, e.g., when EAS discovery procedures returns a list of EASs, the EEC performs EAS selection based on the information received in step 1 and the AC profile. The EEC can perform EAS discovery with different EESs before selecting an EAS.\nEditor's note:\tSA3 recommendations, if any, on how the user or the AC can consent, e.g., to the disclosure of location information and the use of the AC ID in the signalling towards the network are FFS.\nNOTE 1:\tIf required, the EEC can perform service provisioning procedure, or EEC registration procedure or both, before performing the EAS discovery procedures. EEC may already have captured EESs and EASs availability for present location; so that the AC's request (step 1) can be replied to quickly and efficiently.\nNOTE 2:\tThe EEC can include AC profiles of more than one AC in the EAS discovery request sent to the EES.\n4.\tThe EEC responds back to the AC with the EAS discovery response.

The figure is a visual representation of the complex process, making it easier to understand and follow.\nFigure 8.14.2.4-1: ACR trigger request procedure\n1.\tThe AC sends an ACR trigger request to the EEC. The request includes AC profile, AC's security credentials, type of requested operation (i.e., ACR detection, ACR initiation) and S-EAS information as described in clause 8.14.3.10. If the request is to initiate the ACR, the request may also include the target EAS information.\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tIf the request is successfully validated, the EEC sends an ACR trigger response to the AC indicating if the request was successful as described in 8.14.3.11. The EEC process the request from the AC. If the type of requested operation in the request received in step 1 is:\n-\tACR detection, then the EEC determines if ACR is required or not. If it is required, the EEC uses one of the EEC initiated ACR scenarios or launches ACR with action \"determination\", leading to S-EES executed ACR;\n-\tACR initiation, then the EEC uses one of the EEC initiated ACR scenarios and initiate ACR. If the request in step 1 also includes target information, the EEC uses it to select the ACR targets;\nNOTE:\tEEC notifies the AC to trigger ACT as required, or EEC notifies ACR execution result as specified in clause 8.14.2.5.3.\nFollowing are supported for EEC services subscription:\n-\tSubscribe;\n-\tNotify;\n-\tSubscription update; and\n-\tUnsubscribe.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC can communicate with the EEC.\nThe figure depicts the EEC (Electronic Equipment Certificate) services subscription procedure, which is a crucial step in the process of obtaining an EEC service.

The request includes AC profile, AC's security credentials, a list of EEC's services that AC requires the EEC to handle, and related parameters as described in 8.14.3.12. If the subscription request includes:\n-\tEAS discovery or EAS dynamic information subscription, then the request may include a list of EAS characteristics and a list of EAS dynamic information filters respectively;\n-\tACR, then the request includes a list of S-EAS information and corresponding type of ACR operations:\n-\tACR notifications, where the EEC notifies the AC with respect to the \"ACR detection\" and \"ACR initiation\" requests as specified in clause 8.14.2.5.3;\n-\tACR monitoring, where the EEC monitors the need for ACR and notifies the AC as and when required e.g., on receiving ACR related notifications on EDGE-1 interface; and\n-\tEEC managed ACR, where the EEC monitors the need for ACR. If need for ACR is detected, then the EEC decides and initiates ACR using one of the EEC initiated ACR scenarios. The EEC notifies the AC about the imminent ACR and may include the target information.\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tIf the request is successfully validated, the EEC creates the subscription and sends an EEC services subscription response message to the AC. The response includes the list of services that the EEC will handle and related details.\n4.\tThe EEC executes the services e.g., EAS discovery, ACR, and notifies the AC with information as necessary. The EEC may use locally cached information or configurations while providing services to the AC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC has subscribed to the EEC.\nThe figure depicts a 5.3 -1 EEC services notification procedure, illustrating the steps involved in notifying end-users of EEC services. The figure includes a flowchart with various stages, such as receiving a notification, processing the notification, and providing the user with the necessary information. The figure also includes a legend to help users understand the different stages and their corresponding actions.\nFigure 8.14.2.5.3-1: EEC services notification procedure\n1.\tAn event occurs at the EEC that satisfies the trigger conditions for notifying a AC e.g., EEC detects a need for Application Context Relocation, unavailability of suitable T-EES and/or unavailability of suitable T-EAS.\nNOTE:\tUpon receiving a EEC services notification indicating no suitable T-EES/T-EAS was available, the AC may decide to move the application context to the CAS\n2.\tThe EEC sends an EEC services notification to the AC with relevant information related to the event triggered in step 1.\nFigure 8.14.2.5.4-1 illustrates EEC services subscription update procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC has subscribed to the EEC.\nThe figure depicts a step-by-step procedure for updating the EEC services subscription, including the necessary steps and required documentation.\nFigure 8.14.2.5.4-1: EEC services subscription update procedure\n1.\tThe AC sends an EEC services subscription update request to the EEC. The request includes the subscription ID, AC's security credentials, and may include updated notification related details or updated list of required EEC services.\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tIf the request is successfully validated, the EEC updates the subscription and sends a successful subscription update response.\n4.\tThe EEC executes the services e.g., EAS discovery, ACR, and notifies the AC with information as necessary. The EEC may use locally cached information or configurations while providing services to the AC.\nFigure 8.14.2.5.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC has subscribed to the EEC.\nThe figure depicts a user interface for EEC (End-User Computing) services, specifically the unsubscribe procedure. The figure includes a list of services, their respective IDs, and a button to unregister from the service. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with clear labels and a simple layout, making it easy for users to navigate and perform the unsubscription process.\nFigure 8.14.2.5.5-1: EEC services unsubscribe procedure\n1.\tThe AC sends EEC services unsubscribe request to the EEC. The request includes the subscription ID and AC's security credentials.\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tUpon successful authorization, the EEC sends a successful de-registration response.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC can communicate with the EEC.\nThe figure depicts the UE ID request procedure in a 6-1 network, illustrating the steps taken by the UE to request an ID. The figure shows the UE's interface, the network interface controller (NFC), and the network control center (NCC). The NFC sends an ID request to the NCC, which then forwards the request to the network control center (NCC). The NCC then processes the request and sends an ID back to the NFC. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the process, making it easy to understand the steps involved in requesting an ID in a 6-1 network.\nFigure 8.14.2.6-1: UE ID request procedure\n1.\tThe AC sends an UE ID request to the EEC. The request includes AC's security credentials and the EAS ID list for which the AC needs to know the associated Edge UE ID or AF-specific UE ID(s).\n2.\tThe EEC checks AC's security credentials and validates the request.\n3.\tIf the request is successfully validated, the EEC process the request from the AC. The EEC uses the UE Identifier API procedure (see clause 8.6.5) to query the EES.\nNOTE:\tThis procedure may be used to support the retrieval of the UE ID for AC’s (and EAS's) dealing with IPv4 NATed IP address issue (i.e. EAS's direct invocation of UE Identifier API procedure due to NATed IP address fails to identify the UE). Under such a scenario then it is understood that, the AC through application signalling which is outside the scope of this document, would pass on the UE ID (received in step 3) to the EAS so that it can be used to invoke capability APIs over EDGE-3 or EDGE-7.\nEditor's note:\tThe use of this procedure for other use cases such as preserving the privacy of the UE is FFS.\n",

The selection of ACR scenario(s) may be performed by the EEC or the EES for a given AC and the selected EAS from the common supported ACR scenarios of AC, EEC, selected EES and selected EAS. The selection of ACR scenario(s) for each EAS in EAS bundles may be performed separately by the EEC or the EES (or the main EES in case of bundle EAS served by multiple EESs, which is the EES registering the main EAS) for a given AC and the selected EAS(s) in a bundle, based on the service continuity support by AC, EEC, EES(s) and EAS(s). In addition, the EEC or EES can further determine the one or more ACR scenario(s) for the selected EAS based on the AC service KPI.\nNOTE:\tHow to select ACR scenario(s) at the EEC or EES considering AC service KPI is implementation specific.\nInstantiable EAS Information may be provided to the EEC in EAS discovery response and EAS discovery notification, as specified in clause 8.5.3.3 and 8.5.3.6.

When Application Group information is not provided, the EES determines that the EAS in the request is providing services to the AC with the indicated ACID e.g. for EEC Context handling purposes as described in clause 8.9. When Application Group information is included in the request, the EAS provided is considered Common EAS for the Application Group.\nNOTE 2:\tFurther clarification for EAS selection may be needed.\nIf the EEC or EES selected ACR scenario list for EAS bundle includes EAS executed ACR scenario (as described in 8.8.2.8), the EES also sends DNAIs and service area of the selected EAS(s) to the main EAS in the ACR selection notification.\nThe request may contain the associated EES(s) information along with the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) and the bundle EAS type indicating direct bundle, each associated EES(s) is along with part of or all the list of EASID, when EEC determines the associated EES(s) based on the EDN configuration information and bundle EAS information (e.g. list of EASID and direct bundle type).\nIf the request contains selected EAS ID and selected EAS Endpoint, the EES may apply the EAS traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the EAS in the 3GPP Core Network, based on application KPIs and if the EAS traffic influence was not done before (e.g. neither in EAS discovery procedure nor the EAS perform traffic influence).\nWhen the selection is that of a common EAS for application group, the request message may contain the list of EESs for a certain Application Group ID, received from the ECS in the service provisioning response message. This application group related information may be used for further common EAS announcement(s) between EES(s). In the case of no ECS-ER, if the request message does not contain the list of EESs for a certain Application Group ID, then the EES determines the other EESs to which announce common EAS request needs to be sent as described in clause 8.8.3.3. If there is ECS-ER, the EEC selected EAS is used in interaction between the EES and ECS-ER, as described in clause 8.20.2.3 to store the common EAS information., If the ECS-ER provides a different common EAS information in the response it is forwarded to the EEC in the EAS information provisioning response. If the ECS-ER-provided common EAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the common EAS is registered is also included in the EAS information provisioning response.\nIf the request contains the selected EASID and the selected EAS endpoint is not included, the EES verifies if instantiation of EAS is needed and may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS as in clause 8.12.\nWhen the request contains EEC Service Continuity Support IE and the EEC context has been established, the EES includes the IE into the EEC context described in Table 8.2.8-1.\nNOTE 2:\tEES can also influence the EAS traffic in advance.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is up to the AC to decide when to connect to the selected EAS (either immediately or wait for a while) once the AC knows the selected EAS.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS information provisioning response to the EEC indicating a successful status. If an EEC context has been established, the response also includes the list of selected ACR scenario(s) into the session context IE within EEC context as described in Table 8.2.8-2; otherwise, the EES shall indicate a failure status and include appropriate reasons. If the EES has triggered EAS instantiation based on the EAS information provisioning request and obtained the newly instantiated EAS information, the response contains information about the newly instantiated EAS, including the EAS endpoint information.\nThe EEC, EES and EAS (or the bundled EAS(s)) use the selected ACR scenario list to determine if they should perform ACR detection and/or ACR decision.\nUpon receiving the EAS information provisioning response, if the response includes instantiated EAS information, the EEC uses the endpoint information to subscribe to ACR event notification, as needed, and provides necessary notifications to the AC.\nNOTE 4:\tOther ACR selection criteria are out of scope of the current specification.\nNOTE 5:\tThe common supported ACR scenarios is decided as part of the EAS discovery and selection procedure.\nFor the \"EAS selection\" case, in the case of no ECS-ER, the selected common EAS shall be announced to other relevant EES(s) as per procedure in clause 8.19.\n",

If a subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the ECS-ER treats the ECS as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.17.2.3.3.5-1 illustrates the procedure.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe ECS has subscribed for ECS discovery.\nThe figure depicts the ECS (Ephemeris Control System) discovery and unsubscribe procedure, which is a crucial step in managing and controlling the ECS in a network. The figure shows the steps involved in discovering and unsubscribing from the ECS, including the process of identifying the ECS, configuring the ECS, and initiating the unsubscribe process. The figure also includes a visual representation of the ECS, including its components and their functions.\nFigure 8.17.2.3.3.5-1: ECS discovery unsubscribe procedure\n1.\tThe ECS sends a ECS discovery unsubscribe request to the ECS-ER. The request contains security information of the ECS and the subscription identifier.\n2.\tThe ECS-ER authorizes the received request. If authorized, the ECS-ER cancels the stored subscription.\n3.\tThe ECS-ER sends an ECS unsubscribe response indicating success or failure of the subscription update operation.\nWhen required to retrieve Service provisioning information from a partner ECS, the ECS queries the partner ECS by providing information such as required applications, location, service continuity support information and connectivity information. In response the partner ECS provides Service provisioning information of EDNs satisfying the requirements.\nThe following clauses specify procedures, information flows and APIs for service provisioning information retrieval.\nIn the following procedures, ECS sending the request can be an ECS-ER of an ECSP and Partner ECS receiving the request can be the ECS-ER of the partner ECSP.\nNOTE:\tPartner ECS can also be a V-ECS based on the roaming status of the UE for which the service provisioning information is being retrieved.\nFollowing procedures are supported for service provisioning:\n-\tRequest-response model; and\n-\tSubscribe-notify model.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.2-1 illustrates service provisioning procedure based on request/response model.\nPre-condition(s):\n1.\tECS has received a service provisioning request from an EEC or T-EES discovery request from an EES.\n2.\tThe ECS has the ECS profile of the partner ECS (e.g. through pre-configuration, OAM configuration or ECS discovery).\n3.\tRequired federation agreement exists between the ECSPs.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning information retrieval request/response process, illustrating the steps involved in retrieving service provisioning information. It includes a request form, a response form, and a flowchart to guide the process. The figure is used to demonstrate the process of retrieving service provisioning information, which is an essential step in the service provisioning process.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.2-1: Service provisioning information retrieval – Request/Response\n1.\tThe ECS sends a service provisioning information retrieval request to the partner ECS. The request contains security information of the ECS, and optionally AC profile(s) and UE's current location. If the UE hosting the EEC is roaming in a V-PLMN (determined using the serving PLMN information in the received service provisioning request, or by interacting with the H-PLMN), then the service provisioning information retrieval request includes the information of the serving PLMN i.e. the V-PLMN.\n2.\tThe partner ECS authorizes the received request. If authorized, the partner ECS processes the request and gathers the provisioning information of the EDNs that can satisfy the query parameters received in step 1.\n3.\tThe partner ECS sends a service provisioning information retrieval response to the ECS. The response includes provisioning information of the EDNs that can satisfy the query parameters received in step 1 and may include lifetime information. The ECS caches the received information for further use. If the Lifetime IE is included, then the ECS may reuse the retrieved information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, without the need to repeat step 1.\nNOTE:\tOnly the information allowed by the federation agreement is included in the service provisioning information response.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.2-1 illustrates service provisioning information subscription request between an ECS and its partner ECS.\nPre-condition(s):\n1.\tThe ECS has the ECS configuration information of the partner ECS (e.g. through pre-configuration, OAM configuration or ECS discovery).\n2.\tRequired federation agreement exists between the ECSPs.\n\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning information retrieval system, specifically focusing on the retrieval of subscribed services. It includes various components such as the subscriber, service provider, and the service provisioning system. The system is designed to efficiently retrieve and manage subscribed services, ensuring a smooth and reliable service experience for subscribers.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.2-1: Service provisioning information retrieval – Subscribe\n1.\tThe ECS sends a service provisioning information subscription request to the partner ECS. The request contains security information of the ECS, Notification Target Address (e.g. URL), federation information, Service Provisioning filters.\n2.\tThe partner ECS authorizes the received request. If authorized, the partner ECS creates a subscription and stores the subscription.\n3.\tThe partner ECS sends a service provisioning information subscription response to the ECS. The response includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the ECS shall send a service provisioning information subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a service provisioning information subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the partner ECS shall treat the ECS as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.3-1 illustrates the service provisioning information notification procedure between an ECS and its partner ECS.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tECS has subscribed for service provisioning information from the partner ECS as specified in clause 8.17.2.4.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning information notification system, with various components such as service provisioning information, notification, and service provisioning information. The system is designed to provide timely and accurate information to users, ensuring a smooth and efficient service provisioning process.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.3-1: Service provisioning information notification\n1.\tAn event occurs at the partner ECS that satisfies trigger conditions for notifying (e.g. to provide a change in information about available EASs) a subscribed ECS.\n2.\tThe Partner ECS sends a service provisioning information notification to the ECS. The notification includes updated provisioning information of the EDNs that can satisfy the query parameters received during subscription and may include lifetime information. The ECS caches the received information for further use. If the Lifetime IE is included, then the ECS may reuse the received information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE.\nNOTE:\tOnly the information allowed by the federation agreement is included in the service provisioning information notification.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.4-1 illustrates service provisioning information subscription update request between an ECS and its partner ECS.\nPre-condition(s):\n1.\tECS has subscribed for service provisioning information from the partner ECS as specified in clause 8.17.2.4.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning information retrieval system, showing the steps involved in updating a subscription. It includes a user interface for accessing the system, a database for storing the information, and a mechanism for retrieving the updated subscription details.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.4-1: Service provisioning information retrieval – Subscription update\n1.\tThe ECS sends a service provisioning information subscription update request to the partner ECS. The request contains security information of the ECS and subscription identifier, and may include updated Notification Target Address (e.g. URL), federation information, Service Provisioning filters, location information and PLMN information.\n2.\tThe partner ECS authorizes the received request. If authorized, the partner ECS updates the stored subscription.\n3.\tThe partner ECS sends a service provisioning information subscription update response to the ECS. The response may include updated expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the ECS shall send a service provisioning information subscription update request prior to the expiration time. If a service provisioning information subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the partner ECS shall treat the ECS as implicitly unsubscribed.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.5-1 illustrates service provisioning subscription update request between an ECS and its partner ECS.\nPre-condition(s):\n1.\tECS has subscribed for service provisioning information from the partner ECS as specified in clause 8.17.2.4.2.3.2.\nThe figure depicts a service provisioning information retrieval system, with various components such as service provisioning information, unsubscription, and service provisioning information retrieval.\nFigure 8.17.2.4.2.3.5-1: Service provisioning information retrieval – Unsubscribe\n1.\tThe ECS sends a service provisioning information unsubscribe request to the partner ECS. The request contains security information of the ECS and the subscription identifier.\n2.\tThe partner ECS authorizes the received request. If authorized, the partner ECS cancels the subscription.\n3.\tThe partner ECS sends a service provisioning information unsubscribe response to the ECS.\n",

The EES of the ECSP serving the UE is determined based on SLA(s) between the ECSPs such that it can be authorized by the EES of the partner ECSP. The endpoint of EES of partner ECSP is provided by the ECS in a way that is transparent to EEC.\nFollowing procedures are defined for EAS discovery with respect to ENS:\n-\tEAS discovery via leading ECSP;\n-\tEEC triggered EAS discovery via partner ECSP; and\n-\tEES triggered EAS discovery via partner ECSP.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tECSP-1 and ECSP-2 have a service level agreement to share edge services.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of an EAS (Electronic Attack System) discovery process for an Enhanced Network Security (ENS) system. The figure shows the various components involved in the EAS discovery process, including the ENS, the ENS controller, and the ENS security system. The figure illustrates the steps involved in identifying and identifying potential threats to the ENS, such as unauthorized access attempts, malicious traffic, and unauthorized network access. The figure also shows the communication between the ENS controller and the ENS security system, as well as the communication between the ENS controller and the ENS security system. The figure is a visual representation of the EAS discovery process, providing a clear and concise overview of the process.\nFigure 8.18.2.3.2-1: EAS discovery for ENS\n1.\tThe EEC sends EAS discovery request to EES (ECSP-B) as specified in clause 8.5 and may include the endpoint of EES (ECSP-A) in the request, if provided by the ECS as specified in clause 8.18.2.2.1.\n2.\tIf the EAS discovery request contains EES information of a partner ECSP (ECSP-A) or \tthe required EAS is not available with the EES the EES may determine to use ENS. If the EAS discovery request contains EES information of a partner ECSP, the EES can use it after validating the information.\nNOTE 1:\tTo validate the information of partner ECSPs, EES (ECSP-B) can use the federation agreement between ECSPs.\n3.\tIf the EAS discovery request does not contain EES information of a partner ECSP, the EES may use the EES retrieval procedures as specified in clause 8.8.3.3 to obtain EES information of a partner ECSP. The Retrieve EES request may include an ENS indication so that the ECS (ECSP-B) can skip checking T-EES(s) locally registered in the ECS (ECSP-B).\n4.\tOnce EES information of the partner ECSP is available, the EES (ECSP-B) sends the EAS discovery request to the EES (ECSP-A) as described in step 3 of clause 8.8.3.2. The EAS discovery request includes the information of the MNO serving the UE (e.g. MNO name, PLMN ID).\nThe EES (ECSP-A) validates the request and returns EAS discovery response including the discovered candidate EAS(s) to the EES (ECSP-B). In addition to step 4 of clause 8.8.3.2, the candidate EAS(s) are discovered based on the serving MNO information received from the EES (ECSP-B) and allowed MNO information registered by the EAS.\nNOTE 2:\tTo validate the EAS discovery request, EES (ECSP-A) can use the federation agreement between ECSPs.\n5.\tEES (ECSP-B) provides the discovered information to the EEC as part of the EAS discovery response as specified in clause 8.5.\nIf the EEC has the EES information of the partner ECSP and the required security credentials to communicate with the partner ECSP, the EEC can use the EAS discovery procedures specified in clause 8.5 to directly obtain the EAS information from the EES of the partner ECSP. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES of the partner ECSP identifies the EAS(s) considering the allowed MNO information of the registered EASs and UE’s serving MNO information.\nWhen service continuity is required, the EES can trigger the T-EAS discovery procedures as defined in clause 8.8.3.2 with the EES of the partner ECSP to find an EAS with respect to ENS. The EAS discovery request includes UE'’s serving MNO information (e.g. MNO name, PLMN ID). Upon receiving the request from the S-EES, the T-EES of the partner ECSP identifies the EAS(s) considering the allowed MNO information of the registered EASs and UE's serving MNO information.\n",
