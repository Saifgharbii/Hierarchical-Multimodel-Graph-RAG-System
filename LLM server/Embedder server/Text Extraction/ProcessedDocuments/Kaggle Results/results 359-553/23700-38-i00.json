The initial MC service configuration is a pre-condition for authentication and authorization for MC services in a partner MC system.\nInitial MC service UE configuration data can be exchanged between the MC systems using ACMX entities as described in the following procedure. This solution allows to keep a partner MC system up to date with regard to the required initial MC service UE configuration date needed for migration.\nTable 7.9.1.2.1-1 describes the information flow from the primary ACMC to the primary ACMS, and from the primary ACMS to the partner ACMS, for updating initial MC service UE configuration data information that is required by the partner MC system for preparing migrating MC service UEs.\nTable 7.9.1.2.1-1: Update MC service UE initial configuration\n\nTable 7.9.1.2.2-1 describes the information flow from the partner ACMC to the partner ACMS and from partner ACMS to primary ACMS.\nTable 7.9.1.2.2-1: Update MC service UE initial configuration response\n\nThe procedure for an authorized MC service user in a primary MC system to update the partner MC system with the initial MC service UE configuration data information is shown in figure 7.9.1.3-1.\nPre-conditions\n-\tThe primary and partner MC system(s) are configured to accept connections from relevant ACMCs via the respective ACMSs in each of the connected MC service system(s) and have been configured and authorized successfully to allow exchange of administrative configuration information\n-\tThe relevant ACMC(s) and ACMS connection authorizations have been established successfully\n-\tThe set of MC service IDs and the MC service UE initial configuration of the migrating MC service users have been already sent by the primary MC system to the partner MC system, as specified in solution #5.\n-\tWhen a functional alias is used as the target of the request by an ACM client in the primary MC system, it is required that the primary ACM server has subscribed to the MC service functional alias controlling server within the primary MC system, and that the partner ACM server has subscribed to the MC service functional alias controlling server within the partner MC system.\n\nThe figure depicts an initial configuration of a mobile communication service (MC) UE, with a focus on the network update process.
