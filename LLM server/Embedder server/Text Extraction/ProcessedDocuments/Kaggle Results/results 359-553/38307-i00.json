Unless stated otherwise, the release independent for the band combinations are from Rel-15. Configurations with BCSs other than BCS5 are release independent from Rel-15, where the BCSs for configurations are defined in TS 38.101-1 [2] and/or TS 38.101-3 [4]. Configurations with BCS5 are release independent from Rel-17, and BCS5 with signalling is allowed for early implementation from Rel-15. Note that BCS4/BCS5 is not applicable to intra-band EN-DC configurations.\nWhen a new feature is introduced only the latest release of release independent spec needs to be updated. The latest release of release independent spec refers to the release which the new feature is introduced in. If an RF feature introduced in the same release as the release which the feature is independent from, (i.e. M=N), the common UE RF requirements table in annex B.4 is specified from release N+1, otherwise the common UE RF requirements table is specified from release N.\n\n",
