The access to the N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [12]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [13]) plays the role of the authorization server.\nThe N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [11]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name of the service (i.e., \"n5g-eir-eic\"), and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.\nSecurity Protection Edge Proxy (SEPP), as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [11], shall be used between service based interfaces across PLMNs. The NFs in a PLMN shall use the SEPP as a HTTP/2 proxy for the HTTP/2 messages that carry \":authority\" pseudo header with a uri-host formatted as specified in clause 6.1.4.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]\nAs specified in clause 13.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [11], TLS shall be used for the security protection of messages at the transport layer for the N5g-eir service based interface if network security is not provided by other means.\nThe protocol stack for the N5g-eir service based interface is shown on Figure 6.1.7.2-1.\n\nThe figure depicts the SBI (Service-Based Interworking) protocol stack, which is a key component of the 5G network. It illustrates the various layers and components involved in the SBI protocol, including the SBC (Service-Based Communication), SBC-B (Service-Based Communication Backbone), and SBC-C (Service-Based Communication Core). The figure also includes a diagram of the network topology, showing the interconnection between the SBCs and the SBC-C. The SBI protocol stack is designed to enable seamless communication between different network services, such as voice, video, and data, and is an essential part of the 5G network architecture.\nFigure 6.1.7.2-1: SBI Protocol Stack\nThe N5g-eir service based interface uses HTTP/2 protocol (see clause 5.2) with JSON (see clause 5.4) as the application layer serialization protocol. For the security protection at the transport layer, 5G-EIR NF shall support TLS and TLS shall be used within a PLMN if network security is not provided by other means, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [11].\nAs specified in clause 13.4.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [11] OAuth 2.0 (see IETF RFC 6749 [12]) may be used for authorization of N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck service access. The 5G-EIR NF and the NRF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.510 [13]) shall support the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework with \"Client Credentials\" grant type as specified in clause 4.4 of IETF RFC 6749 [12]. The NRF shall act as the Authorization Server providing the access tokens to the NF service consumers to access the service provided by the 5G-EIR. If the 5G-EIR NF receives an OAuth 2.0 authorization token in the \"Authorization\" HTTP request header field, the N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck service shall validate the access token, its expiry and its access scope before allowing access to the requested resource, as specified in clause 7 of IETF RFC 6749 [12].\n",
