The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to enhance signal quality and reduce interference.\nFigure 6.3B.4.3.4.2-1 Test uplink transmission for HD-FDD\nFor single tone NPUSCH transmission scenario:\n1.  SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via NPDCCH DCI format N0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3B.4.3.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.\n2.  Schedule the UE's NPUSCH data transmission for period containing SI message transmission according to Annex A.2.4 and make the UE transmit NPUSCH with 32 or 48 slots (16 or 24 ms) gap for HD-FDD or 46 slots (23ms) gap for TDD. Uplink scheduling grant is transmitted via NPDCCH 9 subframes before NPUSCH transmission.\n3.  Measure the power of 5 consecutive NPUSCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted NPUSCH power is maintained within 112 ms for HD-FDD. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.\n4.  Repeat step 2 and 3 for configuration ID 2 in Table 6.3B.4.3.4.1-1.\nFor 12 tones NPUSCH transmission scenario:\n0.

Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product power are measured through rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table 6.6B.3-1.\nTable 6.6B.3-1: UE category NB1 and NB2 transmitter IM requirement\n\nThe normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.102 [11] clause 6.6B.\n6.6B.4\tTest description\n6.6B.4.1\tInitial conditions\nInitial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the correct measurement state.\nThe initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions and test frequencies based on the subset of E-UTRA operating bands defined for NB-IoT in clause 5.2B. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters shown in table 6.6B4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2.4. Configurations of NPDSCH and NPDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.\nTable 6.6B.4.1-1: Test Configuration Table for FDD\n\n1.\tConnect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [12] Annex A, Figure A.2 using only main Tx/Rx antenna.\n2.\tThe parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [12] subclause 8.1.4.3.\n3.\tDownlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to Annex H.1.1 and H.4.0.\n4.\tThe UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6B.4.1-1.\n5.\tPropagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.\n6.\tUE location according to TS 36.508 [12] clause 8.2.6.1 is provided to the UE through any preconfigured means.\n7.\tTest equipment shall emulate the signal with doppler and delay according to ephemeris defined in TS 36.508 [12] table 8.2.6.2.1-1 for GSO if UE supports only GSO or both GSO and NGSO satellites and table 8.2.6.2.1-3 for NGSO (LEO-1200) if UE supports only NGSO satellites. Test system shall send same SIB31-NB information during the duration of the test as define in TS 36.508[12] clause 8.2.6.3.1\n8.\tDeactivate UE prediction of satellite trajectory by any preconfigured means\n9.\tEnsure the UE is in State 2A-NB with CP CIoT Optimisation according to TS 36.508 [12] clause 8.1.5.

Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. (UE should be already transmitting PUMAX after Initial Conditions setting).\n2.\tMeasure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Table 6.2B.2.4-1. The measurement period is at least one sub-frame (1ms) for 15 KHz channel spacing.\n3.\tSet the interference signal frequency below the UL carrier frequency using the first offset in table 6.6B.5-1.\n4.\tSet the interference CW signal level according to table 6.6B.5-1.\n5.\tMeasure the rectangular filtered mean power of transmitting intermodulation product signals below and above the UL carrier frequency and calculate the ratios with the power measured in step 2. The centre frequency of the measurement filter shall be (Interference signal frequency - Interference Signal Frequency Offset + 7.5kHz) and (UL carrier frequency - 15 kHz + Interference Signal Frequency Offset), respectively.\n6.\tSet the interference signal frequency above the UL carrier frequency using the first offset in table 6.6B.5-1.\n7.\tMeasure the rectangular filtered mean power of transmitting intermodulation product signals below and above the UL carrier frequency and calculate the ratios with the power measured in step 2. The centre frequency of the measurement filter shall be (UL carrier frequency - 15 kHz - Interference Signal Frequency Offset) and (Interference signal frequency + Interference Signal Frequency Offset + 7.5kHz) respectively.\nRepeat the measurement using the second offset in table 6.6B.5-1.\n6.6B.4.3\tMessage contents\nMessage contents are according to TS 36.508 [12] subclause 8.1.6.\n6.6B.5\tTest requirement\nThe ratio derived in step 5 and 7, shall not exceed the described value in table 6.6B.5-1\nTable 6.6B.5-1: Transmit Intermodulation\n\n",

Whether the measurement channel is used for testing a certain UE category or not is specified in the individual test cases.\nRate matching process in Figure A-1 is dependent on the parameter “Total number of Soft Channel bits” which has been defined for each UE category in TS 36.306 [15] clause 4.1.

Overall period of UL scheduling pattern corresponds with Si-periodicity and it consists of two different patterns with dependencies on SI transmission.\n-\tOne pattern applies for period containing SI messages transmission. This pattern has a period with same duration as SI windows length (time period where SI messages are transmitted).\n-\tAnother pattern for period where there is no transmission of SI messages. This pattern is repeated during SI periodicity.\nThe figure depicts a scheduling algorithm for 2.4-1, which is a type of network protocol used in 2.4 GHz frequency bands. The algorithm is based on the SI (Synchronized Interval Transmission) transmission method, which ensures that the data transmission is synchronized and reliable. The figure illustrates the scheduling process, including the selection of the best transmission time slot for each data packet, and the use of a priority queue to manage the scheduling decisions. The figure also shows the different types of scheduling algorithms, such as the fixed-time slot (FTS) and the fixed-time slot with priority (FTSP), and the use of a priority queue to manage the scheduling decisions. The figure provides a clear and concise representation of the scheduling algorithm, making it easy to understand and interpret.\nFigure A.2.4-1: NPDCCH scheduling based on SI transmission\n\nNOTE 1: For 3.75kHz, 1 tone, and π/2 BPSK modulation. NPDCCH transmission is scheduled at the 18th subframe (starting from the 0th subframe) every 80ms and its corresponding NPUSCH format 1 is scheduled 9 subframes after NPDCCH transmission. NPUSCH format 1 transmission has a duration of 64 consecutive ms. This pattern applies for both periods containing and not containing SI messages transmission.\nNOTE 2: For 3.75kHz, 1 tone, and π/4 QPSK modulation. NPDCCH transmissions are scheduled at the 18th, 66th and 114th subframe (starting from the 0th subframe) every 160ms for periods containing SI messages transmission and at the 2nd, 51th, 98th, 146th and 194th subframe (starting from the 0th subframe) every 240ms for periods where there is no transmission of SI messages.

The allocated RBs are necessary but not under test. The non allocated RBs are under test. The RB allocation for this test is as follows: The allocated RBs are at one end of the channel BW, leaving the other end unallocated. The number of allocated RBs is smaller than half of the number of RBs, available in the channel BW. This means that the vicinity of the carrier in the centre is unallocated.\nThere are 3 types of inband emissions:\n1.\tGeneral\n2.\tIQ image\n3.\tCarrier leakage\nCarrier leakage are inband emissions next to the carrier.\nIQ image are inband emissions symmetrically (with respect to the carrier) on the other side of the allocated RBs.\nGeneral are applied to all unallocated RBs.\nFor each evaluated RB, the minimum requirement is calculated as the higher of PRB - 30 dB and the power sum of all limit values (General, IQ Image or Carrier leakage) that apply.\nIn specific the following combinations:\n-\tPower (General)\n-\tPower (General + Carrier leakage)\n-\tPower (General + IQ Image)\n1 and 2 is expressed in terms of power in one non allocated RB under test, normalized to the average power of an allocated RB (unit dB).\n3 is expressed in terms of power in one non allocated RB, normalized to the power of all allocated RBs.

Decimation requires a decision, which samples are used and which ones are rejected. The algorithm in E.6.6, Timing of the FFT window, can also be used to decide about the used samples.\n",

For some tests, for example receiver tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure that a Test System not compliant with clause F.1does not increase the chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause F.1 had been used.\n",

The allowance of ± 0.2 dB around the above mentioned level is predefined by RAN5 to find the minimum test time. The allowance of ±0.2 dB maps through the function “final throughput versus level” into a throughput corridor. The minimum test time is achieved when the preliminary throughput escapes the corridor the last time.

After ns results the number of bad results (ne) is counted and the error ratio (ER) is calculated by ne/ns.\nApplying statistical theory, a decision limit can be designed, against which the calculated ER is compared to derive the decision. Such a limit is one decision point and is characterised by:\n-\tD: the wrong decision probability (a predefined parameter)\n-\tns: the number of results (a fixed predefined parameter)\n-\tne: the number of bad results (the limit based on just ns)\nIn the formula for the limit, D and ns can be understood as variable parameter and variable. However the standard test execution requires fixed ns and D. The property of such a test is: It discriminate between two states only, depending on the test design:\n-\tpass (with CL) / undecided           (undecided in the sense: finally undecided)\n-\tfail (with CL) / undecided            (undecided in the sense: finally undecided)\n-\tpass(with CL)  / fail (with CL)     (however against two limits).\nIn contrast to the standard statistical tests, the early decision concept predefines a set of (ne,ns) co-ordinates, representing the limit-curve for decision. After each result a preliminary ER is calculated and compared against the limit-curve. After each result one may make the decision or not (undecided for later decision). The parameters and variables in the limit-curve for the early decision concept have a similar but not equal meaning:\n-\tD: the wrong decision probability (a predefined parameter)\n-\tns: the number of results (a variable parameter)\n-\tne: the number of bad results (the limit. It varies together with ns)\nTo avoid a “final undecided” in the standard test, a second limit must be introduced and the single decision co-ordinate (ne,ns) needs a high ne, leading to a fixed (high) test time. In the early decision concept, having the same selectivity and the same confidence level an “undecided” need not to be avoided, as it can be decided later. A perfect DUT will hit the decision coordinate (ne,ns) with ne=0. This test time is short.\n",
