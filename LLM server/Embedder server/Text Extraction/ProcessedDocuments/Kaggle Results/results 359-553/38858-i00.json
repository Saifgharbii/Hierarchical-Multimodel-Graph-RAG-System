            "description": "TDD is widely used in commercial NR deployments. In TDD, the time domain resource is split between downlink and uplink. Allocation of a limited time duration for the uplink in TDD would result in reduced coverage, increased latency and reduced capacity. As a possible enhancement on this limitation of the conventional TDD operation, it would be worth studying the feasibility of allowing the simultaneous existence of downlink and uplink, a.k.a. full duplex, or more specifically, subband non-overlapping full duplex at the gNB side within a conventional TDD band.\nThe NR TDD specifications allow the dynamic/flexible allocation of downlink and uplink in time and CLI handling and RIM for NR were introduced in Rel-16. Nevertheless, further study may be required for CLI handling between the gNBs of the same or different operators to enable the dynamic/flexible TDD in commercial networks. The inter-gNB CLI may be due to either adjacent-channel CLI or co-channel-CLI, or both, depending on the deployment scenario. One of the problems not addressed in the previous releases is gNB-to-gNB CLI.\nThis study aims to identify the feasibility and solutions of duplex evolution in the areas outlined above to provide enhanced UL coverage, reduced latency, improved system capacity, and improved configuration flexibility for NR TDD operations in unpaired spectrum. In addition, the regulatory aspects need to be examined for deploying identified duplex enhancements in TDD unpaired spectrum considering potential constraints.\n",

                            "text_content": "For discussion purpose, for SBFD operation within a TDD carrier, a SBFD subband consists of 1 RB or a set of consecutive RBs for the same transmission direction. For discussion purpose, SBFD symbol is defined as symbol with subbands that gNB would use for SBFD operation.\nSBFD operation within a TDD carrier is studied and SBFD scheme within a single configured DL and UL BWP pair with aligned center frequencies is the baseline.\nThe maximum number of UL subbands for SBFD operation in an SBFD symbol (excluding legacy UL symbol) within a TDD carrier is one for the study in RAN1.The UL subband can be located at one side of the carrier or can be located at the middle part of the carrier\nWhether SBFD operation in SSB symbols is supported or not is studied in RAN1. RAN1 studied whether UL subband can be configured in SSB symbol and agreed that an UL subband can be configured in an SSB symbol, where SSB is from serving cell perspective which can be CD-SSB or NCD-SSB. If SBFD-aware UEs are not allowed to transmit in the SSB symbol but is allowed to receive within the DL BWP in the SSB symbol, negative impact on SSB detection and measurement can be avoided but UL performance may be degraded due to fewer UL opportunities. If SBFD-aware UE is allowed to transmit in the SSB symbol, the UE may only transmit UL in an UL subband depending on gNB scheduling, configuration, UE measurement or priority rule. There may be negative impact on SSB detection and measurement if the SBFD-aware UE is requested to transmit in the SSB symbol.\nWhether or not a slot can consist of both SBFD and non-SBFD symbols is studied in RAN1 including benefits, use cases, scheduling flexibility, implementation complexity and compatibility with legacy TDD DL/UL configuration. One motivation for allowing that a slot can consist of both SBFD and non-SBFD symbols is for compatibility with symbol-level TDD UL/DL configuration. Frequent transition between SBFD and non-SBFD symbols may increase the implementation complexity and interruptions of transmissions/receptions during transition. At least for semi-static SBFD, in order to avoid frequent transition between SBFD and non-SBFD symbols, potential limitation on the maximum number of transition points between SBFD and non-SBFD symbols can be considered from SBFD subband configuration perspective. Maximum of two transition points including one transition point from non-SBFD symbols to SBFD symbols and one transition point from SBFD symbols to non-SBFD symbols within a TDD UL/DL pattern period can be considered as a starting point where the transition point can be aligned with slot boundary or within a slot. A guard period between SBFD and non-SBFD symbols may or may not be required at gNB and/or UE side depending on gNB/UE implementation and/or SBFD operation.\nThe time and frequency location of subbands within a TDD carrier are not fixed in the specification. Regarding whether to inform the UE of the time and/or frequency location of subbands that gNB would use for SBFD operation, the following options are studied with Option 4 prioritized at least for RRC_CONNECTED state.\n-\tSBFD operation Option 1:\n-\tTime and frequency locations of subbands for SBFD operation are not known to UEs.\n-\tUE behaviors follow existing specifications without introducing new UE behaviors for SBFD operation at gNB side.\n-\tSBFD operation Option 2:\n-\tTime and frequency locations of subbands for SBFD operation are not known to UEs.\n-\tUE behaviors for non-SBFD aware UEs follow existing specifications.\n-\tFrom RAN1 perspective, new UE behaviors can be introduced for SBFD aware UEs\n-\tSBFD operation Option 3:\n-\tOnly time location of subbands for SBFD operation is known to SBFD aware UEs.\n-\tUE behaviors for non-SBFD aware UEs follow existing specifications.\n-\tFrom RAN1 perspective, new UE behaviors can be introduced for SBFD aware UEs based on the time location of subbands for SBFD operation\n-\tSBFD operation Option 4:\n-\tBoth time and frequency locations of subbands for SBFD operation are known to SBFD aware UEs.\n-\tUE behaviors for non-SBFD aware UEs follow existing specifications.\n-\tFrom RAN1 perspective, new UE behaviors can be introduced for SBFD aware UEs based on the time and frequency locations of subbands for SBFD operation.\nAmong the four options, SBFD operation Option 4 is agreed as the baseline for SBFD operation at least for RRC_CONNECTED state.\nRandom access in SBFD symbols is studied in RAN1. If random access is allowed in SBFD symbols for SBFD-aware UEs, it may potentially reduce the random access latency, reduce the PRACH collision probability and/or improve the coverage of PRACH and Msg3. These aspects were not fully evaluated in RAN1. PRACH and Msg3 transmissions in UL subband in SBFD symbols may cause UE-to-UE CLI. The system performance impact is not evaluated in RAN1. Specification impact is expected to allow random access in SBFD symbols at least for PRACH and Msg3 transmissions in symbols configured as DL in TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon.\nFor indication of subband locations for SBFD operation, semi-static configuration of subband time and frequency location is studied as baseline.\nFor semi-static configuration of subband time locations for SBFD operation, it is agreed that explicit configuration of SBFD subband time locations within a period is the baseline.\nFor semi-static configuration of subband frequency locations for SBFD operation, at least explicit indication of frequency location of UL subband is required. At least for semi-static SBFD, the following two options are viable solutions for frequency location configuration of DL subband(s) and guardband(s) if any.\n-\tOption 1: Frequency locations of DL subband(s) are explicitly configured. Guardband(s) if any are implicitly derived as the RBs which are not within UL subband or DL subband(s).\n-\tOption 2: The number of RBs for guardband(s), if any, is explicitly configured. DL subband(s) are implicitly derived as RBs which are not within UL subband or guardband(s).\nFor semi-static SBFD, a SBFD aware UE does not transmit UL channels/signals or receive DL channels/signals on the guardband(s) that the UE is aware of.\nFurthermore, for the purpose of RAN1 study, the understanding is that for semi-static configuration of subband frequency locations for SBFD operation, frequency location of UL/DL subband is with reference to CRB grid. For semi-static configuration of subband location, same subband frequency resources across different SBFD symbols are considered as baseline.\nFor a SBFD aware UE semi-statically configured with UL subband in a SBFD symbol configured as DL in TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon, the following is agreed as baseline in the RAN1 study:\n-\tUL transmissions within UL subband are allowed in the symbol\n-\tUL transmissions outside UL subband are not allowed in the symbol\n-\tFrequency locations of DL subband(s) are known to the SBFD aware UE\n-\tThe frequency location of DL subband(s) can be explicitly indicated or implicitly derived\n-\tDL receptions within DL subband(s) are allowed in the symbol\n-\tNote: UL transmissions are within active UL BWP and DL receptions are within active DL BWP in the symbol\nIn addition, whether DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) are allowed or not in a symbol configured as DL in TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon for SBFD aware UEs are studied based on the following options:\n-\tOption 1 (semi-static SBFD): DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) are not allowed\n-\tOption 2: (dynamic SBFD): DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) are allowed\nFor SBFD operation in a symbol configured as flexible in TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon, the following alternatives are studied for SBFD aware UEs,\nAlt 1:\n-\tUL transmissions within UL subband are allowed in the symbol\n-\tUL transmissions outside UL subband are not allowed in the symbol\n-\tFrequency locations of DL subband(s) are known to the SBFD aware UE\n-\tDL receptions within DL subband(s) are allowed in the symbol\n-\tFFS: Whether DL receptions outside DL subband(s) are allowed or not in the symbol\nAlt 2:\n-\tUL transmissions within UL subband are allowed in the symbol\n-\tThe RBs outside the UL subband can be used as either UL, or DL excluding guardband(s) if used, in the symbol from gNB’s perspective, and the transmission direction for all those RBs is the same\n-\tFFS: SBFD aware UE behaviours\n-\tFFS: Whether or not signalling of guardband(s) is needed\n-\tFFS: Whether or not the symbol can be converted to a DL-only symbol\n-\tFrequency locations of DL subband(s) are known to the SBFD aware UE\n-\tDL receptions within DL subband(s) are allowed in the symbol\nNote:\tUL transmissions are within active UL BWP and DL receptions are within active DL BWP in the symbol for both options. For all RBs outside the UL subband, UE cannot use separate RBs for DL and UL simultaneously.\nIn addition, whether DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) and UL transmissions outside semi-statically configured UL subband are allowed or not in a symbol configured as flexible in TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon for SBFD aware UEs are studied based on the following options:\n-\tOption 1 (semi-static): DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) are not allowed and UL transmissions outside semi-statically configured UL subband are not allowed\n-\tOption 2 (dynamic SBFD): DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) are allowed\n-\tUL transmissions outside the semi-statically configured UL subbands are not allowed\n-\tOption 3 (dynamic SBFD): DL receptions outside semi-statically configured DL subband(s) are allowed\n-\tUL transmissions outside the semi-statically configured UL subbands are allowed\n6.1.1.4 Dynamic SBFD\nFor dynamic SBFD, the following observations are agreed.\n-\tCompared to semi-static SBFD, dynamic SBFD can better adapt to the UL/DL resource requirements based on UL/DL traffic loads.\n-\tDynamic SBFD may increase gNB implementation complexity due to dynamic antenna/panels switching and filters/RF tuning, may incur loss of resources due to transition time, may increase inter-gNB CLI, may increase scheduling complexity, and can result in additional specification impact on top of semi-static SBFD\n-\tUE implementation complexity may be increased if the UE supports dynamic SBFD and dynamic SBFD may result in increased UE-to-UE CLI\nIf dynamic SBFD is supported, the following options can be considered.\n-\tOption 1: Dynamic SBFD is achieved by scheduling DCI which is used to schedule DL receptions outside semi-statically configured SBFD DL subband and/or UL transmission outside semi-statically configured SBFD UL subband.\n-\tOption 2: Dynamic SBFD is achieved by non-scheduling DCI which indicates whether a symbol is SBFD symbol or not.\n-\tOption 3: Dynamic SBFD is achieved by MAC-CE which indicates whether a symbol is SBFD symbol or not.\nNote 1:\tWhether or not dynamic SBFD is beneficial from a performance and complexity perspective is a separate discussion.\nNote 2:\tThe possibility of introducing flexible subband type for Option 1 to achieve DL receptions outside semi-statically configured SBFD DL subband and/or UL transmission outside semi-statically configured SBFD UL subband is not precluded.\nNote 3:\tNone of the above options imply that there is a dynamic change in the DL/UL subband sizes.\n",

It is agreed that for SBFD-aware UEs, the part of the DL RBG inside the DL subband can be used and the part of the UL RBG inside the UL subband can be used for better resource utilization. It is agreed that the part of the RBG outside the DL subband cannot be used for DL reception and the part of the RBG outside the UL subband cannot be used for UL transmission at least for semi-static SBFD.\nFor semi-static SBFD, for a CSI reporting subband which overlaps with SBFD subband boundaries, it is agreed that CSI report is derived based on CSI-RS resources excluding CSI-RS resources outside DL subband(s) for SBFD-aware UE.\nFor semi-static SBFD, for a CSI-RS resource which overlaps with SBFD subband boundaries, it is agreed that only CSI-RS resources within DL subband(s) are valid for SBFD-aware UE.\nFor SBFD-aware UEs, at least the following issues for PDSCH are studied:\n-\tPRG(s) with size of 2 and 4 that overlaps with subband boundary\n-\tWideband precoder in case of non-contiguous DL subbands\nFor a PRG that overlaps with subband boundary, if the part of DL PRG inside the DL subband can be used, better scheduling flexibility and resource utilization can be achieved, however degraded channel estimation quality in the partial PRG is expected compared to a PRG due to limited RBs in the partial PRG. It is noted that UE complexity could increase if this feature is supported.\nIf PRG is determined as wideband, the following two options are studied.\n-\tOption 1: non-contiguous frequency resources across two DL subbands but contiguous frequency resource within each DL subband can be allocated\n-\tOption 2: non-contiguous frequency resources across two DL subbands cannot be allocated\nIt is agreed that Option 1 can achieve better scheduling flexibility and higher DL data rate. Compared with Option 2, Option 1 requires UE to handle two non-contiguous segments of contiguous RBs that may increase UE complexity for channel estimation.\nFrequency resource allocation for CSI-RS across downlink subbands for SBFD-aware UEs are studied considering the following options:\n-\tOption 1: Two contiguous CSI-RS resources that are linked\n-\tOption 2: One CSI-RS resource\n-\tOption 2-1: Non-contiguous CSI-RS resource allocation\n-\tOption 2-2: One contiguous CSI-RS resource allocation with non-contiguous CSI-RS resource derived by excluding frequency resources outside DL subband (s)\nFor all the options, there is no impact on CSI-RS sequence generation. Option 1 requires additional signalling to link two CSI-RS resources in two DL subbands. Option 2-1 requires new RRC structure to configure non-contiguous RBs for one CSI-RS resource, which may require additional signalling overhead. Option 2-2 can reuse the existing signalling design for CSI-RS resource configuration. Option 2-2 can be used to resolve the potential unaligned boundaries between CSI-RS resource configuration and SBFD subbands. Further discussion is required on the UE complexity due to UE capability of maximum number of configured CSI-RS resources and/or processing non-contiguous CSI-RS.\nFor UL transmissions and DL receptions across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols in different slots (each transmission/reception within a slot has either all SBFD or all non-SBFD symbols), the following options are studied for SBFD-aware UEs:\n-\tOption 1: The transmissions/receptions are restricted to SBFD symbols only or non-SBFD symbols only\n-\tOption 2: The transmissions/receptions can be in SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols\nUL transmissions and DL receptions across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols include the following:\n-\tPDSCH/PUSCH/PUCCH repetitions\n-\tSPS PDSCH/CG PUSCH\n-\tTBoMS\n-\tMulti-PUSCH/PDSCH scheduled by a single DCI\n-\tPeriodic/semi-persistent SRS/CSI-RS/PUCCH\n-\tPDCCH\nOption 1 can be achieved by gNB configuration or scheduling to ensure that all transmission/reception occasions are confined to either SBFD symbols or non-SBFD symbols. Alternatively, Option 1 can be achieved by additional indication or rules to determine the transmission/reception occasions are valid within one symbol type and are invalid within the other symbol type. The frequency resources, power control and beam/spatial relation for all the transmission/reception occasions can be the same for Option 1 but may be different for Option 2. If different, it may require additional specification efforts. Option 1 may or may not increase the transmission/reception latency if the transmission/reception in the other symbol type is postponed and may degrade the performance if the transmission/reception in the other symbol type is dropped. Option 2 may or may not reduce the transmission/reception latency and improve coverage.\nFor UL transmissions and DL receptions across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols in different slots (each transmission/reception within a slot has either all SBFD or all non-SBFD symbols), if the transmissions/receptions can be in SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols with different available resources, at least the following frequency resource allocation options for PDSCH, CSI-RS, PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS for SBFD-aware UE are studied.\n-\tOption 1: Separate FDRA determination for SBFD slots and non-SBFD slots.\n-\tOption 1-1: Separate FDRA configurations/indications for SBFD slots and non-SBFD slots\n-\tOption 1-2: Separate frequency resources determined for SBFD slots and non-SBFD slots based on single FDRA configuration/indication\n-\tOption 1-3: single FDRA configuration/indication and RB offset(s)\n-\tOption 2: Perform rate matching or puncturing on the RBs outside DL/UL subbands for DL/UL channels/signals.\n-\tOption 3: A DL/UL channel/signal overlapping with RBs outside DL/UL subbands in a SBFD slot is dropped or postponed.\nNote: Different options can be studied for different signals/channels.\nRAN1 studied whether the transmission/reception occasion of a physical channel/signal can be mapped to SBFD and non-SBFD symbols within a slot for a UE, and whether a UE can transmit/receive in the occasion mapped to SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols including:\n-\tUse-case(s) including the locations and number of transition points of the SBFD and non-SBFD symbols in the slot.\n-\tPotential benefits if any\n-\tPhase continuity\n-\tPotential interruption of transmissions/receptions during transition\n-\tRequired guard time if any\n-\tPotential impact on performance\n-\tImpact on link adaptation, channel estimation, and other procedures\n-\tUL transmission timing if any\n-\tImplementation complexity\n-\tApplicability for SBFD aware UE and non-SBFD aware UEs\n-\tNOTE: There are more than one scenario where a transmission overlaps SBFD and non-SBFD symbols and some may or may not face the aspects listed above\n-\tNOTE: This study doesn’t mean RAN1 agreement on a slot consisting of SBFD and non-SBFD symbols.\nFor a physical channel/signal occasion mapped to SBFD and non-SBFD symbols within a slot if any, the following options for UE transmission/reception can be considered in the normative stage.\n-\tOption 1: UE does not transmit or receive the physical channel/signal within the slot.\n-\tOption 2: UE can transmit or receive the physical channel/signal within the slot only under certain conditions.\n-\tThe conditions may depend on at least the following: whether or not phase continuity can be maintained across SBFD and non-SBFD symbols, whether or not there are same or different transmission/reception parameters e.g. power control, spatial/QCL, UL timing etc. applied in SBFD and non-SBFD symbols, and whether or not there is a guard period between the SBFD and non-SBFD symbols, etc.\n-\tOther options are not precluded.\nFor SBFD-aware UEs, the following options are studied for CSI report associated with periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS, in case the periodicity is such that CSI-RS instances occur in both SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols in different slots (each CSI-RS resource within a slot has either all SBFD or all non-SBFD symbols):\n-\tOption 1: two CSI-ReportConfigs, where one is associated with SBFD symbols and the other is associated with non-SBFD symbols\n-\tOption 1-1: One CSI-ReportConfig is associated with a CSI-RS restricted to SBFD symbols only and the second CSI-ReportConfig is associated with a second CSI-RS restricted to non-SBFD symbols only;\n-\tOption 1-2: Both CSI-ReportConfigs are associated with the same CSI-RS. The CSI report associated with one CSI-ReportConfig is derived based on CSI-RS instances in SBFD symbols only. The CSI report associated with the second CSI-ReportConfig is derived based on CSI-RS instances in non-SBFD symbols only.\n-\tOption 2: one CSI-ReportConfig associated with both SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols\n-\tOption 2-1: One CSI-ReportConfig is associated with two CSI-RSs which are restricted to SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols respectively. Separate CSI measurements are derived based on the first and second CSI-RSs respectively.\n-\tOption 2-2: One CSI-ReportConfig is associated with one CSI-RS. The CSI report is derived based on CSI-RS which can be in SBFD symbols or non-SBFD symbols in different time instances.\nNote that whether the CSI-RS resource can be used for SBFD and non-SBFD symbols may depend on, e.g., gNB implementation of same/different antenna configuration in both symbols.\nOption 1-1 can be supported according to existing specification by gNB configuration of appropriate periodicities to ensure that the CSI-RS associated with each CSI-ReportConfig is confined to either SBFD symbols or non-SBFD symbols only. But it may restrict the gNB configuration flexibility and enhancements can be considered by additional indication or rules to determine the CSI-RS is valid within one symbol type and is invalid in the other symbol type.\nOption 2-2 can be supported according to existing specification to configure measurement restriction so that UE would not average CSI measurements across SBFD and non-SBFD symbols.\nFor SRS, PUCCH and PUSCH on SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols in different slots, it may be beneficial to have separate resources, FH parameters, UL power control parameters and/or beam/spatial relation.\ngNB can configure a CORESET and a search space in a way such that the MOs of the search space occur in either SBFD or non-SBFD symbols, or the MOs of the search space occur in both SBFD and non-SBFD symbols but the associated CORESET does not overlap the boundary of a DL subband in SBFD symbols.\nIf it is agreed to be beneficial that a CORESET and a search space are configured that the MOs of the search space occur in both SBFD and non-SBFD symbols and the associated CORESET overlaps the boundary of a DL subband in SBFD symbols, at least the following options can be considered for SBFD-aware UE:\n-\tOption 1: Separate valid resources for the CORESET in SBFD symbols and in non-SBFD symbols.\n-\tOption 2: Rate matching or puncturing on the REG(s) of a PDCCH outside DL subband(s).\n-\tOption 3: UE does not monitor a PDCCH candidate if it is mapped to one or more REs that overlap with REs outside DL subband(s).\n-\tOption 4: Drop search space(s) when the associated CORESET overlaps with RBs outside DL subband(s)\n-\tOption 5: Separate search spaces associated with a CORESET in SBFD and non-SBFD symbols\nNote: These options are applicable to at least USS.\n6.1.3\tBS self-interference due to time misalignment\nTime misalignment at gNB between UL receptions and DL transmissions due to configuration of non-zero NTA,offset at UE can lead to increased interference assuming no gNB transmit chain impairments and no filtering of DL subband(s) in the gNB Rx chain.\nSimulation results from one source [41] show that the increase of self-interference on the UL subband due to misaligned timing between UL reception and DL transmission at the gNB can be quite small (~1dB) when impairments in the gNB transmit chains and filtering of DL subbands in the gNB Rx chains are considered. Filtering that suppresses self-interference from DL subbands in the gNB Rx chains could incur some switching time/delay to bypass the filter in UL symbols and could introduce some insertion loss.\n",

Note that Alt #1 and Alt #2 are supported in existing specifications.\n-\tAlt #1: separate CLI-RSSI measurement resources/reports in each DL subband\n-\tAlt #2: CLI-RSSI measure/report in one DL subband only\n-\tAlt #3: CLI-RSSI measurement/report based on non-contiguous CLI-RSSI resource across downlink subbands\nAlt #1 allows flexible configuration of measurement reporting in one DL subband or two DL subbands but it consumes multiple CLI-RSSI measurement resources from the UE capability budget. Alt #2 restricts gNB configuration flexibility and does not account for whether or not the CLI is asymmetric across two DL subbands. This method does not consume multiple CLI-RSSI measurement resources from UE capability point of view. Alt #3 requires additional specification efforts to support non-contiguous CLI-RSSI resource allocation across downlink subbands. This method is similar to non-contiguous CSI-RS resource allocation. A single CLI-RSSI report based on non-contiguous CLI-RSSI resource may be sufficient. This method does not consume multiple CLI-RSSI measurement resources from UE capability point of view. Note that it does not imply whether L1 or L2 based measurement is supported.\nMethod #2 and Method #3 can be used for identifying the aggressor UE(s) if orthogonal resources are allocated for different aggressor UE(s). Method #2 and #3 can at least provide higher interference signal strength than inter-subband interference leakage based measurements in Method #1. Furthermore, such measurement is not subject to inter-cell DL interference. It is feasible for UE to measure RSRP/RSSI within UL subband if within active DL BWP and receive DL in DL subband(s) simultaneously similar as simultaneous RSRP/RSSI measurement and DL reception in Rel-16. The existing CLI measurement and report framework can be reused to support RSRP/RSSI measurements within UL subband when UL subband is confined within active DL BWP.\n",

It is up to companies to use SLS as a tool to evaluate coverage performance of SBFD, and it is also up to companies to perform link level evaluation for other purposes.\nFor link level evaluation of coverage performance, RAN1 focuses on Urban Macro scenario for FR1 and Dense Urban Macro Layer scenario for FR2-1. Regarding the target uplink channel for coverage evaluation, RAN1 focuses on PUSCH with 1Mbps target data rate for FR1 and 5Mbps target data rate for FR2-1.\nFor link level evaluation of coverage performance, single slot PUSCH transmission is assumed for baseline legacy TDD, and the following schemes of coverage enhancement can be assumed for SBFD:\n-\tScheme-1: SBFD with PUSCH repetition type A\n-\tScheme-2: SBFD with TBoMS PUSCH\n-\tScheme-3: SBFD with PUSCH repetition type A and joint channel estimation\n-\tScheme-4: SBFD with TBoMS PUSCH and joint channel estimation\n-\tFor Scheme-3 and Scheme-4, two options are considered:\n-\tOption 1 (baseline): joint channel estimation is applied only for the same symbol type\n-\tOption 2: joint channel estimation is applied across SBFD and non-SBFD slots\nFor link level evaluation of coverage performance, MPL, MCL and MIL defined in TR38.830 are used as the performance metrics. Similar evaluation methodology as defined in TR38.830 (i.e., LLS + Link budget analysis) can be used, and the performance metrics are obtained using link budget analysis and TDD/SBFD required SINR for target data rate.\nFor link level simulation of coverage performance, RAN1 should consider self-interference, co-site inter-sector interference, inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel inter-subband CLI and UE-gNB interference in SBFD system and consider UE-gNB interference in TDD system. The following modelling methods can be considered.\nOption-1:\n-\tThe modelling method is as below:\n-\tFor TDD UL slot, additive white Gaussian noise with variance of  is generated, where\n-\t is UE-gNB interference and  is noise (in linear scale).\n-\tFor SBFD slot, additive white Gaussian noise with variance of  is generated, where\n-\t, , ,  are self-interference, co-site inter-sector interference, inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel inter-subband CLI and UE-gNB interference (in linear scale), respectively\n-\tCompanies are encouraged to report the details of deriving  and . Some examples are as below:\n-\tExample-1:  and  are derived based on a certain assumption of the topology of gNBs and UEs. In this example, the interference is pre-receiver interference.\n-\tNote: link budget analysis can be applied in this example\n-\tExample-2:  is derived based on statistic in SLS, and then  is used in LLS to increase the Gaussian noise power in SBFD symbol compared to TDD UL symbol. In this example, the interference is post-receiver interference.\n-\tExample-3:  and  can be derived based on statistic in SLS. In this example, the interference is post-receiver interference.\n-\tCompanies are encouraged to report the RU assumption for the interference.\n-\tNote: For simplicity, the interference is independently updated/generated in each slot.\n-\tNote: Companies are encouraged to report whether and how channel estimation and interference estimation will be impacted by  and .\n-\tBased on the modelling method, the following high-level evaluation method can be used as an example for coverage performance evaluation:\n-\tStep 1: For legacy TDD system, assume the SNR in UL only slot is , perform LLS to get the required SNR () with which UE can achieve a certain bit rate in UL\n-\tStep 2: For SBFD system with frame structure XXXXU, assume the SNR in UL only slot is  and the SNR in SBFD slot is . Perform LLS to get the required SNR () with which UE can achieve a certain bit rate in UL for a given SBFD coverage enhancement scheme (e.g., SBFD with PUSCH repetition type A, etc.)\n-\tStep 3: Use Link budget template to obtain MPL, MCL and MIL for legacy TDD and SBFD.\n-\tFor legacy TDD, the required SNR () obtained in Step 1 is used to calculate MPL, MCL, MIL.\n-\tFor SBFD, the required SNR () obtained in Step 2 is used to calculate MPL, MCL, MIL.\nOption-2:\n-\tThe UE-gNB interference and inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel inter-subband CLI in LLS coverage evaluation are explicitly modelled based on a given topology of aggressor UEs and gNBs. The UE-gNB and gNB-gNB fast fading channels are explicitly modelled in LLS. The signal model is as follows\n-\n-\t is the received signal vector at the victim gNB\n-\t is the channel matrix from target UE to gNB,  is the transmitted signal of the target user\n-\t, , are the channel matrix and transmitted signal of the UE in the same cell as the target user\n-\t and  are the channel matrix and transmitted signal of the UEs in the adjacent cell\n-\t,  and  are the channel matrix, the precoding matrix, and leakage CLI signal from aggressor gNB  to the victim gNB.\n-\tThe power of the signal and interference is included in the channel matrix respectively\n-\t and  are the self-interference vector of the co-site sectors and the thermal noise signal vector on the receiving antennas\n-\tCompanies are encouraged to report the topology of gNBs and UEs to derive the detailed signals and interferences above. One example is as below\n\n\n-\tBased on the above modelling, the following high-level evaluation method can be used as an example for coverage performance evaluation:\n-\tStep 1: For legacy TDD system, perform LLS to get the required SNR () with which UE can achieve a certain bit rate in UL\n-\tStep 2: For SBFD system with frame structure XXXXU, perform LLS to get the required SNR () with which UE can achieve a certain bit rate in UL for a given SBFD coverage enhancement scheme (e.g., SBFD with PUSCH repetition type A, etc.)\n-\tStep 3: Use Link budget template to obtain MPL, MCL and MIL for legacy TDD and SBFD.\n-\tFor legacy TDD, the required SNR () obtained in Step 1 is used to calculate MPL, MCL, MIL.\n-\tFor SBFD, the required SNR () obtained in Step 2 is used to calculate MPL, MCL, MIL.\nFor the two options above, self-interference can be modelled as additive white gaussian noise with fixed INR = - 6 dB targeting 1 dB desense similar to SLS, and co-site inter-sector interference can be modelled as additive white gaussian noise with fixed INR = - X dB based on assumption of co-site isolation .\nThe link level simulation assumptions for coverage evaluation are provided in Annex D.1. The link budget template for coverage evaluation is provided in Annex D.2.\n",

For UPT, the gain is calculated as: Gain (%) = dynamic SBFD UPT / baseline UPT – 1. For Latency, the increase is calculated as: Increase (%) = dynamic SBFD latency / baseline latency – 1.\nEvaluation results of dynamic SBFD for Dense Urban Macro layer (FR1) from one source can be found in Annex B.3.1.3.\nFor dynamic SBFD Option 2 (“dSBFD Opt 2” in Annex B.3.1), an ‘X’ symbol can be used as either an SBFD symbol or a full DL symbol. For dynamic SBFD Option 3 (“dSBFD Opt 3” in Annex B.3.1), an ‘X’ symbol can be used as an SBFD symbol, a full DL symbol or a full UL symbol.\nFor dynamic SBFD, [40] and [33] determine whether an ‘X’ symbol is used as an SBFD symbol or a non-SBFD symbol (full DL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 2 or full DL/UL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 3) based on the required resources for DL/UL traffic per 5 slots. [41] determines whether an ‘X’ symbol is used as an SBFD symbol or a non-SBFD symbol (full DL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 2 or full DL/UL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 3) based on the DL/UL traffic availability per slot. [24] determines whether an ‘X’ symbol is used as an SBFD symbol or a non-SBFD symbol (full DL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 2 or full DL/UL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 3) based on the required resources for DL/UL traffic per slot. [21] determines whether an ‘X’ symbol is used as an SBFD symbol or a non-SBFD symbol (full DL symbol for dynamic SBFD Option 2) based on the required resources for DL/UL traffic and condition for BS-to-BS/UE-to-UE CLI handling per slot.\nFor dynamic TDD, [40] and [33] determine whether an ‘F’ symbol is used as a DL symbol or an UL symbol based on the required resources for DL/UL traffic per 5 slots. [41] determines whether an ‘F’ symbol is used as a DL symbol or an UL symbol based on the DL/UL traffic availability per slot.\nFor dynamic TDD, [40] does not assume gNB-gNB co-channel inter-PRB CLI modelling. [33] and [41] assume gNB-gNB co-channel inter-PRB CLI modelling. The power of gNB-gNB co-channel inter-PRB CLI experienced by the victim gNB on each receiver chain at one UL RB is calculated in the similar way as for SBFD, refer to Annex A.2.3.\n[21] assumes inter-cell coordinated scheduling for BS-to-BS/UE-to-UE CLI handling where switching from an SBFD symbol to non-SBFD symbol is done only when the expected BS-to-BS/UE-to-UE CLI values are lower than certain thresholds for both Indoor office (FR1) and Urban Macro (FR1). [33] assumes no CLI handling for Indoor office (FR1), and assumes no CLI handling and CLI handling for Urban Macro (FR1) and Dense Urban Macro layer (FR1), where only intra-cell coordinated scheduling for UE-UE CLI that is only one transmission direction (either DL or UL) is scheduled within the same cluster and different clusters can have same or different transmission directions for the evaluations with CLI handling.

resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 4 symbols and DL OH: 1 symbol has lower mean UL Average-UPT and similar 5% UL Average-UPT for all load levels.\nIn case of SBFD Alt 1, based on results from 1 source,\n-\tNon-Transparent UL resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 1 symbol and DL OH: 1 symbol has lower mean DL Average-UPT and higher or similar 5% DL Average-UPT for all load levels.\n-\tTransparent UL resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 3 symbols and DL OH: 1 symbol has lower mean DL Average-UPT for all load levels and similar 5% DL Average-UPT for low load level, higher 5% DL Average-UPT for medium load level, and lower 5% DL Average-UPT for high load level.\n-\tTransparent UL resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 4 symbols and DL OH: 1 symbol has lower mean DL Average-UPT for and higher 5% DL Average-UPT for all traffic load level.\n-\tNon-Transparent UL resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 1 symbol and DL OH: 1 symbol has higher or similar mean UL Average-UPT and similar 5% UL Average-UPT for all load levels.\n-\tTransparent UL resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 3 symbols and DL OH: 1 symbol has lower mean UL Average-UPT and similar 5% UL Average-UPT for all load levels.\n-\tTransparent UL resource muting based IRC assuming UL OH: 4 symbols and DL OH: 1 symbol has lower mean UL Average-UPT and similar 5% UL Average-UPT for all load levels.\nComparing Non-Transparent UL resource muting based IRC (scheme 1) to Transparent UL resource muting based IRC (scheme 2 and scheme 3), based on the results from source 1, Non-Transparent UL resource muting based IRC has higher mean UL Average-UPT for all load levels due to the larger overhead of muted UL resources assumed for the transparent scheme, i.e. 3 or 4 symbols per slot for the transparent scheme and 1 symbol per slot for the non-transparent scheme.\nBoth Transparent and Non-transparent schemes have lower mean DL Average-UPT for all load levels compared to semi-static SBFD without inter-gNB CLI handling due to the overhead from DL symbol muting, i.e. mute 1 symbol per slot.\nAs described in section 8.3.1A.4, the potential specification impact of the proposed scheme is to define non-transparent UL muting resource patterns including its time and frequency location (e.g. symbol-level and/or RB-level and/or RE-level) with potential impact on PUSCH resource mapping.\n",

In the study, potential impact on UL performance is included.\nIn the study of gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI measurement and/or channel measurement, it is assumed that periodic NZP CSI-RS/SSB is the baseline. Also, for the study, it is assumed that both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB can be used for gNB-to-gNB CLI measurement. From the study of gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI measurement and/or channel measurement, followings are observed:\n-\tgNBs, which measure gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI using CD-SSBs from neighbor cells, might require muting/skipping some of the CD-SSBs if the time/frequency resource of CD-SSBs for the gNBs is overlapping.\n-\tThis approach might at least incur impact on initial access / cell search / RRM measurement performance\n-\tIn order to address the above issue, NCD-SSBs provided to neighbor gNBs can be used for CLI measurement at victim gNBs.\n-\tSSB resources may be useful for coarse tracking of CLI levels\n-\tNZP CSI-RS resource configurations provided to neighbor gNBs can be used for the purpose of estimating inter-gNB CLI levels.\n-\tNZP CSI-RS resource configurations provided to neighbor gNBs also can be used for the purpose of estimating inter-gNB channel which helps Tx / Rx gNBs perform beamforming to reduce inter-gNB CLI.\n\nFrom the study of UL resource muting for gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI measurement, channel measurement, the followings are observed:\n-\tThe UL resource muting can be used to measure the gNB-to-gNB CLI levels with less interference from UL.\n-\tThe UL resource muting can be used to measure the gNB-to-gNB channel with less interference from UL.\n-\tThe UL resource muting can be used to measure the gNB-to-gNB CLI interference covariance matrix with less interference from UL.\nNote:\tAbove can be done using current specification which supports transparent UL resource muting with gNB scheduling. UL resource muting could incur UL performance loss.\nFor performance evaluation of UL Resource Muting-based scheme for measuring the gNB-to-gNB CLI interference covariance matrix, three sources ([19], [24], [35]) provide the evaluation results. The evaluation results are summarized in section 8.3.1A and the tables for the evaluation result are shown in Annex B.4.\nFor gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI measurement, RAN1 discussed potential exchange of information among gNBs on Reference Signal/Channel (e.g., NZP CSI-RS, NCD-SSB) configuration.\nSpecification impact of UL Resource Muting-based scheme for measuring the gNB-to-gNB CLI interference covariance matrix is summarized in section 8.3.1A.4.\n",

                    "text_content": "In an SBFD-capable BS, the receiver in the uplink sub-band potentially experiences interference from multiple sources. In the study these sources include:\n-\tThe base stations own transmitter transmitting in the downlink sub-bands;\n-\tOther sectors transmitting in the downlink sub-bands;\n-\tOther base stations of the same operator transmitting in the downlink sub-bands;\n-\tOther operators base stations transmitting on other carriers within the same band.\nThroughout the study, it is assumed that all other sectors and other base stations belonging to the same operator do not transmit in the uplink sub-band during SBFD slots, that is, that SBFD is deployed in all sectors and sites and the SBFD configuration is the same in all sectors and sites. The case where SBFD is not deployed at all sites or SBFD configurations could differ has not been examined as part of the study.\nSelf-interference has been assessed using a framework named as “Residual Self Interference Calculation”, RSIC in a table. It is important to take into account that although the table is a useful and convenient means to break down the analysis of self-interference mitigation steps for the purposes of proposing an overall self-interference mitigation solution, the table should be interpreted with care. The individual components in the table are not independent of one another and are not independent of the total TX power level and RX parameters. Although the table expresses the interference suppression as a dB value, the dB interference suppression would change for other TX power or RX parameters. Thus, the values in the table should not be seen as a generic approach to scaling interference, but rather as a breakdown of how the SBFD may operate under a certain set of assumptions that is used to visualize how the analysis of feasibility has been worked out.\nFurthermore, the overall impact of analogue components is considered rather than the behavior of each individual transmitter/receiver. Due to production variations between radios and deviations in the exact level of isolation between TX and RX some transceivers may perform better and others worse in reality. The RSIC table should be seen as an overall example of the distribution of interference mitigation performances, but not an exact calculation based on individual transmitter/receivers.\nAn obvious baseline for assessing the radio performance is a transmitter / receiver performance that just meets RAN4 minimum requirements. However, it is to be expected that to a reasonable extent the performance could be extended beyond the minimum needed for meeting for 3GPP requirements and thus examples are provided considering both the baseline and some improvement. The associated complexity of improvement should be considered.\nIt is important to note that the antenna isolation can vary depending on the beam direction although this variation with beam direction may reduce after beam nulling is applied. In some companies’ input, worst case is considered. Meanwhile some figures presented in the tables from other companies are “typical”. For “good” beam directions, the residual interference may be reduced. However, there may be other beam steering directions for which the power may greater than used in these estimates. Individual RSIC descriptions capture the extent of expected variation with beam direction.\nThe impact of and ability to suppress inter-sector interference is captured in a similar manner to the self-interference cancellation with a table termed the co-channel co-site inter-sector interference table. The same considerations apply to the table for inter-sector interference as for the self-interference table.\nThe impact of interference between different gNBs on the same SBFD carrier at other sites is not considered as part of the RAN4 study on feasibility, because the relevant analysis highly depends on the practical network deployment. However, RAN4 have advised RAN1 on how to consider inter-subband leakage and the receiver blocking model and RAN1 then consider the impact of such interference as a performance issue, on which the relevant conclusion has been captured.\nThe impact of interference from other operators may be considered by RAN1 in the performance assessment and is considered by RAN4 as part of the co-existence study.\nThe downlink sub-band transmissions can impact the performance in the uplink sub-bands by two basic mechanisms:\n-\tUnwanted emissions from the downlink sub-bands occur at frequencies corresponding to the uplink sub-band and cause interference. The impacts of such effects are described qualitatively below and assessed quantitatively in subsequent sections.\n-\tA high downlink power from the downlink sub-bands passing through the uplink receiver can induce interference in the uplink sub-band due to non-linearities in the RF. The impacts of such effects are described qualitatively below and assessed quantitatively in subsequent sections.\nWhen considering the RSIC for self-interference and inter-sector interference, the following aspects and self-interference mitigation techniques have been considered:\nAntenna isolation\nFor self-interference suppression, isolation between the transmitter and receiver antennas can be used to reduce both the transmitter leakage power transferred to the uplink sub-band and the power level of the TX sub-band signals that must be handled by the receiver. The antenna isolation may be impacted by the beamforming applied at both the transmitter and receiver.\nPhysical distance between the transmitter and receiver sub-arrays produces isolation. The isolation can be significantly increased by means of isolation structures, isolating materials and/or RF chokes.\nThe antenna isolation needs to be achieved over at least a bandwidth covering all of the carriers that the basestation transmits. Since BS hardware is generally built with the ability to configure or re-configure carriers within the 3GPP band(s) or sub-band(s) covered by the BS, and only applies analogue filtering to suppress the transmitter outside of the band(s) then the isolation may need to be achieved between a TX carrier or sub-band anywhere within the 3GPP (sub-)band(s) transmitted by the BS and the UL sub-band.\nInter-sector interference occurs due to propagation of side/grating lobes and backlobes between sectors. The positioning of sectors is likely to be limited by site constraints. Potentially inter-sector isolation may be increased by increasing physical distance between sectors or by means of adding isolation materials (which may depend on factors such as weight, wind-load, weather resistance etc.).\nTX beam nulling\nSBFD assumes an AAS array at the BS with a large antenna array. The degrees of freedom available from the array can be used for steering transmitter nulls towards the receive sub-panel, such that the transmitter leakage to the receiver is reduced. A possible cost of applying TX beam nulling is that the EIRP towards downlink users is reduced, and that downlink MIMO performance may be impacted. The RSIC analysis provides details of additional isolation achieved and the downlink impact of the TX beam nulling.\nSuppression of transmitter leakage (frequency isolation)\nThe unwanted emissions from the transmitter that fall into the receiver sub-band arise from the spectral widening of the OFDM signal and from intermodulation products in the transmitter RF. Spectrum widening of the OFDM signal can be managed by means of digital filtering. Non-linearity in the transmitter RF chain is typically mitigated by techniques including Crest Factor Reduction (CFR) and Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD). Using these techniques, the interference in the UL sub-band due to transmitter leakage can be suppressed. The amount of suppression is captured in the RSIC tables.\nAnalogue interference cancellation\nAnalogue interference cancellation refers to techniques that involve capture of the transmitted signal in the downlink (including both the DL sub-bands and potentially also the leakage signal to the UL sub-band at the transmitter) and feedback to and removal from the received signal. This can involve both cancellation of the leakage signal in the UL sub-band and removal of the signal in the downlink sub-band in order to reduce the total power entering the analogue receive chain.\nThe analogue cancellation theoretically requires feedback from every transmitter to every receiver, although techniques have been proposed that reduce the number of TX-RX paths that need to be implemented. The feedback needs to take into account the coupling between the TX and RX (S parameters), any filtering or other processing that take place in between the TX capture and RX cancellation points and any impact of scattering or reflections from the environment around the base station.\nDigital interference cancellation\nDigital interference cancellation refers to the use of digital processing to remove interference in the uplink sub-bands. Digital processing can refer to several different techniques. One technique is to capture and sample the leakage from the transmitter in order to subtract the leakage signal in the digital domain at the receiver. In this case, the impact of coupling within the array, receiver RF and scattering / reflection needs to be modelled in the cancellation signal. The complexity of such cancellation depends on the number of transmitters and number of receivers. Digital cancellation of this type can attenuate transmitter interference but cannot reduce the magnitude of the TX signal entering the receiver RF analogue front end.\nAnother type of digital processing is the use of the receiver equalization and combining to mitigate interference due to the transmitter, potentially including the leakage signal and non-linearities created within the receiver. A channel estimate is needed for the wanted received signal. For the interference components, it may be possible to estimate the characteristics of the coupling and distortions between transmitter and receiver. Alternatively, co-variance estimations of the interference can be used in the receiver equalization processing. The receiver algorithm should aim to maximize SINR at the receiver.\nReceive beamforming\nThe receiver beamforming can be used to steer nulls towards sources of interference, such as the transmitter or other sectors. The process of receiver beamforming is implicitly captured in the receiver MMSE combining as described above. The receiver combining will aim to maximize RX SINR by means of optimizing the beamforming gain towards the wanted signal and rejection towards interferers.\nReceiver linearity performance\nThe receiver analogue chain contains RF imperfections. For a large input signal, the receive chain may be driven towards compression and create intermodulation products. The self-interference signal from the transmitter (and other nearby sectors) is a high-power signal that enters the receiver and can cause such effects.\nSeveral approaches may be considered to mitigate the impact of receiver non-linearity, each of which will have trade-offs. One possibility is to use components, in particular LNAs with an increased linearity. This will mitigate receiver non-linearity behaviors at a cost of some increase in energy consumption and potentially size. A second possibility is to use automatic gain control to reduce the receiver gain and hence the magnitude of the received signals. Reduction of gain will increase the receiver noise figure, and so careful consideration is needed on the balance between mitigating RX interference and increasing the noise figure (which decreases coverage).\nA further possibility is the use of filtering before or within the RF front end. Filtering prior to the LNA or in the first stages of the receiver chain that filters out the downlink power from the transmitter can reduce interference. There may be drawbacks from filtering such as filter insertion loss, which can increase noise figure. The need to be specifically tuned to the RF frequency of the UL sub-band and impacts to size and integration. More analysis of filtering solutions is provided in the feasibility sub-sections. Filtering further down the chain, such as between LNA stages has less impact on noise figure but requires early stages of the RX chain to have high linearity.\nThe RSIC tables present estimates of linearity performance considering the advantages and disadvantages of mitigation approaches.\nPhase noise\nPhase noise in the receiver can lead to interference. Reciprocal mixing of receiver phase noise on a high-power signal in the DL sub-band can cause interference into an UL sub-band. In general, phase noise is not a significant contributor to cause interference into an UL sub-band unless phase noise is high and the DL signal is received at very high power\nOther considerations\nAnother factor that can impact the self- and inter-sector interference suppression can be the dynamic range of the ADC in the receiver. The dynamic range of the ADC needs to be sufficient to accommodate both the TX signal in the DL sub-band and the lower power RX signal in the UL sub-band. It is generally straightforward to reduce the signal power in the TX sub-band by means of filtering at an intermediate frequency immediately prior to the ADC and so ADC dynamic range is not seen as a problem. (A more advanced solution could be needed for direct conversion receiver architectures).\n9.2\tFeasibility of FR1 wide area BS aspects\n",

Accordingly, based upon the inputs from companies, the ranges for values of (1)-(4) are summarized in reply LS [46]; however, the detailed ranges are the supersets of results provided from source companies which require further feasibility analysis. Therefore, RAN4 further carried out the study based on a more detailed self-interference analysis framework [47], which is used to capture inputs from companies.\n\nTable 9.2.1.1-1: FR1 WA BS Self-interference Analysis Summary\n\n\nWhen SBFD is implemented at the gNB, the received UL signal at the gNB is subject to co-channel self-interference from the gNB side transmitter. Methods to cancel the self-interference include passive methods which rely on the antenna isolation between Tx and Rx antennas, active methods which utilize RF or digital signal processing, hybrid methods using a combination of these, and filtering.\nAchieving a sufficient level of residual self-interference suppression and cancellation is the most critical part when implementing SBFD at the gNB. Without adequate SIC capability, the interference from the transmitted DL signal would corrupt the received UL signal as illustrated in Figure 9.2.1.2.1-1 (a). To solve this problem, various SIC schemes can be used. Using the example of Figure 9.2.1.2.1-1 (b), SIC capability can be provided through the antenna or panel design (A), can be applied in RF domain to the RF signal (B) or in digital signal domain (C), or a combination of these.\nThe figure depicts the gNB transceiver architecture, highlighting its self-interference cancellation capability. The architecture includes a self-interference cancellation module (SICM) that effectively mitigates interference by analyzing the received signal and adjusting the transmit power accordingly. This feature is crucial for maintaining reliable communication in a 5G network, where multiple users share the same frequency band.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-1: gNB transceiver architecture with self-interference cancellation capability\nFor example, antenna SIC can be used to minimize the leakage power from the Tx ports to the Rx ports of the panel, and digital SIC is then used to handle any residual interference after antenna SIC. DL out-band signal power flowing into the UL Rx path can be effectively suppressed below the noise floor level to guarantee the UL receiver performance. Also, by combining digital pre-distortion (DPD) at the Tx path and digital SIC at the Rx path, the out-band interference from the DL signal to the UL signal can be effectively mitigated by the gNB such that the need for a guard band between the UL and DL signals is minimized.\nSpatial Isolation by Antenna Design\nIn the analysis it’s assumed separate panels for simultaneous downlink transmission and uplink reception as separate-TX/RX antenna array for evaluation of SBFD operation. The basic spatial isolation between RX and TX antenna panels can be achieved by directional isolation.\nFirstly, Tx/Rx isolation can be increased by increasing the spatial distance. Furthermore, an additional RF barrier structure could be useful to further improve Tx/Rx isolation performance, and using the RF barrier between the Tx and Rx panels could also affect the required spatial distance separating the Tx and Rx panels. A well-designed RF barrier can minimize the need for large spatial separation and mostly preserve the existing antenna form factor and enclosed volume comparable to legacy TDD. To design an efficient RF barrier, various electromagnetic resonator structures can be incorporated into the antenna design, e.g., wall(s), gap(s), or a combination of them. These result in surface wave nulling and can further block the undesired leakage signals from the Tx panel to the Rx panel.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-2 demonstrates the S21 measurement results with respect to the distance between upper and lower antenna panels in our FR1 3.5 GHz SBFD testbed.\nThe figure depicts a testbed setup for FR1, a 5G technology, with various performance metrics measured at different distances between the upper and lower panels. The results show that the SIC (Signal Integrity) is maintained at a high level, indicating that the system is capable of handling interference and maintaining signal quality.      The figure depicts a testbed setup for FR1, a 5G technology, with various performance metrics measured at different distances between the upper and lower panels. The results show that the SIC (Signal Integrity) is maintained at a high level, indicating that the system is capable of handling interference and maintaining signal quality.   The figure depicts a testbed setup for FR1, a 5G technology, with various performance metrics measured at different distances between the upper and lower panels. The results show that the SIC (Signal Integrity) is maintained at a high level, indicating that the system is capable of handling interference and maintaining signal quality.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-2: FR1 testbed and SIC performance when varying distance between upper and lower panel\nWhile it can be expected that spatial isolation numbers vary depending on the form and particular layout configuration of antenna elements in the upper and lower panels, we have shown that >80 dB antenna isolation is possible between the Tx and Rx panels in FR1, with reasonable separation distance between upper and lower panel.\nAn important design consideration for increased spatial isolation provided by the RF barrier is whether such stopband performance is stable over a wide enough frequency range. Electromagnetic (EM) isolators and resonant structures are designed around a specific center frequency, e.g., 3.5 GHz. Therefore, design of the resonant structure must account properly for the channel bandwidth and NR operating band under consideration to provide a sufficiently large stopband between Tx and Rx panel. Another consideration is that undesired Tx/Rx interference is created by multiple EM sources, e.g., antenna elements in the Tx panel. Therefore, diffusion of the corresponding surface waves is more challenging when isolating the Tx and Rx panel. Despite these challenges, our FR1 3.5 GHz testbed have achieved isolation performance that show almost uniform antenna and panel isolation performance with respect to frequency for the 100 MHz channel BW of the NR carrier in 3.5 GHz.\nAccording to the applied mechanisms and measurement results, the achievable level for TX and RX spatial isolation without impact on radiation pattern based on compact antenna size is around 80dB for FR1.\nTX and RX beam nulling/isolation\nThe effect of beam nulling for isolation depends on implementation and antenna array size. For both TX and RX panels, the large number of antenna elements for TX/RX beamforming can provide the ability to provide nulling to mitigate the self-interference by increasing the isolation. For FR1 up to 10dB isolation by beam nulling can be contributed to residual interference suppression.\nFrequency isolation at TX\nFor SBFD, in which the Tx signal and the Rx signal are respectively allocated to non-overlapping frequency-domain resources on the same time-domain symbol for simultaneous transmission and reception, at least the waveform roll-off therefore reduces the magnitude of the Tx-Rx interference to which the Rx signal is subjected. Additionally, BB filtering can be applied to further increase the achievable isolation. The use of frequency-domain isolation between the Tx and Rx signal allocations is primarily an approach that serves the purpose of reducing the amount of self-interference which must be further cancelled by a digital cancellation stage.\nIn the case of gNB-side SBFD operation, the SBFD UL subband can be considered as out-of-channel with respect to the 1 or 2 SBFD DL subband(s). Undesired spectral leakage from the DL Tx signal in the gNB into the Rx path are reduced similar to the case of out-of-channel leakage, e.g., comparable to the gNB Tx-side Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) for coexistence between two operators on adjacent channels in the same NR band. Note that ACLR is determined by the non-linear characteristics of the PA and corresponding RF requirements are set by RAN4, e.g., 45 dBc for the gNB Tx.\nWhile it can be assumed that the achievable Tx-to-Rx interference from the SBFD DL subband to the UL subband can only guarantee performance according to the less stringent in-channel RF requirements, our FR1 3.5 GHz testbed implementation shows that the use of digital pre-distortion (DPD) techniques to improve upon the non-linearity characteristics of the PA can achieve 45 dBc isolation between the SBFD DL and UL subbands. Figure 9.2.1.2.1-3  shows the achievable isolation in frequency domain for FR1 SFBD when Tx-to-Rx leakage is also compensated for by DPD based on the FR1 3.5 GHz testbed.\nThe figure depicts a testbed setup for the FR1 standard, which is a key component of the 5G network. It includes a 5G radio unit (RSU), a base station (gNB), and a set of antennas. The figure also shows the performance of the system under different scenarios, including the use of digital pre-distortion (PSD) and the use of different types of base stations (SBFD DL and UL SBs). The testbed is designed to ensure the reliability and performance of the 5G network.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-3: FR1 testbed and PSD for SBFD DL and UL SBs after antenna isolation and digital pre-distortion\nFrequency isolation at RX and RF SIC\nNote that TDD gNB radio unit design must also account for ADC and LNA in the receiver path, e.g., to prevent Rx saturation or blocking by the spectral leakage created from the undesired Tx signal. To prevent ADC saturation in the Rx path of the gNB radio unit supporting SBFD, Rx filtering can be used to suppress the leakage from the Tx side interfering signal. Additional Rx filters can provide protection to avoid potential dynamic range and saturation issues for ADC or LNA when demodulating the UL subband in the Rx path of the gNB. Note that for RF filters with sharp roll-off’s, the order of the filter must increase, and so must then the size of the filter. Additional insertion losses are incurred which negatively affect the link budget.\nHigh-Q value RF filter can provide enough attenuation towards high power level interference in the DL subband(s), not only for the self-interference but also other co-channel interference sources from co-site inter-sector and inter-site gNBs. As illustrated in the below figure, for RF direct-sampling receiver (which shall be regarded as the receiver architecture more difficult to implement subband filter compared to super heterodyne and homodyne/zero-IF receivers) to have the RF subband filter be located between the two-stage cascaded LNAs, the normal design is to have the UL subband as passband and reserve a few number of PRBs (e.g., 5PRB assumed) for transition band(s) to allow a certain suppression to filter out interference signals over DL subband(s).\nThe figure depicts an improved direct-RF sampling receiver with subband filtering between the two-stage cascaded LNAs, which enhances the signal quality and reduces the number of RF samples required.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-4: Improved direct-RF sampling receiver with subband filtering between the two-stage cascaded LNAs\nThe key difficult is to design a high Q-value RF subband filter, which should also be restricted by the limited space in the integrated base station design. The RF filter performance for Q-values of 1500 and 5000 has been studied by using RF simulation tool as provided as below, by providing the transmission S21 and reflection S11 goal for the targeted 20MHz passband, 20dB return loss, stopband and 25dB attenuation.\nThe figure depicts the performance of an analog filter for two different frequencies, 3.5GHz and 5000MHz, with a passband of 20MHz. The filter is designed to meet the specified Q (Q=1500) and has a passband of 20MHz. The figure provides a visual representation of the filter's performance, allowing for a quick understanding of its characteristics.     The figure depicts the performance of an analog filter for two different frequencies, 3.5GHz and 5000MHz, with a passband of 20MHz. The filter is designed to meet the specified Q (Q=1500) and has a passband of 20MHz. The figure provides a visual representation of the filter's performance, allowing for a quick understanding of its characteristics.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-5: Analog filter performance for Q=1500 (left) and 5000 (right), for 3.5GHz operating freq. and 20MHz passband\nThe feasibility of high Q-value RF subband filter with reasonable size/weight to be integrated into current gNB implementation has been challenged by some companies in previous RAN4 meetings. On the other hand, it should be noted that some novel designs are recently proposed, which could be based on some new structure for ceramic dielectric filter to have very good RF filtering performance as requested, and there are some preliminary results simulated by HFSS, which are based on the ceramic dielectric filter with the cascaded quardruplet structure dimensioned by 19.5mm*19.5mm*6mm illustrated in the below figure, that shall be regarded as reasonable small size/weight and feasible to be integrated in current gNB design.\nThe figure depicts a new cascaded quadruplet structure for a ceramic dielectric filter, which is a crucial component in the design of electronic filters. The structure is composed of four quadruplets, each containing four layers of dielectric material, and is designed to enhance the performance of the filter by providing additional layers of material for better absorption and transmission of electromagnetic waves. The figure illustrates the intricate details of the filter's construction, including the precise arrangement of the layers and the use of ceramic material for the dielectric layer. This structure is an essential part of the filter's design, as it helps to improve the filter's ability to reject unwanted signals and maintain a high level of performance.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-6: New cascaded quardruplet structure for ceramic dielectric filter\nFurthermore, one alternative solution with relaxed Q-value subband filter but with more flexibility for subband configuration is also studied. As illustrated by the below figure, subband filter can still be implemented between the two-stage cascaded LNAs, and what different is the designed filter shall have a passband wider than the configured UL subband and the transition band could be much relaxed from 5PRB. For example, to support 20MHz UL subband, we can implement a subband filter easier to be implemented, e.g., {larger passband than 20MHz, more PRB for transition band} being considered.\nThe figure depicts a simplified alternative solution to the Q-value subband filtering in a 5G network, which is a crucial component for ensuring high-quality signal transmission. The solution involves using relaxed Q-value subband filtering, which allows for more flexibility in the selection of subbands, leading to improved performance and reduced complexity. The figure also illustrates the use of a relaxed Q-value subband filter, which is a key component in the 5G network architecture.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-7: Alternative solution with relaxed Q-value subband filtering\nWith the above design, the motivation of introducing UL subband filter is to reduce DL interference level to avoid RX blocking, rather than to remove all DL interference signals, thus making the filtering passband to be equal to UL subband unnecessary. If the subband filter with larger passband could prevent RX blocking, the residual interference not filtered by the subband filter can be further handled by the operation in the digital domain, including digital filtering and digital interference cancellation.\nFor instance, we designed the filter with <25MHz passband and <4MHz used for roll-off transition band between passband/stopband and 25dB suppression (better suppression performance, but still easier to be implemented because of larger transition bands). We would also like to use HFSS-based RF simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of this design. There are some numerical results of the well-designed advanced RF filter for which we evaluate the performance by HFSS-based RF simulation. The filter is also based on the ceramic dielectric filter with the cascaded quardruplet structure with the same dimension as previous filter design (i.e., 19.5mm*19.5mm*6mm) but different structure illustrated as the below figure, that shall also be regarded as reasonable small size/weight and feasible to be integrated in current gNB design.\n\nThe figure depicts a new cascaded quadruplet structure for a ceramic dielectric filter, designed with a 24.8MHz passband. The structure is intended to be larger than the 20MHz UL subband, providing enhanced performance and flexibility for filter design.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-8: New cascaded quardruplet structure for ceramic dielectric filter for filter design with 24.8MHz passband (intentionally larger than 20MHz UL subband)\n\nThe figure depicts a RF simulation result for a filter design with a 24.8MHz passband, intended to be larger than the 20MHz UL subband. The simulation results show the effect of the filter on the RF signal, with the passband being intentionally larger to ensure better performance.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.1-9: RF simulation results for filter design with 24.8MHz passband (intentionally larger than 20MHz UL subband)\nAs demonstrated in the above figure, for this RF filter design, the passband (the point m2 to m3 in the above figure) is 24.8MHz, which is intentionally larger 20MHz as UL subband bandwidth. Even by considering 25dB suppression, the transmission bands are less than 3.8MHz for both lower and higher frequency sides.\nWe can assume the worst case that 4.8MHz DL interference signals (24.8MHz passband – 20MHz UL subband BW) are not filtered out at all, and the DL interference at 2x 3.8MHz transition bands is filtered out by -14dB (for the worst case estimation by separating 3.8MHz into several parts). Therefore, we can derive the residual self-Interference signal in gNB RX subband (caused by non-ideal RX selectivity) gain-normalized  = as 49dBm - 80dB - 5dB - 11.8dB (subband filtering) - 40dB = -87.8dB, which is still 6.8dB smaller than the residual self-interference leakage in UL subband due to non-ideal TX. It should be noted that the equivalent suppression provided by subband filtering can be calculated as 10*log_10((4.8MHz/80MHz)*10^(0dB/10) + (2*3.8MHz/80MHz)*10^(-14dB/10) +  (67.6MHz/80MHz)*10^(-25dB/10)) = -11.8dB. Therefore, with the alternative solution with the subband filtering having a larger passband than the configured UL subband and larger transition bands for roll-off, the RF filter will be easier to be design.\nAdditionally, analog filters such as IF and BB filters can be employed. For example, when the receiver is designed to use zero IF architecture, the receiver can use the lowpass filter to further remove the leakage signal after applying the mixer. By combining multiple LNAs, filter loss can be compensated more easily.\nDigital IC\nAs aforementioned theoretically, the digital IC should be with the capability to remove all remaining self-interference if the total level to be handled by ADC input is within its dynamic range. For 12bit ADC with assumption of 12dB PRPA signal, the dynamic range is >50dB.\nThe desired received signal is mixed with the undesired DL leakage signal in the Rx path of the gNB radio, e.g., after ADC. The unwanted DL leakage signal must be removed by receiver processing using digital SIC. It is necessary to estimate the interference channel between the Tx panel and the Rx panel. Digital SIC performance is helped when synchronization to accurately remove the Tx signal from the Rx signal can be obtained. In principle, two methods exist to estimate the interference channel. One approach is to store information on a Tx signal that has passed through the PA with a feedback link and then estimate the interference channel over-the-air to remove the interference from the Rx signal. Another approach is to use only over-the-air estimation. Without a feedback link, the whole combined channel can still be estimated through the Rx panel. We used the first approach in the FR1 3.5 GHz testbed.\nThe corresponding technique input in the summary Table 9.2.1.1-1 presents an overview of the self-interference mitigation potential for a wide area BS with 53 dBm transmit power.\nWhen considering the transmitter sub-band emissions that leak into the RX sub-band, the emissions are suppressed to a level of around -72dBm using transmitter and analog suppression techniques, which is around 24dB above the noise floor. In principle, digital techniques could to some extent be used to further suppress the TX interference, however the receiver is blocked. From the receiver perspective, the input power is too high and the receiver is blocked. A detailed description is provided in the summary table.\nThe following are more detailed considerations of modelling and techniques captured in table 9.2.1.1-1.\nTX – RX isolation\nTransmitter to receiver isolation is achieved by means of separating the transmit and receive panels. Spatial separation alone achieves in the order of 30-40 dB isolation. However, a number of techniques exist to significantly improve the TX-RX panel isolation including chokes, absorption, mushroom EBG etc. A detailed electromagnetic simulation of these techniques is presented in [67], which demonstrates that the isolation between a TX panel and RX sub-array varies depending on beam direction between 55 to 80dB. An example of the electromagnetic simulations is depicted in figure 9.2.1.2.2-1 and 9.2.1.2.2-2. The first figure visualizes the EM propagation between the sub-arrays, whereas the second figure indicates the TX panel to RX sub-array isolation for several TX beam steering directions. The simulations take into account an advanced suppression structure between the sub-arrays.\nThe figure depicts a full-wave averaged E-field magnitude on an XZ plane cut based on an EM simulation, illustrating the spatial distribution of the electric field.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.2-1: Full-wave averaged E-field magnitude on an XZ plane cut based on EM simulation\n\nFigure 9.2.1.2.2-2: TX panel to RX sub-array coupling magnitude curves considering co-polarized (top) and cross polarized (bottom) ports. Each curve represents the coupling magnitude of the TX panel to a single RX sub-array. Each sub-figure corresponds to a specific elevation angle.\nThe specific value depends on the scheduled users, and 70dB has been taken as a representative value. With TX beam nulling, as described in the subsequent section the variation can be reduced and the achievable isolation becomes around 80dB.\nTX beam nulling\nThe transmit panel has a large number of transmit elements and hence a high number of degrees of freedom to perform beamforming. Beam Nulling can be used in the transmit panel to reduce the power at the receive panel. It is not clear that beam nulling has the same impact on both the transmitted signal and the transmitter leakage, however for simplicity this has been assumed. A simulation investigation has been presented in [50], which demonstrated the possibility to increase the spatial isolation to around 80dB using beam nulling. Furthermore, beam nulling reduces the variation of the spatial isolation due to beam direction. Thus, 80dB of spatial isolation is assumed.\nThe beam nulling has an impact on DL EIRP depending on the beam direction. The impact to DL MIMO performance was not investigated.\nAnalogue interference cancellation\nAnalogue interference cancellation could be considered as a means for suppressing both interference in the RX sub-band and power in the TX sub-band entering the receiver. Analogue IC requires and inter-connections/routing paths to detect the signal at each transmitter as well as remove the interference in the receiver. In order to ensure that the removed signal is not impacted by receiver processing, the interference subtraction must take place in the first stage of the receiver chain, before the LNA and thus insertion losses caused by the coupling will degrade the noise figure.\nAnalogue interference cancellation is a promising technology for some smaller BS types and simulations demonstrate potential for mitigating interference for larger arrays. However, the complexity of interconnections between all TX and RX elements in a large commercial BS and the losses associated with the combining and subtracting would lead to a performance decrease and size and weight increase for an AAS to the level of a doubtful feasibility. Thus, analogue interference cancellation has not been considered for a high power, large array AAS.\nReceiver analogue filtering\nFor the wide area BS, the main performance issue is the large power in the TX sub-bands entering the receiver, -27dBm. The minimum RAN4 requirement for a receiver is to produce a 6dB desensitization when a carrier of -43dBm is applied in a 2nd adjacent channel, and thus the application of -27dBm directly next to the RX sub-band is very challenging. Although the linearity performance can be improved, the LNA linearity cannot be directly improved to become sufficient.\nA possible solution is to use analogue filters before the LNA to remove the DL sub-band power. Investigations in [50] demonstrate that it is not possible to build analogue filters with an achievable Q-factor without a large insertion loss.\n\nThe figure depicts the performance of an analogue filter for a Q=1500 signal, illustrating the filter's characteristics such as gain, phase margin, and noise figure. The filter is designed to meet the specified Q value, ensuring a stable and accurate representation of the signal.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.2-3: Analogue filter performance for Q=1500\n\nTable 9.2.1.2.2-1: Insertion losses for Q=1500 filters\n\nAnother alternative is to place analogue filters between a first stage and a second stage LNA. Using this approach, the linearity of the receiver chain could in principle be improved with a much-reduced impact to the noise floor. However, there are a number of significant problems with such an approach:\n-\tThe first LNA stage needs high linearity and becomes very power consuming.\n-\tThe tight integration needed to achieve power and weight efficient AAS BS is no longer feasible due to the filter size. Hence there will be further increases in power consumption due to reduced integration and thermal management issues.\n-\tThe filters would need to be tuned specifically to the UL sub-band if implemented in RF. Hence, non-reconfigurable, operator specific hardware would be needed for every BS. The alternative is to use a mixer to bring the signal down to IF or baseband, but then the mixer linearity would compromise the receiver performance and the blocking performance would not be achieved.\n-\tThere would need to be a number of filters for every branch due to e.g. 2 polarizations, support for DL slots, UL slots and SBFD slots with different filtering requirements (even more filters if there would be multi-carrier support). Also switches would be needed, which would compromise linearity and add further space. It is doubtful all of the filters could be accommodated without further losses.\nDue to the above reasons, analogue filtering is not considered to be a realistic approach for a commercially relevant BS and so is not considered the feasibility analysis.\nDigital interference cancellation and digital processing\nDigital TX interference cancellation and subtraction, and RX combining taking into account interference covariance have the potential to mitigate interference in the receiver. Digital processing has not been considered because the power level in the analogue front end of the receiver is high enough to saturate the receiver. Digital interference subtraction would required a very high computational complexity for a wide area AAS due to the large number of TX-RX combinations.\nFor FR1 our analysis and evaluation are provided in the summary table, we show two examples for Wide Area BS to consider different max TX power. One is 47 dBm max TX power and the other is 53 dBm. The major difference for WA example 2 is the adoption of analog filter to counteract the higher RX blocking from TX sub-band.\nAnalogue filter prior to the LNA would introduce also insertion loss which will cause sensitivity loss. Hence it is not suitable. Meanwhile putting analogue filter after LNA could tolerance the high insertion loss. The filter can be RF analog filter in the front-end or base-band analogue filter before the ADC. In the example we use RF analog filter which is put after LNA. The filter performance can be found in Figure below. A Q-value of 1500 and 5 poles are assumed in the simulator. It can be found that the insertion loss is less than 5 dB and ~15 dB suppression is achievable, with some margin to address the manufacturing accuracy and temperature drift.\nThe figure depicts a sub-band filter, which is a component of a digital signal processing system used to filter out undesired frequencies in a signal. The filter is designed to remove high-frequency components from the signal, allowing only the desired frequencies to pass through. This is important in telecommunications, where the transmission of high-frequency signals is crucial for maintaining signal quality and reducing interference. The figure shows the filter's structure, including the input and output ports, and the various components that make up the filter, such as capacitors, inductors, and resistors. The figure also includes a legend to help understand the different components and their functions. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise representation of the performance of an example sub-band filter in a digital signal processing system.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.3-1: Performance of an example sub-band filter\nAs shown in the example below, putting analogue filter after LNA, since the front-end LNA can provide substantial gain on the wanted signal, the impact to overall noise figure is negligible (2.21dB vs 2.24 dB), and the RX IIP3 prior to the filter is high enough to cope with high blocking level, such as ~ -30 dBm. The OIP3 of gain block in LNA might need to be increases a bit, which results the addition of power consumption. However the addition is quite limited, which is less than 0.5% of overall power consumption.\nTable 9.2.1.2.3-1: Cascaded NF and IIP3\n\nAnalogue sub-band filter after LNA can provide the needed suppression for the receiver parts after the filter, and the impacts to RX sensitivity due to insertion loss is negligible. If analogue sub-band filter is adopted in the solution, the blocking performance can be improved at least 10 dB.\nTo enable proper reception of the uplink signal at the gNB receiver with simultaneously transmission DL signal, gNB should mitigate the direct self-interference ‘leakage’ and any significant clutter reflections. The self-interference could be mitigated by different techniques such as spatial isolation, analog subband filter, analog interference cancellation, beamforming and digital interference cancellation. In the following, we discuss in detail the knobs for gNB transceiver that enable the mitigation of both component of self-interference, namely direct leakage and clutter reflections.\nAntenna techniques and spatial isolation\nFor SBFD deployments, gNB antenna configurations should be based on two panels configuration with split of the antenna elements for simultaneous downlink transmission and uplink reception as shown in Figure 9.2.1.2.4-1 on the other hand, for legacy TDD deployments, gNB antenna configuration is based on single panel for downlink transmission or uplink reception. With the split panel architecture, the gNB can enable larger spatial isolation is an essential component to mitigate self-interference. In addition, the physical separation between the two panels could be used to add electro-magnetic spatial duplexer that enhances the spatial isolation between the panels.\nThe figure depicts the antenna/panels configuration of a gNB in TDD and SBFD modes, illustrating the various components and their arrangement to ensure optimal signal reception and transmission.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.4-1: gNB antenna/panels configuration in TDD and SBFD modes\nRF measurements for the Tx-Rx spatial has been conducted and results are shown in Figure 9.2.1.2.4-2. Each curve represents the spatial isolation measured between all transmit chains of one array to one receiver chain of the other array. This includes the near field transmit and receive antenna gains. The results show more than 80 dB of isolation is achieved at the band of interest.\nThe figure depicts the spatial isolation measurements of the Tx-Rx spatial isolation between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) in a 5G network. The measurements are crucial for ensuring reliable communication, as they help to prevent interference and ensure that the signal is not reflected off nearby objects. The figure shows the Tx-Rx spatial isolation as a function of distance, with the Tx-Rx distance being the distance between the transmitter and receiver. The measurements are taken at different distances, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the spatial isolation performance in the 5G network.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.4-2: RF measurements of Tx-Rx spatial isolation between for FR1\nFrequency isolation\nDL and UL transmissions can be separated in the frequency domain via multiplexing of the DL and UL using non-overlapping DL and UL sub-bands. As a result, large frequency isolation for the UL signal reception is attained as shown in Figure 9.2.1.2.4-3. For RAN4 further considerations, the frequency isolation represents the ratio of the power of non-linear leakage into the UL subband to the power of the DL signal at the DL subband, which can be approximated by the ACLR requirements specified by RAN4. RAN1 has requested RAN4 to provide value range for the frequency isolation capability of the gNB as well as the accompanying assumptions to those values.\nThe figure depicts a frequency isolation system, illustrating the separation of different frequency bands within a communication network. The system consists of multiple frequency bands, each represented by different colors and symbols, with the goal of ensuring that no two frequency bands interfere with each other. This helps to maintain a stable and reliable communication network.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.4-3: Frequency isolation\nA guardband may be needed at the gNB to protect UL reception within the UL subband and reduce the impact of self-interference. In some scenarios, depending on the gNB implementation, a very small guardband or even no guardband may be needed at all. However, from UE perspective, given that there is no UE selectivity, a guardband may be needed to protect the DL reception from the inter-UE CLI. To further analyse this, 80 MHz system bandwidth, the 60 MHz DL subband is allocated with 161 RBs (starting from first RBs at band edge) and the 20 MHz UL subband is allocated with 51 RBs. A guard band of 5RBs in between UL and DL subband. The Tx waveform is pushed to the PA to derive max Tx power of 47 dBm. The subband frequency isolation is defined at the ratio between the power leakage within the 20 MHz UL subband as compared to the transmit signal power within the 60 MHz DL subband as shown in Figure 9.2.1.2.4-4.\n\nThe figure depicts the power spectral density (PSD) of the downlink (DL) waveform and frequency isolation in a 5G network. The figure illustrates the impact of various factors on the signal quality, such as the presence of noise and interference, which can be mitigated through frequency isolation techniques.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.4-4: PSD of DL waveform and frequency isolation\nBeam isolation and beamforming/nulling\nIn FR1, the DL precoder and UL combiner weights could be optimized to provide some beamform nulling for the clutter and/or self-interference. The massive MIMO antenna has large number of degrees of freedom in both digital and analog (i.e., hybrid beamforming) that provide the ability to create some spatial nulls. Beamforming nulling is an efficient technique for clutter mitigation.\nDigital self-interference mitigation\nThe nonlinearities introduced within the gNB front’s end due to non-ideal components of the Tx chain will lead to residual non-linear self-interference that cannot be fully captured in the RF or analog domain due to the associated high complexity, high sensitivity of the canceler and the system’s stability. In this regard, leveraging adaptive filtering and non-linear modeling of the residual self-interference to accurately model and cancel the residual self-interference is performed to provide additional mitigation in the digital domain and enable higher MCS. With the knowledge of the DL samples and the non-linear model, an adaptive filter can be used to synthesize the non-linear leakage and cancel it out from the Rx signal as shown in Figure 9.2.1.2.4-5. This technique can be used for cancellation of both self-interference and clutter echo by having multiple taps cancellation.\nThe figure depicts a digital self-interference cancellation system, which is a crucial component in 5G networks to mitigate the impact of self-interference, a phenomenon where signals from the same frequency repeat and cause interference. The system uses a combination of digital signal processing techniques to detect and cancel out the self-interference signals, ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.4-5: Digital self-interference cancellation\nFor FR1 Wide Area BS SI analysis, the following assumptions are used.\nTable 9.2.1.2.5-1: SI analysis assumptions for Wide area BS\n\nIn SI capability analysis, the following techniques are used,\n-\tCFR is used to improve component efficiency, DPD is used for high power equipment to optimize ACLR.\n-\tTx antennas panel and Rx antennas panel are separate, there are also some isolation materials between them, and cross polarization is also used.\n-\tRF subband RF filter is assumed for Tx and Rx path.\n-\tDigital filter is used to resolve the adjacent subband (i.e. Tx subband) interference issue.\n-\tBeam nulling is used to improve isolation between Tx and Rx.\n-\tDigital IC is used to reduce interference in the UL sub-bands. The interference is leakage from the transmitter, similar as DPD, digital domain needs to capture and sample the interference signals, then subtract the interference at receiver.\nFrom the analysis provided in the summary table, the receiver may be blocked. Some specific techniques need to be used to improve the spatial ISO. Requirement of IIP3 is relatively high and the ACS requirement is improved largely compared with the legacy BS. It seems wide area SBFD BS design may need much improvement from several aspects to make it feasible.\nThe Nokia input in the summary table presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a wide area base station with 54 dBm total output power. The RSIC capability corresponds to 110 dBc for the Rx subband and between 122 dBc for TX sub-band which are achieved using a combination of spatial isolation (65 dBc), frequency separation (45 dBc), and Tx beam nulling (5-10 dBc, only applicable to the Tx subband isolation). Under such considerations, the self-interference observed in the UL subband is -62 dBm/20 MHz (dominated by ACLR from the transmitter) which is 34 dB above the noise floor. Such level of interference would result in high desensitization of the receiver which makes it unpractical for wide-area deployments where coverage is one of the main KPIs. A detailed description of the assumed techniques and other assumptions is provided in the summary table.\nBS TX Power\nTo study the feasibility for wide area base stations, including powerful mMIMO base stations, an output power of 55 dBm (as e.g. in the case of 64 TX paths with 5 W each) is assumed. Considering 80%/20% DL/UL frequency resource split in an SBFD configuration, this amounts to 54 dBm.\nIf lower power is assumed for wide area base stations, correspondingly the deployment scenario would require a denser ISD.\nFrequency isolation at TX\nWe think 45 dB frequency isolation is feasible. This is in line with the 45 dB ACLR requirement that is typical for base stations, albeit for D-U-D sub-band configuration, slightly more difficult to achieve.\nThe techniques to achieve sufficient frequency isolation may include:\n-\tTransmitter digital filtering or windowing to clean the UL sub-band. This is required to clean the IFFT output of the linear leakage of the signal, otherwise the sinc spectrum of the IFFT will dominate the emissions on the UL sub-band. Requires new filter design with potentially tighter suppression requirements compared to the channel filter, due to the desire to minimize guard bands between DL and UL sub-bands.\n-\tTighter filter suppression requirements may mean longer filter impulse response and lead to signal EVM degradation.\n-\tTransmitter digital pre-distortion to linearize the transmit chain and suppress PA distortion components. Achieving the same performance for sub-band leakage ratio as for ACLR will be more challenging, as the UL sub-band is closer to the DL sub-band(s) than the adjacent channel. The ACLR is averaged over the same bandwidth as the DL channel, with emissions likely decaying somewhat with offset. For inter-sub-band leakage, the offset is generally small, indicating tighter DPD requirements for the same absolute level of emissions. Moreover, the DUD frequency configuration will be challenging due to spectral regrowth from both sides of the UL sub-band, compared to DU configuration or the ACLR case.\n-\tHigher DPD complexity translates to higher energy consumption.\n-\tHigher energy consumption leads to increased heating, worse PA performance and thermal management issues. This may require larger and heavier cooling solutions.\nSpatial isolation\nFor the achievable spatial isolation for separate TX and RX antenna arrays, we find that 65 dB may be a reasonable assumption for a well-designed antenna in an average case, if assuming EM shielding structures between the arrays.\nThe techniques to achieve sufficient spatial isolation may include:\n-\tSeparate TX and RX antennas or antenna arrays. Increased separation from TX to RX will improve isolation.\n-\tTo maintain the same or similar physical size of the antenna, the number of elements per array need to be halved. This reduces the achievable array gain by at least 3 dB in both link directions and has been demonstrated by simulations to degrade the system performance.\n-\tTo maintain baseline system performance, the number of antenna elements per array must be maintained, leading to an increased antenna size by at least 2x. This in turn means higher weight and wind load, increased complexity, increased trace losses which may need to be compensated, and in general higher cost.\n-\tSeparate TX and RX antenna arrays requires separate PWBs for the TX and RX, leading to a higher cost.\n-\tSeparate TX and RX antenna arrays leads to loss of reciprocity in the DL and UL channels and makes reliable channel state measurements more difficult and complicated. The extent of this loss has not been studied.\n-\tEM shielding techniques such as wave traps or chokes between the TX and RX arrays.\nTX Beam nulling /isolation in TX sub-band\nThe beamforming coefficients of the transmit beamforming may be modified so that the energy coupled to the receive antenna elements is minimized. We have conducted EM simulations that measure the TX-RX isolation based on the most exposed RX antenna element/subarray, where this element/subarray is determined separately, with and without beam nulling. Those findings are found in contribution [48]. We observe that the level of self-interference depends on the beam direction. We have measured a minimum of 8 dB of beam nulling gain for all the Tx beams and up to 14 dB of gain for the beam with lowest isolation to the receive antenna elements as illustrated in Figure 9.2.1.2.6-1. The observed DL EIRP impact was between 0dB - 0.8 dB depending on beam direction, although 90% of the transmit beams experienced a DL EIRP loss below 0.3 dB. Note also that:\n-\tThe modification of TX beamforming coefficients reduces the transmitted EIRP toward the intended UE, leading to further reduced DL performance unless compensated by increased conducted power.\n-\tBased on simulations, some TX beams may be affected more than others, leading to potential scheduler restrictions in which UEs may be scheduled during the SBFD time slots.\n-\tThe transmit beam nulling is most effective on the DL sub-band, for which the transmit signal is known and can be beamformed. It is not assumed that transmit beam nulling is effective on the UL sub-band, which contains only unwanted emission components from the transmitter.\nThe figure depicts the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of isolation between each Tx beam towards the worst-affected Rx port. The Tx beams are generated within ±45° azimuth and elevation angles, indicating the spatial distribution of the Tx beams and their impact on the isolation between the Rx ports.\nFigure 9.2.1.2.6-1: Empirical CDF of isolation between each Tx beam towards worst-affected Rx port. Tx beams are generated within ±45° azimuth and elevation angles.\nRF IC and other tech. (before LNA)\nThe following techniques have been evaluated, but have significant challenges in FR1 wide area base station implementations:\n-\tAnalog cancellation in the RF domain. This method may be used to subtract the unwanted coupled TX signal components from the RX signal path, before the LNA. With proper phase shift and amplitude scaling, the TX component may be cancelled.\n-\tThere has been a proposal of an AFIR type of canceler solution in which the canceler unit is made of M+N individual cancelers, where M is the number of TXs and N the number of RXs. The canceler unit is connected to TX and RX antenna panels. If M=N=64 there will be 64 RF connections from TX panel to the canceler unit and 64 RF connections from canceler unit to RX panel. That might be doable in a common mechanics but in the case that all three units are separate, it is not feasible anymore. Since the distance of the TX and RX antenna panels need to be quite high (due to needed spatial isolation) and receiver and transmitter chains need to be located close to antenna filters (to avoid excessive insertion losses that cannot be compensated), separate TX and RX PWBs are needed.\n-\tValid mathematics have been presented that M+N cancelers are sufficient for RF IC but that it is true only when one set of beamforming coefficients are valid at a time e.g. in the mmW arrays. For MU MIMO there is a need for (M+N)xUxL cancelers where M and N are as above and U is the number or users and L is the average number of layers per use. For a typical 5G case that would be starting from 5120 cancelers. On top of that, all of them have to be updated every time when the beamforming coefficients are updated. That leads to an intolerable complexity and processing burden when solving mathematics for each of those individually.\nFrequency isolation at RX\nSub-band filtering techniques before or after the LNA may improve frequency isolation, but have significant challenges in FR1 wide area base station implementations and therefore are not assumed to be feasible:\n-\tHigh insertion loss before the LNA will increase the receiver noise figure and negate any system gains of SBFD.\n-\tIf a sub-band filter would be used between the two LNAs, i.e. as an inter-stage filter:\n-\tVery high linearity is required from the first stage LNA, which will lead to increased cost, power consumption and thermal management issues.\n-\tInter-stage filter does not help to protect the first LNA from direct ACLR from the aggressor. If the first stage LNA is saturated, the receiver would not work.\n-\tHigh insertion loss placed after the LNA does not reduce LNA linearity requirements. Improved linearity LNAs are needed that add to cost and power consumption, which leads to thermal management issues. Other challenges include:\n-\tSignificant insertion loss → NF increase that can hardly be accommodated in the 1 dB desensitization budget.\n-\tConsiderable transition band and temperature dependency of the passband position → larger guard band between the sub-bands needed and less BW is usable for UL\n-\tGroup delay distortion close to the cut-off frequencies\n-\tIncompatibility with a typical multi-carrier gNB design\n-\tIncreased complexity as switches are needed for by-pass in UL slots for full BW\n-\tAdditional space needed in RX chain that is not available in typical gNB design\n-\tOverall additional power consumption which leads to thermal management issues\n-\tFrequency drift over temperature that will impact filter insertion loss and rejection performance, hence impacts the RX lineup performance\n-\tThe new sub-band specific filters would be operator’s spectrum specific and locking the spectrum configuration for any further changes or tuning. The existing bandpass filters for the operating band would anyway be required, suggesting that the new filters would double the filter size for the UL antenna panel. This all means higher cost and complexity.\n-\tBesides, some preliminary analyses with simulations of filters with Q-values of 1500 and even up to 5000 have been presented by companies. In one of the analyses, it has been shown that the guard bands would become very wide or excessive losses would be obtained otherwise. Also, it is important to note that these simulations have not taken the manufacturing tolerances into consideration nor the temperature drift, which have an effect of paramount importance when implementing a working filtering solution. Last but not least, these filtering solutions would be too large to be suited for mMIMO BS, and they add large amount of cost to the BOM of a BS.\nRX Beam nulling / isolation in RX sub-band\nWe assume 0 dB for RX beam nulling; as the SBFD feature is about enhancing uplink performance, we do not think the UL beamforming can be compromised further than the loss of channel reciprocity (due to separate TX and RX arrays) brings.\nRX beamforming operates in the digital domain in a mMIMO system. The digital signal streams of the relevant receivers are combined using suitable amplitude and phase coefficients. Hence RX beam nulling will not relax the receiver dynamic range and linearity requirements.\nDigital IC\nThe following techniques have been evaluated, but have significant challenges in FR1 wide area base station implementations:\n-\tDigital cancellation. With knowledge of the TX signal, a properly scaled and phase shifted TX component may be subtracted from the RX signal to improve cancellation performance.\n-\tThe TX signal may be available from observation receiver that is used in the DPD processing. For a mMIMO implementation, the DPD system may utilize only a few observation receivers, that sample the TX chains sequentially. It may be necessary to multiply the number of observation receivers to be able to sample each TX chain, leading to increased cost and energy consumption.\n-\tEach RX chain contains signals that are coupled from every TX chain. This means that the cancellation signal for each RX chain must be formed of every TX chains. The complexity can easily become extreme in a mMIMO implementation, with 32 or 64 TRXs. The complexity of the cancellation results in high energy consumption.\n-\tThe cancellation may work with different performance for the DL signal fundamental components (i.e. the DL PRBs) than for the unwanted emission components (i.e. leakage on UL sub-band). The DL signal may be easier to cancel than the unwanted emissions. For the unwanted emissions, it is more efficient to cancel them at the TX DPD.\nBased on the self-interference analysis provided in Section 9.2.1 for FR1 wide area BS, it can be observed that the implementation feasibility of controlling the residual interference to meet the 1dB receiver desensitization target depends on the implementation aspects including:\n-\tMaximum BS transmit power\n-\tSpatial isolation capability\n-\tbeam nulling/ isolation capability\n-\tBlocker suppression at the RX\n-\tFrequency isolation at the TX and RX\n-\tThe digital interference suppression/cancellation capabilities\nBased on the different assumptions and/or technique adoption for the above-mentioned implementations aspects, and based on 6 companies’ technical inputs, companies have come to the following conclusions:\n-\t1dB receiver desensitization target is achievable by self-interference cancellation capability according to 3 companies.\n1dB receiver desensitization target is not achievable or is challenging based on existing technology and technology roadmaps that are viewed as viable in the current time or foreseeable future according to 3 companies.\n",

For the below interested scenario, antenna isolation (with the achievable coupling loss) is to be evaluated:\n-\t3 sector scenario is under consideration:\n-\tThe angle between every two sectors’ boresight directions is 120 degrees;\n-\tSector antenna panel’s width is 180mm;\n-\tBetween two sectors’ antenna panel:\n-\tThe center-to-center distance is: 150mm;\n-\tThe nearest distance between edge to edge is: 60mm;\n-\tThree antenna elements are used to form the antenna port.\n-\t3.5GHz operating frequency with 100MHz bandwidth.\nThe above simulation scenario can be illustrated in Figure 9.2.2.2.1-1. In the right part of below figure, the top view is presented with the concerned panels of sector 1 and sector 2.\nThe figure depicts a 3-sector scenario for co-channel co-site inter-sector antenna isolation study, illustrating the top view of the 2-sector scenario. It highlights the importance of antenna isolation in ensuring reliable communication in multi-sector networks.                           The figure depicts a 3-sector scenario for co-channel co-site inter-sector antenna isolation study, illustrating the top view of the 2-sector scenario. It highlights the importance of antenna isolation in ensuring reliable communication in multi-sector networks.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.1-1: (Left figure) 3-sector scenario for co-channel co-site inter-sector antenna isolation study; \n(Right figure) top view for the 2-sector scenario.\nAccordingly, we have performed HFSS-based RF simulation for the above 3-sector scenario, by evaluating the isolation from sector 2 to sector 1. Specifically, S-parameters between two antenna ports from two sectors are evaluated, by considering each pair of antenna ports with co/cross-polarization relationships, which is illustrated in Figure 9.2.2.2.1-2. The RF evaluation results have been provided in the Table 9.2.2.2.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of S-parameters for antenna port pair, highlighting the relationship between the antenna port and the antenna port of the other port pair. The S-parameters are essential for understanding the performance of the antenna system and are used to calculate the gain and phase shift of the antenna. The figure provides a clear visual representation of the S-parameters, making it easier to understand the relationship between the two ports.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.1-2: Illustration of S-parameters for antenna port pair.\nTable 9.2.2.2.1-1: S-parameter evaluation results.\n\n\nBased on the numerical results, the variance of spatial isolation for different antenna port pairs and different co-/cross-polarization relationships can be demonstrated. Moreover, the edge effect (the wave traversing the surface of antenna panel is condensed and reflected arbitrary at the edge of the antenna panel or any obstacles) further complicates the results.\nBy comparing the same pair of antenna ports but with co-polarization and cross-polarization, it is hard to have a simple observation for which one is higher, but different observations depend on the designated antenna pair. The results could be explainable by the +45degree and -45degree placement for two polarizations. Within a panel, the co-pol and cross-pol can be guaranteed, while 3-sector case may make the alignment disappear.\nThe RF simulation has shown the antennal isolation for co-channel co-site inter-sector gNB-gNB CLI is in the range of 62-93dB, depending on different antenna pair and co/cross-polarization, and 75dB can be regarded as typical value as RAN4 agreement.\nIt is worth noting that the above spatial isolation values (typical value for 75dB) based on HFSS simulation have not yet reflected EM conjugated structure as used in the testbed for two panels within a sector. In the testbed to evaluate self-interference within a sector, the EM conjugated structure can improve around 20~30dB additionally. It is anticipated that the similar improvement if the EM conjugated structure is installed between two-sector antennas. Hence, with the EM conjugated structure, it is expected that the achievable antenna isolation shall be improved by around 25dB.\nThe input provided in Table 9.2.2.1-1 presents an analysis of the inter-sector interference effects for wide area FR1 BS. It should be noted that, as demonstrated in section 9.2.1.2.2, the receiver is already driven into saturation due to self-interference. In addition to the self-interference, the inter-sector interference in the TX sub-bands is also very high power and would drive the receiver into saturation.\nInter-sector isolation\nDue to capacity optimization and site costs, outdoor sites will typically host several sectors, as well as potentially co-located base stations. Some examples of different types of deployment are depicted in figure 9.2.2.2.2-1. Site space constraints (considering zoning, rental, weight, wind-load and other factors) typically mean that the potential to increase distance between sectors or to mount additional structures between sectors and base stations can be very limited.\nTo avoid direct interference to the SBFD receive resources, all sectors using the same carrier must apply SBFD simultaneously in the same slots. If this is the case, then the SBFD receiver will still experience significant power from the TX sub-band of the other sectors, and from other base stations. The isolation between the TX sub-band of other sectors and the RX panel can potentially be less than the TX sub-band within the own base station since the possibilities for building an efficient isolating structure between sectors is less than within a BS.\n\n\nThe figure depicts various outdoor BS deployments, illustrating different types of BSs, such as small cells, macro cells, and femtocells, as well as their respective antenna configurations. The figure also highlights the importance of proper planning and design to ensure effective coverage and user experience.The figure depicts various outdoor BS deployments, illustrating different types of BSs, such as small cells, macro cells, and femtocells, as well as their respective antenna configurations. The figure highlights the importance of proper planning and design to ensure effective coverage and user experience.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.2-1: Examples of outdoor BS deployments\nIsolation between sectors has been simulated using electromagnetic simulations in [68] with an assumption of 400mm sector separation. The isolation varies to some degree with separation, but not to an extent that would change the overall results. For most practical site deployments, addition of materials between sectors is not likely to be feasible (and may reduce network performance). The simulation set-up is depicted in figure 9.2.2.2.2-2. In additional to a horizontal separation, a height separation between TX and RX panels is assumed.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.2-2: EM simulation setup for 3-sector site\nFigure 9.2.2.2.2-3 depicts the EM simulation results. The left hand plot shows the isolation with azimuth steering and elevation in boresight and the right hand plot with elevation steering and azimuth on boresight. The insolation between sectors is highly dependent on the beam direction. Although an “average” isolation can be given, this would mask the fact that for certain beam directions isolation is good and for others it is not good. Since the beam direction depends on the physical positions of users, advanced co-ordination of beam directions may not be possible if other constraints such as capacity and latency are to be optimized. Even with an optimization, the isolation would be less than 80dB.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.2-3: Inter-sector isolation (between two sectors) results from EM modelling.\nIt should also be considered that there are likely to be two interfering sectors, as well as potentially other co-located BS (for example, from other operators).\nBeam nulling\nThere may be some potential for beam nulling to mitigate interference between sectors. However, it is not sufficient to avoid that the power into the receiver drives the receiver into saturation for the wide area scenario.\nReceiver filtering\nAnalogue filtering in the receiver is not assumed for reasons described in section 9.2.1.2.2.\nOn digital IC aspect, in our view, since the information of non-linear product is already got in the digital domain, and it can be exchanged between sectors within a BBU, hence digital IC can be applied for this case.\nOn the achievable coupling loss in the case of co-site inter-sector gNB-gNB, RF measurements for the spatial isolation has been conducted. Figure 9.2.2.2.3-2 shows measurements results for two 120° sectors which is 2.5 m distance in horizontal. The curve represents the spatial isolation between a TX full power transmission of one sector to one receiver chain of the other sector. Form the measurements it can be found that the larger angle beam steering, the isolation becomes smaller. The isolation at worst case is ~76 dB. It is a test on legacy AAS BS. There are some methods can be adopted to improve the isolation for a BS capable of SBFD operation, e.g. mounting EM absorber materials next to the antenna array in the base station. ~10 dB improvement is foreseen based on our evaluations. For co-site inter-sector case better spatial isolation than RSI case is achievable.\nThe figure depicts a set of 2.3-1 measurements of the spatial isolation of a 5G network. The measurements are taken at the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE), with the aim of evaluating the performance of the network in terms of signal quality and interference. The figure illustrates the importance of spatial isolation in ensuring reliable communication, as it helps to prevent signal reflections and interference from other devices in the network.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.3-1: Spatial isolation measurements\n\nThe figure depicts the measurement results at different beam directions for a 5G network, illustrating the impact of beamforming techniques on signal quality.\nFigure 9.2.2.2.3-2: Measurements results at different beam directions\nThe co-site inter-sector interference analysis of values for FR1 Wide Area BS is provided in the summary table.\nSpatial isolation techniques\nThe spatial isolation mechanisms for co-site inter-sector case are in principle similar to the self-interference case. In addition, these aspects need to be considered:\n-\tElement-to-element isolation is easier to manage within a single antenna enclosure, where all parameters and physical dimensions can be controlled. Isolation between sectors occurs due to unwanted radiation towards the back of the antenna, which is more difficult to control. The geometry between the antennas of different sectors can be difficult to adjust precisely, meaning that the element coupling can be difficult to predict.\n-\tIt has been suggested that EM shielding material between sectors may be used. This is not possible in all installations but may possibly be an option in some installations. The effectiveness of the EM shielding has not been studied.\n-\tTransmit beam nulling across different sectors is theoretically possible, but the practical implementation may be too costly since it may be necessary to calculate the beamforming vector for each subcarrier.\nBased on the analysis on co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-subband interference provided in Section 9.2.2 for FR1 wide area BS, it can be observed that the implementation feasibility of controlling the co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-subband interference to meet the target (i.e., being less than certain level of receiver desensitization) depends on the implementation aspects including:\n-\tMaximum BS transmit power\n-\tNumber of co-site, co-channel sectors and the separation between them and other site constraints\n-\tThe achievable spatial isolation and use of absorbing material and choke structure depending on site constraints\n-\tBeam nulling/isolation capability\n-\tFrequency isolation at the TX and RX\n-\tThe digital interference suppression/cancellation capability.\nBased on the different assumptions and/or technique adoption for the above-mentioned implementations aspects, and based on 4 companies’ technical inputs, companies have come to the following conclusions:\n-\tthe implementations can achieve reasonable residual level for co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-subband interference, up to 1dB desensitization, according to 2 companies.\n-\tthe implementations are not able to achieve that because the receiver is saturated, and the RX processing is not feasible, based on co-site deployment limitation, existing technology and technology roadmaps that are viewed as viable in the current time or foreseeable future according to 2 companies.\nIt should be noted that gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI handling schemes provided in Section 8.3 have not yet been considered in concluding the implementation feasibility study for controlling the co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-subband interference.\n",

                            "text_content": "Table 9.3.1.1-1 summarizes the analysis from different companies on the FR1 MR base station. This section is based on the self-interference analysis framework.\nTable 9.3.1.1-1: Summary of FR1 medium range BS self-interference analysis\n\n\nTable 9.3.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a medium range base station with 36 dBm total output power. The RSIC capability corresponds to 110 to 120 dBc which is achieved using a combination of spatial isolation (60 dBc), Tx beam nulling (0-5 dB, only applicable in the Tx subband), frequency separation (45 dBc), and digital IC techniques (5-10 dBc). Under such considerations, the self-interference observed in the 20 MHz UL subband is dominated by transmitter ACLR and receiver selectivity with a magnitude of approximately -74 dBm prior to digital IC and up to -84 dBm after digital IC, while the noise floor is -91.0 dBm. This results in a non-negligible desensitization of the receiver which would degrade more or less the system performance depending on the deployment ISD, UL link budget, etc.\nThe assumptions and corresponding justification are presented below with focus on the main differences with respect to the wide-area analysis in Section 9.2.1.2.6.\nSpatial isolation\nThe same techniques to achieve spatial isolation in FR1 wide-area base stations can be applied to medium-range base stations as well. Nevertheless, the following differences should be noted:\n-\tMedium range BS have typically smaller form-factor than the wide-area BS, e.g. down to 30x30x10 cm. The absolute physical separation between Tx and Rx panels needs to be smaller than for wide-area BS to keep the relative increase of the BS enclosure to a reasonable level.\n-\tMedium range base stations may have a lower number of TRXs as compared to wide-area base stations. This could result in higher coupling per Rx chain.\nConsidering these two aspects, 60 dBc of spatial isolation is considered.\nTX Beam nulling / isolation in TX sub-band\nWith only a relatively low number of TRXs, the potential of Tx beam nulling techniques is reduced. Only 0-5 dBc is considered, under the assumption of at most 1 dB of EIRP loss.\nRF IC and other tech. (before LNA)\nIf the number of TRX is significantly lowered compared to massive MIMO, there is a possibility for RF IC to be feasible. However, this all depends on the implementation. With a low number of TRXs, the spatial isolation to a single RX port would likely be lower than for an implementation with a large number of TRXs – possibility necessitating RF cancellation paths to compensate. The overall SIC capability would be similar in both cases.\nFrequency isolation at RX\nThis all depends on the implementation.\nDigital IC\nIf the number of TRX is significantly lowered compared to massive MIMO, there is a possibility for digital IC to be feasible. However, this all depends on the implementation. Digital IC can be achieved by improving the DPD in the transmitter side to reduce the unwanted transmitter leakage components that fall in the UL subband, while receiver-side digital IC techniques are also required to supress the self-interference signal in gNB RX subband caused by non-ideal RX selectivity.\nFor the medium range BS, four implementation scenarios are presented in Table 9.3.1.1-1. In the first scenario, the RF is assumed to perform at the absolute minimum needed to meet the 3GPP requirements. In the second scenario, an improved RF performance that is still likely to be a reasonable commercial implementation is considered (called realistic). Two further scenarios are considered; one in which the receiver linearity is assumed to exceed the realistic scenario, which could lead to more significant compromises in power consumption, size etc. The other scenario is one in which realistic RF performance is assumed, but the transmitter is assumed to be 3dB lower than the maximum transmitter limit in power.\nIt can be observed that for a BS only built to meet 3GPP minimum requirements, the receiver performance is not sufficient to operate SBFD without significant desensitization. To operate SBFD, either receiver digital processing is needed with the realistic assumptions (the feasibility of achieving sufficient gain with such processing depends on the wider deployment scenario), or somewhat better receiver performance, or lower transmit power than the 3GPP maximum limit.\nAn explanation for the assumptions in the table are provided below.\nSpatial isolation and beam nulling\nFor a medium range size AAS array, simulations show a spatial isolation of around 65-70dB, depending on the beam direction. With beam nulling, the isolation can be lifted to around 80dB, with in general less than 1dB cost in the downlink.\nAnalogue interference cancellation\nWith a smaller array size, analogue interference cancelation may be more feasible for a MR BS than for a WA BS. However, the number of interconnections is still significant. Furthermore, analogue IC requires that the same beam steering is applied on all RBs and all carriers, preventing sub-band precoding and multi-carrier operation. Also, in general analogue IC is not needed to avoid receiver saturation. Analogue IC has not been taken into account.\nAnalogue filtering\nAnalogue filtering is not realistic in an implementation for the same reasons described for the WA BS in section 9.2.1.2.2. Furthermore, analogue filtering is not really needed as the input power level to the MR receiver is generally manageable.\nDigital interference cancellation and receiver processing\nDigital sampling of the TX leakage interference and subtraction at RX is more feasible for a MR BS than for a WA BS. An alternative to digital cancellation of TX leakage could be an improved PA linearization at the transmitter side. The possibility of either improved PA linearization or digital IC is captured as 15dB digital IC.\nAt the receiver, the interference co-variance matrix can be estimated and the receiver MMSE-IRC algorithm can mitigate interference. The extent to which the receiver can mitigate interference depends on the overall interference structure, which depends on the profile of interfering UEs, other sectors and other base stations as well as the fading channel profiles in the environment. The study has not considered the deployment environment when considering feasibility of self-interference suppression, and hence a specific number for the suppression by means of receiver processing is not provided. However, it is noted that for the MR to operate with the “realistic” receiver and the maximum allowed transmit power, several dB of suppression would need to be achieved by digital processing.\nTable 9.3.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a medium range base station.\nTable 9.3.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a medium range base station.\nTable 9.3.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a medium range base station.\nBased on the self-interference analysis provided in Section 9.3.1 for FR1 medium range BS, it can be observed that the implementation feasibility of controlling the residual interference to meet the 1dB receiver desensitization target depends on the implementation aspects, including:\n-\tMaximum BS transmit power\n-\tSpatial isolation capability\n-\tBeam nulling/ isolation capability\n-\tBlocker suppression at the RX\n-\tFrequency isolation at the TX and RX\n-\tThe digital interference suppression/ cancellation capabilities\nBased on the different assumptions and/ or techniques adopted for the above-mentioned implementation aspects, based on 5 companies’ technical inputs, companies have come to the following conclusions:\n-\tIt is feasible to achieve the 1 dB desensitization target according to 4 companies.\n-\tIt is not feasible to achieve the 1 dB desensitization target for a base station that strictly meets the RAN4 minimum requirements and/or operates with the maximum BS transmit power according to 2 companies.\n-\tNote: Among 5 companies, 1 company shows different feasibility results based on different assumptions.\n",

This section is based on the co-channel inter-subband co-site interference analysis framework.\nTable 9.3.2.1-1: Summary of FR1 medium range BS co-channel inter-subband co-site inter-sector interference analysis\n\nMedium range base stations are commonly deployed with omnidirectional antennas, but some deployments use directional antennas also with the target to boost coverage or capacity. In case of 3-sector site deployment with directional antennas, the techniques described in Section 9.2.2.2.4 apply here as well, although it is important to note that it may be more difficult to add large horizontal separation between sectors if the site footprint is small.\nIn a case a 3-sector site deployment are considered, our analysis is presented in table 9.3.2.1-1 above. We considered the same spatial isolation as considered in the urban macro cell case. As our input to the table shows, the total interference in RX subband is between -90 dBm and -70 dBm, which is already above the noise floor and would cause desensitization of the receiver. It is also important to note that this analysis does not consider the self-interference, so in reality the desensitization would be greater.\nTable 9.3.2.1-1 presents an analysis of the inter-sector interference effects for medium range FR1 BS. The table considers the “optimistic” receiver considered in section 9.3.2.1.2; i.e., a receiver that is more capable than in a current BS. If the “realistic” receiver would be considered, then the indicated desensitizations would be greater.\nThe level of inter-sector interference only varies depending on the beam direction from around 4dB to 22dB. The total desensitization would include self-interference and would be around 1dB greater. There may be some potential to increase inter-sector isolation using TX beam nulling (not shown in the table), however clearly mitigating inter-sector interference will be a challenge also for MR BS.\nInter-sector isolation\nIsolation between sectors has been simulated using electromagnetic simulations in [68] with an assumption of 400mm sector separation. The isolation varies to some degree with separation, but not to an extent that would change the overall results. For most practical site deployments, addition of materials between sectors is not likely to be feasible (and may reduce network performance).\nThe insolation between sectors is highly dependent on the beam direction. Although an “average” isolation can be given, this would mask the fact that for certain beam directions isolation is good and for others it is not good.\nBeam nulling\nThere may be some potential for beam nulling to mitigate interference between sectors. To achieve complete isolation between sectors, more than 20dB beam nulling would be needed.\nReceiver filtering\nAnalogue filtering in the receiver is not assumed for reasons described in section 9.3.2.1.2.\nFor FR1 medium range BS, it is not necessarily to require co-site multi-sector deployment while omni-directional antenna could also be the deployment option. And the co-site inter-sector interference is only present for the case where directional antennas are used.\nFor the case of 3-sector site deployment with directional antenna, Table 9.3.2.1-1 presents the company’s view on the co-site inter-sector interference analysis for a medium range base station. Similar to FR1 wide area BS counterpart, the achievable antenna isolation is key factor to analyze the co-site inter-sector co-channel gNB-gNB CLI. It has been demonstrated that even without analog subband filter implemented, the residual co-site inter-sector interference can be well controlled with proper implementation of spatial isolation, frequency isolation, beam nulling, and optional digital cancellation for FR1 medium range BS.\nSectorized deployments of medium range BS are by no means universal. Dependent on the deployment needs, single sector MR BS are often deployed at least in some locations. In case a three sector deployment is used, based on the co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-sub-band interference analysis in Section 9.3.2, it can be observed that the implementation feasibility of controlling the co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-subband interference to meet the target (i.e., being less than certain level of receiver desensitization) depends on the implementation aspects including:\n-\tNumber of co-site, co-channel sectors and the separation between them and other site constraints\n-\tThe achievable spatial isolation and use of absorbing material and choke structure depending on site constraints\n-\tBeam nulling/isolation capability\n-\tFrequency isolation at the TX and RX\n-\tThe digital interference suppression/cancellation capability.\nFor the case with multiple co-site sectors, based on the different assumptions and/or technique adoption for the above-mentioned implementations aspects, and based on 3 companies’ technical inputs:\n-\tThe total interference caused by two co-site sectors would be above the noise floor, causing a desensitization of the receiver, according to 2 companies.\n-\tThe residual co-site inter-sector interference can be controlled, causing reasonable residual self-interference, causing up to 1 dB desensitization of the receiver, according to 1 company.\nIt should be noted that gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI handling schemes provided in Section 8.3 have not yet been considered in concluding the implementation feasibility study for controlling the co-site inter-sector co-channel inter-subband interference.\n",

                            "text_content": "Table 9.4.1.1-1 summarizes the self-interference analysis results from companies.\n\nTable 9.4.1.1-1: SI feasibility study for FR1 Local Area BS\n\nThe self-interference suppression expectations for the LA BS class are provided in table 9.4.1.1-1. Two examples are provided. The first is an LA BS with RF performance just enough to meet 3GPP minimum requirements. The second is an LS BS with improved receiver performance, but still likely sufficient for a commercially viable solution.\nThe table suggests that, depending on variation in the achievable spatial isolation, some degree of improved receiver and/or digital cancellation may be needed for LA SBFD. However, in general self-interference suppression appears feasible.\nSpatial isolation and beam nulling\nThe spatial isolation for LA is more difficult to quantify, as the array size and form-factor for a LA BS may vary significantly. LA SBFD could even be operated by placing TX and RX LA base stations at some distance. 70dB isolation has been assumed, and obviously the conclusions may vary if a smaller isolation is achieved. Beam nulling is not assumed, since a small array size is assumed.\nAnalogue interference cancellation\nAnalogue interference cancellation is more feasible for a LA BS with a smaller array size. The drawback would be the need to beamform on the same way on all RB and all carriers for a LA BS. Potentially analogue IC could be considered if the isolation for a particular design would be substantially less than 70dB.\nAnalogue filtering\nAnalogue filtering is not really needed for a LA BS due to the lower power in the TX sub-bands.\nDigital interference cancellation and receiver processing\nDigital sampling of the TX leakage interference and subtraction at RX is feasible for a LA BS. An alternative to digital cancellation of TX leakage could be an improved PA linearization at the transmitter side. The possibility of either improved PA linearization or digital IC is captured as 15dB digital IC.\nReceiver combining could also potentially mitigate some interference although with a smaller array size, the degrees of freedom with which to do so would be lower than other BS classes.\nIn SI capability analysis, the following techniques are used,\n-\tCFR is used to improve equipment efficiency, DPD is used for high power equipment to optimize ACLR.\n-\tTx antennas panel and Rx antennas panel are separate, there are some isolation material between them, and cross polarization is also used.\n-\tDigital filter is used to resolve the adjacent sub-band (i.e. TX subband) interference issue.\n-\tDigital IC is used to reduce interference in the UL sub-bands.\nFrom the analysis in Table 9.4.1.1-1, the following capabilities are needed,\n-\tFrequency isolation capability of frequency isolation at TX is 45dB\n-\tSpatial isolation is 70dB\n-\tACS is 55dBc\n-\tIIP3 is -16dBm\n-\tDigital IC is 10dB\nThe above capabilities except frequency isolation are improved compared with legacy LA BS, but it’s feasible from implementation point of view.\nThe Nokia input in the Table 9.4.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a local area base station with 24 dBm total output power. The RSIC capability corresponds to 110 to 115 dBc for the Rx which is achieved using a combination of spatial isolation (60 dBc), frequency separation (45 dBc), and digital IC techniques (5-10 dBc). Under such considerations, the self-interference observed in the 20 MHz UL subband is dominated by transmitter ACLR and receiver selectivity with a combined magnitude of approximately -85 dBm prior to digital IC and -90 dBm to -95 dBm after digital IC, while the noise floor is -91.0 dBm. Even though there is a small desensitization of the receiver, it is feasible to operate the base station with acceptable performance as the coverage is not the primary target of local area deployments where the UL link budget and received UL power is generally very high.\nA detailed description of some of the key assumptions is provided below.\nSpatial isolation and beam nulling\nApproximately 60 dB of spatial isolation can be achieved for ceiling- or wall-mounted base stations with directive antenna radiation patterns although at the expense of larger form-factor to reach sufficient physical separation between Tx and Rx. For typical LA base stations with omni-directional antennas, the spatial isolation would be significantly lower, e.g., 30 dB or less, thus SBFD operation would be much more challenging or potentially unfeasible.\nTx beam nulling is not assumed due to relatively low number of TRXs.\nDigital Interference cancellation techniques\nSince the number of TRX is significantly lowered compared to mMIMO, there is a possibility for digital IC to be feasible. Digital IC can be achieved by improving the DPD in the transmitter side to reduce the unwanted transmitter leakage components that fall in the UL subband, while receiver-side digital IC techniques are also required to supress the self-interference signal in gNB RX subband caused by non-ideal RX selectivity.\nTable 9.4.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a local area base station.\nTable 9.4.1.1-1 presents the company’s view on the self-interference mitigation analysis for a local area base station.\nBased on the feasibility study on self-interference in Section 9.4.1.2 and the summary table provided in Section 9.4.1.1, it can be concluded that with the proper implementation of component techniques including spatial isolation, frequency isolation, beam nulling, digital IC or a combination of these, the SBFD residual self-interference for FR1 LA BS can be controlled to the level of 6dB below the noise floor, which results in 1dB sensitivity degradation.\n",

                            "text_content": "The self-interference analysis from companies’ inputs for FR2-1 SBFD-capable gNB are summarized in Table 9.5.1.1-1. Both self-interference leakage in gNB RX sub-band due to non-ideal TX and Self-Interference signal in gNB RX sub-band caused by non-ideal RX selectivity are studied in the analysis framework. The self-interference cancellation techniques including spatial isolation, frequency isolation, beam nulling and digital are considered.\nTable 9.5.1.1-1: self-interference analysis\n\nDifferent from FR1 counterpart, the difference of feasibility analysis on self-interference for FR2 BS will be provided here for different factors.\nSpatial Isolation by Antenna Design\nIt’s observed that similar and even better antenna isolation performance with the FR2-1 26 GHz testbed where panel separation can be exploited.\nFigure 9.5.1.2.1-1 shows the FR2-1 testbed using 2 Tx panels and 2 Rx panels. Like described in the case of the FR1 3.5 GHz testbed, the Tx panel and the Rx panel in the FR2-1 26 GHz testbed are separated by a separation distance. Additional Tx/Rx isolation performance is then enabled by using an RF barrier, e.g., an additional EM resonant between the panels. In the case of FR2-1 26 GHz, since each panel can perform more directive beam in analog domain than possible in FR1 using mMIMO panels, the FR2-1 antenna isolation performance is better than what is achievable in FR1.\n\nThe figure depicts a testbed setup for evaluating the performance of Frequency-Reentrant (FR2) modulation in a 5G network. The testbed includes a 5G base station (gNB), a set of 5G user equipment (UE), and a set of 5G scatterers. The figure illustrates the impact of varying the operating frequency on the signal quality, with different levels of signal strength and interference. The testbed is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and evaluate the performance of FR2 modulation in a 5G network.\nFigure 9.5.1.2.1-1: FR2-1 testbed and SIC performance when varying the operating frequency\nSimilar as FR1, an important design consideration for increased spatial isolation provided by the RF barrier is whether such stopband performance is stable over a wide enough frequency range. Our FR2-1 26 GHz testbeds have achieved isolation performance that show almost uniform antenna/ panel isolation performance with respect to frequency for 100 MHz CC BW in 26 GHz. Figure 9.5.1.2.1-1 shows measurement results from the FR2-1 testbed with respect to achievable antenna isolation as a function of the operating frequency.\nAccording to the applied mechanisms and measurement results, the achievable level for TX and RX spatial isolation without impact on radiation pattern based on compact antenna size is around 87dB for FR2.\nFrequency isolation at TX\nIn the case of FR2-1, frequency-domain isolation for SBFD is of particular importance. Non-linear characteristics of mmWave PAs are worse than those of FR1 mid-band PAs. RAN4 ACLR requirements are more relaxed in FR2-1 when compared to FR1. This is due to beamforming providing isolation in FR2-1, implying that the probability of a blocker coming from the same direction is much lower than in FR1. Another consideration is that in FR1, the difference between the out-of-channel requirements like the ACLR and in-channel requirements like EVM is large. The PA linearity requirement is therefore dominated by out-of-channel emission requirements, e.g., ACLR. In FR2-1, these are at comparable levels. Spectral regrowth due to IM3 is dominant for in-channel requirements and as such, PA linearity requirements are rather driven by EVM and possibly in-band emissions. Another design challenge for DPD in FR2-1 is that PA characteristics must be carried through a feedback link from the output of the PA. In the case of mmWave, it is more difficult than in FR1 to create such a feedback link due to signal attenuation. Therefore, it is significantly more challenging to exploit DPD in FR2-1 such as done for FR1.\nDespite these design challenges for gNB-side SBFD operation, our FR2-1 26 GHz testbed measurement results in Figure 9.5.1.2.1-2 show that 28 dBc leakage ratio between DL and UL subband (or component carriers) are still possible, e.g., similar to ACLR as existing out-of-channel requirement for FR2-1.\nThe figure depicts a testbed setup for the FR2-1 system, which includes a 5G network, a 4G network, and a 3G network. The testbed is designed to simulate the real-world scenario of signal propagation in a 5G network, with antennas isolated and filtered to ensure the performance of the system. The figure also includes a PSD (Power Spectral Density) plot for the DL (Downlink) and UL (Uplink) subbands, which shows the power distribution of the signals in the different frequency bands.\nFigure 9.5.1.2.1-2: FR2-1 testbed and PSD for SBFD DL and UL subbands after antenna isolation and filtering\nFrequency isolation at RX and RF SIC\nConsidering the input power at LNA for FR2 BS could be much less than FR1 WA BS, because of the better spatial isolation and lower BS output power, there is no necessity to have subband filtering to improve the linearity of LNA.\nDigital IC\nSimilar as FR1, the digital SIC performance is helped when synchronization is achieved between Tx and Rx to accurately remove the Tx signal from the Rx signal can be obtained. As described in our analysis for FR1 WA BS, two methods exist to estimate the interference channel. One approach is to store information on a Tx signal that has passed through the PA with a feedback link and then estimate the interference channel over-the-air to remove the interference from the Rx signal. Another approach is to use only over-the-air estimation. Without a feedback link, the whole combined channel can still be estimated through the Rx panel. We used the second approach in the FR2-1 26 GHz testbed.\nAs shown in the 9.5.1.1, it can be found that the blocking level to RX panel is weak and should be even lower at each LNA input. Hence the IM3 is not a limited factor. Due to the same reason that the blocking level is relatively weak, the other RX impacts due to blocker in Tx sub-band can also be negligible. Hence, we think that the evaluation on Self-Interference leakage in gNB RX subband would be sufficient for FR2-1.\nIn the following, we discuss in detail the knobs for FR2 gNB transceiver that enable the mitigation of both component of self-interference, namely direct leakage and clutter reflections.\nAntenna techniques and spatial isolation\nSimilar to FR1, FR2 gNB Radio unit architecture with two physically separated panels for simultaneous transmission and reception enable large spatial isolation. To highlight this more, RF measurements for the Tx-Rx spatial has been conducted at 28 GHz frequency with two separate panels. The Tx and Rx measurement setup of the full duplex antenna array is shown in Figure 9.5.1.2.3-1. This measurement setup is on top of the building roof with antenna pointing to the sky, in which case could be without clutter impact or with negligible clutter impact. In this setup, the Tx and Rx beam sweeping is synchronized which is the worst-case scenario - without including clutter. The measurement results, presented in Figure 9.5.1.2.3-2, show at least 80-90 dB spatial isolation can be achieved between the two Tx and Rx panels. If the antenna array center-to-center distance is 65 cm, the spatial isolation could be achieved at -86.9 dB or better.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for Tx-Rx spatial isolation of the full duplex antenna array at 28 GHz. It shows a 5x5 array with 2x2 MIMO configuration, with each antenna having a 28 GHz frequency and a 20 dB gain. The setup includes a 2x2 MIMO array with 2x2 MIMO configuration, with each antenna having a 28 GHz frequency and a 20 dB gain. The setup includes a 2x2 MIMO array with 2x2 MIMO configuration, with each antenna having a 28 GHz frequency and a 20 dB gain.\nFigure 9.5.1.2.3-1: Measurement setup for Tx-Rx spatial isolation of the full duplex antenna array at 28 GHz\nFigure 9.5.1.2.3-2: RF measurements of Tx-Rx spatial isolation between two subarrays for FR2\nBeam isolation and beamforming/nulling\nIn FR2, spatially isolated and narrow Tx and Rx beam could be selected to provide extra ‘beam’ isolation, which is a combined factor with the antenna isolation. For direct leaked self-interference, it is less related to the beam direction although there is still some dependency. However, for clutter, the signal transmitted from the Tx panel goes through the wireless medium, scattered by the reflectors and then gets back to the Rx panel, which generally has longer delay compared with direct leaked self-interference. The clutter is direction specific, in which case proper selection of Tx and Rx beam pair can alleviate such clutter impact. For FR2, clutter measurements have been conducted for a typical conference room. The measurement setup and results are shown in Figure 9.5.1.2.3-3. In the measurement setup, the Tx and Rx beam sweeping is synchronized, which is the worst-case scenario.\nThe figure depicts clutter measurements for FR2 indoor deployments, illustrating the impact of various factors such as room size, furniture, and other objects on the signal quality. The measurements are crucial for understanding the performance of indoor wireless networks and optimizing the design of the network infrastructure.\nFigure 9.5.1.2.3-3: Clutter measurements for FR2 indoor deployments\nDigital self-interference mitigation\nIn FR2, non-linear interference cancellation (NLIC) measurements have been conducted at 60 GHz for a typical conference room setup. For FR2, the measurement results are shown in for both low MCS and high MCS showing that NLIC could provide ~10 dB improvement on SNR performance.\nAn overview of the self-interference mitigation potential for FR2-1 (28GHz) for three output power levels can be found in Table 9.5.1.1-1. It can be seen that mitigation of self-interference with less than 1dB receiver desensitization appears feasible for 30dBm. With 35dBm, the desensitization is around 1.5dB from self-interference. There may be some potential to further refine the performance. For 40dBm output power, mitigation of self-interference becomes significantly more challenging.\nTX – RX isolation\nA number of techniques exist to improve the TX-RX panel isolation including chokes, absorption, mushroom EBG etc. A detailed electromagnetic simulation of these techniques is presented in [50], which demonstrates that the isolation between a TX panel and RX sub-array is around 80dB. Unlike for FR1, the self-isolation does not seem to vary significantly with beam direction. Figure 9.5.1.2.4-1 shows EM simulation results and a visualization of the EM isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5.1.2.4-1: EM simulation results for FR2 self-isolaiton (top) co-polarized (middle) cross polarized elements (bottom) visualization of the EM propagation\nTX beam nulling\nThe transmit panel has a large number of transmit elements and hence a high number of degrees of freedom to perform beamforming. Beam Nulling can be used in the transmit panel to reduce the power at the receive panel. It is not clear that beam nulling has the same impact on both the transmitted signal and the transmitter leakage, however for simplicity this has been assumed.\nInterference cancellation\nAnalogue and digital interference cancellation have not been considered due to the complexity and losses of building interconnectors for FR2, the high bandwidth and large amount of digital processing required.\nDigital processing\nDigital RX combining taking into account interference convariance have the potential to mitigate interference in the receiver. The gains from digital combining depend on the BS environment considering other interference sources such as other sectors, gNB and UEs.\nPhase noise reciprocal mixing\nReciprocal mixing of phase noise causes a more significant amount of noise in the receiver in FR2-1 compared to FR1. However, the analysis suggests that also for FR2-1, reciprocal mixing of phase noise will not cause a significant degradation.\nNokia’s views on the self-interference analysis for FR2-1 base stations are presented in Table 9.5.1.1-1. Our analysis shows that considering an BS TX power equal to 37 dBm, it is not possible to achieve the required residual self-interference. In our analysis, the required RSIC budget is 130 dBc, while the overall RSIC capability is 119 dB, which would result in a residual self-interference that would cause more than 1 dB desensitization of the receiver. Below, we discuss the key aspects considered in this analysis.\nSpatial isolation and Tx Beam nulling\nFor the achievable spatial isolation, we find that 80 dB may be a reasonable assumption considering the increased isolation from using higher frequencies and narrow Tx and Rx analog beams. Similar as discussed in our FR1 analysis in clause 9.2.1.2.6, separate Tx and Rx panels with EM shielding structures between the arrays are assumed, which in turn leads to an increase in antenna size and weight if baseline system performance needs to be maintained.\nIn FR2-1, TX beam nulling can be used to reduce self-interference, at least in the TX subband. It can be used with digital and analog beamforming. Our simulations show that in the latter case, beam nulling works well as illustrated in Figure 9.5.1.2.5-1 where at most 10 dB of additional isolation is obtained over a relatively large frequency range (500 MHz). However, in case multiple Tx panels are used for MU-MIMO or higher-rank transmissions, the gains of beam nulling are reduced since analog beamforming does not allow the use of beam nulling to suppress interference from more than one TX panel.\nThe figure depicts the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of isolation between each Tx beam towards the worst-affected Rx port. The Tx beams are generated within ±45° azimuth and elevation angles, indicating the spatial distribution of the Tx beams and their impact on the isolation between the Rx ports.\nFigure 9.5.1.2.5-1: Empirical CDF of isolation between each Tx beam towards worst-affected Rx port. Tx beams are generated within ±45° azimuth and elevation angles.\nWe assume 0 dB for RX beam nulling; as the SBFD feature is about enhancing uplink performance, we do not think the UL beamforming can be compromised further than the loss of channel reciprocity (due to separate TX and RX arrays) brings.\nDigital IC\nWe consider ~5dBc possibility for digital IC with maximum ratio combining of RX. Self-interference cancellation might be achieved since the direction of wanted signal and interference signal are not the same.\nBased on the provided studies in clause 9.5.1.1, it can be concluded that it is feasible to meet the 1 dB desensitization target considering self-interference suppression for FR2-1 BS with TX output power levels up to around 33dBm.\n",

Both self-interference leakage in gNB RX subband due to non-ideal TX and Self-Interference signal in gNB RX subband caused by non-ideal RX selectivity are studied in the analysis framework. The interference cancellation techniques including spatial isolation, frequency isolation, beam nulling and digital/RF cancellation are considered in the analysis framework.\nTable 9.5.2.1-1: Co-channel inter-sub-band co-site inter-sector interference analysis\n\nDifferent from the self-interference, the digital IC is not of necessity for the co-channel interference from co-site inter-sector BS. Furthermore, the isolation achieved by TX and RX beamforming nulling will be larger due to the different beamforming directions from different sectors.\nFor FR2 inter-sector isolation, some measurements based on existing modules are proceed as below. The AAS mounting in the same mast would be worse cases for radiated isolation. The following two cases are the typical site deployments for the worse cases. The left one (Case 1) is up-down installation and the right one (case 2) is 120° installation.\nThe figure depicts measurements of inter-sector isolation in a 5G network, showing how signals are separated based on their path and the presence of other sectors.

Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights beamforming techniques to mitigate interference.\nFigure 9.5.2.2.2-1: Measurements of inter-sector isolation\nFor each case, 60*60=3600 beam combinations are measured. The results are shown in Table 9.5.2.2.2-1 for existing modules and Table 9.5.2.2.2-2 for improved modules. Some surface wave suppression measures can be used to improve the isolation, e.g. reflection and absorption structure. Using these measures, more than 10 dB improvement can be achieved for the case with poor isolation. As shown in in the measurements, 100 dB inter-sector isolation is achieveable for FR2\nTable 9.5.2.2.2-1: Inter-sector isolation for existing modules\n\nTable 9.5.2.2.2-2: Inter-sector isolation for improved modules\n\nAn analysis of the inter-sector interference effects for FR2-1 BS can be found in Table 9.5.2.1-1. The analysis suggests that inter-sector interference can lead to substantial degradations. Apart from with the most optimal beam directions settings and 30dBm TRP, degradations due to inter-sector interference are substantial. Although TX beam nulling may be considered to reduce inter-sector interference, in excess of 30dB-60dB suppression (depending on output power) would be needed to mitigate interference for all beam directions.\nFor 30dBm TRP, RX processing or improvements in the TX interference suppression may improve the inter-sector performance. However, the degradation will not be reduced to well below 1dB (taking into account also degradation from self-interference will occur) for all beam directions.\nThus co-sectorization is likely to pose technical challenges for SBFD deployments in FR2.\nInter-sector isolation\nIsolation between sectors has been simulated using electromagnetic simulations in [68] with an assumption of 400mm sector separation. The isolation varies to some degree with separation, but not to an extent that would change the overall results. For most practical site deployments, addition of materials between sectors is not likely to be feasible (and may reduce network performance). Figure 9.5.2.2.3-1 depicts the EM simulation setup.\nFigure 9.5.2.2.3-1: Simulation setup for FR2 multi-sector EM modelling\nFigure 9.5.2.2.3-2 depicts the achievable isolation. The left hand plot shows the isolation with azimuth steering and elevation in boresight and the right hand plot with elevation steering and azimuth on boresight. The insolation between sectors is highly dependent on the beam direction. Although an “average” isolation can be given, this would mask the fact that for certain beam directions isolation is good and for others it is not good. Since the beam direction depends on the physical positions of users, advanced co-ordination of beam directions may not be possible if other constraints such as capacity and latency are to be optimized.\nFigure 9.5.2.2.3-2: FR2 antenna with 400 mm edge to edge coupling magnitude\nBeam nulling\nThere may be some potential for beam nulling to mitigate interference between sectors. To achieve complete isolation between sectors, more than 30dB beam nulling would be needed.\nBased on the provided studies in clause 9.5.2.1, two companies conclude that it is feasible to supress inter-sector interference to a level that it meets 1 dB desensitization target, whereas one company concludes that it is not feasible for a proportion of beam directions. The difference between the conclusions is mainly due to differences in assumption on whether it is possible to build isolation materials within sites and whether sufficient beam nulling is possible in all directions.\n",

                            "text_content": "In the objective of this study item, half duplex operation at UE side is assumed. In this part of feasibility of UE aspects, FR1 is considered.\nIn the UE feasibility study in FR1, the co-channel inter-subband UE-UE CLI model and adjacent channel UE-UE CLI model are mainly discussed. Co-channel/adjacent channel interference models at the UE side are summarized in Table 9.6.1.1-1. For co-channel interference models, the UE IBE requirement can be used for the interference modelling at Tx side; for receiver in-channel adjacent subband selectivity performance, no rejection/attenuation due to RF/BB filtering is assumed and the selectivity and performance of the FFT is included in the study. For adjacent channel models, UE ACLR and adjacent channel selectivity requirements can be used for the interference modeling at Tx and Rx side, respectively.\nTable 9.6.1.1-1. Existing UE interference models based on RF requirements in RAN4\n\nThe objectives of UE-UE co-channel inter sub-band CLI modeling is to analyze the impact of interference that occurs between two UEs in close proximity, operating on adjacent sub-bands within the same channel. This interference occurs when UL transmission of an aggressor UE in the channel interferes with the DL reception of a victim UE in the same channel.\nFor this SI RAN4 has decided to use typical UE parameters in the analysis, as different from worst-case parameters that are commonly used to define minimum performance requirements.  The evaluation of gNB performance improvements is underway in RAN1, taking into account a population of typical UEs rather than worst-case UEs.\nIn-channel adjacent subband selectivity is a measure of a receiver’s ability to receive an NR signal on its assigned downlink subband in the presence of an interference power on the adjacent uplink subband. The value of in-channel adjacent subband selectivity is the ratio of the receiver attenuation on the assigned downlink subband to the receiver attenuation on the adjacent uplink subband. In an ideal scenario, the UL transmission of the aggressor UE should not impact the DL reception of the victim UE due to the OFDM wave orthogonality. However, non-ideal FFT suppression can cause interference to the victim UE, particularly when the UL sub-band has frequency errors and is not perfectly time-synchronized with the DL sub-band. The analysis indicates that the IBE interference could be more significant than the in-channel adjacent subband selectivity, and frequency and time offset are not significant factors influencing UE-UE interference. It is worth noting that the RF degradations can cause inter-subband interference as well and the impact will depend on the targeted Rx IM and EVM performance. The measurement data submitted by one company shows the achievable in-channel adjacent subband selectivity of FR1 UE can be 33 dB. Nonetheless, the typical interference will normally not be any worse than this value. For this reason, the 33 dB was agreed for modeling the in-channel adjacent subband selectivity.\nFor legacy UE, no sub-band filtering is considered.\nTo model the NF for co-channel CLI in a system level simulation, a fixed value noise figure of 9 dB is used. AGC is not modeled if a fixed NF model is used.\nApart from the in-channel adjacent subband selectivity, it is important to mention that degradation can also be caused by transmitter leakage from the UL sub-band into the DL sub-band. For co-channel cases, the leakage was agreed to be modelled based on IBE based model with details provided in clause 9.6.1.2.2.\nIn-Band Emissions\nFor UE co-channel Tx model, RAN4 has decided to use the IBE minimum requirements from 38.101-1 clause 6.4.2.3 as shown in Table 9.6.1.2.2-1 in the feasibility study. This IBE-based model consists of three parts: General, IQ image, and Carrier leakage. In the system level simulation, the general and IQ image parts shall be considered, while the carrier leakage part can be ignored. For DUD configuration, the IQ image from the uplink is fully contained in the UL sub-band and does not land in the DL subband, thus the IQ image can also be ignored in the simulation. The granularity of this model is 1RB and it is not pursued to simplify this model to a frequency flat model. It is understood that these requirements are minimum performance requirements as opposed to typical requirements. RAN4 has agreed to use typical requirements for the UE parameters. Since typical values for the UE parameters were not determined, the formulation from the current specification is being used.\nTable 9.6.1.2.2-1: Requirements for in-band emissions in TS 38.101-1\n\nIt should also be assumed the LO location is in the center of the channel for the purposes of system studies in RAN4. The LO location is important as it allows placement of the image.\nFor UE co-channel Rx model, currently there is no corresponding RF requirement for this model. In the feasibility of UE co-channel Rx model, the definition of in-channel adjacent subband selectivity is introduced for SBFD feasibility study purpose:\n-\tIn-channel adjacent subband selectivity is a measure of a receiver’s ability to receive an NR signal on its assigned downlink subband in the presence of an interference power on the adjacent uplink subband. The value of in-channel adjacent subband selectivity is the ratio of the receiver attenuation on the assigned downlink subband to the receiver attenuation on the adjacent uplink subband.\nFor legacy UE, no sub-band filtering is assumed in the feasibility study, and accordingly no rejection/attenuation due to RF/BB filtering is assumed and only the selectivity performance of the FFT operation is studied. 33 dB was agreed for FR1 in RAN4 for in-channel adjacent subband selectivity considering FFT operation.\nThermal self-noise performance\nRAN4 decided on using a simplified fixed-value noise figure model for the UE receiver. Generally, the receiver noise figure will vary with the input power level, however the single value noise figure model was regarded to be sufficient for the purpose of system studies for SBFD operation. RAN4 decided on a noise figure value of 9 dB for FR1 UE.\nEffect of jammer – non-thermal self-noise aspect\nThere are a few factors to consider in determining the in- channel subband interference in the presence of a co-channel jammer. With an in-channel adjacent-subband interferer the 3rd order distortion, reciprocal mixing, residual sideband, quantization noise, phase noise, ADC distortion, and analog filtering should be considered.\nIn RAN4 study, measurements were made of a UE receiver for various signal levels, interferer levels, interferer offsets, sub-band bandwidths, and interferer bandwidths. The measurements have included the impact of the entire receiver, which includes everything through the FFT operation, in which 120 various conditions were measured.\nFFT leakage and selectivity\nIn the SBFD system an aggressor UE (UE2) operating in the UL sub-band may interfere with a UE (UE1) receiving in the adjacent DL sub-band. The UL signal from UE2 may arrive at UE1 misaligned in time or frequency, which can potentially cause UE1 DL SINR degradation in the FFT operation.\nThe simulation involved the conversion of the OFDM waveform to a spectrum by using FFT, along with the introduction of timing and frequency errors. A 5 RB guard band was assumed. The analysis revealed that time-misalignment was the main cause of the spectral leakage, and even minor timing errors resulted in leakage.\nIt appears reasonable to consider the leakage as a single average value, and the data shows about 33 dB down from the jammer level would be appropriate. The leakage effect should be taken into consideration and compared to the interference caused by the aggressor IBE.  It has been observed that the interference in the victim sub-band can be modelled as 33 dB below the input jammer power level, and the interference is approximately frequency flat across the victim subband.\nThe figure depicts a 5G signal path with various components such as base stations (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. It highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of redundant paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design of the optical backbone aligns with SDN principles, providing redundancy and failover capabilities.\nFigure 9.6.1.2.3-1: FFT leakage with time and frequency misaligned blocker (5 RB guard band)\nThe UE-UE adjacent channel CLI occurs when the UL transmission of the aggressor UE in a channel interferes with the DL reception of the victim UE in an adjacent channel. Unlike the case of co-channel interference, there is no need to consider any FFT selectivity in the adjacent channel scenario. Apart from the selectivity, it is necessary to account for the leakage from the UL sub-band into the DL sub-band caused by the transmitter. It was decided to assume the power-dependent ACLR of the aggressor UE and selectivity of the victim UE when modeling adjacent channel interference.\nTo model the NF for adjacent channel CLI in a system-level simulation, a fixed value noise figure of 9dB is used. The effect of AGC is not modeled when a fixed noise figure model is used. Additionally, UE ACLR should be modeled as 30 dB at max power, improving 1 dB/dB with back-off up to a maximum of 10 dB of improvement. Therefore, when the back-off is 10 dB, the ACLR is 40 dB. When the victim and aggressor UEs are close, between 1 and 50m, and close to the cell edge, with low desired signal level, and potentially high interference level, it cannot be guaranteed that the UE receiver will operate in the linear region.\nUE adjacent channel leakage ratio is used in the feasibility study for adjacent channel UE-UE CLI Tx model. Only ACLR in 1st adjacent channel was considered in the study item and ACLR in 2nd adjacent channel was precluded. In the UE Tx model, only power class 3 was assumed.  UE ACLR is modelled as 30 dB at max power that improves 1dB/dB with backoff up to a maximum 10 dB of improvement. This means at 10 dB backoff the ACLR is 40 dB. Partially allocated UL subband was not considered in the system simulation. This ACLR model can be seen as frequency flat model, and the distortion is modelled as a flat power spectral density across the frequency range of the distortion.\nUE adjacent channel selectivity (33dB for FR1) is used as adjacent channel UE-UE CLI model under the assumption that the blocker from adjacent channel does not exceed the maximum input level (-25 dBm) for UE. If the blocker is higher than -25dBm, it is assumed that it will result large receiver degradation and hence the RX will not correctly decode the data (100% packet loss).\n",

                            "text_content": "Existing co-channel UE RX performance requirements\nFor legacy UEs, the current UE RF architecture can be assumed without any RF architecture modification. Currently there are no RF requirements for UE co-channel Rx performance.\nSub-band filtering and legacy UEs\nFor legacy UEs, no sub-band filtering is implemented, and therefore RAN4 has not assumed any subband filtering.\nThermal self-noise aspects (both adjacent channel and co-channel)\nRAN4 decided on a simple fixed-value noise figure model for the UE receiver. Generally, the receiver noise figure will vary with the input power level, however the single value noise figure model was considered sufficient for the purpose of system studies for SBFD, therefore AGC effect on self-noise is not modelled. RAN4 decided on a NF of 10dB.\nSubband in-channel selectivity\nIt is worth noting that the RF degradations can cause inter-subband interference. An analysis of the FR2-1 receiver’s design was conducted. Various factors, such as residual sideband, reciprocal mixing, integrated phase noise, IM3 distortion, and ADC distortions, were considered. The effect of all these distortions is lumped into a single parameter referred to as selectivity. Based on the discussion and analysis from the meeting, contributions suggested possible the sub-band selectivity values from 20 dB to 34 dB. The receiver performance is simply modelled as being 23 dB below the jammer power level. The definition of Subband in-channel selectivity is introduced for clarity in the SBFD feasibility study\n-\tIn-channel adjacent subband selectivity is a measure of a receiver’s ability to receive an NR signal on its assigned downlink subband in the presence of an interference power on the adjacent uplink subband. The value of in-channel adjacent subband selectivity is the ratio of the receiver attenuation on the assigned downlink subband to the receiver attenuation on the adjacent uplink subband.\nFFT leakage and selectivity\nIn an ideal scenario, the UL transmission of the aggressor UE should not impact the DL reception of the victim UE due to the OFDM wave orthogonality. However, non-ideal FFT suppression can cause interference to the victim UE, particularly when the UL sub-band has frequency errors and is not time-synchronized with the DL sub-band. The analysis indicates that the IBE interference is higher and dominates the sub-band co-channel selectivity, and frequency and time offset are not significant factors influencing UE-UE interference. It is worth noting that the RF degradation can cause inter-subband interference as well and the impact will depend on the targeted Rx IM and EVM performance. Nonetheless, this interference will not be any worse than the selectivity value. For this reason, the 23 dB was agreed upon for modeling the inter-sub-band selectivity.\nInband emissions (co-channel)\nRAN4 has decided to use the IBE requirements from TS 38.101-2 clause 6.4.2.3.4 (power class 3 UE). It is understood these requirements are minimum performance requirements as opposed to typical requirements. RAN4 has agreed to use typical requirements for the UE parameters, however, no final conclusion has been made regarding typical values. Consequently, the formulation from the current specification is being utilized.\nIt should also be assumed the LO location is in the center of the channel for the purposes of system studies in RAN4. The LO location is important as it allows placement of the image.\nAnalysis indicates that the IBE interference is higher and dominates the sub-band in-channel selectivity,\nApart from the selectivity, the degradation can be caused by transmitter leakage from the UL sub-band into the DL sub-band. For co-channel case, the leakage was agreed to be modelled using IBE based model. Additionally, the IQ image contribution for the IBE model for co-channel CLI can be ignored for the DUD configuration.\nFor UE co-channel Tx model, UE IBE in TS 38.101-2 can be used in the feasibility study as shown in Table 9.7.1.1.2-1. This model consists of three parts, General, IQ image, Carrier leakage. In the system level simulation, the general and IQ image parts shall be considered, while the carrier leakage part can be ignored in the feasibility study. For DUD configuration, the IQ image from the uplink is fully contained in the UL sub-band and does not land in the DL subband, thus the IQ image can also be ignored in the simulation.\nTable 9.7.1.1.2-1: Requirements for in-band emissions in TS 38.101-2 (For Power class 3)\n\nEffect of adjacent channel aggressor UE jammer\nAn analysis of the FR2-1 receiver’s design was conducted. Various factors, such as residual sideband, reciprocal mixing, integrated phase noise, IM3 distortion, and ADC distortions, were considered. The receiver’s performance is simply represented as 34 dB lower than the jammer power level.\nACLR (adjacent channel)\nACLR is one aspect modelled as an interference aspect from a nearby aggressor UE transmitting in an adjacent UL subband. When the victim and aggressor UEs are close, between 1 and 50m, and close to the cell edge, with low desired signal level, and high interference level, it might be the case that the victim UE will not always operate in the linear region, resulting in dominance of the ACLR from the aggressor UE. UE ACLR is modeled as 24 dB at max power, improving 1 dB/dB with backoff up to a maximum of 10 dB of improvement. Therefore, when the backoff is 10 dB, the ACLR is 34 dB. This model is an approximation of the performance of a typical UE.\n",

And this file summarizes the results with the following format:\n-\tFor scenario [num], Case [num], Victim [link type], [assumption 1, 2, 3…], [num] companies show simulation results:\n-\tAverage and 5th percentile (at cell-edge) SINR/throughput degradation.\n-\tFor ACIR is [Relative ACIR / +2 / +4 / +6 / +8 dB], throughput loss is in the range [lowest loss, highest loss], and Median is [median loss]. Besides, [num] companies provides N/A.\n-\tResults with four optional assumptions: BS antenna configuration, BS Tx power level, grid shift, and noise figure enhancement.\n-\tThe excel document “Summary of all simulation results” provides the summary results for all 8 scenarios and 4 cases defined in Table 11.1-1 and Table 11.1-2. And this file summarizes the results with the following format:\n-\tOne sheet covers one scenario with all 4 cases, and in each sheet the table is shown as below:\n\n-\tThe excel document “Collection of simulation results from all companies” provides the break-down of detailed results for all 8 scenarios and 4 cases defined in Table 11.1-1 and Table 11.1-2.\nAdditionally, the simulation results carried out for the co-existence cases/scenarios are provided for the baseline ACIR as well as enhanced ACIR. The former (i.e., baseline ACIR, termed Relative ACIR in the simulation compilation file) is equivalent to the ACIR when considering the baseline ACLR and ACS as provided in Annex E, following the below formulation with all parameters in linear scale:\n\n\nThe baseline ACIR is derived from the ACLR and ACS values listed in Annex E, in Tables E.2.3-1, E.2.3-2, and E.2.4-1. On the other hand, the enhanced ACIR that RAN4 has considered in the coexistence study represents the case where the baseline ACIR is enhanced with x dB, ranging from 2dB till 8dB, while some numbers can’t be met because ACIR enhancement can be limited by the ACLR/ACS of the legacy TDD network or UE operating in the adjacent channel as highlighted below for the different cases:\n-\tCase 1 (Legacy UE as a victim and SBFD network as an aggressor): ACIR enhancements can be done. Legacy UE ACS is assumed to be fixed (33 dB in FR1 and 23 dB in FR2-1). However, the BS-to-UE ACIR enhancement cannot exceed 0.3 dB in FR1 and 1.2 dB in FR2-1 based on the limitation of the UE ACS simulation assumption.\n-\tCase 2 (Legacy BS as a victim and SBFD network as aggressor): ACIR enhancements can be done. Legacy BS ACS is assumed to be fixed (50 dB in FR1 and 24 dB in FR2-1). However, the BS-to-BS ACIR enhancement cannot exceed 6.2 dB in FR1 and 1.5 dB in FR2-1 based on the limitation of the legacy BS ACS simulation assumption.\n-\tCase 3 (SBFD-capable BS as a victim and legacy BS as aggressor): ACIR enhancements can be done. Legacy BS ACLR is assumed to be fixed (50 dB in FR1 and 24 dB in FR2-1). However, the BS-to-BS ACIR enhancement cannot exceed 1.2 dB in FR1 and 5.5 dB in FR2-1 based on the limitation of the legacy BS ACLR simulation assumption.\n-\tCase 4 (SBFD-aware UE as a victim and legacy UE as aggressor): ACIR enhancements can be done. Legacy TDD UE ACLR is assumed to be fixed (30 dB in FR1 and 24 dB in FR2-1). However, the UE-to-BS ACIR enhancement is 0 dB in FR1 and cannot exceed 3.0 dB in FR2-1 based on the limitation of the legacy UE ACS.\nFurthermore, the above mentioned ACIR enhancement limitations were only derived from the simulation assumptions of legacy TDD BS and UE devices adopted in RAN4 co-existence study, which limitations can be further studied for new frequency bands or band-specific assumptions. It is possible to have the ACIR enhancement to exceed those limitations under certain conditions, if we consider the SBFD deployment in certain frequency bands where the TDD legacy network devices have better performance.\nIt should be noted that the “baseline assumptions” mentioned Section 11 are defined in Annex E.\n",

The evolution of NR duplex operation would bring changes to the frame structures of legacy TDD operation and consequently may affect the outcomes of the coexistence studies and, consequently, the regulated license conditions.\nTo address the cross-border issue and facilitate coordination, the Electronics Communications Committee (ECC) recommended the usage of two frame structures in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz frequency band [52]. Additionally, a technique for cross-border interference mitigation was studied in [53] based on DL symbol blanking on overlapping UL/DL resources between two geographically adjacent networks.\nHowever, enabling operation with various TDD patterns and removing the need of synchronized networks, CEPT has specified additional baselines for unsynchronized or semi-unsynchronized networks. Nevertheless, those baselines are more stringent, making the BS design more challenging, impacting final cost and possibly product’s volume and weight. As an example, for the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band, inside the band, ECC specified below and above the block edge a restricted baseline of -34 dBm/5MHz EIRP for non AAS BS or -43 dBm/MHz TRP for AAS BS [54] operators, the situation may be reported to the competent authority for resolution.\n",

Unsynchronized operation is allowed, more stringent regulation parameters have not been specified for such case but, again, operators would have to work their differences to avoid any claim to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED). FCC requires 3450 – 3550 MHz service (AMBIT band) licensees to negotiate with 3550 – 3700 MHz (CBRS band) licensees to enable TDD synchronization across these services [55]-[56]. Notice that the term TDD synchronization refers to aligning TDD uplink and downlink slots. FCC recognizes the potential for harmful interference from a high-power AMBIT band downlink transmission to a CBRS band uplink. Licensees in the 3700 – 3980 MHz band (C-Band) are encouraged to explore synchronization of TDD operations to minimize interference between adjacent band services [57].\nThe shared band 48/n48 (3550 – 3700 MHz), also known as the CBRS band, requires spectrum sharing among three tiers of users controlled by one or multiple spectrum access systems (SASs) [58]. Coexistence, including TDD synchronization, among cellular users within the band is supported by OnGo Alliance coexistence requirements set forth in OnGo-TS-2001 [59].\nThe ISED Canada is reallocating portions of the 3500 to 4200 MHz band as TDD bands for cellular use. The ISED is considering TDD synchronization as a means of facilitating sharing and co-existence with adjacent band services [60].\nCurrently there are no specific regulatory requirements for SBFD operation in North America. Some SBFD operations result in similar interference scenarios as found in unsynchronized TDD systems. The potential coexistence risk introduced by SBFD may break the standard body agreement on TDD synchronization by OnGo Alliance coexistence requirements set forth in OnGo-TS-2001 [59].\n",

There are no regulatory requirements about the TDD pattern choice, instead, operators will determine final TDD pattern provided adjacent channel network are synchronized operation.\nFor adjacent TDD operation band and FDD operation band, inter-operator gNB-gNB CLI occurs. To avoid such interference, MIIT specify some interference mitigation scheme, e.g., frequency guard band and minimum spatial isolation requirement. One example is the interference between band 39 and band 1/band 3. To avoid severe gNB-to-gNB interference, a 5MHz frequency guard band is reserved between two adjacent operation bands. Besides, 50dB MCL is required between different operators’ gNB.\nThere are no SBFD regulatory requirements in China until now. MIIT mainly cares interference between different operators.

                    "text_content": "At present, many bands are issued by regulators with clearly defined duplex modes, i.e., FDD or TDD, and probably SDL or SUL. The evolution of NR duplex operation, as a new technology, may require regulators to consider the new regulatory requirements and/or update the ruling.\nAt least for regions studied so far, there is no regulation rule directly related to SBFD operation. The evolution of NR duplex operation would bring changes to the frame structures of legacy TDD operation, which has been assumed in many regions for coexistence. As a result, rules related to TDD synchronization and interference to incumbent services may be impacted.\nRegulators try to harmonize spectrum usage and pay attention to the use of new technologies that might create interference to incumbent services operating in or adjacent to the considered spectrum. When allocating spectrum to IMT TDD operation, many regulators made coexistence studies with incumbent services assuming a certain TDD configuration. Based on the conclusions of those studies, regulators have then specified the corresponding parameters to enable such deployment. Existing 3GPP specifications e.g., TS 38.104, assume the TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area and using the same or adjacent operating bands are synchronized. Unsynchronized operations have not been considered and so, no specific RF requirements are defined for the unsynchronized operations.\nSome regulators and regional organizations (e.g., CEPT ECC in Europe) have recommended specific TDD frame structure usage to facilitate coordination, addressing the cross-border issues between countries. In most studied regions, to avoid cross-link interference situations, regulatory conditions at the national/regional level define the common TDD frame structures for multiple operators’ operations in or adjacent to the considered spectrum, or administrations ask MNOs to agree on a common frame structure for Macro cellular deployments.\nTo enable unsynchronized TDD deployments without creating interference in the network(s) deployed in the same geographic areas, some regulators have specified more stringent parameters (e.g., CEPT specified below and above the block edge a restricted baseline of -34dBm/5 MHz EIRP for non-AAS BS or -43dBm/MHz TRP for AAS BS), which usually increases BS design’s complexity. For adjacent TDD operation band and FDD operation band, some regulators (e.g., MIIT in China) specify interference mitigation scheme such as guard band and minimum spatial isolation requirement.\nNevertheless, when deployed in environments that guarantee and prevent any interference in the adjacent spectrum (e.g., isolated indoor deployment), neither specific condition nor recommendation has been specified by the Regulators, allowing any TDD deployment in such environments as long as no interference disturbs adjacent services. For example, in a single operator’s TDD network, there may be no limitation on the frame structure and it is up to the operator’s choice. It is already possible today to use different TDD frame structures for isolated deployment, e.g., isolated indoor factory, as long as the obligation to avoid interference is guaranteed. For such types of deployments, existing regulation rules should not be impacted when operating SBFD.\nSBFD operation would allow simultaneous transmission and reception in different sub-bands within the same carrier. New regulatory requirements or changes to current regulations may be needed to allow SBFD operation for multiple operators’ deployment.\n",

transmission opportunities for semi-static SBFD compared to legacy TDD, and the DL UPT gain at least comes from the more DL transmission opportunities for semi-static SBFD compared to legacy TDD.\n-\tIn case of using SBFD with XXXXU or DXXXU slot format, the UL UPT gain at least comes from more UL resources and more UL transmission opportunities for semi-static SBFD compared to legacy TDD, and the DL UPT loss for SBFD at least comes from less DL resources for semi-static SBFD compared to legacy TDD.\n-\tThe UL UPT loss at least comes from inter-site gNB-gNB CLI and co-site inter-sector gNB-gNB CLI for Urban Macro and Dense Urban Macro layer. The impact of co-site inter-sector gNB-gNB CLI depends on co-site inter-sector CLI suppression capability. Also, the UL UPT loss at least comes from noise figure increase due to higher blocker power.\n-\tFor SBFD deployment case 4, for the SBFD operator, the UL UPT loss at least comes from inter-site adjacent-channel gNB-gNB CLI and co-site adjacent-channel gNB-gNB CLI for Urban Macro and Dense Urban Macro layer. The impact of co-site adjacent-channel gNB-gNB CLI depends on co-site adjacent-channel CLI suppression capability. Also, the UL UPT loss at least comes from noise figure increase due to higher blocker power by adjacent-channel CLI.\n-\tFor SBFD deployment case 4, for the legacy TDD operator in the case of XXXXX slot format, adjacent channel gNB-gNB CLI causes loss.\n-\tThe DL UPT loss at least comes from UE-to-UE CLI.\nBased on link level simulation, comparing SBFD with XXXXU slot format and legacy TDD with DDDSU slot format, RAN1 observed, with assumption of 1dB desense for self-interference suppression and different co-site inter-sector isolation values,\n-\tsemi-static SBFD with PUSCH repetition type A without/with joint channel estimation provides the UL coverage gain in range of {0.00~6.75}dB and median value of 5.41dB from 13 sources in FR1 UMa and in range of {5.86~8.76}dB and median value of 6.92dB from 4 sources in FR2-1 Dense UMa, respectively.\n-\tsemi-static SBFD with TBoMS with/without joint channel estimation provides the UL coverage gain in range of {2.83~6.88}dB and median value of 5.09dB from 4 sources in FR1 UMa and in range of {4.49~7.82}dB and median value of 5.72dB from 2 sources in FR2-1 Dense UMa, respectively.\nSBFD operation at gNB for UEs was studied under the following assumptions,\n-\tSBFD operation within a TDD carrier.\n-\tSBFD scheme within a single configured DL and UL BWP pair with aligned center frequencies, and\n-\tUp to one UL subband for SBFD operation in an SBFD symbol (excluding legacy UL symbol) within a TDD carrier.\nRAN1 concluded SBFD operation Option 4 is feasible for RRC_CONNECTED state from the RAN1 specification perspective, where SBFD operation Option 4 assumes\n-\tBoth time and frequency locations of subbands for SBFD operation are known to SBFD aware UEs.\n-\tUE behaviors for non-SBFD aware UEs follow existing specifications.\n-\tFrom RAN1 perspective, new UE behaviors can be introduced for SBFD aware UEs based on the time and frequency locations of subbands for SBFD operation.\nNon-SBFD aware UEs, including legacy UEs, and SBFD aware UEs can coexist in cells with SBFD operation at gNB side from RAN1 specification point of view.\nTo support SBFD operation Option 4 for RRC_CONNECTED state, RAN1 identified the following potential specification impact for SBFD-aware UE:\n-\tIndication of time and frequency domain locations of SBFD subbands to UEs.\n-\tUE transmission, reception and measurement behavior and procedures in SBFD symbols and/or non-SBFD symbols.\nFor semi-static SBFD, the gNB-to-gNB co-channel CLI handling schemes and UE-to-UE co-channel CLI handling schemes were studied, including performance and specification impact, which are included in Section 7.4.2, Section 7.4.3 and Section 7.4.4.

Both FR1 and FR2 BS classes are studied, including FR1 wide area BS, FR1 medium range BS, FR1 local area BS and FR2-1 wide area BS. When considering the RSIC for self-interference and inter-sector interference, the following aspects and self-interference mitigation techniques have been considered: spatial antenna isolation, Tx beam nulling, suppression of transmitter leakage (i.e., frequency isolation), analogue interference cancellation, digital interference cancellation, receive beam-forming, receiver linearity performance, phase noise and other considerations.\nRAN4 has also studied the implementation feasibility of UE considering modeling of UE-UE co-channel inter-sub-band CLI and UE-UE adjacent channel CLI. Both FR1 and FR2-1 UE are studied and CLI modeling combines both Tx and Rx parts. It’s worth noting that half duplex operation at UE side is assumed according to the objective of this study item.\nBesides, the impact on both BS and UE RF requirements are studied. For the BS aspects, impact on Tx requirements, impact on Rx requirements and potentially new requirements for SBFD operation are analyzed. For the UE aspects, reusing existing UE RF requirements is the conclusion of the study phase, since no issues related to existing UE RF requirements has been identified in the co-existence study.\nMoreover, the adjacent channel co-existence studies were performed under a total of 8 deployment scenarios as described in Table 11-1. For each deployment scenario, a total of 4 cases were performed as described in Table 11-2. The performance metrics were throughput loss at the cell edge and cell average.\nIn the summary sub-section, value ranges and median values are collected from all companies' simulation results with respect to the different scenarios, cases, victims, and the four kinds of simulation parameters. The final conclusion is derived for the four \"victim/ aggressor\" network combinations.\nFinally, regulatory considerations for deploying the duplex enhancements in TDD unpaired spectrum are summarized with respect to three ITU Regions, namely ITU Region 1, ITU Region 2 and ITU Region 3.\nRegarding detailed conclusions, Table 13.1.2-1 below summarizes the different study conclusions and their respective section.\nTable 13.1.2-1: RAN4 conclusions reference\n",

The summary of observations for gNB-to-gNB CLI handling schemes are included in Section 8.3.\nRAN4 did not conduct any adjacent channel co-existence studies with dynamic TDD in Rel-18 SI as similar discussions took place under Rel-16 and were captured in TR 38.828. The following recommendations were made in section 6.3.1.1 of TR 38.828\n-    Concerning Urban Macro to Urban Macro scenario in FR1, “Performance degradation was observed from the BS-to-BS interference for macro-macro scenario, which suggests that dynamic TDD should not be operated in such scenarios.”\n-  \tConcerning indoor network and a macro network scenario in FR1 and vice versa, “Performance degradations were not observed from operating dynamic TDD between an indoor network and a macro network and vice versa if there is sufficient isolation between them. No significant impact from operating dynamic TDD for the indoor scenario was observed as long as the BS and UE powers are similar and the operator’s co-ordinate so that base station positions are offset. If higher BS power is assumed, some throughput degradation in the indoor scenario was observed due to BS-to-BS interference. The observations imply that dynamic TDD can be used in indoors as long as care is taken.”\nThe recommendations for dynamic TDD in TR38.828 are still valid and should be taken into consideration.
