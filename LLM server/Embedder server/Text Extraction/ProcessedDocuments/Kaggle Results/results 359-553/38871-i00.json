                            "text_content": "FR2 OTA measurement setups with full degree of rotation freedom for each AoA support two simultaneous AoAs with any combination of DL directions, i.e., any permutation of possible AoAs shall be supported. This setup was initially considered as the preferred measurement setup for multi-AoA UE RF testing but later discarded for reasons outlined below.\nSuch setup was also considered the default measurement setup for FR2 UE RF testing during the SI phase of FR2 OTA testing [3] given the requirement to perform off-centre of beam measurements as illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-1. However, the adoption of the UE Beamlock test Function (UBF), see Clause 5.4 of [5], to readily perform off-centre of beam measurements shifted the focus towards more practical single-AoA/single-probe UE RF setups, e.g., the Indirect Far Field (IFF) methodology [3] which subsequently became the de-facto setup for FR2 UE RF testing.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for evaluating the RF characteristics of a UE (User Equipment) in a TRP (Time-Domain Reflectometry) scan, as part of a study on the performance of a 5G network. The setup includes a DFF (Digital Frequency-Division Multiplexer) measurement setup, which allows for the measurement of the RF characteristics of the UE's antenna. The figure provides a visual representation of the setup, including the placement of the DFF, the measurement equipment, and the setup's layout. The study aims to evaluate the performance of the UE in a 5G network, focusing on the RF characteristics of the UE's antenna.\nFigure 5.2.1-1: DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for TRP scans (Figure 5.2.1.1-1 of [3]).\nMeasurement setups that allow arbitrary positioning for each probe, i.e., the UE does not necessarily require a positioning system are illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-2 and Figure 5.2.1-3. The Direct Far Field (DFF) methodology, i.e., millimeter-wave measurement probes placed in the far-field away from the DUT when adapted to two-simultaneous AoA testing, is illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-2. Here, the probes introducing AoA1 (beam shown in blue) and AoA2 (beam shown in red) can be positioned arbitrarily while the DUT is fixed. When the DFF probes are replaced with Indirect Far Field (IFF) probes, i.e., measurement probe and reflector, a sample test system with full degrees of freedom for each AoA is shown in Figure 5.2.1-3. The full degree of rotation freedom for each probe is highlighted with the yellow arrows behind each DFF probe/IFF probe&reflector combination. The positioning requirements to accurately position probe(s) along two principal axes in 3D yield a very high positioning complexity.\nThe figure depicts a two-simultaneous AoA testing setup with full degrees of freedom for each probe, illustrating the measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing. The setup includes two probes, each with a full degree of freedom, and a reference probe. The figure shows the measurement setup with a 100-mm-long, 10-mm-diameter, and 10-mm-thick DFF, with a 10-mm-long, 10-mm-diameter, and 10-mm-thick reference probe. The setup is designed to ensure accurate and reliable measurements of the AoA of the two probes.\nFigure 5.2.1-2: Example DFF measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing with full degrees of freedom for each probe.\nThe figure depicts a two-simultaneous AoA testing setup with full degrees of freedom for each probe, illustrating the measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing. The setup includes two probes, each with a full degree of freedom, and a reference probe. The figure shows the measurement setup with a 3D coordinate system, with the reference probe at the origin and the two probes at the points of interest. The axes represent the AoA and the reference probe's position, while the axes of the two probes are perpendicular to each other. The figure provides a clear and detailed representation of the measurement setup, allowing for accurate and reliable testing of two-simultaneous AoA.\nFigure 5.2.1-3: Example IFF measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing with full degrees of freedom for each probe.\nSize (width/depth/height) estimations performed for such DFF/IFF systems supporting the FR2-1 frequency range and devices up to a 40 cm diameter (40 cm QZ) are tabulated in Table 5.2.1-1. The increase in chamber sizes (footprint and heights) when compared to existing FR2 UE RF chambers is significant and existing chambers are not upgradable to support full degrees of freedom. The lead times to develop such systems with full degrees of freedom could be quite significant and could thus delay the commercial adoption of these test cases. Additionally, the overall system complexities of such systems could further require an increase in measurement uncertainties (MUs) and thus test tolerances (TTs).\nTable 5.2.1-1: Size estimates for UE RF systems with full degrees of freedom for each probe.\n\nMeasurement setups that allow full degrees of positioning freedom for one probe and the DUT while the other probe is fixed are shown in Figure 5.2.1-4 for the DFF and Figure 5.2.1-5 for the IFF methodology. The probe introducing AoA1 (beam shown in blue) is fixed while the DUT and the probe introducing AoA2 (beam shown in red) can be positioned arbitrarily (as indicated with the yellow arrows). This approach therefore also supports full degrees of rotational freedom for each AoA.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing with arbitrary positioning capability for one probe and a DUT supporting full degrees of freedom. The setup includes a DFF (Differential Frequency) meter, a probe, and a DUT (Device Under Test). The DFF meter measures the frequency difference between the two probes, which is used to determine the AoA (Angle of Arrival) of the signals. The setup allows for testing with full degrees of freedom, meaning that the angle of arrival can be adjusted independently for each probe. This is important for testing the performance of the system under different scenarios, such as different antenna configurations or different signal propagation conditions.\nFigure 5.2.1-4: Example DFF measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing with arbitrary positioning capability for one probe and DUT supporting full degrees of freedom.\nSize (width/depth/height) estimations were performed for such DFF/IFF systems as well which are tabulated in Table 5.2.1-2. Only a very small improvement in footprint, i.e., width, can be observed for this system architecture when compared to Table 5.2.1-1. The same conclusions/observations can be made as those above, i.e., the increase in chamber sizes (footprint and heights) when compared to existing FR2 UE RF chambers is significant and existing chambers are not upgradable to support full degrees of freedom.\nThe figure depicts a two-simultaneous AoA testing setup with full degrees of freedom for one probe and a DUT. The setup includes a probe and a DUT, with the probe equipped with an antenna and a receiver. The setup allows for the measurement of the AoA of the probe and the DUT simultaneously, with the probe and DUT being in different locations. The setup is designed to provide a high degree of flexibility and accuracy in the measurement of the AoA.\nFigure 5.2.1-5: Example IFF measurement setup for two-simultaneous AoA testing with full degrees of freedom for one probe & DUT\nTable 5.2.1-2: Size estimates for UE RF systems with full degrees of freedom for each probe.\n\nAlternate example measurement setups to support full degrees of freedom for AoA are shown in Figures 5.2.1-6 through 5.2.1-9.\nThe figure depicts a 2AoA DFF test system with full degrees of freedom, illustrating the system's ability to accurately measure the angle of arrival (AoA) of signals. The system includes a 2AoA DFF detector, a 2AoA DFF analyzer, and a 2AoA DFF controller, all operating in a 2AoA DFF test environment. The system's ability to measure the angle of arrival of signals is crucial for various applications, such as signal processing, communication systems, and radar systems.\nFigure 5.2.1-6: Example of 2AoA DFF test system with full degrees of freedom\nThe figure depicts a distributed-axes system with two moving IFF reflectors, illustrating the concept of distributed-axes systems in the context of optical communication. The system consists of multiple IFF reflectors, each with a fixed position and a moving position, which allows for the transmission of signals in both directions. The figure also includes a schematic representation of the system, highlighting the interconnection of the IFF reflectors and the optical line terminals (OLTs). This system is designed to provide high-speed, reliable communication in optical networks.\nFigure 5.2.1-7: Distributed-axes system with two moving IFF reflectors\nThe figure depicts a distributed-axes system with two moving IFF reflectors, illustrating the concept of distributed-axes systems in the context of optical communication. The system consists of multiple IFF reflectors, each with a fixed position and a moving position, which allows for the transmission of signals in both directions. The figure also includes a schematic representation of the system, highlighting the interconnection of the IFF reflectors and the optical line terminals (OLTs). This system is designed to provide high-speed, reliable communication in optical networks.\nFigure 5.2.1-8: Distributed-axes system with two moving IFF reflectors\nThe figure depicts a 2AoA RF test system with a DFF antenna as the second NR anchor on a slider, illustrating the use of a DFB (Diode-Free Beamformer) antenna for 2AoA testing. The system includes a DFB antenna, a DFB-based RF front-end, and a DFB-based RF back-end, which are essential components for achieving high-quality 2AoA measurements. The figure also highlights the importance of proper alignment and alignment of the DFB antenna with the NR anchor to ensure accurate and reliable 2AoA measurements.\nFigure 5.2.1-9: 2AoA RF test system with DFF antenna as the second NR anchor on a slider\nThe full degrees of freedom for each AoA supports a probe offset option with variable angular offset(s) between AoA1 and AoA2 in the chamber. The angular separation between AoA1 and AoA2 can change during the testing. This is further illustrated with a sample DUT with a beam peak in the DUT y direction, as illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-10. As the AoA2 probe has full degrees of freedom, i.e., the angular difference between AoA1 and AoA2 is arbitrary, the AoA2 probe can track/follow the DUT’s beam peak during testing as illustrated in Table 5.2.1-3 for two different DUT orientations/test points.\nThe figure depicts a sample DUT with a presumed beam peak in the y direction, illustrating the beamforming technique used in a 5G network. The figure shows the signal path, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The beamforming technique is highlighted to mitigate interference, with key components such as the base station, user equipment, and scatterers. The figure also illustrates the layered design of the optical backbone, aligning with SDN principles.\nFigure 5.2.1-10: Sample DUT with assumed beam peak in the DUT’s y direction\nTable 5.2.1-3: Ability of tracking a DUT reference direction\n\nEfforts for multi-AoA DL spherical coverage testing based on the assumptions that no prior knowledge of the performance of any panel/chain is available, e.g., beam peak directions of each panel, are significant and quantified next. The spherical coverage test for any multi-chain UE system configuration would require a spherical coverage test with N*(N-1)≈N2 AoA combinations. Here, N is the minimum number of spherical coverage grid points. The effort in terms of minimum number of test points is quantified in Table 5.2.1-4 assuming that the same measurement grids/grid density are used as for legacy spherical coverage testing, defined in Clause M.3 of [6].\nTable 5.2.1-4: Test Effort Estimates for UE RF Systems with Full Degrees of Freedom for AoA.\n\nThe number of test points for this test approach is test time prohibitive given the very large number of test points.\nThis measurement setup has its pros/cons summarized in Table 5.2.1-5.\nTable 5.2.1-5: Overview of Measurement Setup\n\nWhen the AoA2 probe/anchor probe is placed in the NF while supporting variable angular offsets, different system aspects must be taken into account. A sample measurement setup is shown in Figure 5.2.1-11 where both AoA1 (in FF) and AoA2 (in NF) have full degrees of freedom.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for AoA2/Anchor in a NF (Network Function Virtualization) environment. It illustrates the setup with 11 measurement points, each representing a different angle of arrival (AoA2) and anchor (AoA1). The figure shows the measurement setup with a 100-meter cable, which is used to measure the AoA2/Anchor. The setup includes a 100-meter cable, a 100-meter cable, and a 100-meter cable, which are used to measure the AoA1/Anchor.

The setup includes a 100-meter cable, a 100-meter cable, and a 100-meter cable, which are used to measure the AoA2/Anchor.\nFigure 5.2.1-11: Example Measurement Setup with AoA2/Anchor in NF\nAn example implementation with the anchor probe mounted to the roll motor with independent positioning control (purple arrows) is shown in Figure 5.2.1-12.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for AoA2/Anchor in NF, illustrating the various components and their arrangement. The setup includes a 1-12 array, with 12 antennas, each with a 20-degree AoA, and a 20-degree anchor. The setup is designed to measure the angle of arrival (AoA) and the angle of departure (AoD) of signals, which are crucial for understanding the propagation characteristics of the signal in a 5G network. The figure also includes a 20-degree anchor, which is used to measure the angle of arrival (AoA) of the signal. The setup is designed to be modular and can be easily expanded to accommodate additional components or measurements.\nFigure 5.2.1-12: Example Implementation of Measurement Setup with AoA2/Anchor in NF\nIt should be noted that link antennas used in existing systems commonly do not have completely independent positioning control to support the full degrees of freedom. Link antennas are traditionally used to introduce an auxiliary communication link between the gNB and the DUT to avoid poor signal conditions in the non-tested DL or UL (for UL or DL measurements) and thus dropped calls. As no calibrated measurements are performed over this link, this signal path is generally never calibrated and the positioning and link probe requirements are very relaxed, e.g., large positioning uncertainty of the link antenna are acceptable, and the link antenna can be a low performance antenna coupler. Hence, such link antenna setups are not suitable for UE RF measurements.\nIn [9], NF methodologies for single-UL and DL were investigated and eventually considered permitted methodologies for FR2 test cases that currently require large relaxations in RAN5 technical specifications. The EIS/EIRP measurements in the immediate NF require very accurate positioning of the NF probe, a high-end antenna probe, and the NF antenna pattern characterization. Given the need for accurate positioning and relatively large NF probe antennas supporting two principal polarizations, antenna(s) and fixturing will result in significant blocking in various AoA1 measurement directions. More importantly, to accurately determine EIS in the NF, it is required to calibrate out the offset of the active DUT antenna from the centre of QZ to account for the correct path loss between the NF measurement probe and the active antenna. This offset can either be determined using a set of measurements which need to be performed for each AoA1 measurement direction (black box approach of CFFNF in Clause 5.1.4 of [9]) or based on a rather extensive vendor declaration, e.g., location of all antenna panels and which antenna is active for any given measurement direction. Applying these NF findings to multi-Rx UE RF testing has the following implications:\n\n-\tThe vendor declaration would require the exact location of all active antenna pairs for each AoA2 probe direction, i.e., an even more extensive vendor declaration than for single DL EIS measurements\n-\tThe NF probe needs to guarantee the same DL conditions to both active DUT receivers as a FF probe would since UE RF requirements are defined in the FF\nThis measurement setup has its pros/cons summarized in Table 5.2.1-6.\nTable 5.2.1-6: Overview of Measurement Setup with AoA2 Probes in the NF\n\n",

A sample measurement setup is shown in Figure 5.2.3-2. The system implementation with AoA1 supporting the 2-axis positioner and with a single or multiple AoA2 probe(s) require very large systems since AoA2 probe(s) must be placed behind AoA1 probe as shown in Figure 5.2.3-3 to support free movement of AoA1 and no interference with AoA2.\nThe figure depicts a 3-2 DFF measurement setup with full degrees of freedom for AoA1, allowing for variable angular offsets between AoA1 and AoA2.

The increase in chamber sizes (footprint and heights) when compared to existing FR2 UE RF chambers is significant and existing chambers are not upgradable to support full degrees of freedom.

The figure illustrates the process of setting up the test mode switch to activate the antenna, which is crucial for ensuring accurate measurements.\nFigure 5.2.6-1: Example measurement setup (Method 1) with test mode to fix active antenna.\nThe second approach (Method 2) is illustrated in Figure 5.2.6-1 and based on the following high-level procedure:\n-    Perform Rx Beam peak search for AoA1.\n-    Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the measurement antenna to form the RX beam towards the RX beam peak direction and respective polarization found for AoA1.\n-    SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) on AoA1. If necessary, switch the connection of the SS from the measurement antenna to the link antenna.\n-    Perform Rx Beam peak search for AoA2.\nThe idea behind this approach is to augment/modify the existing UE Beamlock Function (UBF), i.e., lock a beam connected to one receiver while a second connection is still possible with freedom on the direction and/or panel used.\n\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for an augmented UBF test mode, with a focus on the 6-2 configuration. The setup includes a 6-2 UBF test mode, which is a method used to assess the performance of a network by simulating a 6-2 path. The figure shows the components of the setup, including the 6-2 UBF test mode, the 6-2 path, and the 6-2 path simulator. The figure also includes a visual representation of the 6-2 path, which is a key component of the test mode.\nFigure 5.2.6-2: Example measurement setup (Method 2) with augmented UBF test mode.\nMethod 1 cannot verify the potential cross talk between two AoAs especially then the two AoAs are with a small angular separation. When performing sequential tests, the testing is not verifying the real performance of multi-Rx UEs. Method 2 does not suffer from these issues, but it was not concluded whether the measurements on the locked beam (i.e. AoA1 in Figure 5.2.6-2) may be impacted by the link antenna in the Near Field.\n",

                            "text_content": "The system described in 5.2.2 has strong continuity with legacy systems, and therefore warrants further development. The system has reduced flexibility in placing source locations due to a fixed relative location of the sources. If this arrangement is used with a legacy 2 axis positioner, the UE can only be tested with some subset of all possible AoA pairs for a given AoA separation or offset. See Figure 5.2.7.1-1 for a graphical representation of the set of all possible testable AoA pairs by the system described in 5.2.2 in conjunction with a 2-axis positioner and a constant step-size scan. The restriction of the AoA pairings strictly towards one pole or the other can influence the measured 2AoA reception performance of the UE as a function of its orientation in the positioner during test.\nThe figure depicts a spherical coordinate system from the UE's perspective, showing AoA pairs along meridians. The system is designed for a test system with fixed offset between the sources and a 2-axis positioner.\nFigure 5.2.7.1-1: From the UE’s perspective, AoA pairs lie along meridians of a spherical coordinate system for a test system with fixed offset between the sources and a 2-axis positioner.\nConceptually, robustness to orientation can be accomplished by adding test AoAs uniformly distributed on the sphere in more directions rather than just along the meridians. This necessitates using a 3-axis positioner in the agreed TE system rather than the legacy 2-axis positioner. Figure 5.2.7.1-2 graphically shows the intended goal of the added degree of freedom from the UE’s perspective.\n\nFigure 5.2.7.1-2: Scheme to combat bias introduced by AoA pairs limited to lie along meridians from the UE’s perspective.\nRecall that the legacy 2-axis positioner is only able to pair each grid point to AoAs along the blue arrows, respectively (see Figure 5.2.7.1-1). The 3-axis positioner is intended to allow each grid point to be additionally paired with AoAs along the green arrows. These additional directions essentially dismantle the restriction of having test AoA pairs exclusively along meridians of a spherical coordinate system from the UE’s perspective.\nSimulated test runs with a UE with modules on adjacent confirms the intended enhancement removes sensitivity to UE orientation, see Figure 5.2.7.1-3. ‘D’ referenced in the figures is used in the sense of degree of freedom of the positioner, rather than spatial dimension. HH or VV refer to beam scanning directions for both modules, each assumed to be 4x1.\nThe figure depicts a 3-axis positioner used to remove UE orientation sensitivity in a 5G network. The positioner is designed to ensure accurate positioning of the UE, reducing the impact of environmental factors on signal quality.\nFigure 5.2.7.1-3: UE orientation sensitivity removal using a 3-axis positioner.\nThe basic idea to implement this type of 3-axis positioner is an ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner that has similar functionality to the legacy positioner mounted to a fixed ‘outside’ roll-motor (‘outside’ to indicate it is not part of the positioner that would implement the basic scan). The ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner could be implemented as a azimuth-roll set-up (legacy geometry), an elevation-azimuth type positioner or other equivalent type. The ‘fixed’ aspect of the outside roll-motor refers to the fact that its stator would be statically positioned relative to the source locations, with its shaft axis pointed at one of the sources. This target source’s  AoAs define the grid where the UE’s performance is evaluated. Figure 5.2.7.2-1 helps visualize the AoA pairings at each grid point.\nThe figure depicts a 3-axis positioner used in a 3D positioning system, with each axis representing a different angle of view. The system is designed to accurately measure the position of a point in a 3D space, allowing for precise positioning of objects. The figure shows the positioner in action, with each axis showing the angle of view and the corresponding point in the 3D space. The system is used in various applications, such as robotics, manufacturing, and autonomous vehicles, to ensure accurate and reliable positioning.\nFigure 5.2.7.2-1: Visualization of AoA pairs associated with each point with the proposed 3-axis positioner\nOne helpful aspect is that the 3-axis positioner no longer needs 180⁰ swing of the azimuth motion from the ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner for each scanned hemisphere: It is possible for the inside positioner to use a 90⁰ azimuth, 360⁰ roll strategy if advantageous.\nFigure 5.2.7.2-2 helps with conceptual description of how the third degree of freedom in the positioner can be leveraged to achieve the grid and AoA pairings of 5.2.7.2-1.  The blue and the green shafts represent the ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner, and they are together mounted on the outside roll motor shaft (red items). Two options are shown for the implementation of the ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner: azimuth-elevation and azimuth-roll. The latter option allows continuity with the legacy positioner grid and geometry. Detail design work is needed to adequately hide the motors to reduce the prospect of blockage, as well as other details like bringing the articulation axes closer; these are up to TE implementation. In either implementation the ‘outside’ roll motor is ground referenced like the sources and points to one of them, say S1 (grey body in the figures below).\nThe figure depicts a 3-axis positioner concept, which is a type of linear actuator used in various applications to reduce bias in position measurements. The figure shows a simplified representation of the positioner, with three axes (x, y, and z) and a linear actuator connected to each axis. The positioner is designed to reduce the effect of external forces on the position measurement, ensuring accurate and stable readings. The figure is useful for understanding the concept and its application in various industries.\nFigure 5.2.7.2-2: Bias reducing 3-axis positioner concepts.\nThe sequence of actuation can be considered equivalent to the following:\n-\tStep 1: The outside roll motor starts off at the zero-rotation location (as shown) and the ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner \t  (blue and green axes) mounted to the roll motor is used to move S1 to the desired grid point from the UE’s \t   \t \t  perspective.\n-\tStep 2: The outside roll-motor is then actuated over 360⁰ with an arbitrary number of stops for measurement. Each \t   stop represents an AoA pair with one source (S1) fixed in space\n-\t Step 3: Once the outside roll-motor returns to the zero position, the ‘inside’ 2-axis positioner is used to move S1 to \t  the next grid point\n-\tStep 4: (Loop to step 2 until S1 is moved through all grid points).\nMore realistic views of the positioner are shown in Figure 5.2.7.2-3.\nThe figure depicts a 3-axis positioner, which is a crucial component in the assembly of a 3D printer. It is used to control the movement of the print head, ensuring accurate and precise positioning of the print material. The positioner is designed to be compatible with various 3D printer models and materials, allowing for a wide range of applications.\nFigure 5.2.7.2-3: More realistic depiction of an example implementation of the 3-axis positioner.\n\nThe focus in this section is on an outside-roll-azimuth-roll positioner implementation, due to continuity of grid geometry with legacy positioners. Blocking is an important consideration for 2TRP connectivity. With the agreed TE with the legacy 2-axis positioner, both sources must be confined to a 180⁰ sector in the horizontal plane, to stay out of the 180⁰ swing of the azimuth motion of the positioner. With the proposed 3-axis positioner however, the roll axis of the outside motor is fixed to point to one of the sources, and the system loses its rotational symmetry. This means that the new positioner mechanism cannot be equally hidden from both sources for all AoA separations like the strategy used with the legacy positioner. There are two types of source blockages to navigate:\n1.\tSource blockage due to inside positioner mechanics.\n2.\tSource blockage due to outside roll-motor arm to which the inside positioner is mounted.\nThe blocking situation is more realistically depicted in Figure 5.2.7.3-1 in the form of a sequence of typical outside roll motor actuation. Note that azimuth and source separation sum up to 180⁰, a relationship that is identified as the main condition for blocking to occur. This configuration depicts instances of both types of blockage. The red dotted highlight shows S2 blockage due to the inside positioner, while the blue dotted highlight shows S2 blockage due to the arm mounted to the outside motor.\nThe figure depicts a 3-axis positioner, highlighting the issue of blockage in its operation. The positioner is shown in a 3-dimensional view, with the axes representing the positioner's height, width, and depth. The positioner is shown in a 3-axis view, with the axes representing the positioner's height, width, and depth.

The positioner\nFigure 5.2.7.3-1: Blockage issue with 3-axis positioner, viewed from azimuth axis.\nBlockage due to the insider positioner:\nEven if the reduced azimuth motion (per hemisphere) of the inside 2-axis positioner is reduced to [0-90⁰], the outside roll motor would swing the ‘inside’ positioner into the LOS of the second source for source separations of 90⁰ or more. Conceptually, the blockage occurs when the second source (S2) approaches the pole of the grid where the inside positioner is located. This blockage condition is not due to the choice of positioner, but instead due to the choice to test each point with AoA pairs in more directions than just along meridians.\nThis situation manifests for all grid points whose theta coordinate approaches the supplementary angle (180-x) to the source separation angle. Furthermore, blocking may only occur for some subset of outside-motor roll angles. See Figure 5.2.7.3-2. For perspective, it is useful to remember that this blockage condition is not due to the choice of positioner, but instead due to the choice to test each point with AoA pairs in more directions.\n\nFigure 5.2.7.3-2: Blockage issue due to inside positioner of a 3-axis positioner, viewed from (the inside) azimuth axis of the example implementation.\nThe fraction of AoA pairs where one source is near the south pole is relatively small and can be identified a-priori for each hemisphere scan and re-assigned to the opposite hemisphere scan. For the opposite hemisphere scan, the second source would flip over to near the north pole and the first source would also flip but it will remain clear of the south pole, provided AoA separation is not 180⁰. So, a blocked AoA in one hemisphere scan is not blocked during the opposite hemisphere scan. Another detail is that for the blocked AoA pairs, the second source location is now the one near the north pole (originally designated S1). It may not fall on the originally chosen grid, but that should not matter to the ‘inside’ positioner. The external roll motor can then position the flipped first source (originally designated S2) at the desired location in the southern hemisphere. Since the AoA pair reorganization can be done a-priori, there is no foreseen test time impact.\nTo summarize, a ‘no-block’ strategy to dodge the inside positioner can be implemented by exchanging some pre-identified test AoAs across the two hemisphere scans. Since the blocked region is essentially due to the mechanical outline of the inside positioner, it is up to TE implementation to treat the considerations presented below:\n1.\tVarious motion transfer schemes can be leveraged to reduce the shadow region, which reduces the number of AoA pairs that may be blocked.\n2.\tIt would be mathematically consistent to re-orient the sample points on the circle (locus of second source during the outside motor roll) to reduce blockage. i.e., move all stops for the external roll motor for that grid point by some convenient angle to avoid the shadow region.\nBlockage due to outside positioner arm:\nAs the outside motor’s is stepped at any grid point, some stops will cause the mechanics carrying the inside positioner to block the source. The strategy is to leverage multiple different mechanical configurations to achieve the same UE pointing direction relative to the two sources. An example is shown below for a given UE pointing direction.\n\nSince the same orientation is achieved with two different outside roll settings, the TE retains a way to dodge a blockage condition induced by the outside motor angular position. The following views of the system in a configuration that demonstrate the blocking issue endemic to testing each point with at least 3 equally spatially distributed AoA pairs. Sources are shown as flat discs. Source separation angle is 150⁰. Chosen grid point for illustration is S1 at theta=30⁰, phi = -45⁰. Note that azimuth and source separation sum up to 180⁰, a relationship that is identified as the main condition for blocking to occur. Geometries are not optimized for blockage reduction.\nThe highlighted view is an example of how the outside motor arm can impede line of sight between the UE and source S2. In the illustration below, an alternative set of coordinates achieve the same UE orientation relative to the sources, but the arm is no longer in a blocking location. This strategy is an example of a no-block strategy for the outside motor. Figure 5.2.7.3-3 shows the strategy to allow the outside motor to dodge the line of sight to source S2 for the example 3-axis implementation. On the right is the blocking condition, note orange arm is in line of sight to source S2. On the left is an equivalent UE pointing direction but without blockage from the outside motor arm.\nThe figure depicts a no-block strategy for outside motor arm positioning, illustrating the implementation of a 3-axis positioner. The no-block strategy ensures that the motor arm does not block the positioner, allowing for precise and accurate positioning.\nFigure 5.2.7.3-3: No-block strategy for outside motor arm the example implementation of a 3-axis positioner.\nTo summarize, a ‘no-block’ strategy to dodge the outside arm can be implemented by taking advantage of the fact that there are multiple unique positioner settings to achieve the same UE pointing direction.\nTable 5.2.7.4-1: Overview of positioner enhancement\n\n",

The sample implementation has a 2-axis positioning system for the DUT to implement a 3D scan and three probes in the x, y, and z axes with the assumption that AoA1 is along z and AoA2 along x or y. The DL directions perceived by the DUT from each probe are illustrated with red, green, and red spheres on the DUT grid in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, for this initial test point of (q, f) = (0°, 0°).\nThe figure depicts a sample measurement setup with three fixed probe locations for an initial test point of (0 °, 0 °). The setup includes a 3D coordinate system, with the x-axis representing the distance from the probe to the measurement point, the y-axis representing the distance from the measurement point to the probe, and the z-axis representing the distance from the measurement point to the measurement point. The figure includes a legend to indicate the different measurement points and their corresponding values. The figure is used to demonstrate the setup and the measurement process, which involves collecting data from the three fixed probe locations and analyzing the results to determine the accuracy of the measurement.\nFigure 5.3.1-1: Sample measurement setup with three fixed probe locations for initial test point of (0°, 0°)\nFor the sample multi-AoA system investigated, the angular difference between AoA1 (z direction) and AoA2 (x direction) and between AoA1 (z direction) and AoA2 (y direction) is 90° in both cases. One could seemingly argue that the roll motor of the DUT (rotation around the DUT z axis) makes it irrelevant whether AoA2 is along the y or the x axis. However, once the device is rotated in 3D, i.e., q and f, this argument is no longer applicable which is further analysed and illustrated below. For a second sample device orientation of (q, f) = (45°, -45°), the perceived DL directions are illustrated on the rotated DUT grid in Figure 5.3.1-2. Clearly, a 90° rotation of the device around its z axis would no longer map the green sphere onto the red sphere.\nThe figure depicts a sample measurement setup with three fixed probe locations for testing a point of interest (POI) at (45 °, -45 °). The setup includes a 3D coordinate system, with the POI marked as (45 °, -45 °). The three fixed probe locations are marked as (0, 0), (0, 150), and (150, 0). The figure illustrates the setup's components, such as the probe, the reference point, and the measurement device. The setup is designed to measure the distance between the POI and the reference point, with the measurement device being a laser scanner. The figure is useful for understanding the setup's components and their relative positions.\nFigure 5.3.1-2: Sample measurement setup with three fixed probe locations for test point of (45°, -45°)\nIt is now assumed that the test points in 3D are based on a constant-step size grid with 266 unique grid points (Dq=Df=15°), i.e., as defined for PC1 & PC3 spherical coverage test cases for 1-DL in Clause 5.3 of [6], or on a constant density grid with 200 unique grid points, i.e., as defined for PC1 spherical coverage test cases for 1-DL in Clause 5.3 of [6]. These test/grid points are visualized in Table 5.3.1-1.\nTable 5.3.1-1: Visualization of spherical coverage test/grid points\n\nWhen all spherical coverage grid points are sampled with 0°≤q≤180° and 0°≤f≤360°, the DL directions perceived by the UE from the various probes are plotted in Table 5.3.1-2. Clearly, these results show vastly different results.\n-\tFor the probe aligned with the z axis, the perceived DL directions match the test points.\n-\tFor the probe aligned with the y axis, the DUT only perceives the DL in a single plane only, i.e., the DUT’s xy plane. This is due to the turntable axis of the OTA positioner aligned with the y axis, i.e., the turntable rotation merely changes the polarization but not the DL direction with this probe. The roll motor, i.e., the rotation of the DUT around its z axis, only adjusts the DL direction within the xy plane.\n-\tFor the AoA2 probe aligned with the x axis, the DL directions are perceived from different directions in (q, f) but limited to a single hemisphere only.\nThe plots of the perceived DL directions from different, fixed probes demonstrate the need to define the absolute probe locations/directions for UE RF systems so that different test systems yield the same results.\nTable 5.3.1-2: DL directions perceived by the DUT from probes in the x, y, and z axes.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "Due to the finite size of the probes, the minimum angular separation between probes will be limited to prevent collisions and thus prevent a “full” degree of rotation freedom of one AoA unless probes are placed back-to-back as illustrated in Figure 5.2.3-3 which on the other hand introduces blocking effects.\nThe minimum angular separation between neighbouring reflectors is larger than the minimum separation between two regular millimetre-wave probes as illustrated in Figure 5.3.2-1. It is estimated that the minimum angular separation between two IFF probes is about 30° while the minimum angular separation between two DFF probes is about 5°.\nAlthough DFF is one of the permitted methodologies for FR2 OTA testing [10], IFF is the de-facto reference methodology for FR2 OTA measurements. To enable the applicability of IFF to multi-AoA UE RF testing [3, 12], the largest minimum angular separation of DFF and IFF must be selected, i.e., the minimum angular separation between probes must be 30°.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of minimum angular separations between Infrared (IFF) and Differential (DFF) probes in a 5G network. The IFF probe is positioned at the center of the network, while the DFF probe is located at the edge. The figure illustrates the importance of these angular separations in ensuring reliable communication, as they can significantly impact the signal quality and interference.\nFigure 5.3.2-1: Illustration of minimum angular separations between IFF (top) and DFF probes.\nThe maximum angular separation between probes could be as large as 180°. However, this angular separation would result in significant blocking between one AoA probe and the DUT positioner, as illustrated in Figure 5.3.2-2, and the line-of-sight path between both probes also introduce a significant amount of coupling. It was therefore suggested to limit the maximum angular separation between probes/AoAs to 150° (blue reflector/probe in Figure 5.3.2-2).\n\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a 3D model, specifically a 3D-2-2-2 model, which is a type of 3D-2-2-2 model. This model is used to illustrate the maximum proposed angular separation, including blocking for angular separation of 180°. The model is a 3D representation of a 3D-2-2-2 model, which is a type of 3D-2-2-2 model. The model is used to illustrate the maximum proposed angular separation, including blocking for angular separation of 180°.\nFigure 5.3.2-2: Illustration of maximum proposed angular separation including blocking for angular separation of 180°.\nAdditionally, placing two reflectors opposite to each other will yield higher variations in field/power measurements within the QZ caused by reflections from one reflector facing another head on. As illustrated in Figure 5.3.2-3, the two dark grey reflectors with 180° separation illuminate each other with plane waves, i.e., without much attenuation; scattering from the metal surfaces including edges of the reflector will thus reflect energy back towards the source probe. On the other hand, the cross coupling between the reflector at 0° and the red or blue reflectors is minimized as they are not in each other’s direct path. It was argued that the cross coupling between the two opposing reflectors should be insignificant given the large separation and thus large path losses. However, the reflectors are in each other’s collimated beam’s path, i.e., signal from the right reflector arriving at the left reflector should not have experienced much of an attenuation when compared to the signal at the QZ.\nIt should furthermore be highlighted that 2 AoA RRM systems currently limit the maximum separation between probes to 150° [12], specifically Table A.3.15.3-1.\nRequiring a 180° separation for multi-AoA Rx testing would therefore not allow a re-use of existing 2 AoA RRM systems as they would not be able to support the larger separation.\nThe figure depicts a 3D representation of a maximum proposed angular separation, including blocking for angular separation of 180°. The figure illustrates the concept of angular separation in a 3D space, with the axes representing the angular separation and the axes of the blockers. The figure is used to demonstrate the concept of angular separation in a 3D space, with the axes of the blockers representing the angular separation and the axes of the blockers representing the angular separation.\nFigure 5.3.2-3: Illustration of maximum proposed angular separation including blocking for angular separation of 180°.\n",

                            "text_content": "A full 3D scan, typically required for beam peak searches, spherical coverage test cases and TRP measurements, can be performed in various ways as illustrated in Table 5.3.3-1. Here, a single-probe, combined-axes OTA system with the probe aligned in the z direction is shown with two different methodologies to achieve a full 3D UE rotation/scan:\n-\tfull rotation in f (around z axis) and half rotation in q (around y axis) as shown in left column\n-\tfull rotation in q (around y axis) and half rotation in f (around z axis) as shown in right column\nAs shown in the table for the constant-step size grid with 312 grid points (Dq=Df=15°, 266 of which are unique due to the redundant points at the poles) on top or the constant-density grid with 200 grid points on the bottom, either approach will yield the same test point coverage.\nTable 5.3.3-1: 3D scan implementations and resulting coverage using single-probe system\n\nIt was agreed to define absolute probe locations as different 2D planes containing the various AoA probes were shown to have vastly different effects on the perceived DL directions by the UE, see Clause 5.3.1. For simplicity, sample test systems with just 4 total probes (1 AoA1 probe and 3 AoA2 probes) are considered next. Here, the AoA2 probes are displaced by 60° (P60), 120° (P120), and 150° (P150) from the AoA1 probe placed along the z direction (P0). As illustrated in Table 5.3.3-2, one system configuration has the AoA2 probes aligned in the xz plane (left), and another system configuration has the AoA2 probes aligned in the yz plane (right). Aside from studying the effect of different probe locations on the perceived DL directions, the two different 3D approaches are investigated as well, i.e., by rotating the device a full turn in f (rotation axis z) and a half turn in q (rotation axis y) as shown the top of Table 5.3.3-2 and alternatively, a full turn in q (rotation axis y) and a half turn in f (rotation axis z) as shown the bottom of Table 5.3.3-2.\nThe following analyses for constant step-size grids take into account that multiple measurements at the pole for P0 are performed; while these measurements yield unique DL directions for P0, they translate to non-unique DL directions for P60, P120, and P150.\nTable 5.3.3-2: System configurations with probes in the xz plane (left) and yz plane (right). 3D scan performed with full rotation in f and half rotation in q (top) and with full rotation in q and half rotation in f (bottom)\n\nThe system configurations with full rotation in  and half rotation in  and the perceived DL directions are further illustrated in Table 5.3.3-3 for a constant-step size grid with 312 grid points and in Table 5.3.3-4 for a constant density grid with 200 grid points. Similarly, the system configurations with full rotation in q and half rotation in f and the perceived DL directions are further illustrated in Table 5.3.3-5 for a constant-step size grid with 312 grid points and in Table 5.3.3-6 for a constant density grid with 200 grid points. The following observations can be made from these results:\n-    Probes aligned in the yz plane introduce large keep-out areas for the angular coverage/DL directions towards each pole.\n-    With full rotation in f and half rotation in q, probes aligned in the xz plane introduce a conical sector towards the pole at q=0° with no angular coverage/DL directions for offset probes.\n-    Constant density grids do not maintain the constant density coverage/DL direction distribution for probes offset from P0, a higher density of DL directions is observed especially near the poles.\n-    When probes are aligned in the xz plane, constant-step size grids maintain the constant-step size distribution of DL directions for probes offset from P0.\n-    Probes aligned in the xz plane generally provide a wider angular coverage for AoA2 DL directions when compared to probes aligned in the yz plane.\n-    With full rotation in q and half rotation in f and probes aligned in the xz plane, the AoA2 DL directions are distributed in 3D without a conical region with lack of coverage.\n-    Only with full rotation in q and half rotation in f, probes aligned in the xz plane, and constant-step size grids, uniform angular coverage/DL directions is achieved, i.e., the distribution of DL directions for all probes on the xz plane match the distribution of grid points.\nBased on the observations made in this section, the following decisions were made:\n-\tFor optimized AoA1 and AoA2 test point/perceived DL direction coverage, apply a full rotation in  and a half rotation in .\n-\tFor optimized AoA1 and AoA2 test point/perceived DL direction coverage, utilize constant-step size grids only.\n-\tFor optimized AoA1 and AoA2 test point/perceived DL direction coverage, place the AoA2 probes in the xz plane\nTable 5.3.3-3: DL directions perceived by the DUT from two different system configurations with AoA2 to AoA1 probe offsets of 60°, 120°, and 150° with a constant-step size grid using 312 grid points (Dq=Df=15°).

For better visualization purposes, a coarse measurement grid with 84 grid points for the constant-step size grid (Dq=Df=30°) and 50 grid points for the constant density grid is considered.\nThe DL directions and polarizations perceived by the DUT for a sample system with the AoA1 probe in the z direction and AoA2 probes in the x and y directions are presented in Table 5.3.4-1 for just the constant-step size grid. The magenta arrows demonstrate the q polarization while the orange arrows demonstrate the f polarization with respect to the probe antenna/system coordinate system. Clearly, for the probes placed in the z and x directions, the DL polarizations w.r.t. the DUT coordinate system are preserved, i.e., the probe antenna DL q/f polarization matches the DUT q/f polarization. However, for the probe along the y axis, the DL polarization perceived by the DUT changes depending on grid point. Similar observations can be made for a system configuration with multiple AoA2 probes placed on the xz and the yz planes. The system configurations with full rotation in  and half rotation in  and the perceived DL directions are further illustrated in Table 5.3.4-2 for the constant-step size grid and in Table 5.3.4-3 for the constant density grid. Similarly, the system configurations with full rotation in q and half rotation in f and the perceived DL directions are further illustrated in Table 5.3.4-4 for the constant-step size grid and in Table 5.3.4-5 for the constant density grid.\nThese results again show that the probe antenna DL q/f-polarizations from AoA2 probes (w.r.t. the system coordinate system) are preserved only when the AoA2 probes are placed in the xz plane, i.e., antenna DL q/f polarizations map to DUT q/f polarizations, while this is no longer the case for AoA2 probes are placed in the yz plane, i.e., probe antenna DL q/f polarizations generally map to a combination of DUT q/f polarizations.\n\nTable 5.3.4-1: DL direction and polarizations perceived by the DUT from probes in the x, y, and z axes.\n\n\nTable 5.3.4-2: DL direction perceived by the DUT from two different system configurations with AoA2 to AoA1 probe offsets of 60°, 120°, and 150° with a constant-step size spherical coverage grid using 84 grid points (Dq=Df=30°).

For better visualization purposes, a coarse measurement grid with 84 grid points for the constant-step size grid (Dq=Df=30°) and 50 grid points for the constant density grid is considered. Given the clear advantages of the 3D measurement scan using a full rotation in q and half rotation in f for multi-AoA testing, only this approach is further considered here.\nThe AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors, i.e., the vectors between the DL orientation perceived by the UE from AoA1 to AoA2, are visualized in Table 5.3.5-1 for the constant step-size grid and in Table 5.3.5-2 for the constant-density grid. The vectors are illustrated in two different ways. In the figures on the left, e.g.,\n\nthe AoA1 DL directions are plotted on top of the sphere with the black marker while the AoA2 DL directions are plotted slightly elevated from the sphere for clarity. The corresponding AoA1 & AoA2 pairs received by the UE are connected with arrows (pointing from AoA1 to AoA2) with the arrows plotted in random colours to support better differentiation. In the figures on the right, e.g.,\n\nonly the AoA1 DL directions are plotted on top of the sphere with the black marker while the direction towards the corresponding offset AoA2 DL direction is visualized with the single arrow (the length of the arrow corresponds to the value of the offset).\nThe following observations can be drawn from these figures:\n-    With probes aligned in the xz axis, the AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors point towards the pole at q=180° for DL directions perceived from y≥0 while the AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors point towards the pole at q=0° for DL directions perceived from y≤0\n-    With probes aligned in the yz axis, the AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors point towards positive f for DL directions perceived from y≥0 while the AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors point towards negative f for DL directions perceived from y≤0.\nIt was agreed that the directionality of the AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors matters. For simulations, testing both +AoA offset and –AoA offset for each test point was considered the starting point. The intention is to accommodate the impact from directionality of the AoA1-AoA2 DL orientation vectors, i.e., to ensure no testing bias is introduced or whether it needs to be compensated somehow.\n\nTable 5.3.5-1: Vectors of DL orientations between AoA1 (P0) and AoA2 from two different system configurations with AoA2 to AoA1 probe offsets of 60°, 120°, and 150° with a constant-step size grid using 84 grid points (Dq=Df=30°).

An example measurement setup of multi-Rx chain DL reception RRM test case for Category 1 scenario is illustrated in Figure 6.2.1-1.\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for Category 1 scenario, illustrating the various components and their arrangement. The setup includes a 100-meter cable, a 100-ohm load, and a 100-ohm resistor, all connected to a 100-ohm load. The setup is designed to measure the current and voltage waveforms of the load, as well as the voltage waveform of the cable. The setup is used to validate the accuracy of the load and cable models, and to ensure that the load and cable are suitable for the measurement.\nFigure 6.2.1-1: Example measurement setup for Category 1 scenario.\nThe figure depicts a time and frequency multiplexed downlink transmission for Category 1 scenario, illustrating the transmission of data over a single frequency band. The transmission is designed to ensure efficient use of the available bandwidth and minimize interference. The figure includes various components such as the transmitter, receiver, and the downlink signal path, which are essential for the successful transmission of data.\nFigure 6.2.1-2: Example of Time and Frequency multiplexed downlink transmission for Category 1 scenario\nAs illustrated in Figure 6.2.1-2, PDCCH/PDSCH from two AoAs transmit in the FDM manner. PBCH measurement is based on TDM manner. For CSI-RS, the measurements could be based on TDM/FDM/CDM.\nDual TCI switching is the key test case in multi-Rx chain DL reception RRM testing. To verify the performance of Dual TCI switching, the following 4 options were discussed:\n-\tOption 1: Dual TCI switches simultaneously, probe number for multiple AoA test system is at least 4\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for a Category 2 scenario with 4 probes, illustrating the use of optical fiber cables and fiber-optic connectors. The setup includes a 4-port fiber-optic splitter, a 4-port fiber-optic cable, and a 4-port fiber-optic connector. The 4-port fiber-optic splitter is used to split the signal into 4 separate paths, while the 4-port fiber-optic cable is used to connect the splitter to the 4-port fiber-optic connector. The 4-port fiber-optic connector is used to connect the fiber-optic cable to the 4-port fiber-optic splitter. The setup is designed to ensure that the signal is split into 4 separate paths, allowing for the analysis of each path separately.\nFigure 6.2.1-3: Example measurement setup for Option 1 of Category 2 scenario with 4 probes\nFor option 1, in the period of T1, DUT connects TCI state 0 and TCI state 1 via probe#1 and probe#2 respectively. Then in the period of T2, TCI state 0 switches to TCI state 3 via switching between probe#1 and probe#4, and in the meanwhile, TCI state 1 switches to TCI state 2 via switching between probe#2 and probe#3.\n-\tOption 2: Dual TCI switches from one probe to two probes simultaneously, probe number for multiple AoA test system is at least 3\n\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for a Category 2 scenario with 3 probes, illustrating the use of optical fiber cables and optical line terminals (OLTs) to transmit and receive signals.

In the period of T2, DUT measures the SSBs from Probe#2 and Probe#3 while keeping the connection from Probe 1. And then DUT simultaneously switches from Probe#1 to Probe#2 and #3.\nAn example measurement setup of multi-Rx chain DL reception RRM test case for Category 2 scenario with 3 probes is illustrated in Figure 6.2.1-5. PDCCH/PDSCH from two AoAs transmit in the FDM manner. PBCH measurement is based on TDM manner. For CSI-RS, the measurements could be based on TDM/FDM/CDM.\nFor the testing with Option 2, the side conditions for the period T1 and T1 are as follows. In the period of T1, the candidate test direction is selected from legacy EIS spherical coverage. In the period of T2, the candidate test directions (AoA pairs) are selected from multi-Rx spherical coverage requirements defined in UE RF core requirements.\nNote that Figure 6.2.1-4 and Figure 6.2.1-5 show an example test procedure for Dual TCI switching. Other test procedures with at least 3 probes measurement setup are not precluded. The details of RRM test cases are to be discussed in the corresponding work item.\n-\tOption 3: Dual TCI switches simultaneously, but the beam directions are not changed, probe number for multiple AoA test system is at least 2\n\nThe figure depicts a measurement setup for Option 3 of Category 2 scenario with two probes, illustrating the setup for a 6 GHz frequency band. The setup includes a 2x2 MIMO antenna array, a 100-GHz 5G base station (gNB), and two 5G sub-6 GHz transceivers (Tx-Rx). The setup is designed to measure the performance of the 5G network, including signal strength, interference, and signal quality.\nFigure 6.2.1-6: Example measurement setup for Option 3 of Category 2 scenario with 2 probes\nFor option 3, in the period of T1, DUT connects TCI state 0 and TCI state 1 via Pol.H of probe#1 and Pol.H of probe#2, respectively.

For multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF requirements, the percentage of 2AoA spherical coverage is specified. Therefore, the new requirements of 2AoA are quite similar as legacy EIS spherical coverage requirements. While the difference between multi-Rx chain DL reception requirement and legacy EIS spherical coverage requirement measurement is that DL power is not scanning with a DL power step size in multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF testing. It says in multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF testing, the throughput of UE is measured at a fixed DL power, i.e., legacy EIS spherical coverage power level.\nAs specified in Table B.19.2-2 of [13], each MU element is described as dB value that could not totally apply for multi-Rx chain DL reception UE MU analysis. Additionally, the difference of probability between candidate measurement grids measurement step size could be evaluated and provided based on the simulations. Therefore, it is agreed to use the percentage value as the metric for the 2AoA UE RF MU analysis.\nThe preliminary MU budget for UE RF testing methodology is defined in Table A.1-1 and Table A.1-2.\nTable A.1-1: Uncertainty assessment for wanted DL signal absolute power in 2AoA coverage measurement with IFF\n\nA.1-2: Total uncertainty assessment for 2AoA coverage measurement with IFF\n\n",

            "description": "Considering +AoA and -AoA are always on the meridian, the Reference coordinate system is used for Rel-18 multi-Rx testing. The Alternate coordinate system could be considered for the cases when the AoA pairs do not lie along the same meridian.\nThe performance of UEs with multi-Rx chain reception DL with 2 active AoA is agreed to be measured with 3D scan on the spherical surface using constant step size grids. Therefore, the test point of AoA1 on the spherical surface can be expressed as  in the same way it is defined for legacy RF testing with 1 AoA. In the case of the AoA2, the test points require certain angle separation with respect to AoA1. However, the direction of AoA2, which is also called as “AoA1-AoA2 DL Orientation Vector” in clause 5.3.5, may introduce ambiguity without additional instructions. The situation is illustrated in Figure B.2-1.\nFigure B.2-1 illustrates the possible AoA pairs on the test point of AoA1, highlighting the impact of different antenna configurations on the received signal strength.\nFigure B.2-1 Illustration of possible AoA pairs on the test point of AoA1\nIn order to simplify the representation of the AoA pairs per test points of AoA1, the alternate coordinate system nomenclature described in this section can be used to express the AoA pairs with one coordinate, and it could be used also for the situation whereAoA2 does not lie in the same meridian as of AoA1.\nIn this alternate coordinate system nomenclature for 2AoA testing. the Reference coordinates of AoA1 (θ, ϕ) could be extended to  (θ, ϕ, ω), where ω corresponds to the AoA1-AoA2 DL Orientation Vector. In detail, ω is the angle between the AoA1-AoA2 DL Orientation Vector and the reference axis in the assistant plane.\nThe assistant plane is orthogonal to the AoA1 direction , and the Z’ axis correspond to the projection of the meridian (points with same fixed  angle) of AoA1 into the assistant plane. I.e. in case of , +Z’ corresponds to the cross point of +Z axis and the assistant plane (see Figure B.2-2a). In case of , -Z’ corresponds to the cross point of -Z axis and the assistant plane (see Figure B.2-2b).\nThe figure B.2-2 illustrates the Assistant Plane of the alternate coordinate system, which is used to represent the position of the assistant plane in the 3D space. The figure shows the assistant plane in a 3D coordinate system, with the x-axis representing the position of the assistant plane in the 3D space, and the y-axis representing the position of the assistant plane in the 2D space. The z-axis represents the position of the assistant plane in the 3D space. The figure also includes a legend that explains the different colors and symbols used to represent the assistant plane in the 3D space.\nFigure B.2-2 Illustration of Assistant Plane of the alternate coordinate system\nFinally, ω is the angle from the reference axis Z’ to the AoA1-AoA2 DL Orientation Vector in clockwise direction (see Figure B.2-3).\nThe figure B.2-3 illustrates the angle ω in the alternate coordinate system, which is a crucial component in the analysis of the telecommunication signal propagation in a 5G network. The figure shows the angle ω as a function of the distance from the transmitter (Tx) to the receiver (Rx), with the angle ω being a measure of the signal's angle of arrival (AoA) at the receiver. This angle is essential for understanding the signal's path and the impact of various factors such as the distance between the transmitter and receiver, the presence of obstacles, and the use of beamforming techniques. The figure also includes a legend to help interpret the different symbols and their meanings.\nFigure B.2-3 Illustration of angle ω in the alternate coordinate system\nThis alternate coordinate system can also cover the theoretical cases when the AoA pairs do not lie along the same meridian, and eliminate the possible ambiguity on test point expression.\n\n",

Re-positioning approach is adopted for multi-Rx performance measurements to avoid AoA blockage.\nAs the starting point, the initial positioner/UE orientation is selected to be (-90° - ½ angular separation).

For multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF testing, it has already known that measured performance of a UE is expected to systematically vary as a function of position. This systematic variation means that the strategy to completely randomize the orientation of the UE to determine MU does not apply. Moreover, for the measurement grid analysis for multi-Rx, the AoA pairs lie along longitudes of the UE reference coordination system, and the requirements apply only for the UE-declared orientation in the positioner. Therefore, it is agreed that uncertainty mechanism for multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF testing is limited to the coarseness of the grid and doesn’t depend on the UE random orientations as the legacy approach.\nThrough the analysis from simulation results with antenna configuration of 6x2 and 4x2, 15deg is selected as the step size of constant-step grid.\n\n",
