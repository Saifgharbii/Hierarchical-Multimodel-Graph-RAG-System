Jean-Yves FINE, Thales in SP-220967, with the assistance of M. Amer Catovic, Qualcomm, for the \"Terminal and Core Network aspects\".\nIntroduction\nThe \" Integration of satellite components in the 5G architecture” work item adds or enhances a number of features in 5GCore architecture in order to support Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), for several use cases:\nCoverage extension: Many commercial activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry take place outside inhabited areas. Coverage extension with satellite networks is useful to enable e.g. voice communication, video monitoring, and remote control in uncovered or under-covered areas.\nInternet of Things: many Internet-of-Things applications relate to monitoring of assets (e.g. ships, trains, trucks), infrastructure (e.g. bridges, pipelines, railway track), or the environment (e.g. agriculture sensors). In many IoT applications, only small amounts of data are exchanged and communication is optimized for low power usage. Satellite communication should also be able to address these requirements.\nDisaster communication: Public safety authorities have a responsibility to provide assistance in case of natural disasters. This requires communication, also in cases where because of that disaster the cellular infrastructure is damaged. Satellite communication can be used as fall back for these cases. Ideally the user equipment (UE) and way of working when cellular networks are available should also be usable with satellite access.\nGlobal roaming: Applications like tracking and tracing of containers need to be available globally across satellite and terrestrial networks. When a container is in a harbour or transported on a truck, using a terrestrial cellular network is probably most efficient. However, when the container is on a ship in the middle of an ocean, only satellite communication is possible.\nBroadcasting: Satellite communication is particularly suitable to broadcast the same information over a very wide area. This can also be used in context of 5G mobile edge applications (e.g. mobile gaming), where application content needs to be available in many different edge locations.\n\nTo address such use cases, 3GPP has set Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets for satellite in TS 22.261 [1].\nAt 5G Core Network architecture level, in SA2, a dedicated study on architecture aspects for using satellite access in 5G (FS_5GSAT_ARCH) was conducted to select the solutions able to cope with satellite specific key issues. The outcome of the study (TR 23.737 [2]) identifies the impacts of satellite integration in the 5GS and solutions to adjust the 5G system accordingly.\nThe 5GSAT_ARCH work item, following the study, updated architecture specifications (TS 23.501 [4], TS 23.502 [5], TS 23.503 [6]) to implement the solutions identified.\nIn CT1, TR 24.821 [3] studied \"Non-Terrestrial Impact of PLMN selection procedure\" and, following 5GSAT_ARCH_CT, led to update TS 23.122 [7] and TS 24.501 [8].\nFurthermore, RAN has defined \"3GPP defined radio access networks supporting non-Terrestrial Networks\" [10], described in the next clause.\n\nArchitectural/general aspects\nA PLMN core network can be connected to a satellite NG-RAN. A satellite NG-RAN can be shared between more than one core networks.\nSatellite NG-RAN can be used as a new RAN 3GPP access but also as backhaul between the core and terrestrial access network, providing a transport for the N1/N2/N3 reference points.\nMulti-connectivity and URLLC over satellite are not considered in Rel-17. Basic assumptions are that UEs are equipped with GNSS, and transparent mode: satellites (LEO/MEO/GEO) are relaying the Uu interface only at physical layer level.\nImpacts on 5GC of Satellite NG-RAN used as new RAN 3GPP access\nIn Rel-17, only direct access with transparent satellite is considered, as shown in following figure:\n\n\nFigure 1: Direct access with transparent satellite\nImpacts of satellites onto 5GS are linked to the size of the cells (larger than the terrestrial ones), the fact that the satellite cells can be fix on earth, when beam is steerable, but also moving on earth, when beam is not steerable. This characteristics impacts 5GS mobility management, i.e. the management of the handover of radio bearer between nodes and the management of the reachability of a UE for downlink services (paging), that need to be adapted to take into account both the satellite beam size and fix or moving cells configuration.\nA basic assumption in Re-17 is that tracking areas (TAs) and cell identities (cell IDs) refer to specific geographical areas, so that 5G services can use these identifiers as representation of a UE location.\nTo avoid Tracking Area Codes (TAC) fluctuations, in the moving cells case, it has been decided that the Radio Access Network will broadcast in the cell the list of Tracking Area Codes, corresponding to tracking areas that have been define on the earth surface through network planning, for the zone currently enlighten by the radio cell.\nNew Radio Access Technology types are introduced in the 5GC to distinguish between different satellite configurations (LEO, MEO, GEO, other).\nThe distance earth – satellite also introduces higher delay values than for terrestrial cells and new 5QI is also introduced in TR 23.501 [4] to cope with this delay, depending on the satellite RAT type.\nImpacts on 5GC of Satellite NG-RAN used as backhaul\nRel-17 only considers backhauling with constant delay. Here, the satellite operator is able to mask any delay changes in service/feeder links by exploiting the knowledge of the satellite position to calculate how much variable delay should be added to keep the overall delay constant. Connecting gNBs to 5GC via, e.g., a single GEO satellite or a single NGSO satellite without ISLs are examples of such backhauling as shown in following figure.\nThe figure depicts a satellite backhauling scenario with constant delay, illustrating the impact of satellite positioning and communication on the overall network performance.\nFigure 2: satellite backhauling with constant delay\nBackhauling with constant delay minimizes the impact on the 3GPP network architecture. However, there are following new features introduced in TR 23.501 [4] related to the QoS aspects of satellite backhauling:\no\tReporting of satellite backhaul category to the 5G Core Network.\no\tNew 5G QoS Indicator (5QI) defined for satellite backhaul and satellite access.\nTerminal and Core Network aspects\nPLMN selection procedure is updated for satellite integration in 5GS. Then, in the continuity of the study done in TR 24.821 [3], the following aspects of UE impact at the NAS layer (including PLMN selection) have ben specified by CT1:\n-\tNew “NG-RAN satellite” RAT type in USIM\n-\tExtension of the NAS supervision timers over satellite access  for GEO and MEO RAT types (LEO uses legacy timers)\n-\tModification of the higher priority PLMN selection procedure to include shared MCC 9xx\n-\tNew minimum periodic search timer for higher priority PLMN search over satellite access when PLMN uses shared MCC\n-\tNew trigger for PLMN selection upon transition in/out international areas (based on UE implementation)\n-\tNew Forbidden List of PLMNs not allowed to operate at UE location and its handling\n-\tNew  5GMM cause value#78 and its handling (related to the list in the previous bullet)\n-\tSupport for multiple TACs for the same PLMN broadcast in the radio cell, including corresponding logic for determining the “Current TAI” and impact on ME-USIM procedures\nThere are corresponding network impacts.\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTS 22.261: “Service Requirements for the 5G System”.\n[2]\t\tTR 23.737: “Study on architecture aspects for using satellite access in 5G”;\n[3]\t\tTR 24.821: “Study on PLMN selection for satellite access in 5G”;\n[4]\t\tTR 23.501: “System architecture for the 5G System (5GS), Stage 2”;\n[5]\t\tTR 23.502: “Procedures for the 5G System (5GS), Stage 2”;\n[6]\t\tTR 23.503: “Policy and charging control for the 5G System (5GS), Stage 2”;\n[7]\t\tTR 23.122: “Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode”;\n[8]\t\tTR 24.501: “Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocols for the 5G System (5GS), Stage3”\n[9]\t\tRP-221946 “Summary for NR support for Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN)”\n[10]\tRP-221169 “Solutions for NR to support non-terrestrial networks (NTN)” / UID 860046\n\n",

NTN refers to networks, or segments of networks, using a spaceborne vehicle or an airborne vehicle for transmission, defined as follows:\n•\tSpaceborne vehicles: Geosynchronous (GSO) and Non-Geosynchronous (NGSO) orbiting satellites. NGSO includes Low Earth Orbit at altitude approximately between 300 km and 1500 km and Medium Earth Orbit at altitude approximately between 7000 km and 25000 km.\n•\tAirborne vehicles: High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) encompassing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) including Lighter than Air UAS (LTA), Heavier than Air UAS (HTA), all operating in altitudes typically between 8 and 50 km, quasi-stationary.\nThis clause present the RAN aspects while the System and core network aspects (\"5GSAT_ARCH\") are covered in the next clause.\nThe addressed radio specifics of NTN compared to 5G terrestrial networks include\n•\tDelay variation, Doppler variation as well as possible Earth moving radio cells, due to the motion of space/airborne vehicles\n•\tLong latency due to the altitude of the space/airborne vehicles\n•\tDifferential delay and possible multi country cell coverage due to larger radio cell size\n•\tDifferent propagation channel model (See 3GPP 38.811)\n•\tDifferent radio unit performance due to specific payload performance\nOverall architecture and general aspects\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, non-terrestrial access is provided by means of an NTN payload, i.e. a network node on-board a satellite or HAPS, and an NTN Gateway interconnected by a feeder link, the UE accessing NTN network services through the NTN payload via a service link.\n\n\nFigure 1: Overall illustration of an NTN (from TS 38.300 [4])\nThe NTN payload transparently forwards the radio protocol received from the UE (via the service link) to the NTN Gateway (via the feeder link) and vice-versa. A gNB may serve multiple NTN payloads while an NTN payload may be served by multiple gNBs.\nThree types of service links are supported:\n-\tEarth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) continuously covering the same geographical areas all the time (e.g., the case of GSO satellites);\n-\tQuasi-Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) covering one geographic area for a limited period and a different geographic area during another period (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating steerable beams);\n-\tEarth-moving: provisioned by beam(s) whose coverage area slides over the Earth surface (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating fixed or non-steerable beams).\nWith NGSO satellites, the NTN gNB can provide either quasi-Earth-fixed cell coverage or Earth-moving cell coverage, while gNB operating with GSO satellite can provide Earth fixed cell coverage.\nTiming, Synchronization and HARQ enhancements (RAN1)\nThe network broadcast ephemeris information and common Timing Advance (common TA) parameters in each NTN cell. Since NTN capable UE are expected to be all GNSS-capable, they shall acquire a valid GNSS position as well as the satellite ephemeris and common TA before connecting to an NTN cell.\nTo achieve uplink synchronisation, before performing random access, the UE shall autonomously pre-compensate the Timing Advance, as well as the frequency Doppler shift by considering the common TA (information from the gNB), the UE position, the satellite position and satellite velocity through the satellite ephemeris. In connected mode, the UE shall continuously update the Timing Advance and frequency pre-compensation. If the UE does not have a valid GNSS position and/or valid satellite ephemeris, it does not communicate with the network until both are regained. The UEs may be configured to report Timing Advance at initial access or in connected mode. In connected mode triggered reporting of the Timing Advance is supported.\nWhile the pre-compensation of the instantaneous Doppler shift experienced on the service link is to be performed by the UE for the uplink, the management of Doppler shift experienced over the feeder link is left to the network implementation.\nTo accommodate the propagation delay in NTNs, several timing relationships are enhanced by a Common Timing Advance (Common TA) and two scheduling offsets   and   .   is a configured offset that corresponds to the Round Trip Time (RTT) between the Reference Point (RP) and the NTN payload.   is a configured scheduling offset that approximately corresponds to the sum of the service link RTT and the common TA.  is a configured offset that approximately corresponds to the RTT between the RP and the gNB.\nTo mitigate the impact of HARQ stalling in NTN the HARQ feedback can be disabled in the presence of ARQ re-transmissions at the RLC layer (e.g., in GSO satellite systems) and/or the number of HARQ processes for re-transmissions at the MAC layer can be increased to 32 (e.g., in NGSO satellite systems).\nMobility Management (RAN2)\nTo enable mobility in NTN, the network provides serving cell's and neighbouring cell's satellite ephemeris needed to access the target serving NTN cell in the handover command.\nUE supports mobility between NTN and Terrestrial Network (i.e. from NTN to Terrestrial Network (hand-in) and from Terrestrial Network to NTN (hand-out)), but is not required to connect to both NTN and Terrestrial Network at the same time. It may also support mobility between radio access technologies based on different orbit (GSO, NGSO at different altitude).\nTriggering conditions upon which UE may execute Conditional Hand-Over (CHO) to a candidate cell, have been introduced: event A4, time-based trigger condition, location-based trigger condition. The two last conditions are configured together with one of the measurement-based trigger conditions. Location is defined by the distance between UE and a reference location. Time is defined by the time between T1 and T2, where T1 is an absolute time value and T2 is a duration started at T1.\nFor the measurements the network can configure multiple SS/PBCH Block Measurement Timing Configuration (SMTCs) in parallel per carrier and for a given set of cells depending on UE capabilities using propagation delay difference and ephemeris information. It can also configure measurement gaps based on multiple SMTC.\nThe adjustment of SMTCs is possible under network control based on UE assistance information if available for connected mode and under UE control based on UE location and satellite assistance information (e.g., ephemeris, common TA parameters) for idle/inactive modes.\nIn the quasi-earth fixed cell scenario, UE can perform time-based and location-based measurement in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE. The timing and location information associated to a cell are provided via system information. They refer respectively to the time when the serving cell is going to stop serving a geographical area and to the reference location of serving cell.\nA Tracking Area corresponds to a fixed geographical area. Any respective mapping is configured in the RAN. The network may broadcast multiple Tracking Area Codes (TAC) per PLMN in a NR NTN cell in order to reduce the signalling load at cell edge, in particular for Earth-moving cell coverage. A TAC change in the System Information is under network control and may not be exactly synchronised with real-time illumination of beams on ground.\nRegarding the UE location aspects, upon network request, after AS security is established in connected mode, a UE should report its coarse UE location information (most significant bits of the GNSS coordinates, ensuring an  accuracy in the order of 2 km) to the NG-RAN if available.\nSwitch-over (RAN3)\nA service link switch refers to a change of serving satellite.\nA feeder link switch over is the procedure where the feeder link is changed from a source NTN Gateway to a target NTN Gateway for a specific NTN payload. The feeder link switch over is a Transport Network Layer procedure. Both hard and soft feeder link switch over are applicable to NTN.\nService and feeder link switch overs apply mostly for the case of NGSO.\nNG-RAN signalling (RAN3)\nThe Cell Identity, indicated by the gNB to the Core Network as part of the User Location Information corresponds to a Mapped Cell ID, irrespective of the orbit of the NTN payload or the types of service links supported. It is used for Paging Optimization in NG interface, Area of Interest and Public Warning Services.\nThe Cell Identity included within the target identification of the handover messages allows identifying the correct target radio cell as well as for RAN paging.\nThe mapping between Mapped Cell IDs and geographical areas is configured in the RAN and Core Network. The gNB is responsible for constructing the Mapped Cell ID based on the UE location info received from the UE, if available. The mapping may be pre-configured (e.g., up to operator's policy) or up to implementation.\nThe gNB reports the broadcasted TAC(s) of the selected Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) as part of UE Location Information (ULI). In case the gNB knows the UE's location information, the gNB may determine the Tracking Area Indicator (TAI) the UE is currently located in and provide that TAI to the AMF as part of ULI.\nAMF (Re-)Selection by gNB (RAN3)\nFor a RRC_CONNECTED UE, when the gNB is configured to ensure that the UE connects to an AMF that serves the country in which the UE is located. If the gNB detects that the UE is in a different country to that served by the serving AMF, then it should perform an NG handover to change to an appropriate AMF, or initiate an UE Context Release Request procedure towards the serving AMF (in which case the AMF may decide to de-register the UE).\nO&M Requirements (RAN3)\nThe NTN related parameters, as listed in clause 16.14.7 of TS 38.300, shall be provided by O&M to the gNB providing non-terrestrial access. Additional NTN related parameters in Annex B4 of TS 38.300 may be provided by O&M to the gNB for its operation.\nRF performances and RRM requirements (RAN4)\nBased on coexistence studies captured in TR 38.863, the minimum RF and performance requirements in FR1 for respectively NR User Equipment (UE) supporting satellite access operation and NR Satellite Access Node (SAN) are defined in TS 38.101-5 and TS 38.108.\nFigure 2 illustrate the satellite access node which encompass on ground non-NTN infrastructure gNB functions, gateway and feeder link and the RF functions of the NTN payload.\nThe figure depicts a satellite access node (SAN) from the Telecommunication Standardization Sector 38.108, which is a crucial component in satellite communication systems. The figure illustrates the structure and components of a satellite communication system, including the satellite itself, the ground station (GS), and the communication link between the two. The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure reliable communication in the event of a failure.\nFigure 2: Satellite Access Node (SAN) (from TS 38.108 [16])\nThe considered operating bands in frequency range FR1 are defined in Table 1:\nTable 1: Satellite operating bands [16]\n\nRF requirements of an NTN capable UE (as defined in TS 38.101-5) requires the same RF performance as UE operating with terrestrial network. This allows connectivity to both NTN or Terrestrial Network.\nNote that RF requirements of the SAN as defined in TS 38.108 [16] are lower compared to the BS RF requirements of a terrestrial network as defined in TS 38.104 [19].\nSpecific requirements for radio resource management in NTN are defined in TS 38.133. They mostly relate to specific delay as well as timing and frequency errors in the different procedures.\nIn addition to SAN, RF requirements of HAPS were defined in TS 38.104 [19] as HAPS BS class which refers to Wide Area BS class without additional changes.\nNR operating band n1 can be applied for HAPS operation, as defined in TS 38.104 [19].\nNR UEs as defined by current TS 38.101-1 can support HAPS deployments with no additional changes needed in TS 38.101-1.\nReferences\n[1] TS 38.211\t\tNR; Physical channels and modulation (RAN1)\n[2] TS 38.213\t\tNR; Physical layer procedures for control (RAN1)\n[3] TS 38.214\t\tNR; Physical layer procedures for data (RAN1)\n[4] TS 38.300\t\tNR; Overall description; Stage-2 (RAN2)\n[5] TS 38.304\t\tNR; User Equipment (UE) procedures in idle mode and in RRC Inactive state  (RAN2)\n[6] TS 38.306\t\tNR; User Equipment (UE) radio access capabilities (RAN2)\n[7] TS 38.321\t\tNR; Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol specification (RAN2)\n[8] TS 38.322\t\tNR; Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol specification (RAN2)\n[9] TS 38.323\t\tNR; Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) specification (RAN2)\n[10] TS 38.331\tNR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification (RAN2)\n[11] TS 38.401\tNG-RAN; Architecture description (RAN3)\n[12] TS 38.410\tNG-RAN; NG general aspects and principles (RAN3)\n[13] TS 38.413\tNG-RAN; NG Application Protocol (NGAP) (RAN3)\n[14] TS 38.423\tNG-RAN; NG-RAN; Xn Application Protocol (XnAP) (RAN3)\n[15] TS 38.101-5\tNR; User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and reception, part 5: Satellite access Radio Frequency (RF) and performance requirements (RAN4)\n[16] TS 38.108\tNR; Satellite Access Node radio transmission and reception (RAN4)\n[17] TS 38.133\tNR; Requirements for support of radio resource management (RAN4)\n[18] TR 38.863\tNon-terrestrial networks (NTN)related RF and co-existence aspects (RAN4)\n[19] TS 38.104\tNR; Base Station (BS) radio transmission and reception (RAN4)\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc. in SP-220455 (merge of RP-221547 and CP-221272).\nThe \"NB-IoT/eMTC support for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)\" work item specifies enhanced features necessary for the support of Bandwidth reduced Low complexity (BL) UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs by Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN).\nSA and CT aspects of NB-IoT/eMTC Non-Terrestrial Networks in EPS provide minimum essential functionality for the Rel-17 UE and the network to support satellite E-UTRAN access in WB-S1 mode or NB-S1 mode with CIoT EPS optimization. The functionality is largely aligned with that of Rel-17 NR Non-Terrestrial Networks in 5GS, with the exception of discontinuous coverage that is addressed only within the present work item in Rel-17.\nOverall architecture and general aspects:\nE-UTRAN supports radio access over non-terrestrial networks for BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs. Non-terrestrial networks encompasses platforms that provide radio access through satellites in Geosynchronous orbits (GSO) as well as Non-Geosynchronous Orbit (NGSO), which includes Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, non-terrestrial access is provided by means of an NTN payload, i.e. a network node on-board a satellite, and an NTN Gateway interconnected by a feeder link, the UE accessing NTN network services through the NTN payload via a service link.\nThe figure depicts an NTN (Network Topology Node) with various components such as switches, routers, and network elements. The NTN is a crucial component in network architecture, facilitating the routing of data packets and ensuring efficient communication.\nFigure 1: Overall illustration of an NTN\nThree types of service links are supported:\n-\tEarth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) continuously covering the same geographical areas all the time (e.g., the case of GSO satellites);\n-\tQuasi-Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) covering one geographic area for a limited period of time and a different geographic area during another period of time (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating steerable beams);\n-\tEarth-moving: provisioned by beam(s) whose coverage area slides over the Earth surface (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating fixed or non-steerable beams).\nWith NGSO satellites, the eNB can provide either quasi-Earth-fixed cell coverage or Earth-moving cell coverage, while eNB operating with GSO satellites can provide Earth fixed cell coverage or quasi-Earth-fixed cell coverage.\nSupport for BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs over NTN is only applicable to E-UTRA connected to EPC.\nOnly BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs with GNSS capability are supported.\nTiming and Synchronization:\nThe network broadcasts ephemeris information and common Timing Advance (common TA) parameters in each NTN cell. A UE shall acquire its GNSS position as well as the satellite ephemeris and common TA before connecting to an NTN cell. To achieve uplink synchronisation, before performing random access, the UE shall autonomously pre-compensate the Timing Advance, as well as the frequency doppler shift by considering the common TA, the UE position and the satellite position through the satellite ephemeris. In connected mode, the UE shall continuously update the Timing Advance and frequency pre-compensation, but the UE is not expected to perform GNSS acquisition. The UE does not perform any transmissions due to outdated satellite ephemeris, common TA or GNSS position based on timers. In connected mode, upon outdated satellite ephemeris and common Timing Advance, the UE re-acquires the broadcasted parameters and upon outdated GNSS position the UE moves to idle mode. The UEs may be configured to report Timing Advance at initial access or in connected mode. In connected mode triggered reporting of the Timing Advance is supported.\nFor downlink synchronization in case of NB-IoT, the two LSB of the ARFCN is signalled in MIB for bands for which a 200 kHz channel raster is not supported, and the legacy 100 kHz raster is used. Otherwise, for bands for which a 200 kHz channel raster is supported, there is no signalling of ARFCN information in MIB.\nDownlink and uplink timings are frame aligned at the uplink time synchronization reference point (RP). To accommodate the long propagation delays in NTN, the timing relationships are enhanced by the support of two scheduling offsets:   and   as illustrated in Figure 2:\nThe figure depicts the timing relationship parameters of a 5G network, illustrating the relationship between the time of arrival (TOA) and the time of departure (TOD) of signals. The figure shows the various components involved in the timing process, such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, which are essential for ensuring reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure 2: Timing relationship parameters\nUplink segmented transmission is supported for uplink transmission with repetitions. The UE shall apply UE pre-compensation per segment of UL transmission of PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage and NPUSCH/NPRACH for NB-IoT from one segment to the next segment. The configuration of uplink transmission segment is indicated on SIB for initial access and can be re-configured by RRC signalling.\nDiscontinuous coverage and assistance information:\nAs a satellite moves on a specified orbit, for example in case of a NGSO satellite, the satellite beam(s) coverage area may move and cover different portions of a geographical area due to the orbital movement of the satellite. As a consequence, a UE located in the concerned geographical area may experience a situation of discontinuous coverage, due to e.g., a sparse satellite constellation deployment.\nThe network may broadcast assistance information relating to the serving satellite and other satellites of the constellation to enable UEs to predict upcoming satellites fly-over periods and save power during periods of no coverage. The broadcast assistance information includes SGP4 ephemeris elements based on the TLE (Two-Line Elements) sets industry standard. Additional assistance information, such as coverage footprint parameters and cell radius, may also be optionally broadcast by the network.\nPredicting out of coverage and in coverage periods is up to UE implementation. When out of coverage, the UE is not required to perform Access Stratum (AS) functions.\nIn the Core Network, discontinuous coverage is handled by means of Tracking Area- or RAT-specific configuration of the MME such that the MME is able, via existing functionality (namely periodic TAU timer, mobile reachable timer, implicit detach timer and high latency communication), to ensure that when the UE is unreachable, a) the UE does not trigger NAS transaction or detach from the network and b) mobile-terminated data destined to the UE can be stored in the network.\nMobility Management:\nThe network may broadcast more than one Tracking Area Code (TAC) per PLMN in a cell in order to reduce the signalling load at cell edge in NTN, in particular for Earth-moving cell coverage. The AS layer indicates all received TACs for the selected PLMN to the NAS layer. The network may update the UEs upon TAC removal. UEs may by UE implementation also check whether a TAC has been removed from the TACs broadcast by the network.\nAt the NAS layer, the UE need not trigger a Tracking Area Update due to mobility reason, if any of the broadcast TAC(s) in the cell where the UE is located is part of the UE’s Tracking Area List.\nFor quasi-Earth-fixed cells, timing information on when the cell is going to stop serving the area may be broadcast by the network. This may be used by the UE to start measurements on neighbour cells before the broadcast stop time of the serving cell, while the exact start of the measurements is up to UE implementation.\nRadio link failure and RRC connection re-establishment are supported in NTN. To enable mobility in NTN, the network provides target cell satellite parameters needed to access the NTN cell in the handover command. Conditional handover is supported for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage.\nDifferent RAT types are introduced that allow distinction by the Core Network between existing terrestrial accesses and new non-terrestrial accesses as well as, among non-terrestrial accesses, between the different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, OTHERSAT) and radio access type (i.e. WB-EUTRAN, NB-IoT and LTE-M). This allows the Core Network nodes and the HSS to identify the access a UE is using such that they are able to adjust their behavior and that of the UE accordingly (e.g. setting of NAS timers, determination and enforcement of access restrictions, etc.).\nFeeder-link switch-over:\nThe NTN Control function determines the point in time when a feeder link switch over between two eNBs is performed. For BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage, the transfer of the affected UE(s)' context between the two eNBs at feeder link switch over is performed by means of either S1 based or X2 based handover, and it depends on the eNBs' implementation and configuration information provided to the eNBs by the NTN Control function.\nNetwork-interfaces signalling aspects:\nThe Cell Identity in NTN corresponds to a fixed geographical area identified by a Mapped Cell ID, irrespective of the orbit of the NTN payload or of the type of the service link. For a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage, the Cell Identity included within the target identification of the handover messages allows identifying the correct target cell. The mapping between Mapped Cell IDs and geographical areas is configured in the RAN and the Core Network (e.g. pre-configured depending on operator's policy, or based on implementation). For a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage or a NB-IoT UE that supports S1-U data transfer or User Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, the eNB is responsible for constructing the Mapped Cell ID based on the UE location information received from the UE, if available. The User Location Information may enable the MME to determine whether the UE is allowed to operate at its present location. Pre-configuration of special mapped cell identifiers may be used to indicate areas outside the serving PLMN's country.\nThe eNB reports the broadcasted TAC(s) of the selected PLMN to the MME. In case the eNB knows the UE's location information, the eNB may determine the TAI the UE is currently located in and provide that TAI to the MME.\nMME(Re-)Selection by eNB:\nFor an RRC_CONNECTED UE, when the eNB is configured to ensure that the BL UE or the UE in enhanced coverage is using an MME that serves the country in which the UE is located. If the eNB detects that a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage is in a different country from that served by the serving MME, it should perform an S1 handover to change to an appropriate MME or initiate a UE Context Release Request procedure towards the serving MME (in which case the MME may decide to detach the UE).\nFor an RRC_CONNECTED NB-IoT UE, when the eNB is configured to ensure that the NB-IoT UE is using an MME that serves the country in which the UE is located. If the eNB detects that the UE is in a different country to that served by the serving MME, it should initiate a UE Context Release Request procedure towards the serving MME (in which case the MME may decide to detach the UE).\nVerification of UE location:\nThe network may, according to regulatory requirements, need to enforce that the PLMN selected by the UE is allowed to operate in the geographical location where the UE is located. To this end, the MME may invoke the ULI (User Location Information) procedure during Mobility Management and Session Management procedures in order to determine the UE location. If the MME is able to determine with sufficient accuracy that it is not allowed to operate in the UE location it may reject and/or detach the UE.\nO&M Requirements:\nThe NTN related parameters shall be provided by O&M to the eNB providing non-terrestrial access, as specified in TS 38.300 for NR NTN.\nSupport for E-UTRAN:\nFor S1 and X2 interfaces, codepoints in the RAT Restriction Information IE (in the Handover Restriction List) allow the selection of different constellation types, i.e., \"LEO\", \"MEO\", \"GEO\", \"OTHERSAT\" for satellite access.\nFor S1 interface, additional codepoints are added to the RAT Type IE associated with a TAC, i.e., \"NBIoT-LEO\", \"NBIoT-MEO\", \"NBIoT-GEO\", \"NBIoT-OTHERSAT\", \"EUTRAN-LEO\", \"EUTRAN-MEO\", \"EUTRAN-GEO\", \"EUTRAN-OTHERSAT\".\nFor S1 interface, the UE Context Reference at Source IE (eNB UE S1AP ID) is introduced in the Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container.\nFor S1 interface, a new cause value is added signalling that a UE is not within the serving area of its current PLMN.\nFor TAC reporting over S1, the LTE NTN TAI Information IE and the semantics description for the TAI IE are added in the User Location Information IE; the LTE NTN TAI Information IE and the semantics description for the TAI IE are added to the eNB CP RELOCATION INDICATION, HANDOVER NOTIFY, PATH SWITCH REQUEST, INITIAL UE MESSAGE, UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT, and LOCATION REPORT messages.\nOther NAS protocol Aspects:\nEnhancements to NAS signalling allow the UE to register to EPS core network using satellite E-UTRAN radio access technology. UICC-ME interface is extended to support network selection over satellite access and allowing to prioritize networks offering satellite access. EPS NAS re-transmission timers are extended to support longer propagation delays and response times due to extended distance between peer entities when satellite access is used. The UE supporting satellite E-UTRAN access supports also GNSS and potential uplink signalling delays to be considered in UE and network NAS implementations.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 36.300\tEvolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 (RAN)\n[2]\tTS 38.300\tNR; NR and NG-RAN Overall description; Stage-2 (RAN)\n[3]\tTS 36.306\tE-UTRAN; User Equipment (UE) radio access capabilities (RAN)\n[4]\tTS 36.413\tE-UTRAN; S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) (RAN)\n[5]\tTS 36.423\tE-UTRAN; X2 Application Protocol (X2AP) (RAN)\n[6]\tTS 23.203\tPolicy and charging control architecture  (SA2)\n[7]\tTS 23.271\tFunctional stage 2 description of Location Services (LCS) (SA2)\n[8]\tTS 23.401\tGeneral Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access (SA2)\n[9]\tTS 23.682\tArchitecture enhancements to facilitate communications with packet data networks and applications (SA2)\n[10]\tTS 23.122\tNon-Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle model (CT1)\n[11]\tTS 24.301\tNon-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Stage 3 (CT1)\n[12]\tTS 23.008\tOrganization of subscriber data (CT4)\n[13]\tTS 27.007\tAT command set for User Equipment (UE) (CT1)\n[15]\tTS 29.212\tPolicy and Charging Control (PCC); Reference points (CT3)\n[16]\tTS 29.272\tEvolved Packet System (EPS); Mobility Management Entity (MME) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) related interfaces based on Diameter protocol (CT4)\n[17]\tTS 29.274\t3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS); Evolved General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunnelling Protocol for Control plane (GTPv2-C); Stage 3 (CT4)\n[18]\tTS 31.102\tCharacteristics of the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application (CT6)\n[19]\tTS 31.111\tUniversal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) Application Toolkit (USAT) (CT6)\n",

SEAL offers a set of common services to the verticals industry applications and to V2X applications. These services include the management of Groups, Configurations, Keys, Identities, Locations and Network Resource. SEAL is further described in clause 9.4 of TR 21.916 [9].\nIn Rel-17, enhancements are made to several SEAL services, namely:\n1) The SEAL architecture is enhanced to support Light Weight Protocol (LWP) for constrained devices.\n2) The \"Configuration Management\" capability is enhanced to support generic container to carry Vertical Application Layer (VAL) service-specific information.\n3) The \"Group Management\" capability is enhanced to support temporary groups in a VAL system, to remove the limitation where VAL service specific data cannot be sent to group members, to add location criteria in the group creation, to support management of 5G VN groups, to control notification rate, to control group communication messages, support for external group Id and group fetch procedure.\n4) The \"Location Management\" capability is enhanced to support the tracking of UE and obtaining dynamic UE information at a location, to distinguish the VAL services, to obtain list of UEs based on location area, monitoring location deviation, to include supplementary location information to verticals, to add timestamp for location report and off-network location management.\n5) The \"Network resource management\" is enhanced to add local MBMS support, to allow NRM server to use TSN and 5G native TSC for resource management, to subscribe to unicast QoS monitoring, to Subscribe to Unicast QoS Monitoring and real-time monitoring status information.\nBeside these enhancements, an entirely new service, called Network Slice Capability Enablement (NSCE), is defined. It includes: the functional model; Procedure for VAL server-triggered and network-based network slice adaptation for VAL application; Procedure for VAL UE-triggered and network-based network slice adaptation for VAL application.\nThe SEAL enhancements are specified in TS 24.544 [3], TS 24.545 [4], TS 24.546 [5], TS 24.547 [6], TS 24.548 [7] and TS 29.549 [8], while the SEAL new service is specified in TS 24.549 [10].\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 23.434: \"Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals; Functional architecture and information flows\".\n[2]\tTS 33.434: \"Security aspects of Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL) for verticals\".\n[3]\tTS 24.544: \"Group Management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[4]\tTS 24.545: \"Location Management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[5]\tTS 24.546: \"Configuration management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[6]\tTS 24.547: \"Identity management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[7]\tTS 24.548: \"Network Resource Management - SEAL; Protocol specification\".\n[8]\tTS 29.549: \"SEAL; Application Programming Interface (API) specification\".\n[9]\tTR 21.916: \"Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items\"\n[10]\tTS 24.549: \"Network slice capability enablement- SEAL; Protocol specification; Stage 3\".\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Siemens in SP-220458.\nCyber-physical control applications in vertical domains (CAV) was introduced in Rel-16  [2].

CAV requires very high levels of communication service availability and some of them also require a very low end-to-end latency as well as real-time capabilities.\nRel-17’s enhancements for CAV (eCAV) refines the service requirements for CAV and specifies new service requirements for specific aspects (Stage 1): additional service performance requirements (KPIs, influencing parameters) have been provided for enhanced and new use cases of cyber-physical control applications: control-to-control communication, wired-to-wireless link replacement (100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s), cooperative carrying, mobile operation panels, and industrial wireless sensors.\neCAV addresses further and enhanced service requirements for industrial Ethernet integration, which includes time synchronization, clock synchronization performance requirements, different time domains, integration scenarios, and support for time-sensitive networking (TSN).\nAn essential requirement specifies: \"The 5G system shall support clock synchronization (e.g. IEEE 802.1AS) through the 5G network if the sync master and the sync devices are served by different UEs\". See Figure 1. The flow of clock synchronization messages is in either direction, UL and DL, and can contain two wireless links on its path. The 5G network on Figure 1 illustrates the flow of clock synchronization messages, with two wireless links (both, UL and DL) and can contain two wireless links on its path.\nFigure 1: 5G network on path of synchronization messages with two wireless links (both, UL and DL) [1]\nService requirements on direct device communication (ProSe communication) for cyber-physical control applications are provided (general, network performance, clock synchronization, service continuity, aspects of indirect communication), many of them supporting the use case of cooperative carrying.\nFurthermore, high-level requirements for enhancements in network operation and maintenance in 5G non-public networks for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains and enhancements and clarifications for positioning have been provided.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n\n[1]\tTR 22.832, \"Study on enhancements for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains\"\n[2]\tTS 22.104, \"Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains\"\n[3]\tTS 22.261, \"Service requirements for the 5G system\"\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei in CP-220394.\nThe 3GPP Northbound Interfaces and APIs are specified as to enable external entities and third party Application Servers/Functions to access a set of exposed 3GPP network services and capabilities in a secure and controlled manner.

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Intel in RP-220919.\nThis Work Item specifies solutions for NR Positioning enhancements, including improvement of positioning accuracy and latency of Rel-16 NR positioning methods, improvements of network efficiency (On-Demand PRS transmission), improvement of device efficiency (positioning in RRC_INACTIVE), providing high integrity and reliability requirements (GNSS integrity) and enhancements of A-GNSS positioning (BDS B2a,/B3I and NavIC to NR).\nAll these aspects are detailed below.\nImprovement of positioning accuracy\nTo improve positioning accuracy, several solutions were considered:\nMitigation of gNB/UE Tx/Rx timing delay errors: For mitigation of gNB/UE Tx/Rx timing delay errors, multiple enhancements are introduced in Rel-17:\n•\tFor DL-TDOA, a UE can be requested to provide the Rx TEG IDs together with RSTD measurements and a TRP can be requested to provide TRP Tx TEG association information of DL PRS resources to mitigate UE Rx timing errors and TRP Tx timing errors. A UE can also be requested to measure the same DL PRS resource of a TRP with different UE Rx TEGs and report the corresponding multiple RSTD measurements to mitigate UE Rx timing errors.\n•\tFor UL-TDOA, Rel-17 supports a TRP to provide the Rx TEG IDs together with RTOA measurements and a UE to provide UE Tx TEG association information of UL positioning SRS resources to mitigate TRP Rx timing errors and UE Tx timing errors. A TRP can also be requested to measure the same UL SRS resource of a UE with different TRP Rx TEGs and report the corresponding multiple RTOA measurements to mitigate TRP Rx timing errors.\n•\tMulti-RTT, Rel-17 supports a UE/TRP to provide the RxTx TEG IDs, or combination of {Rx TEG ID, Tx TEG ID} together with UE/gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements and a UE/gNB to provide its Tx TEG association information for mitigating UE/TRP Rx/Tx timing errors;\nIn addition, Rel-17 supports a UE to report more than one measurement instance of RSTD, DL RSRP, and/or UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements in a single measurement report, and support a TRP to report more than one measurement instance of RTOA, UL RSRP, and/or gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements in a single measurement report. Each measurement instance is reported with its own timestamp;\nUL-AOA enhancements: The new assistance information (expected UL-AOA value and uncertainty range) can be provided by the LMF to facilitate gNB measurements for NR UL-AOA, UL-TDOA and Multi-RTT positioning methods. Support of the first arrival path UL-AOA/ZOA measurement pair per SRS resource were introduced, including reporting of multiple per path AOA value pairs (including additional paths) to cope with possible ambiguity of angle measurements in antenna arrays with larger spacing than a half wavelength, and reporting ZoA only to cope with angle measurements in linear antenna arrays.\nThe per path UL SRS receive reference signal power (UL SRS-RSRPP) measurement definition was introduced.\nThe antenna reference point (ARP) location can be associated with UL measurements for NR Positioning (UL AOA, UL-RTOA, UL SRS-RSRP, UL SRS-RSRPP and gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements).\nFinally, to facilitate hybrid RAT dependent positioning, gNB can report to LMF the following set of measurements {one SRS-RSRP, multiple UL-AOAs (AOA/ZoA pairs), one UL-RTOA or one-gNB Rx-Tx time difference}.\nDL-AOD enhancements: The enhancements of assistance data (a subset of PRS resources for each PRS resource for the purpose of prioritization of DL-AOD reporting or the boresight direction information for each PRS resource) were defined to improve DL-AOD estimation. In addition, the assistance information on DL-AOD/DL-AOA expected value and uncertainty range can be provided by LMF to UE. In Rel-17, for more accurate DL-AOD measurements, the gNB can provide the beam/antenna information to LMF (and LMF can further share it to UE for UE-based positioning). The per path DL PRS reference signal received power (DL PRS RSRPP) for the first path measurements were defined for DL-AOD estimation, and the maximum number of DL PRS RSRPP for the first path measurements was 24. Finally, the maximum number of DL PRS RSRP measurements per TRP was increased up to 24 compared to 8 in Rel.16.\nMulti-path and NLOS mitigation: In Rel-17, multi-path (additional path) report enhancements and LOS/NLOS indication were introduced for NR positioning solutions. The maximum number of additional paths that can be reported is increased (up to 8) with per path RSRP measurements and associated relative timing supported. Multiple UL-AOAs (up to 8) per additional path reporting is supported for the UL-TDOA and Multi-RTT positioning methods. The LOS/NLOS indicator was introduced that can be associated with specific measurements, DL/UL reference signals / resources for positioning.\nImprovement of positioning latency\nTo improve the positioning latency, following solutions were considered:\nPreconfigured measurement gap: To reduce latency of procedures for DL PRS processing with measurement gaps, the set of measurement gap patterns can be pre-configured to UE and activated/deactivated by gNB using new DL MAC CE signalling designed to control DL PRS measurement by UE. The UE can request activation and deactivation of the pre-configured MG using new UL MAC CE signalling introduced in Rel-17. The LMF can request activation of pre-configured MG using new NRPPa signalling introduced in Rel-17.\nPreconfigured PRS processing window: To further reduce latency of DL PRS processing, UEs can perform DL PRS measurement outside measurement gaps and inside the active DL BWP with PRS having the same numerology as the active DL BWP. The gNB can use RRC signalling to pre-configure PRS processing window and DL MAC CE signalling for activation of PRS processing window, respectively. gNB can indicate the DL PRS processing priority relative to other DL signals/channels within the PRS processing window for PRS measurement outside MG.\nM-sample measurement (M = 1): In Rel-17, LMF can request UE and/or TRP to perform measurement over either a single RS transmission period (M=1) or four RS transmission periods (M=4). Configuring M=1 for a UE reduces UE measurement period comparing to Rel.16 (In Rel-16, UE is expected to measure DL PRS over four periods (M = 4)). An AGC sample, in addition to the M=1 sample may be required at the UE subject to measurement conditions.\nLower Rx beam sweeping factor: In Rel-17, a new UE capability on lower Rx beam sweeping factor (<8) is introduced to reduce the PRS measurement latency for FR2 positioning frequency layers.\nStoring LPP capability in AMF: The LMF may interact with the AMF to provide (updated) UE Positioning Capability to AMF and to receive stored UE Positioning Capability from AMF as described in TS 23.273. The LPP procedures to transfer UE LPP positioning capabilities may be skipped if the LMF already obtained the UE positioning capabilities from the AMF.\nPreconfigured assistance data: Preconfigured assistance data is the DL-PRS assistance data (with associated validity criteria, i.e. area ID) that can be provided to the UE (before or during an ongoing LPP positioning session), to be then utilized for potential positioning measurements at a future time (e.g. for deferred MT-LR). Pre-configured DL-PRS assistance data may consist of multiple instances, where each instance is applicable to a different area within the network.\nScheduled location time: During positioning procedure, the LMF may obtain the scheduled location time from the AMF. Based on the obtained scheduled location time, the LMF may schedule location measurements by the UE and/or location measurement by the NG-RAN to occur at or near to the scheduled location time.\nOn-Demand PRS transmission\nOn-Demand PRS transmission procedure allows the LMF to control and decide whether PRS should be transmitted or not and whether the characteristics of an ongoing PRS transmission should be changed or not.\nIn case of UE-initiated On-Demand PRS, the LMF may configure the UE with pre-defined PRS configurations via LPP Provide Assistance Data message or via posSI. The UE sends an On-Demand PRS request to the LMF via LPP Request Assistance Data message. The On-Demand PRS request can be the request for a defined PRS configuration with PRS configuration ID or explicit parameter for PRS configuration and may be a request for PRS transmission or change to the PRS transmission characteristics for positioning measurements.\nIn case of LMF-initiated On-Demand PRS, the LMF and the UE may exchange LPP messages e.g., to obtain UE measurements or the DL-PRS positioning capabilities of the UE, etc).\nThe actual PRS changes are requested by the LMF irrespective of whether the procedure is UE- or LMF-initiated.\nPositioning in RRC_INACTIVE state\nPositioning may be performed when a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE. Any uplink LCS or LPP message can be transported in RRC_INACTIVE. If the UE initiated data transmission using UL SDT, the network can send DL LCS, LPP and RRC message (e.g. to configure SRS for UL positioning, if it is supported) to the UE. UE may also receive PRS or transmit SRS in RRC_INACTIVE. Support of all NR positioning measurements and support of NR positioning methods such as NR E-CID, DL-TDOA, DL-AOD, UL-AOA, UL-TDOA, Multi-RTT and RAT-independent positioning methods are extended for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state.\nGNSS Integrity\nPositioning integrity is a measure of the trust in the accuracy of the position-related data and the ability to provide associated alerts. UE based GNSS integrity is supported in Rel-17. It allows the UE to determine and report the integrity results of the calculated location, where only protection level (PL) reporting mode is supported; the UE can use the integrity requirements and assistance data obtained via NG-RAN, together with its own measurements, to determine the integrity results of the calculated location.\nFor integrity operation, the network will ensure that:\nP(Error > Bound for longer than TTA | NOT DNU) <= Residual Risk + IRallocation               (Equation 8.1.1a-1)\nfor all values of IRallocation in the range irMinimum <= IRallocation <= irMaximum\nfor all the errors in Table 8.1.2.1b-1 as specified in section 8.1.2.1b of TS38.305, which have corresponding integrity assistance data available and where the corresponding DNU flag(s) are set to false.\nEnhancements of A-GNSS positioning\nEnhancements of A-GNSS positioning specified: BDS B2a signal; BDS B3I signal; NavIC to NR.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220803 \"Status Report to TSG on NR Positioning Enhancements\", Intel Corporation\n[2]\tTR 38. 857 \"Study on NR positioning enhancements\" v17.0.0\n\n\n",

Deployments of NPN to provide coverage within a specific geographic area for non-public use is a key demand of emerging 5G applications and verticals.\nThis Rel-17 work item enables the four following enhancements:\n\nSupport for accessing an SNPN using credentials from a Credential Holder (CH): A UE can be configured with user or CH controlled prioritized list of information, SNPN identifiers or Group IDs for Network selection (GINs), enabling the UE to discover SNPNs supporting access using credentials from a CH. If the UE selects and accesses the SNPN, the CH is involved in the primary authentication and for authorizing the access to the SNPN. The CH can either include 5GC NFs e.g. AUSF and UDM (if the CH is an SNPN or a PLMN) or include a AAA server.\nSupport for Onboarding of UEs: Onboarding of UEs allows the UE to access an Onboarding Network (ONN) for the purpose of provisioning the UE with SNPN credentials and other information to enable the UE to select and access a desired SNPN. It also allows provisioning the UE with credentials for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA) or secondary authentication/authorization. Provisioning of the UE is done via User Plane connectivity.\nTo be able to provision SNPN credentials in a UE, as the 5GS requires security to be enabled the UE needs to use some already available credentials to access a 5GS, i.e. either:\n1.\tThe UE has Default UE credentials in which case the UE selects an SNPN as ONN and then the UE registers using Registration Type set to \"SNPN Onboarding\" that enables the 5GC to restrict the connectivity to Onboarding service e.g. using a dedicated S-NSSAI within the network.\n2.\tThe UE uses existing PLMN or SNPN credentials in which case the UE uses the existing credentials to get access connectivity to a PLMN or SNPN.\nDuring the PDU Session establishment the UE can get one or more addresses to one or more Provisioning Server(s) that the UE access over the User Plane for getting provisioning with the SNPN credentials and additional information to get connectivity to the SNPN.\nSupport of IMS voice and emergency services for SNPN: Support for IMS voice and emergency services is enabled e.g. allowing the UE to select an SNPN in limited service to access IMS emergency services. Informative description how an SNPN can deploy an IMS or how one or more independent IMS providers can be used by an SNPN.\nNPN support for Video, Imaging and Audio for Professional Applications (VIAPA): Informative description how a UE accessing an overlay network via an underlay network, see figure 1, can be kept in CM-CONNECTED state in the overlay network.\nInformative description how session/service continuity between SNPN and PLMN can be achieved when the UE has a subscription for a PLMN and for an SNPN and accessing one network as overlay network using the other network as underlay network.\nInformative description how to support QoS differentiation for User Plane IPsec Child SA in an underlay network.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of a 5G network, showing the role of a Primary Local Network (PLMN) as the underlay network and a Service Node Network (SNPN) as the overlay network. The PLMN is responsible for providing network connectivity to the end-users, while the SNPN is responsible for providing network connectivity to the core network. The figure illustrates the various components and their interconnections, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and other network elements. The figure also highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and improve network performance.\nFigure 1: Example with a PLMN acting as underlay network and SNPN as overlay network\nManagement aspects (from Huawei, SP-220570):\nThe management part is covered in TS 28.557 \"Management and orchestration; Management of NPN; Stage 1 and stage 2\". TS 28.557 [7] specifies concepts, use cases, requirements and solutions for management of non-public networks.

The support of this feature is uniform across the SNPN as specified in TS 23.501 [3].\"\nFor Uu interface, the indication of SNPN access with subscription of a Credentials Holder is broadcast in SIB1 per SNPN.\nOptionally, Group IDs for Network selection (GINs) could be broadcast in SIBXY. Each GIN may be assigned to one or more SNPNs. There is a common list of GINs for both onboarding and SNPN access using external CHs.\nFor each SNPN there is a vector that describes which GINs are supported, the maximum number of GINs is 24 per cell.\nFor cell selection/reselection, since SA2 has the conclusion the indication of SNPN access with subscription of a Credentials Holder should be set uniformly, there is no impact on cell (re)selection to support SNPN with subscription or credentials by a separate entity.\nNo UE impact was identified on connected mode mobility for external CH.\nSupport UE onboarding and provisioning for NPN\nFor onboarding support, the section \"Support of UE onboarding and remote provisioning\" is added in TS 38.331.\nThe procedure of AMF selection in TS 38.410 is modified for supporting onboarding as follow: \"Therefore, a NAS node selection function is located in the NG-RAN node to determine the AMF association of the UE, based on the UE's temporary identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the AMF. When the UE's temporary identifier has not been yet assigned or is no longer valid the NG-RAN node may instead take into account other information (e.g. slicing information, onboarding indication) to determine the AMF.\"\nFor Uu interface, the indication of UE onboarding and remote provisioning is broadcast in SIB1 per SNPN.\nAs for \"on-boarding support\" indicator, cell selection and suitability criteria of a SNPN cell are not affected. NAS will anyway allow access for onboarding only if the cell/SNPN supports onboarding.\nToggling the 1-bit onboarding indication in SIB1 allows to control congestion due to onboarding request.\nNo UE impact was identified on connected mode mobility for onboarding.\nFor NG interface, the new \"Onboarding Support\" IE is included within the same PLMN Support Item IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE/AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the related statement for NG SETUP procedure, in 38.413, is added as follows:\n\"If the Onboarding Support IE is also included within the same PLMN Support Item IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, consider that the AMF supports UE onboarding for the identified SNPN, as specified in TS 23.501 [9].\"\nSupport of IMS voice and emergency services for SNPN\nEmergency services are supported for SNPN in Rel-17, which is the new feature compared with Rel-16. UE in SNPN access mode could select the SNPN with imsEmergencySupportForSNPN=true for emergency services.\nFor Uu interface, the indication of support for emergency services is broadcast in SIB1 per SNPN.\nSupport of PWS for SNPN\nPWS over SNPN is supported in Rel-17. In TS 38.300, the statement that ETWS and CMAS are not supported over SNPN is removed.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-200732, Status report of WI: Private Network Support for NG-RAN; rapporteur: China Telecom.\n",

Additional specification work has been done in Release 16 on supporting railway requirements for MCPTT group and private calls and on enabling the use of functional aliases in MCPTT private calls, MCVideo and MCData service.\nAdditional Stage 1 requirements were identified in Release 17 (MONASTERYEND) and Stage 2 architectural solutions were developed in Release 17 (eMONASTERY2 / MONASTERY2_ARCH) which were specified in Stage 3 (eMONASTERY2).\nThe Mission Critical Communication framework specified by 3GPP is used as bases for railway communication and is continuously extended with railway specific functionality.\nFor Release 17 the Mission Critical Communication were enhanced with new functionality required by the railway community to support call forwarding and call transfer for private MCPTT calls. The MCData IP connectivity service was extended to support functional aliases and an MC service user can select an appropriate functional alias when be called by another MC service user. The relationship between MC service groups and the use of functional aliases is clarified, including those functions preventing de-affiliation when using a specific functional alias(es) or providing a list of functional aliases used by affiliated group members. For MCVideo services the use of functional aliases was added and is now available as for MCPTT. A functional alias as target address for MCPTT private emergency calls was specified and can be used as alternative to MCPTT IDs. An MC service user can now request an application layer priority, which allow arbitration of multiple service requests by MC service servers.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 22.280: \"Mission Critical Services Common Requirements (MCCoRe); Stage 1\"\n[2]\tTS 22.281: \"Mission Critical (MC) video\"\n[3]\tTS 22.282: \"Mission Critical (MC) data\"\n[4]\tTS 22.179: \"Mission Critical Push to Talk (MCPTT); Stage 1\"\n[5]\tTS 22.289: \"Mobile communication system for railways\"\n[6]\tTS 23.280: \" Common functional architecture to support mission critical services; Stage 2\"\n[7]\tTS 23.281: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Video (MCVideo); Stage 2\"\n[8]\tTS 23.282: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Data (MCData); Stage 2\"\n[9]\tTS 23.283: \"Mission Critical Communication Interworking with Land Mobile Radio Systems\"\n[10]\tTS 23.379: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT); Stage 2\"\n[11]\tTS 24.379: \"Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) call control; Protocol specification\"\n[12]\tTS 24.282: \"Mission Critical Data (MCData) signalling control; Protocol specification\"\n[13]\tTS 24.481: \"Mission Critical Services (MCS) group management; Protocol specification\"\n[14]\tTS 24.483: \"Mission Critical Services (MCS) Management Object (MO)\"\n[15]\tTS 24.484: \"Mission Critical Services (MCS) configuration management; Protocol specification\"\n[16]\tTS 24.582: \"Mission Critical Data (MCData) media plane control; Protocol specification\"\n\nSummary based on the input provided by CMCC in RP-220631.\nThis WI specifies the UE RRM requirements for carrier aggregation (CA) and UE demodulation requirements for CA for FR1 high speed train scenario (HST).

The considered FR2 HST scenario is different from existing 3GPP WIs (for either LTE or NR) with operating bands up to 3.5GHz, and the NR FR2 RRM and demodulation requirements for non-HST scenarios are also not applicable and need to be specified.\nIn this WI, the FR2 HST deployment scenarios are studied, based upon which FR2 HST channel models are provided accordingly. From radio resource management (RRM) and demodulation perspectives, FR2 HST scenario is focused and evaluated, with the feasibility of FR2 HST scenario being technically confirmed.\nFor UE RF requirement, FR2 power class 6 for band n257, n258 and n261 is newly introduced, which is corresponding to the UE type of high speed train roof-mounted UE. Relevant UE TX and RX RF requirements for power class 6 are specified, in which the TX and EIS spherical coverage requirements are defined over the newly introduced spherical coverage evaluation areas. For UE beam correspondence requirement, the applicability rule and requirement side conditions are specified.\nThe RRM requirements for FR2 HST scenarios are introduced and enhanced over existing FR2 RRM requirements. Specifically, the enhancements for FR2 HST are introduced on cell re-selection, RRC connection mobility control, gradual timing adjustment, SSB based radio link monitoring and beam failure detection, intra-frequency measurement and L1-RSRP/SINR measurement. The new requirements of one shot large UL timing adjustment and TCI state switch delay are specified for FR2 HST scenarios.\nThe BS/UE performance requirements are discussed for FR2 HST scenarios, which will be further completed in the performance phase of this WI.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tR4-2206594, TR 38.854 v0.4.0, NR support for high-speed train scenario in frequency range 2 (FR2), Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell, and Samsung.\n[2]\tRP-220317, Status report for WI NR support for high-speed train scenario in frequency range 2 (FR2), Samsung.\nThis work item adds the support of Railways communications for bands n100 in CEPT countries.\nIt deals with the use of the Rail Mobile Radio spectrum in the 900MHz frequency band, which was assigned by the ECC Decision (20)02 [2] for the use by the railways in Europe.\nIt addresses all the necessary precautions to make the paired spectrum of 874.6-800/919.4-925MHz usable for 5G NR.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\t3GPP TR 38.853: Introduction of 900MHz NR band for Europe for Rail Mobile Radio (RMR)\n[2]\tECC Decision (20)02: \"Harmonised use of the paired frequency bands 874.4-880.0 MHz and 919.4-925.0 MHz and of the unpaired frequency band 1900-1910 MHz for Railway Mobile Radio (RMR) \".\nThis work item deals with the use of the Rail Mobile Radio spectrum in the 1900MHz frequency band, which was assigned by the ECC Decision (20)02 [2] for the use by the railways in Europe, in CEPT countries.\nIt addresses all the necessary precautions to make the unpaired spectrum of 1900-1910MHz usable for 5G NR.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\t3GPP TR 38.852: Introduction of 1900MHz NR band for Europe for Rail Mobile Radio (RMR)\n[2]\tECC Decision (20)02: \"Harmonised use of the paired frequency bands 874.4-880.0 MHz and 919.4-925.0 MHz and of the unpaired frequency band 1900-1910 MHz for Railway Mobile Radio (RMR) \".\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-220682 (earlier version provided by FirstNet in CP-220111).\nFor Release 17, the enhancements to MCPTT (and related services) were contained in two work items: Enhanced Mission Critical Push-to-talk architecture phase 3 -- enh3MCPTT for stage2 (SA6); and enh3MCPTT-CT for stage 3 (CT1). The corresponding items which have been completed in Release 17 are described in the following clause.\nThese enhancements impact the following areas of the MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData architecture and protocols: call control and media handling, configuration, and security.\nThe following features have been enhanced.\nPreconfigured group usage: Certain groups are designated for preconfigured group usage only, and as such, should not be allowed to be the target of a call or alert. Enhancements were made to identify preconfigured groups and protect against their use in call scenarios. The enhancements have been applied to the MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData services. In addition, enhancements have been made to give parity to the preconfigured regroup feature across all three MC services\nEmergency alert area notification handling: The emergency alert area notification feature allows for an MC user to be notified whenever said user moves into, or moves out, of a predefined area. The functionality is applicable to the MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData services. Enhancements have been made to give parity of this feature across all three MC services.\nEntry / exit from group geographic area handling: The group geographic area notification feature allows for an MC user to be notified whenever said user moves into, or moves out, of a predefined group geographic area requiring affiliation to, or de-affiliation from, a group. The functionality is applicable to the MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData services. Enhancements have been made to give parity of this feature across all three MC services.\nPDN and APN configuration: The UE initial config allows for configuration of certain APN parameters such as ServiceServerUri. These APN parameters need to be consistent with the Managed Object definitions. These are applicable for all MC services. Similarly, PDN parameters that provide for PDN connectivity information for each of the MC services need to be consistently specified within the MC UE initial configuration document. Enhancements have been made to align stage 3 with stage 2 specifications.\nLocation altitude, accuracy and handling: The handling of location information should provide for an accuracy (uncertainty) that can be given to the various location vectors. These vectors include not just horizontal and vertical location, to support latitude and longitude, but also vertical location to support altitude. Enhancements have been made to the MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData services to provide for this enhanced location handling.\nClearing the floor request queue: Previously, an authorized MCPTT user has had the ability to clear a portion of the MCPTT floor request queue for a given call by specifying the list of users to be cleared from the queue. This functionality is further enhanced to allow the authorized MCPTT user to clear the entire floor request queue for all users in the queue for a given call. Enhancements have been made to allow for this new capability. Although this capability will remove all currently queued floor participants, it does not prevent the removed users from immediately retrying to access the floor for the same call.\nMCPTT unicast media start and stop: The MCPTT service has been enhanced to give the capability to the MCPTT client to indicate to the server that a certain unicast media flow for a given group call can be stopped and then resumed at a later time. This capability can reduce radio resources for an MCPTT user who may be participating in other higher priority group calls.\nThe requirements, architecture, protocol, and security aspects related to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:\n1.\tThe MCPTT service requirements are specified in TS 22.179 and TS 22.280;\n2.\tThe MCVideo service requirements are specified in TS 22.281 and TS 22.280;\n3.\tThe MCData service requirements are specified in TS 22.282 and TS 22.280;\n4.\tThe MCPTT service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.379 and TS 23.280;\n5.\tThe MCVideo service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.281 and TS 23.280;\n6.\tThe MCData service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.282 and TS 23.280;\n7.\tThe security aspects of the MCPTT service are specified in TS 33.180;\n8.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.379 and TS 24.380 respectively;\n9.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCVideo service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.281 and TS 24.581 respectively;\n10.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCData service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.282 and TS 24.582 respectively;\n11.\tThe protocol aspects of MC services for group configuration, identity management, and general configuration are specified in TS 24.481, TS 24.482, TS 24.483, and TS 24.484 respectively;\n12.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for codecs and media handling are specified in TS 26.179;\n13.\tThe protocol aspects of MC services for policy and charging control are specified in TS 29.213 and TS 29.214;\n14.\tThe protocol aspects of MC services for data management related to MC service user profile are specified in TS 29.283;\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 22.179 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT); Stage 1;\n[2]\tTS 22.281 Mission Critical Video services; Stage 1;\n[3]\tTS 22.282 Mission Critical Data services; Stage 1;\n[4]\tTS 22.280 Mission Critical Services Common Requirements (MCCoRe); Stage 1;\n[5]\tTS 23.379 Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT); Stage 2;\n[6]\tTS 23.281 Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Video (MCVideo); Stage 2;\n[7]\tTS 23.282 Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Data (MCData); Stage 2;\n[8]\tTS 23.280 Common functional architecture to support mission critical services; Stage 2;\n[9]\tTS 24.379 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) call control; Protocol specification;\n[10]\tTS 24.380 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) media plane control; Protocol specification;\n[11]\tTS 24.481 Mission Critical Services (MCS) group management; Protocol specification;\n[12]\tTS 24.482 Mission Critical Services (MCS) identity management; Protocol specification;\n[13]\tTS 24.483 Mission Critical Services (MCS) Management Object (MO);\n[14]\tTS 24.484 Mission Critical Services (MCS) configuration management; Protocol specification;\n[15]\tTS 26.179 Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT); Codecs and media handling;\n[16]\tTS 29.213 Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and Quality of Service (QoS) parameter mapping;\n[17]\tTS 29.214: Policy and Charging Control over Rx reference point;\n[18]\tTS 29.283: Diameter data management applications;\n[19]\tTS 33.180: Security of the mission critical service (Release 17).\nSummary based on the input provided by at&t in SP-220089.\nFor Release 17, the enhancements for the MCData service were defined by the two work items above.

Similar to user service authorization for the other MC services, an appropriately scoped access token obtained from the Identity Management server permits only authorized users the authorization to access and use the MCData message store service.\nSecurity for Preconfigured Group Regroup and Preconfigured User Regroup calls defines the use of the preconfigured group to establish the security context.\nEnhancements to the security architecture to support mission critical security services over a 5G system. This includes the mission critical security architecture, which describes the use and integration of 5G nodes and servers.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 33.180: \"Security of the Mission Critical (MC) service; (Release 17)\"\nSummary based on the input provided by UIC.\nMCOver5GS (Mission Critical service over 5GS) aims to enable 5GS for the use by Mission Critical Services supporting on-network as well as off network Mission Critical communication. In a first phase (Rel-17) unicast transmission service are now available for the on-network approach. In consecutive phases multicast/broadcast services and off network are in focus. In the area of off-network communication, the main aim is to align transmission services using 5GS capabilities. Another important aspect is to provide interoperability when Mission Critical Services are supported by both, the EPS and 5GS.\nMCover5GC adapts the general Mission Critical Communication functional model so it is applicable when using 5GS. Rel-17 enables the use of unicast based transmission mode for Mission Critical services and the proper use of 5GS Quality of Service categories. Relevant procedures were adapted to be applicable under 5GS conditions.\nWith use of 5GS, Mission Critical services are now also be used taking the untrusted approach into account so that MC service servers can be operated geographically independently from the IMS/SIP core infrastructure.\nMC services can be deployed using different infrastructures, public or non-public. With 5GS, MC services and their traffic can be operated in isolation from others using network slicing. Transport resources are thus virtualized and can be used for MC service, considering predefined bit rates.

The latest revised WID for MCSMI_CT in CP 220301 focused only on MC system interconnection. The stage 3 migration aspects for MC systems will be considered in a future release. The corresponding items which have been completed in Release 17 are described in the following clause.\nInterconnection between mission critical systems is needed to provide inter-system communication for purposes such as operational support and mutual aid between mission critical systems in different security domains, operated by different mission critical organizations. All of the call types that are available within a single MC system may also be needed when communications between a primary and partner system involves interconnection.\nThese enhancements for interconnection that follow impact areas of the MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData service architecture and protocols. The following features have been added or enhanced to support MC system interconnection.\nFunctional connectivity model and introduction of the MC gateway server: To allow for interconnection of MC systems in different trust domains the MC gateway sever is introduced for each of the MC services to provide topology hiding and an interface between security domains. An MCPTT gateway server can act as a SIP and HTTP proxy for signalling with a partner MCPTT system in a different trust domain. Similarly, an MCVideo gateway server and an MCData gateway server provides the same function for the MCVideo and MCData services, respectively.\nMCPTT service changes to support MC system interconnection: The following MCPTT procedures have been enhanced to support MCPTT interconnection: affiliation, emergency alert, pre-arranged group call, chat group call, common procedures, private call, remotely initiated group call, remote change of selected group, group regroup, user regroup, and the corresponding MCPTT gateway server procedures.\nMCVideo service changes to support MC system interconnection: The following MCVideo procedures have been enhanced to support MCVideo interconnection: affiliation, ambient viewing, emergency alert, group call, private call, common procedures, remote change of selected group, group regroup, user regroup, and the corresponding MCVideo gateway server procedures.\nMCData service changes to support MC system interconnection: The following MCData procedures have been enhanced to support MCData interconnection: affiliation, disposition notifications, emergency alert, Short Data Service procedures, File Download procedures, common procedures, IP connectivity, group regroup, user regroup, and the corresponding MCData gateway server procedures.\nThe requirements, architecture, protocol, and security aspects related to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:\n1.\tThe MCPTT service requirements are specified in TS 22.179 and TS 22.280;\n2.\tThe MCVideo service requirements are specified in TS 22.281 and TS 22.280;\n3.\tThe MCData service requirements are specified in TS 22.282 and TS 22.280;\n4.\tThe MCPTT service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.379 and TS 23.280;\n5.\tThe MCVideo service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.281 and TS 23.280;\n6.\tThe MCData service architecture (including information flows, procedures, and configuration) is specified in TS 23.282 and TS 23.280;\n7.\tThe security aspects of the MCPTT service are specified in TS 33.180;\n8.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.379 and TS 24.380 respectively;\n9.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCVideo service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.281 and TS 24.581 respectively;\n10.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCData service for call control and media plane are specified in TS 24.282 and TS 24.582 respectively;\n11.\tThe protocol aspects of MC services for group configuration, identity management, and general configuration are specified in TS 24.481, TS 24.482, TS 24.483, and TS 24.484 respectively;\n12.\tThe protocol aspects of the MCPTT service for codecs and media handling are specified in TS 26.179;\n13.\tThe protocol aspects of MC services for policy and charging control are specified in TS 29.213 and TS 29.214;\n14.\tThe protocol aspects of MC services for data management related to MC service user profile are specified in TS 29.283;\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 22.179 Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT);

The stage 2 work has been developed based on the study results captured in TR 23.778, stage 1 service requirements defined in TS 22.346, stage 2 work related to the definition of the IOPS mode of operation in TS 23.401, and the support of MC services defined in TS 23.280, TS 23.379, and TS 23.282.\nThose features that have been completed are described in the following clause.\nNOTE:\tStage 3 work was not completed at the time when this summary was introduced in the present document (March 2022).\nThe functional architecture, procedures and information flows to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation have been specified in TS 23.180. The addressed architecture requirements were focused on the case of a backhaul failure between the radio access network (RAN) and the macro Evolved Packet Core (EPC). For that, the IOPS MC system provides support for MC services in the IOPS mode of operation until the failure is recovered.\nIn this release, during the IOPS mode of operation the IOPS MC system supports the following MCPTT services: group call, emergency group call, private call and emergency private call. For the case of MCData services, only short data service is supported. MCVideo services are not supported in Release 17.\nMC services in the IOPS mode of operation are specified based on the IP connectivity functionality. The IP connectivity functionality enables that MC services are provided by the MC service clients via the IOPS MC connectivity function.\nThe IP connectivity functionality defines that the IOPS MC connectivity function does not provide MC services to the MC service clients. Instead, it enables that MC service users are discovered by the IOPS MC connectivity function and get notified about the availability of other MC service users within the coverage of the IOPS Evolved Packet System (EPS). The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes then related IP traffic to discovered MC service UEs over IP unicast transmissions and/or multicast transmissions. An MC service UE supporting the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of operation enables transmitting the IP packets related to an MC service communication over the IOPS MC connectivity function.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 23.401: \"General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access\".\n[2]\tTS 22.346: \"Isolated Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) operation for public safety; Stage 1\".\n[3]\tTS 23.280: \"Common functional architecture to support mission critical services \".\n[4]\tTS 23.379: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT); Stage 2\".\n[5]\tTS 23.282: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Mission Critical Data (MCData); Stage 2\".\nSee the section \"Enhancements to Application Architecture for the Mobile Communication System for Railways Phase 2\"\nSummary based on the input provided by CATT in SP-220899.\nMultimedia Priority Service (MPS) to support priority communications by authorized users, i.e., emergency service personnel, during times of emergency situations and network congestion was originally specified in Release 8.  In Release 17, a stage 1 feasibility study on MPS Phase 2 identified new priority voice, video, and data communication capabilities. Based on the results of the MPS Phase 2 feasibility study as documented in TR 22.854 [1], the normative stage 1 requirements in TS 22.153 [2] were updated and associated stage 2 and stage 3 features were defined in Release 17.\nStage 1 summary\nThe following is a summary of the new stage 1 features included in TS 22.153 [2] Release 17:\n1.\tMPS for MMTEL voice/video\nExplicit stage 1 requirements were added for MPS for MMTEL voice and MMTEL voice conference calls for an authorized Service User using a UE with a subscription for MPS; and new requirements for MPS for MMTEL voice and MMTEL voice conference calls for an authorized Service User using a UE that does not have an MPS subscription, and MPS for all participants of an authorized MMTEL voice conference call. The corresponding extensions were also added for MPS for MMTEL video.\n2.\tMPS for Data Transfer Service (DTS)\nA new MPS for DTS feature was defined as a generic priority packet transport service that applies independently of the specific data application being used. In the case of EPS, MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all traffic on the default bearer upon request. It may also apply to other bearers based on operator policy and regulatory rules. In the case of 5GS, MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all traffic on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule upon request. It may also apply to other QoS flows based on operator policy and regulatory rules. MPS for DTS is a specific example of Priority Data Bearer Service.\n3.\tAttestation of Authorized MPS Priority\nNew stage 1 requirements were added for the attestation and verification of MPS authorization.\nStage 2 summary\nThe following is a summary of the new stage 2 features included in Release 17:\n1.\tMPS for MMTEL voice/video\nEnhancements were included in TS 23.228 [8] based on the new stage 1 requirements for MPS for MMTEL voice and video conference calls. A conferencing AS permits an authorized host with an MPS (IMS) priority subscription to request an upgrade of the host itself, specific participants, or all participants including the host in the conference, whether participants have an MPS subscription or not.\n2.\tMPS for DTS\nA new MPS for DTS feature was specified in TS 23.401 [3], TS 23.203 [4], TS 23.501 [5], TS 23.502 [6], and TS 23.503 [7] to support priority packet transport service that applies independently of the specific data application being used. MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all traffic on the EPC default bearer and the 5GC QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule upon requests received via an AF. Based on additional configuration in the PCF, prioritization may also be applied to other bearers and QoS Flows.\n3.\tSBI Message Priority\nTS 23.501 [5] and TS 23.502 [6] were enhanced to specify that 5GC service based messages carry a priority indication for the UE if the UE has a priority subscription. Specifications already supported the priority indication on service based messages via the AMF based on the receipt of an RRC connection request with a priority establishment cause. The enhancement informs all core network elements with service based interfaces to handle all activity from MPS subscribers with priority.\n4.\tMPS support in the UE Configuration Update procedure\nTS 23.502 [6] was enhanced to support MPS subscription updates in the UE Configuration Update procedure so that a UE that receives an MPS subscription from the network does not have to wait for any re-registration events to obtain priority treatment.\nStage 3 summary\nThe following is a summary of the new stage 3 features and improvements included in Release 17:\n1.\tMPS for MMTEL voice/video\nTS 24.229 [9] was enhanced to specify that all IMS core elements (e.g., the P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, MGCF, BGCF, MRFC, MRB, IBCF, ISC gateway and AS) adjust priority treatment based upon the most recently received Resource Priority Header field. This allows voice/video calls to be upgraded to MPS while in progress.\n2.\tMPS for Data Transfer Service (DTS)\nThe new MPS for DTS feature was defined in support of stage 1 and stage 2 requirements for priority data, along with the associated PCC (Policy and Charging Control) related protocol and information element requirements, for both EPS and 5GS.\n3.\tVoice Call Continuity (VCC)\nIn TS 24.237 [10], the VCC procedure in the SCC AS was enhanced to prevent loss of priority for MPS voice calls across mobility events.\n4.\tSBI Message Priority\nTS 29.500 [11] was enhanced to specify that 5GC service based messages carry a priority indication for the UE if either the UE has a priority subscription or has established an RRC connection with priority. The enhancement informs all core network elements on the service based interfaces that the activity is to be handled with priority.\n5.\tMPS support in the UE Configuration Update procedure\nTS 24.501 [12] was enhanced to support MPS subscription updates in the UE Configuration Update procedure so that a UE that receives an MPS subscription from the network does not have to wait for any re-registration events to obtain priority treatment.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\t3GPP TR 22.854: \"Feasibility Study on Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) Phase 2\".\n[2]\t3GPP TS 22.153: \"Multimedia priority service\".\n[3]\t3GPP TS 23.401, “General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access”.\n[4]\t3GPP TS 23.203, “Policy and charging control architecture”.\n[5]\t3GPP TS 23.501, “System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2”.\n[6]\t3GPP TS 23.502, “System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2”.\n[7]\t3GPP TS 23.503, “Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2”.\n[8]\t3GPP TS 23.228, “Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2”.\n[9]\t3GPP TS 24.229: \"IP multimedia call control protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP); Stage 3\".\n[10]\t3GPP TS 24.237: \"IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity; Stage 3\".\n[11]\t3GPP TS 29.500: \"Technical Realization of Service Based Architecture; Stage 3\".\n[12]\t3GPP TS 24.501: \"Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3\".\n",

Some new requirements are closely related to relevant work item 810049 in stage 1, such as C2 communication and related KPIs.\nThe main work of EAV item is based on the outcome of the study items resulting in TR 22.829 [1]. The General requirements needed for the 5G system to support UAV aspects are introduced in chapter 6.32 in TS 22.261[2], which points to the main normative work of TS 22.125 [3], where the following service requirements and KPIs are addressed:\nPoint1: Requirements for UAV usages: Network exposure for UAV services; Service restriction for UEs onboard of UAV; Requirements for UxNB; C2 communication\nPoint2: Performance requirements: KPIs for services provided to the UAV applications; KPIs for UAV command and control; Positioning performance requirements; Other requirements\nStage-2/3 works related to this WI were progressed by the work item \"Application layer support for UAS\" described in the next clause.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTR 22.829, Enhancement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Stage 1\n[2]\tTS 22.261, Service requirements for the 5G system; Stage 1\n[3] \tTS 22.125, Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) support in 3GPP; Stage 1\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220651.\nThis Feature specifies enabler services related to application layer support for Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS). This feature enables efficient use and deployment of UAS on 3GPP networks. The architecture and protocols for UAS application layer consisting of UAS application enabler are specified considering stage 1 and stage 2 work within 3GPP related to UAS in TS 22.125 [1] and TS 23.256 [2].\nThe UAS application layer utilizes Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL) functionalities. The enhancements to SEAL were specified using the eSEAL WI (see corresponding section).\nAn architecture for UAS application layer over 3GPP system is introduced as shown in figure x.\nThe figure depicts a UAS application layer over the 3GPP system, illustrating the communication between the application layer and the network layer. The figure shows the network layer, which includes the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The application layer, represented by the UAS, is shown in the middle, with the communication between the two layers highlighted by dashed lines. The figure also includes redundancy paths, ensuring the system's reliability.\nFigure 1: UAS application layer over 3GPP system\nA UAS UE can be a UAV controller (UAV-C) or a UAV. In the UAS application specific layer, a UAS application server can be a USS/UTM server or any Application server interacting with UAS application clients. The UAS specific applications include C2 communications, multimedia applications, etc. and hence the details of the UAS application specific layer is out of scope of 3GPP. To support the UAS application specific layer, a UAS application support layer is specified which includes the UAS application enabler (UAE) layer and the Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL). The architecture only supports Uu connectivity in this release. The UAE server exposes service APIs which can be consumed by UAS application servers and conforms to the CAPIF framework.\nThe functional model for UAS application layer over 3GPP system including the UAS application enabler layer functionalities are specified in TS 23.255 [3]. The UAE layer includes UE side function called UAE client and network side function called UAE server and provides the following services to support the UAS application specific layer:\na)\tRegistration enables authentication and authorization of UAS UEs at UAE layer.\nb)\tCommunications between UAVs within a geographical area where a UAV can send UAV application messages to other UAVs in an application defined proximity range from the UAV (sender).\nc)\tGroup based pairing of UAV-C and UAV enables pairing management (e.g pair creation, pair modification) using SEAL group management service.\nd)\tC2 QoS provisioning for UAS utilizes SEAL network resource management service to enable QoS based C2 communications.\ne)\tC2 communication mode selection and switching to enable switching between different C2 modes like Network-Assisted C2 communication, Direct C2 communication and UTM navigated C2 communications.\nf)\tReal-time UAV connection status monitoring and location reporting enables UAS application servers like USS/UTM to monitor the real-time situation of the UAV.\nHTTP protocol is used to enable the above functionalities and the related protocol aspects are specified in TS 24.257 [4].\nThe openAPI specifications for the UAE server services (northbound APIs) exposed to UAS application specific servers over Us reference point are specified in TS 29.257 [5].\nThe feasibility study for UAS application support aspects are specified in TR 23.755 [6].\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 22.125: \"Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) support in 3GPP; Stage 1\"\n[2]\tTS 23.256: \"Support of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) connectivity, identification, and tracking; Stage 2\"\n[3]\tTS 23.255: \"Application layer support for Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS); Functional architecture and information flows\"\n[4]\tTS 24.257: \"Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS); Application Enabler (UAE) layer; Protocol aspects; Stage 3\"\n[5]\tTS 29.257: \"Application layer support for Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS); UAS Application Enabler (UAE) Server Services; Stage 3\"\n[6]\tTR 23.755: \"Study on application layer support for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)\"\nSummary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220619.\nThe work on Remote Identification of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) includes a set of 5GS enhancements aiming at supporting aviation industry needs for remote identification, tracking and authorization of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating via the 3GPP system. Besides stage-1/2 requirements and principles, main stage-3 enhancements relate to Core Network and NAS.\nHigh-level service requirements for remote UAS identification are described in [1].\nKey functions of the 3GPP architecture for UAS are depicted in the following figure (where the UE is assumed to be part, or on board, of a UAV):\nThe figure depicts a high-level system architecture for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), illustrating the various components and their interconnections. The system includes a central processing unit (CPU), a flight control unit (FCU), a navigation and guidance system (NGS), and a communication module (CM). The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure the system's reliability and resilience.\nFigure 1: High-level System architecture for UAS\nThe main architectural and protocol functionalities, added to the stage-2&3 specifications, include the following ([2] - [10]):\nUAV remote identification:\nThe CAA (Civil Aviation Administration)-Level UAV ID is introduced in the 3GPP system, which allows any entity receiving the identity (e.g. with means outside the scope of 3GPP) to address the correct USS for retrieval of UAV information. It can be assigned by the USS with assistance from 3GPP system, e.g., whereby the USS delegates the role of \"resolver\" of the CAA-Level UAV ID to the UAS NF (Network Function withing the 3GPP CN).\nIt is assumed that, during initial UAV's owner registration of the UAV with the USS (out of 3GPP scope), the CAA-level UAV ID is provided to the UAV and the aviation-level information (e.g. UAV serial number, pilot information, UAS operator, etc.) is provided to the USS.\nUAV USS authentication and authorization (UUAA):\nAfter a successful 3GPP authentication of the UE (using existing procedures for 3GPP primary authentication, e.g., with MNO credentials stored in the USIM), a specific/new UUAA procedure is defined, to enable the 3GPP Core Network to verify that the UAV has successfully registered with the USS. The procedure pivots on the CAA-Level UAV ID that is used by the UAV to identify itself with the USS and be authenticated by the USS. In 5GS, this procedure can take place during the 3GPP registration, or during the establishment of a PDU session for UAS services; In EPS, the UUAA procedure takes place during PDN connection establishment. As part of UUAA, a generic container (Service-level-AA container) and a generic SM procedure for authentication/authorization purpose (Service-level-AA procedure) are defined, to exchange the UUAA authentication information between the UE and the USS; in addition, an API based authentication/authorization procedure is also specified. The details of the security material used for the UUAA are outside the scope of 3GPP and considered application layer.\nC2 (Command and Control) communication authorization:\nFor C2 communication over cellular connectivity, consisting of a UAV user plane connection with the UAVC, authorization by the USS is required to enable such traffic, including authorization for pairing of the UAV with a UAVC, as well as optional flight authorization for the UAV (performed by the USS). To support this, NAS PDU session establishment and modification procedures have been extended, to enable inclusion of the CAA-level UAV ID and other application layer authorization information in the Service-level-AA container.\nUAV location reporting and tracking\nUAV location reporting and tracking is specified by mostly re-using the existing location procedures. Different UAV tracking modes have been defined, e.g. where the USS can be notified of the location of a UAV, a UAV moving in/out of a given geographic area, or a list of UAVs in given geographic area.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 22.125: \"Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) support in 3GPP\"\n[2]\tTS 23.256: \" Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) connectivity, identification and tracking; Stage 2\"\n[3]\tTS 23.501: \"System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\"\n[4]\tTS 23.502: \"Procedures for the 5G System (5GS)\"\n[5]\tTS 24.501: \"Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Stage 3\"\n[6]\tTS 24.008: \"Mobile radio interface Layer 3 specification; Core network protocols; Stage 3\"\n[7]\tTS 29.522: \"5G System; Network Exposure Function Northbound APIs; Stage 3\"\n[8]\tTS 29.255: \"5G System; Uncrewed Aerial System Service Supplier (USS) Services; Stage 3\"\n[9]\tTS 29.256: \"5G System; Uncrewed Aerial Systems Network Function (UAS-NF); Aerial Management Services; Stage 3\"\n[10]\tTS 33.256: \"Security aspects of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS)\"\n",

For example, surgeons pay a lot of attention to video quality (very high resolution, frame rates, …) and repeatedly ask for non-compressed video streams to avoid artifacts and to lower application latencies during non-invasive surgery. This led to very stringent data rate requirements (several dozen or higher Gbps in some identified use cases).\nInterestingly, it has been noted that some of the requirements covered as part of CMED are similar to those generated by VIAPA (video, imaging, and audio for professional applications) and this has led to a joint specification for the two work items. For VIAPA, see section \"Enhanced support of Non-Public Networks\".\nBeside SA1, no specific stage 2 nor stage 3 work could be carried out in 3GPP downstream groups as key performance requirements (bitrate, latency, …) were felt too stringent for current technology generation.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTR 22.826: \"Study on Communication Services for Critical Medical Applications\"\n[2]\tTS 22.104: \"Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains\"\n[3]\tTS 22.261: \"Service requirements for the 5G system\"\n[4]\tTS 22.263: \"Service requirements for video, imaging and audio for professional applications (VIAPA)\"\n\n\nSA1 part: Audio-Visual Service Production (AVPROD)\nSummary based on the input provided by BBC in xP-22xxxx.\nAVPROD looks at applications for Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE) and use cases for media production.\nIt looks specifically at PMSE use cases and VIAPA (Video Imaging and Audio for Professional Applications expands this to include areas such as medical and gaming.\nThe documents introduce requirements related to professional video, imaging and audio services. Unlike other consumer multimedia applications envisioned for 3GPP systems, the applications in which this document focuses have more demanding performance targets and includes user devices that are managed in different workflows when compared to typical UEs.\nThis can be divided into two main categories: contribution and production.\n•\tContribution links are heavily compressed and have lower latency requirements and are used for newsgathering and other programme items. They are currently serviced by satellite or bonded cellular and use the PLMNs\n•\tProduction links have higher bandwidth, due to less compression, and challenging latency requirements as well as strict Quality of Service metrics to ensure reliability.\nThe key parameters for these applications are:\nSystem latency. In video production, overall system latency is referred to as imaging system latency and has an impact on the timing of synchronized cameras. For audio applications, overall system latency is referred to as mouth to ear latency and it is critical to maintain lip sync and avoid a performer to be put off by hearing their own echo. Finally, in medical applications the system latency impairs the achievable precision at a given gesture speed as it translates the time needed to traverse the whole imaging system into a geometrical error of the instruments position.\nBandwidth. Video and imaging applications have extremely high uplink bandwidth requirements and while compression may be used to mitigate this in certain user cases it often degrades the picture to the extent onward processing required by some applications is compromised.  For Video Production certain standards have been determined which indicate the maximum allowable compression for a given type of production.  In medical imaging, compression may introduce artefacts which can impact on diagnosis of critical illness and may also introduce additional delays which, in image assisted surgery, translate into misalignment between perceived instruments position on screen and their real position into patients’ body.\nQuality of Service. For Video Production certain standards have been determined which indicate the maximum allowable compression for a given type of production.  In medical imaging, compression may introduce artefacts which can impact on diagnosis of critical illness and may also introduce additional delays which, in image assisted surgery, translate into misalignment between perceived instruments position on screen and their real position into patients’ body.\nVIAPA also highlights service aspects for Non-Public networks, clock synchronization, Network exposure, service continuity and multi-network connectivity.\nPerformance requirements are defined for all applications.\nThere are no specific Stage 2/3 works needed after the Stage 1 requirements, but work has continued in SA4 with the study item on NPNs for media production.\nSA4 part: Study on Media Production over 5G NPN\nSummary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220650.\nThe media production industry uses its own set of codecs, protocols and procedures for IP-based media production. These protocols are (often) targeting dedicated networks installed at a production facility or at a temporary location, which allow transmission of either uncompressed or compressed video at high quality. For the orchestration and configuration of an IP-based media production setup, different solutions are defined.\nThere are cases for which the Media Producer may own their own 5G Network. There are other cases for which the media producer collaborates with a 5G Network operator to support media production events and services. Different collaboration scenarios require different means to establish 5G-based media production connectivity.\nIn deployments, 5G Systems including NPNs may have to be tailored to the needs of each industry vertical and the target use-case in question. The Media Production vertical may want to use the 5G System for different purposes, primarily for sending video and audio from remote locations to a central production studio, but also for return video, tally, talkback, remote device control (connectivity configuration, but also operational control of specialist UE). One aim of the study would be to identify how (in technical terms) media production can beneficially use 5G systems for media production.\nTR 26.805 [4] documents the findings of the Study on Media Production over 5G NPNs. The document contains an elaborative description on different protocols and workflows used in media production at the time of writing. Several different standardization and industry fora are defining Ethernet- and IP-based protocols for media production purposes.\nWhile the study has not identified an urgent technical area for standardisation at this point in time, a number of practical guidelines for implementers are identified and documented in the Technical Report. Those are intended to support media production device manufactures and media producers to leverage different 3GPP features for their purposes.\nThese guidelines may be further promoted and expanded, and more specific aspects are likely worthwhile to be defined. Communication with external organizations such as 5G-MAG is recommended in order to identify if they would follow up on those guidelines to support media production device manufactures and media producers to leverage different 3GPP features for their purposes.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTR 22.827: “Study on Audio Visual Service Production (AVPROD)”\n[2]\tTS 22.263: “System requirements for video,imaging and audio for professional applications (VIAPA)”\n[3]\tTS 26.805 : “Study on Media Production over 5G NPN systems”\n[4]\tTS 26.805: “Study on Media Production over 5G NPN Systems”\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-220587.\n5G multicast and broadcast service specifies architectural enhancements to the 5G system using NR to support multicast and broadcast communication services; encompasses support for functions such as how to deliver multicast and broadcast communications including support within certain location areas, mobility, MBS session management and QoS; and covers interworking with E-UTRAN and EPC based eMBMS for Public Safety (e.g. MCX services).\nThe WI is linked to the RAN WI on NR Multicast and Broadcast Services [2].\nAs documented in TS 23.247 [3], the following features for 5G multicast and broadcast service are specified:\n-\tArchitectural enhancement. MBS Architecture defined in TS 23.247 [3] follows the 5G System architectural principles, enabling distribution of the MBS data from the 5GS ingress to NG-RAN node(s) and then to the UE.\n-\tQoS model and parameters as defined in TS 23.501 [4] also apply to multicast/broadcast communication services with several differences documented in TS 23.247 [3]. The policy and charging control framework as defined in TS 23.503 [5] applies to Multicast and Broadcast services, i.e., for MBS Session binding, QoS Flow binding, PCC rules for MBS Session, and Policy information.\n-\t5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery is for multicast only, and in which 5GC receives a single copy of multicast packets and delivers separate copies of those multicast packets to individual UEs via per-UE PDU sessions, hence for each such UE one PDU session is required to be associated with a Multicast MBS Session. 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery can be used for multicast and broadcast, and in which 5GC receives a single copy of MBS data packets and delivers a single copy of those MBS data packets to a RAN node. See following Figure 1 for details.\nThe figure depicts a user plane data transmission example, illustrating the various data paths and the role of the network in transmitting data.\nFigure 1: User plane data transmission example\n-\t5GC should authorize the AF for delivering MBS data to the 5GC and/or interacting with the 5GC. NEF perform authorization to the external AF for determination of whether the interaction with the 5GC is allowed or not.\n-\tMulticast communication service. It aims at providing the same service and same specific content data to a dedicated set of UEs. The following characteristics for multicast are included in the WI.\n-\tFor Multicast MBS session, 5GC authorizes the UE based on the MBS subscription data, based on MBS subscription data of the UE, and the MBS session information.\n-\tLocal multicast service is the multicast MBS service limited in a certain MBS service area, and it is enforced by NG-RAN node and 5GC. A location dependent multicast service is an MBS service provided in several MBS service area(s), when UE moves to a new MBS service area, content data from the new MBS service area shall be delivered to the UE, and the network ceases to deliver the content data from the old MBS service areas to the UE.\n-\tMobility support of MBS service. UE may move from one NG-RAN node to another NG-RAN node after UE has joined the MB Session. To minimize the data loss of the UE during the handover procedure, multicast MBS session data may be forwarded from source NG-RAN node to target NG-RAN node.\n-\tSession activation and deactivation. The MBS Session activation procedure is used for activating the resources for MBS data at NG-RAN node. The MBS Session deactivation procedure is used for deactivating the resources for MBS data at NG-RAN node. Resources can be efficiently used by a proper control of session activation/deactivation.\n-\tBroadcast communication service. It is to provide the same service and the same specific content data are provided simultaneously to all UEs in a geographical area. For Location dependent broadcast service, it is similar as the one for multicast.\n-\tInter-system mobility with interworking at service layer. In order to minimize the interruption of services, upon mobility for MBS service from NR/5GC to E-UTRAN/EPC and vice versa, the interworking is supported at service layer.\n-\tSecurity for multicast/broadcast service. As defined in TS 33.501 [6], control-plane procedure and user-plane procedure are optionally supported in service layer for security protection of MBS traffic. The user plane security between UE and RAN shall be deactivated when 5GC shared MBS traffic delivery method for MBS data transmission is used to avoid redundant protection.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tSP-201106, New WID: Architectural enhancements for 5G multicast-broadcast services, Huawei, CBN;\n[2]\tRP-220428, WID revision: NR Multicast and Broadcast Services, Huawei, HiSilicon, CBN;\n[3]\tTS 23.247, \"Architectural enhancements for 5G multicast-broadcast services\".\n[4]\tTS 23.501, \"System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\".\n[5]\tTS 23.503, \"Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS)\".\n[6]\tTS 33.501, \"Security architecture and procedures for 5G system\".\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-220408.\nThis Rel-17 NR MBS WI specifies two delivery modes, i.e. MBS multicast and MBS broadcast, for services of PTM (Point-To-Multipoint) nature, such as for example public safety and mission critical services, V2X applications, IPTV, live video, software delivery over wireless and IoT applications.\nBefore introducing NR MBS, there was no broadcast/multicast transmission supported in NR for user data delivery. Services of PTM nature could only be delivered over NR based on unicast, which is inefficient, in particular from radio resources utilization point of view. Nevertheless, for the use cases mentioned above, broadcast/multicast transmission provides substantial benefits, especially in terms of system efficiency and user experience. The MBS multicast delivery mode is capable of addressing higher QoS services while the MBS broadcast delivery mode is focusing on lower QoS services.\nThe objectives of NR MBS WI are included in [2], and the WI is linked to the SA2 WI on Architectural enhancements for 5G multicast-broadcast services [3].\nMBS Multicast: MBS multicast provides the MBS delivery mode for RRC_CONNECTED mode UEs, with the following characteristics:\nGroup scheduling: A common frequency resource (CFR) is defined for multicast scheduling as an ‘MBS frequency region’ with a number of contiguous PRBs, which is configured within the dedicated unicast BWP. A group of UEs can be configured via RRC signalling with a G-RNTI for group scheduling, and the group of UEs can also be configured with downlink SPS and G-CS-RNTI for MBS multicast. The gNB schedules a transport block using G-RNTI (or G-CS-RNTI) to the group of UEs.\nHARQ feedback: HARQ feedback is used to further improve the group scheduling efficiency, and the following two HARQ feedback reporting modes are supported:\nIn the first HARQ feedback reporting mode, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information if the UE has correctly received the transport block or HARQ-NACK value if the UE has not correctly received the transport block.\nFor the second HARQ feedback reporting mode, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-NACK information only if the UE has not correctly received the transport block.\nHARQ reporting for multicast can also be disabled for a UE either semi-statically or dynamically.\nDynamic PTP (Point-To-Point)/PTM switch for MBS multicast\nIt is not always efficient for a gNB to schedule data based on G-RNTI (PTM), and sometimes PTP based scheduling (same as unicast) can bring more benefits thanks to the advanced unicast mechanisms. Based on the common PDCP entity, the gNB can decide whether to use PTM or PTP to deliver data of an MBS multicast session to the UE(s) at a certain time. The gNB makes its decision based on information such as MBS Session QoS requirements, the number of jointly scheduled UEs, UE feedback on link quality, and other criteria and ensures QoS requirements to be met for the service regardless of the chosen transmission method.\nThe figure depicts a dynamic PTP/PTM switch for MBS multicast, illustrating its functionality and design. It features a PTP/PTM switch with a multicast port, allowing for the transmission of multicast data. The switch is designed to support multiple MBSs, ensuring efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure 1: Dynamic PTP/PTM switch for MBS multicast\n\nLossless handover for MBS multicast: To support high QoS services, it is necessary to ensure lossless data delivery also during a handover. To enable lossless handover, synchronisation of PDCP SNs among source and target RAN nodes should be ensured, by either or a combination of the following methods:\n-\tDerivation of the PDCP SNs from DL MBS QFI SNs provided on NG-U;\n-\tDeployment of a Shared NG-U Termination at NG-RAN, shared among gNBs, which comprises a common entity for assignment of PDCP SNs.\nThe figure depicts the synchronization of PDCP (Point-to-Point Data Communication Protocol) signals to enable lossless communication in a wireless network. The PDCP protocol is used to transmit data between two devices, ensuring that the data is transmitted without any loss. The figure illustrates the process of synchronizing the PDCP signals, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the communication.\nFigure 2: PDCP SN synchronization to enable lossless\nMBS Broadcast: MBS broadcast provides the downlink only MBS delivery mode for UE in all RRC states, addressing lower QoS services, with the following characteristics:\nGroup scheduling: A common frequency resource (CFR) is defined for broadcast scheduling as an ‘MBS frequency region’ with a number of contiguous PRBs in which G-RNTI can be used to schedule the associated MBS broadcast service. The bandwidth of CFR can be equal to or larger than initial BWP, which is indicated by system information. HARQ feedback and HARQ re-transmission is not supported for MBS broadcast.\nMBS broadcast Configuration: The UE can receive the MBS configuration for a broadcast service via a broadcast control channel, i.e. MCCH, which is the same for UEs in RRC_IDLE , RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED states.\nService continuity: Lossless mobility cannot be ensured for MBS broadcast, but some mechanisms are specified to support service continuity of the broadcast service. NR MBS broadcast supports MBS frequency prioritization, which enables the UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE to select the right frequency to camp on and receive its services of interest.\nTo ensure service continuity of MBS broadcast for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE can send MBS Interest Indication to the gNB and the gNB can configure the UE in a way allowing it to receive the services the UE is interested in using MBS broadcast.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220407, Status report for WI NR Multicast and Broadcast Services, Huawei, HiSilicon;\n[2] \tTS 33.180: \"Security of the Mission Critical (MC) service; (Release 17)\"\nSummary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220636.\nThe 5G MBS User Services had been developed by SA4 within the 5MBUSA Work Item, and the stage 2 architecture and procedures are documented in TS 26.502 [2].

When delivering content to a MBS Client, the MBSTF uses one or more MBS Delivery Methods.\nReferences\n[1]\tTR 26.802: “Multicast Architecture Enhancement for 5G Media Streaming”\n[2]\tTS 26.502: “5G multicast-broadcast services, User Service architecture”\n[3] \tTS 26.501: “5G Media Streaming (5GMS), General description and architecture”\n\nSummary based on the input provided by TELUS in SP-221269.\nThis Work Item has resulted in a new specification TS 26.502 [1] entitled “5G multicast-broadcast services, User Service architecture” and in CRs to TS 26.501 [2], to support 5G Media Streaming (5GMS) via eMBMS.\nTS 26.502 defines the stage 2 5G multicast-broadcast User Services architecture as follows:\n1.\tAn MBS User Services network architecture that defines how MBS-related entities are involved in providing MBS User Services delivery and control.\n2.\tAn MBS User Services reference architecture model that describes roles of the principal network and UE functions involved.\n3.\tNew reference points in order to support MBS User Services, including MBS 4 MC, MBS 4 UC, MBS 5, MBS 6, MBS 7, and MBS 8 beyond the existing reference points defined in TS 23.247 [3].\n4.\tTwo distribution methods for multicast/broadcast transport of objects and packets respectively.\n5.\tUser Services domain model and dynamic model with relevant parameters for reception reporting, ingestion and announcement.\n6.\tProcedures for 5G Multicast-Broadcast User Services, including baseline procedures, and procedures for user services provisioning, advertisement/discovery, data transfer and data repair.\n7.\tNetwork function services exposed by MBSF and MBSTF.\n8.\tInformative annexes that documents deployment and collaboration models, Nmb8 User Plane ingest examples, and data model examples.\nTS 26.501 further specifies the architecture to allow 5GMS-based downlink media streaming to be deployed as an MBMS-Aware Application on top of eMBMS as defined in TS 23.246 [4], TS 26.346 [5], TS 26.347 [6] and TS 26.348 [7].

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation, Sanechips in RP-220154.\nThis work item enables the transmission of small signalling and/or data packets whilst the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE state. Prior to Rel-17, NR supports RRC_INACTIVE state and UEs with infrequent (periodic and/or non-periodic) data transmission are generally maintained by the network in the RRC_INACTIVE state. Until Rel-16, the RRC_INACTIVE state doesn’t support data transmission. Hence, the UE has to resume the connection (i.e. move to RRC_CONNECTED state) for any DL (MT) and UL (MO) data. Connection setup and subsequently release to INACTIVE state happens for each data transmission however small and infrequent the data packets are. This results in unnecessary power consumption and signalling overhead.\nSome examples of small and infrequent data traffic include Smartphone applications such as: traffic from Instant Messaging services; Heart-beat/keep-alive traffic from IM/email clients and other apps; Push notifications from various applications. Other examples are non-smartphone applications such as: traffic from wearables (periodic positioning information etc); sensors (Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks transmitting temperature, pressure readings periodically or in an event triggered manner etc); smart meters and smart meter networks sending periodic meter readings.\nAs noted in TS 22.891, the NR system shall be efficient and flexible for low throughput short data bursts, support efficient signalling mechanisms (e.g. signalling is less than payload) and reduce signalling overhead in general.\n\nSignalling overhead from INACTIVE state UEs for small data packets is a general problem and will become a critical issue with more UEs in NR not only for network performance and efficiency but also for the UE battery performance. In general, any device that has intermittent small data packets in INACTIVE state will benefit from enabling small data transmission in INACTIVE.\nThe key enablers for small data transmission in NR, namely the INACTIVE state, 2-step, 4-step RACH and configured grant type-1 have already been specified as part of Rel-15 and Rel-16. So, this work builds on these building blocks to enable small data transmission in INACTIVE state for NR.\n\nThe Small Data Transmission (SDT) feature allows data and/or signalling transmission while the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE (i.e. without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED state). SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and is initiated by the UE only if:\n-\tless than a configured amount of UL data awaits transmission across all radio bearers for which SDT is enabled, and;\n-\tthe DL RSRP is above a configured threshold, and;\n-\ta valid SDT resource (either RACH or Configured grant) is available\nSDT procedure is initiated with either a transmission over RACH (referred to as RA-SDT) or over Type 1 CG resources (referred to as CG-SDT). The SDT resources can be configured on initial BWP (for both RACH and CG). RACH and CG resources for SDT can be configured on either or both of NUL and SUL carriers. The initial PUSCH transmission during the SDT procedure includes at least the CCCH message. While the SDT procedure is ongoing, if data appears in a buffer of any radio bearer not enabled for SDT, the UE initiates a transmission of a non-SDT data arrival indication using UE assistance information message to the network and, if available, includes the resume cause. The network may configure UE to apply ROHC continuity for SDT either when the UE initiates SDT in the cell where the UE received RRCRelease and transitioned to RRC_INACTIVE state or when the UE initiates SDT in a cell of its RNA.\nDetails of RA-SDT\nFor RA-SDT, the network may configure 2-step and/or 4-step RA resources. The UE in RRC_INACTIVE initiates RACH and requests RRC resume together with UL SDT data/signalling. If the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB, the UL SDT data/signalling is buffered at the receiving gNB, and then the receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure. RA-SDT is supported with and without UE context relocation and these two mechanisms as depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: RA-SDT with UE context relocation\t\t\tFigure 2: RA-SDT without UE context relocation\nDetails of CG-SDT\nThe CG-SDT resources are valid only within the cell the UE receives the previous RRCRelease (i.e. only for the no cell change case). When using CG resources for initial SDT transmission, the UE can perform autonomous retransmission of the initial transmission if the UE does not receive confirmation from the network. The network can schedule subsequent UL transmissions using dynamic grants or they can take place on the following CG resource occasions. The DL transmissions are scheduled using dynamic assignments. The UE can initiate subsequent UL transmission only after reception of confirmation for the initial PUSCH transmission from the network. For subsequent UL transmission, the UE cannot initiate re-transmission over a CG-SDT resource. CG-SDT can only be initiated with valid UL timing alignment. The UL timing alignment is maintained by the UE based on a SDT-specific timing alignment timer configured by the network via dedicated signalling and, for initial CG-SDT transmission, also by DL RSRP of configured number of highest ranked SSBs which are above a configured RSRP threshold. Upon expiry of the SDT-specific timing alignment timer, the CG resources are released.\nReferences\nList of related CRs:\nselect \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220153 \tStatus Report TSG for WI: NR small data transmissions in INACTIVE state\n\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-220530.\nThis Rel-17 work item introduced additional enhancements for NB-IoT and LTE-MTC based on features standardized in Rel-13 and enhancements performed from Rel-14 through Rel-16. Rel-17 adds features such as 16QAM for NB-IoT in downlink and uplink, 14 HARQ processes in downlink for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs, NB-IoT neighbour cell measurement and triggering before RLF, NB-IoT carrier selection based on coverage level, and a maximum DL TBS of 1736 bits for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs [1].\n\n16-QAM for unicast in UL and DL for NB-IoT\nFrom Rel-13 to Rel-16, an NB-IoT UE can use QPSK for unicast NPDSCH, and QPSK or BPSK for unicast NPUSCH.\nThis feature allows an NB-IoT UE to use 16-QAM for unicast NPDSCH with TBS up to 4968 bits for standalone and guard-band deployments and 3624 bits for in-band deployments; and allows an NB-IoT UE to use 16-QAM for unicast NPUSCH with TBS up to 2536 bits (which can be transmitted with up to half the time-domain resources with respect to QPSK). When 16-QAM for unicast NPDSCH is configured, an NB-IoT UE can report the channel quality report by reporting the recommended NPDCCH repetition and NPDSCH modulation and coding scheme.\nAdditional PDSCH scheduling delay for 14-HARQ processes in DL for LTE-MTC\nThe figure depicts a PDSCH transmission with 10 HARQ processes for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs, illustrating the efficient use of resources and the ability to handle high data rates.\nFigure 1: PDSCH transmission with 10 HARQ processes for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs\nWith 10 HARQ processes, a HD-FDD Cat. M1 UE cannot use all available downlink subframes to transmit PDSCH. As shown in Figure 1, the subframes #0, #1, #17, #18 cannot be scheduled to transmit PDSCH (as marked with an X).\nThis feature allows HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs to use up to 14 HARQ processes in CE Mode A with an additional PDSCH scheduling delay to fully utilize the available BL/CE downlink and BL/CE uplink subframes, where the PDSCH scheduling delay can be indicated as 2 BL/CE DL subframes or a longer delay that consists of different subframe types. Two alternatives for the HARQ-ACK delay indication can be configured: either the HARQ-ACK delay consists of different subframe types, or the HARQ-ACK delay is indicated among sets of absolute subframes.\nNeighbour cell measurements and measurement triggering before RLF for NB-IoT\nThis feature introduces measurements in RRC_CONNECTED for NB-IoT UEs to reduce the time taken for RRC connection reestablishment. The criteria to perform the measurements are signalled separately for intra- and inter-frequency measurements via broadcast signalling. Since dedicated measurements gaps are not supported, the UE may need to perform neighbour cell measurements during DL/UL idle periods that are provided by DRX or packet scheduling.\nCarrier selection based on coverage level for NB-IoT\nThis feature introduces coverage-based paging in NB-IoT to reduce the latency and the resource usage in the network.\nWhen coverage-based paging is enabled, up to two groups of paging carriers can be configured for lower levels of coverage enhancements. The eNB configures the UE during RRC connection release to use one of these groups of paging carriers. If configured, the UE selects a paging carrier in its assigned group if its NRSRP is suitable according to the paging carrier configuration. Coverage based paging is only applicable in the last cell where the coverage information was received.\nMaximum DL TBS of 1736 bits for eMTC\nFrom Rel-13 to Rel-16, the max DL TBS size for LTE-MTC Cat. M1 UEs is 1000 bits.\nThis feature allows HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs to use a DL TBS of up to 1736 bits in CE Mode A, and the soft channel bits for UE supporting this feature is 43008 bits.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220528\tStatus report for WI: Additional enhancements for NB-IoT and LTE-MTC; rapporteur: Huawei\n\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell in Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell.\nIn order to extend the NR applicability in various verticals with tight latency and reliability requirements, Release 16 IIoT work item has introduced transmission reliability enhancements for Time Sensitive Communications (TSC) and addressed efficiency of the system where UEs handle a mixture of URLLC and eMBB traffic. In TSG SA enhancements for the support TSC have been studied (see TR23.700-20) with normative work followed accordingly for Release 17. This Release 17 work item introduced the following enhancements in RAN:\nPhysical Layer feedback enhancements for HARQ-ACK and CSI reporting: For HARQ-ACK feedback enhancements, SPS HARQ-ACK deferral was introduced to prevent excessive SPS HARQ-ACK dropping for PUCCH on TDD cells. Besides, to reduce latency, PUCCH cell switching is supported between the PCell, PSCell, PUCCH-SCell and an additional PUCCH-sSCell for TDD cells. Furthermore, PUCCH repetition enhancements over multiple slots/subslots, HARQ-ACK codebook enhancements and triggered HARQ-ACK codebook retransmissions were introduced to improve the HARQ-ACK feedback reliability.\nFor CSI reporting, enhanced 4-bit sub-band CQI report with absolute values was introduced targeting URLLC services with high reliability requirements and tight latency constraints.\nIntra-UE multiplexing and prioritization of traffic with different priority: To improve UL and DL efficiency and reduce PHY latency for high priority traffic, enhancements on intra-UE multiplexing and prioritization were introduced for overlapping dynamic grant and CG PUSCH of different PHY priorities, multiplexing HARQ-ACK on a PUCCH or PUSCH of a different PHY priority, and simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions of different PHY priorities on different cells for inter-band carrier aggregation (CA).\nUplink enhancements for URLLC in unlicensed controlled environments: URLLC services can be supported in shared spectrum where LBT failures are assumed to be not frequent. For this scenario, semi-static channel occupancy initiated by the UE was introduced.\nBesides, autonomous retransmissions for UL configured grant (CG) and enhanced intra-UE overlapping resource prioritization mechanisms may be enabled simultaneously to harmonize the NR-U and URLLC CG operation.\nEnhancements for support of time synchronization with propagation delay compensation: To improve the absolute time synchronization accuracy of a UE being essential for Time-Sensitive Network (TSN)/TSC operation, two propagation delay compensation (PDC) enhancements are introduced to compensate for time synchronization errors caused by the propagation delay between gNB and UE: PDC based on round-trip-time (RTT) measurements and PDC based on timing advance (TA), which can be performed at the UE or gNB side.\nRAN enhancements based on new QoS related parameter (survival time): In addition to the TSC traffic characteristics introduced in Release 16 as TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI), the Core Network may provide survival time as part of the TSCAI to allow for efficient scheduling at the gNB while satisfying the performance requirements of periodic deterministic communication.\nTo support uplink periodic traffics of services with survival time requirement, configured grant resources can be used such that the mapping relation between the service and the configured grant is known to both gNB and UE. The gNB can use configured grant retransmission scheduling grant to trigger survival time state entry for a DRB which activates all the RLC entities configured for PDCP duplication of the corresponding DRB to prevent failure of subsequent messages.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1] \tRP-220151, Status report for WI Enhanced Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) support for NR; rapporteur: Nokia\n\n",

If the AF is in the same trust domain as the 5G System, then it provides input directly via the Time Sensitive communication Time Synchronization function (TSCTSF).\nThe Functional Architecture is shown in the figure below:\nThe figure depicts a complex architecture for Time Sensitive Communication (TS) and Time Synchronization (TS) services, illustrating the interconnection of various components such as Time Sensitive Data (TSD), Time Sensitive Data Link (TSDL), and Time Sensitive Data Link (TSDL). The figure highlights the importance of synchronization in ensuring the timely delivery of data, and the use of Time Sensitive Data (TSD) to enable real-time communication. The architecture is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for the addition of new components as needed.\nFigure 1: Architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization services\nThe figure below depicts the two main synchronization methods supported: the 5GS synchronization and the (g)PTP domain synchronization.\n•\t5G Clock synchronization: Used for NG RAN synchronization and also distributed to the UE. 5G Clock synchronization over the radio interface towards the UE is specified in TS 38.331.\n•\t(g)PTP synchronization: Provides time synchronization service to (g)PTP network. This process follows the standards IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE 1588 operation.\nThe two synchronization processes can be considered independent from each other and the gNB only needs to be synchronized to the 5G Grand Master (GM) clock.  The 5G system is modeled as a PTP instance for supporting time synchronization, with two synchronization processes being considered independent from each other and the gNB only needing to be synchronized to the 5G Grand Master (GM) clock.\nFigure 2: 5G system is modelled as PTP instance for supporting time synchronization\nIn order to support (g)PtP time synchronization, the 5G System operates in any of the following modes:\n1.\tas time-aware system (IEEE Std 802.1AS).\n2.\tas Boundary Clock (IEEE Std 1588).\n3.\tas peer-to-peer Transparent Clock (IEEE Std 1588).\n4.\tas end-to-end Transparent Clock (IEEE Std 1588).\nThe 5GS shall be modelled as an IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE Std 1588 compliant entity based on the above configuration. The TTs located at the edge of the 5G system (i.e. device side DS-TT and network side NW-TT) are responsible for fulfilling functionalities related to IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE Std 1588.\nThe 5G System is provisioned by the profiles supported by 3GPP specifications that include: Default PTP Profile, IEEE Std 802.1AS PTP profile for transport of timing as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS, SMPTE Profile for use of IEEE Std 1588 Precision Time Protocol in Professional Broadcast Applications.\nFurthermore, (g)PtP time synchronization is supported for the scenarios when Grand Master clock is behind the UE (uplink time sync, UE – UE time sync) and behind the network (down link time sync).\nThe ability for the AF to influence activation of 5G reference time distribution to the UE(s) along with time synchronization error budget (based on the accuracy needed for the application) has also been introduced.\nTime Sensitive Communication and QoS\nTSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) describes traffic characteristics that may be provided for use by the gNB, to allow more efficiently scheduled radio resources for periodic traffic and applying to PDU session type Ethernet and IP.\nTSCAI describes TSC traffic characteristics for use in the 5G System. The knowledge of TSC traffic pattern is useful for 5G-AN to allow it to more efficiently schedule periodic and deterministic traffic flows either via Configured Grants, Semi-Persistent Scheduling or with Dynamic Grants.\nTable 1: TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI)\n\n5GS determines TSC Assistance Container based on information provided by an AF/NEF and may provide it to PCF for IP type and Ethernet type PDU sessions.\nThe AF may provide the traffic pattern parameters such as Burst Arrival Time with reference to the ingress port, Periodicity, Flow Direction, Survival Time and Time domain to the NEF. The NEF forwards the received traffic pattern parameters to TSCTSF.\nThe AF trusted by the operator can be allowed to provide such traffic pattern parameters to TSCTSF directly. The TSCTSF is responsible for determining and forwarding these traffic pattern parameters in TSC Assistance Container to the SMF (via PCF).\nSurvival Time was also introduced as part of TSCAI in order for the AF to provide the time period an application can survive without any burst. It refers to the time that an application consuming a communication service may continue without an anticipated message. Maximum number of messages (message is equivalent to a burst) or in terms of time units. Single burst is expected within a single time period referred to as the periodicity.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1] \tTS 23.501, System Architecture for 5G System; Stage 2 (clauses 4.4.8, 5.27, 5.28)\n[2] \tTS 23.502, Procedures for 5G System; Stage 2\n[3] \tTS 23.503, Policy and Charging Control Framework for the 5G System; Stage 2\n[4] \tFor details of the IEEE work, go to:\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-221163.\nThis Rel-17 work item introduces support for UE complexity reduction techniques and UE power saving techniques suitable for IoT use cases such as industrial wireless sensors, video surveillance, and wearables, with requirements on low UE complexity and/or low UE power consumption and with relatively relaxed data rate requirements. Following an initial study [1], this work item [2] specified support for a reduced capability (RedCap) UE type and two UE power saving techniques: Extended DRX in RRC idle/inactive state, and RRM measurement relaxation for neighbour cells.\nThe following key functionalities are introduced as part of this work item:\nReduced capability (RedCap) UE type: The new reduced capability (RedCap) UE type enables reduced UE complexity through various UE complexity reduction techniques. A RedCap UE supports a maximum UE Rx/Tx bandwidth of 20 MHz in FR1 and 100 MHz in FR2 (whereas a normal NR UE supports at least 100 MHz in FR1 and 200 MHz in FR2). A RedCap UE cannot support larger Rx/Tx UE bandwidths than 20 MHz in FR1 and 100 MHz in FR2, and it cannot support features related to carrier aggregation (CA), dual connectivity (DC), more than 2 UE Rx/Tx antenna branches, or more than 2 DL/UL MIMO layers.\nA RedCap UE can furthermore have a reduced antenna configuration and a reduced number of DL MIMO layers:\n•\tFor FR1, a RedCap UE supports 1 or 2 UE Rx branches and 1 or 2 DL MIMO layers. The supported number of DL MIMO layers is the same as the implemented number of Rx branches, and as a result, 2-Rx RedCap UEs have twice as high DL peak rate as 1-Rx RedCap UEs. The UE indicates to gNB how many branches/layers it supports. The gNB can allow or disallow access from 1-Rx and 2-Rx RedCap UEs separately per cell.\n•\tFor FR2, a RedCap UE can either support a legacy UE power class such as PC3 or the new lower UE power class PC7 (with a reduced-complexity reference UE Rx/Tx antenna configuration with either 1 panel with 4 elements or 2 panels with 2 elements each, corresponding to half the number of array elements compared to a legacy PC3 UE). Furthermore, the UE indicates support for 1 or 2 DL MIMO layers (independent of the antenna configuration).\nA RedCap UE in FDD mode can report per band whether it implements half-duplex FDD (HD-FDD) or full-duplex FDD (FD-FDD) support. In HD-FDD operation, the UE is not required to transmit and receive at the same time. The network indicates in SIB1 whether the cell supports HD-FDD RedCap UEs.\nA RedCap UE can be implemented with or without support for DL 256QAM in FR1. Compared to 64QAM (which is mandatory for RedCap UEs), 256QAM support increases the peak data rate by ~33%. Support for UL 256QAM in FR1 and DL/UL 256QAM in FR2 is also optional for RedCap UEs, but this is true even for legacy NR UEs.\nSome higher layer features are optional for RedCap UEs: RedCap UEs can optionally support 16 DRBs (as normal NR UEs) but only have mandatory support of 8 DRBs. RedCap UEs can optionally support 18-bit PDCP/RLC sequence numbers (as normal NR UEs) but only have mandatory support for 12-bit sequence numbers. RedCap UEs have optional (but not mandatory) support for automatic neighbour relation (ANR) functionality.\nDue to the reduced UE bandwidth, there are some modifications of the bandwidth part (BWP) operation. Separate initial DL/UL BWPs can be configured for random access for RedCap UEs, which may be required if one or both of the ordinary initial DL/UL BWPs in the cell are configured with a bandwidth which is wider than the maximum RedCap UE bandwidth (i.e., wider than 20 MHz in FR1 or wider than 100 MHz in FR2). A separate initial DL BWP can, but does not need to, contain SSB/CORESET#0/SIB. A DL BWP used in connected mode needs to contain (cell-defining or non-cell-defining) SSB but not necessarily CORESET#0/SIB.\nThe UE provides an early indication already during random access that it is a RedCap UE. If RedCap-specific PRACH resources are configured in the cell, the early indication is provided implicitly already by Msg1. In any case, an indication will be provided in Msg3 (or MsgA in case of 2-step RACH) in the form of a RedCap-specific LCID value for CCCH.\nTo minimize UL resource fragmentation for other UEs, the network can choose to disable frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission carrying HARQ-ACK feedback for Msg4 (similar to how PUCCH frequency hopping can be disabled in connected mode).\nExtended DRX in RRC idle/inactive state: Extended DRX cycles are introduced for RRC idle state (up to 10485.76 seconds, i.e., roughly 3 hours) and RRC inactive state (up to 10.24 seconds) as an optional feature for both RedCap and non-RedCap UEs. For use cases with relatively relaxed requirements on DL reachability/latency, the network may configure an extended DRX cycle, which may reduce the UE power consumption substantially during periods with large enough packet inter-arrival time.\nRRM measurement relaxation for neighbour cells: RRM measurement relaxation for neighbour cells is introduced as an optional feature for RedCap UEs that can be enabled by the network. In RRC idle/inactive states, to help reduce UE power consumption, the UE is allowed to further relax neighbour-cell RRM measurements (compared to existing Rel-16 relaxation functionality) when an RSRP/RSRQ-based stationarity criterion is met for a period of time, or when both the stationarity criterion and a not-at-cell-edge criterion are met. In RRC connected state, the network may configure the RSRP/RSRQ-based stationarity criterion and in that case the UE shall report when the criterion is met or no longer met (and how to use the reporting information is up to the network implementation).\nCharging aspects (as per SP-220697 from China Mobile)\nSA2 have studied the architecture enhancement for NR RedCap and introduced the NR RedCap UEs differentiation requirement in clause 5.41 of TS 23.501[4]. Accordingly, CT3 and CT4 have specified a new RAT type NR RedCap. Based on the conclusion, SA5 mainly focus on the charging requirement of ‘RedCap NR Devices’ or ‘devices using NR RedCap’, which can be used by operators to charge differentially.\nStage 2 work on WI ARCH_NR_REDCAP for TS 32.255 [5], TS 32.256 [6] and TS 32.274 [7]: Add charging requirement for SMF, AMF and SMSF to support NR RedCap, providing for NR RedCap UE using NR the RAT Type NR_REDCAP.\nStage 3 work on WI ARCH_NR_REDCAP for TS 32.298 [8]:\tAdding NR RedCap as a new RATType in CHF-CDR.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tTR 38.875 V17.0.0, \"Study on support of reduced capability NR devices\"\n[2]\tRP-220966, \"Revised WID on support of reduced capability NR devices\"\n[3]\tRP-221162, \"Status report for support of reduced capability NR devices\"\n[4]\tTS 23.501: \" System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\"\n[5]\tTS 32.255: \"5G data connectivity domain charging\"\n[6]\tTS 32.256: \"5G connection and mobility domain charging\"\n[7] \tTS 32.274: \" Short Message Service (SMS) charging\"\n[8] \tTS 32.298: \"Charging Data Record (CDR) parameter description\"\n",

Both 5G ProSe Direct Discovery with 5G DDNMF and 5G ProSe Direct Discovery procedures over PC5 reference point are specified. For 5G ProSe Direct Discovery with 5G DDNMF, a new entity 5G DDNMF is introduced to handle network related actions required for dynamic 5G ProSe Direct Discovery. For 5G ProSe Direct Discovery procedures over PC5 reference point, both Group Member Discovery and UE-to-Network Relay Discovery are specified. For all the above 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, both Model A and Model B are supported.\n5G ProSe Direct Communication enables establishment of communication paths between two or more 5G ProSe-enabled UEs that are in direct communication range using NR. 5G ProSe Direct Communication over NR based PC5 reference point supports Broadcast mode, Groupcast mode, and Unicast mode. The Broadcast and Groupcast mode Direct Communication is connection-less while Unicast mode Direct Communication requires a PC5 unicast link be established between two UEs. The Per-Flow QoS model is supported for 5G ProSe Direct Communication.\n5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay enables indirect communication between the 5G network and UEs (e.g. for UEs that are out of coverage of the network). Both 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay are specified. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall provide generic function that can relay any IP (e.g. acts as IP router), Ethernet or Unstructured traffic. The 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay provides forwarding functionality that can relay any type of traffic over the PC5 link, and 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE has its own RRC connection and NAS connection to the network.\nThe Policy/Parameters for 5G ProSe may be provisioned by PCF to UE, and in order to support PC5 radio resource control in NG-RAN, the ProSe service Authorisation information and PC5 QoS parameters for 5G ProSe need to be made available in NG-RAN.\nBased on the Stage 2 requirements to support 5G ProSe, the Stage 3 normative work is specified in TS 24.554 [3], TS 24.555 [4], TS 29.555 [5], TS 29.557 [6] and TS 29.559 [7], the Security normative work is specified in TS 33.503 [8], and ProSe Charging is embedded in normative charging work as specified in TS 32.240 [9].\nCharging aspects (as per SP-220696 from CATT)\nThe charging aspects are specified in TS 23.304 [10].

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in RP-220521.\n3GPP RAN technology for NR sidelink enhancement was specified through this WI to mainly define the means for power saving and enhanced reliability and reduced latency. This WI is the evolution of NR sidelink in Release 16.\nThe key functionalities of NR sidelink enhancement are detailed below.\nPower Savings Resource Allocation\nThe SL UE in Mode 2 can support partial sensing-based resource allocation and random resource selection as power saving resource allocation methods. A SL mode 2 TX resource pool can be (pre)configured to enable full sensing only, partial sensing only, random selection only, or any combination(s) thereof. A UE decides which resource allocation scheme(s) can be used in the AS based on its capability (for a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC) and the allowed resource schemes in the resource pool configuration. Random resource selection is applicable to both periodic and aperiodic traffic.\nA UE configured for partial sensing can perform periodic-based partial sensing and/or contiguous partial sensing for resource (re)selection. Periodic-based partial sensing can only be performed in a TX pool configured with partial sensing and periodic resource reservation. In periodic-based partial sensing, the UE monitors slots in periodic sensing occasion(s) for a given resource reservation periodicity. Contiguous partial sensing is performed by a UE configured for partial sensing when resource (re)selection is triggered by the UE in a TX pool configured with partial sensing. In contiguous partial sensing, the UE monitors slots in a contiguous sensing window which occur prior to the selected transmission resource.\nInter-UE Coordination (IUC)\nThe SL UE can support inter-UE coordination (IUC) in Mode 2, whereby a UE-A sends information about resources to UE-B, which UE-B then uses for resource (re)selection. The following schemes of inter-UE coordination are supported:\n-\tIUC scheme 1, where the coordination information sent from a UE-A to a UE-B is the preferred and/or non-preferred resources for UE-B’s transmission, and\n-\tIUC scheme 2, where the coordination information sent from a UE-A to a UE-B is the presence of expected/potential resource conflict on the resources indicated by UE-B’s SCI\nIn scheme 1, IUC can be triggered by an explicit request from UE-B, or by a condition at UE-A. UE-A determines the set of resources reserved by other UEs or slots where UE-A, when it is the intended receiver of UE-B, does not expect to perform SL reception from UE-B due to half-duplex operation. UE-A uses these resources as the set of non-preferred resources, or excludes these resources to determine a set of preferred resources and sends the preferred/non-preferred resources to UE-B. UE-B’s resources for resource (re)selection can be based on both UE-B’s sensing results (if available) and the coordination information received from UE-A, or it can be based only on coordination information received from UE-A. For scheme 1, MAC CE and second-stage SCI or MAC CE only can be used to send IUC. The explicit request and reporting for IUC in unicast manner is supported.\nIn scheme 2, UE-A determines the expected/potential resource conflict within the resources indicated by UE-B’s SCI as either resources reserved by other UEs and identified by UE-A as fully/partially overlapping with the resources indicated by UE-B’s SCI, or as slots where UE-A is the intended receiver of UE-B and does not expect to perform SL reception on those slots due to half-duplex operation. UE-B uses the conflicting resources to determine the resources to be reselected and exclude the conflicting resources from the reselected resources. For scheme 2, PSFCH is used to send IUC.\nSL DRX\nSidelink supports SL DRX for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Similar parameters as defined for Uu (on-duration, inactivity-timer, retransmission-timer, cycle) are defined for SL to determine the SL active time for SL DRX. During the SL active time, the UE performs SCI monitoring for data reception (i.e., PSCCH and 2nd stage SCI on PSSCH). The UE may skip monitoring of SCI for data reception during SL DRX inactive time. The SL active time of the RX UE includes the time in which any of its applicable SL on-duration timer(s), SL inactivity-timer(s) or SL retransmission timer(s) (for any of unicast, groupcast, or broadcast) are running. In addition, the slots associated with announced periodic transmissions by the TX UE and the time in which a UE is expecting CSI report following a CSI request (for unicast) are considered as SL active time of the RX UE. When data is available for transmission to one or more RX UE(s) configured with SL DRX, the TX UE selects resources taking into account the active time of the RX UE(s) determined by the timers maintained at the TX UE.\nFor unicast, SL DRX is configured per pair of source L2 ID and destination L2 ID. The UE maintains a set of SL DRX timers for each direction per pair of source L2 ID and destination L2 ID. The SL DRX configuration for a pair of source/destination L2 IDs for a direction may be negotiated between the UEs in the AS layer. For SL DRX configuration of each direction, where one UE is the TX UE and the other is the RX UE. RX UE may send assistance information, which includes its desired on duration timer, SL DRX start offset, and SL DRX cycle, to the TX UE and the mode 2 TX UE may use it to determine the SL DRX configuration for the RX UE. Regardless of whether assistance information is provided or not, the TX UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC, or in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 2 resource allocation, determines the SL DRX Configuration for the RX UE. For a TX UE in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation, the SL DRX configuration for the RX UE is determined by the serving gNB of the TX UE. TX UE sends the SL DRX configuration to be used by the RX UE to the RX UE. The RX UE may accept or reject the SL DRX configuration. A default SL DRX configuration for groupcast/broadcast can be used for DCR messages. When the TX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, the TX UE may report the received assistance information to its serving gNB and sends the SL DRX configuration to the RX UE upon receiving the SL DRX configuration in dedicated RRC signalling from the gNB. When the RX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, the RX UE can report the received SL DRX configuration to its serving gNB, e.g. for alignment of the Uu and SL DRX configurations. SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT timer, and SL HARQ retransmission timer are supported in unicast. SL HARQ RTT timer and SL HARQ retransmission timer are maintained per SL process at the RX UE. In addition to (pre)configured values for each of these timers, SL HARQ RTT timer value can be derived from the retransmission resource timing when SCI indicates more than one transmission resource. SL DRX MAC CE is introduced for SL DRX operation in unicast only.\nFor groupcast/broadcast, SL DRX is configured commonly among multiple UEs based on QoS profile and Destination L2 ID. Multiple SL DRX configurations can be supported for each of groupcast/broadcast. SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT and SL retransmission timers are supported for groupcast. Only SL on-duration timer is supported for broadcast. SL DRX cycle, SL on-duration, and SL inactivity timer (only for groupcast) are configured per QoS profile. The starting offset and slot offset of the SL DRX cycle is determined based on the destination L2 ID. The SL HARQ RTT timer (only for groupcast) and SL HARQ retransmission timer (only for groupcast) are not configured per QoS profile or per destination L2 ID. For groupcast, the RX UE maintains an SL inactivity timer for each destination L2 ID, and selects the largest SL inactivity timer value if multiple SL inactivity timer values associated with different QoS profiles are configured for that L2 ID. For groupcast and broadcast, the RX UE maintains a single SL DRX cycle (selected as the smallest SL DRX cycle of any QoS profile of that L2 ID) and single SL on-duration (selected as the largest SL on-duration of any QoS profile of that L2 ID) for each destination L2 ID when multiple QoS profiles are configured for that L2 ID. For groupcast, SL HARQ RTT timer and SL retransmission timer are maintained per SL process at the RX UE. SL HARQ RTT timer can be set to different values to support both HARQ enabled and HARQ disabled transmissions. A default SL DRX configuration, common between groupcast and broadcast, can be used for a QoS profile which is not mapped onto any non-default SL DRX configuration(s). For groupcast, the TX UE restarts its timer corresponding to the SL inactivity timer for the destination L2 ID (used for determining the allowable transmission time) upon reception of new data with the same destination L2 ID. TX profile is introduced to ensure compatibility for groupcast and broadcast transmissions between UEs supporting/not-supporting SL DRX functionality. A TX profile is provided by upper layers to AS layer and identifies one or more sidelink feature group(s). A TX UE only assumes SL DRX for the RX UEs when the associated TX profile corresponds to support of SL DRX. A RX UE determines that SL DRX is used if all destination L2 IDs of interest have an associated TX profile corresponding to the support of SL DRX.\nAlignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is supported for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX at the same UE is supported. In addition, for mode 1 scheduling, the alignment of Uu DRX of the TX UE and SL DRX of the RX UE is supported. For SL RX UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, alignment is achieved by the gNB.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tLast status report: RP-220520\n",

And relay UE can indicate the even of Uu link (e.g., Uu link disconnection or Uu link mobility) to remote UE, so that remote UE can decide whether to perform relay reselection.\nIn order to support PC5 radio resource control in NG-RAN, ProSe service authorisation information and PC5 QoS parameters for ProSe need to be made available in NG-RAN. Beside the authorization for 5G ProSe direct discovery and 5G ProSe direct communication, authorization IEs are introduced to indicate whether the UE is authorised to use a 5G ProSe Layer-3 and/or Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Remote UE. 5G ProSe PC5 QoS parameters are also supported.\nL2 U2N Relay specific aspect: User Plane\nIn order to support bearer mapping between sidelink connection between remote and relay UE, and Uu connection between relay UE and gNB, an adaptation layer is introduced, between RLC (which is per-hop deployed) and PDCP (which is end-to-end deployed). The header of adaptation layer would carry the identity for remote UE identification and bearer identification, in order for relay UE to perform packet forwarding between the two sides.\nThe figure depicts a user plane protocol stack for L2 UE-to-Network Relay, illustrating the various protocols and their interactions. The diagram includes the user plane, network, and relay layers, as well as the protocol stack components such as the user plane protocol, network protocol, and relay protocol.

Furthermore, in order to save relay UE power consumption, network can use dedicated signalling to delivery paging message to relay UE if it is in RRC_CONNECTED state. Based on that, remote UE mobility in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state can be supported.\nFurthermore, in order to support remote UE mobility in RRC_CONNECTED state, the switching between direct and indirect path for intra-gNB scenario is introduced. Via the newly introduced measurement event, remote UE can report the identified candidate connection (direct or indirect) to network, and network can correspondingly switch the UE to the connection (indirect or direct).\nThe figure depicts a procedure for U2N remote UE switching to direct Uu cell, illustrating the steps involved in managing the network's coverage and capacity.\nFigure 5: Procedure for U2N Remote UE switching to direct Uu cell\nThe figure depicts a procedure for U2N remote UE switching to an indirect path, illustrating the steps involved in routing a signal from a base station (gNB) to a user equipment (UE) in a 5G network.

More precisely, it deals with V2X communication over NR PC5 reference point (device-to-device) with power efficiency for pedestrian UEs, i.e. UEs for Vulnerable Road Users. It results from a preliminary study (TR 23.776 [1]).\nThe support of QoS-aware NR PC5 power efficiency for pedestrian UEs is specified in TS 23.287 [2] as below:\n-\tOverall description about support of QoS-aware NR PC5 power efficiency for pedestrian UEs regarding NR PC5 Discontinuous Reception (DRX) operations.\n-\tPC5 DRX configuration, e.g. the mapping of PC5 QoS profile(s) to PC5 DRX cycle(s), default PC5 DRX configuration, for broadcast and groupcast when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\" as provisioned parameters for V2X communications over PC5 reference point.\n-\tNR Tx Profile for broadcast and groupcast as provisioned parameters for V2X communications over PC5 reference point.\nFor NR-based unicast, groupcast and broadcast mode communication over PC5 reference point, PC5 DRX operations are supported to enable pedestrian UE power saving.\nThe V2X layer determines the respective V2X service types, and derives the corresponding PC5 QoS parameters based on either the mapping of V2X service types to PC5 QoS parameters, or the V2X Application Requirements for the V2X service type provided by the application layer. The V2X layer passes the PC5 QoS parameters and destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer. For broadcast and groupcast, the V2X layer also determines the NR Tx Profile for the respective V2X service type based on the mapping of V2X service types to NR Tx Profiles and provides the NR Tx Profile to the AS layer.\nWhen the PC5 DRX operation is needed, e.g. based on the NR Tx Profile in case of broadcast or groupcast, the AS layer determines the PC5 DRX parameter values for V2X communication over PC5 reference point, taking into account, e.g., PC5 QoS parameters and/or destination Layer-2 ID provided by the V2X layer.\nFor unicast, two UEs may negotiate the PC5 DRX configuration in the AS layer, and the PC5 DRX parameter values can be configured per pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs and per direction in the AS layer.\nFor broadcast and groupcast when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\", the UE uses the provisioned PC5 DRX configuration for PC5 DRX operation.\nBased on the Stage 2 requirements to support NR PC5 DRX operations, Stage 3 normative works are specified in TS 24.587 [3], TS 24.588 [4] and TS 31.102 [5].\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTR 23.776: \"Study on architecture enhancements for 3GPP support of advanced Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services; Phase 2\".\n[2]\tTS 23.287: \"Architecture enhancements for 5G System (5GS) to support Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services\".\n[3]\tTS 24.587: \"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services in 5G System (5GS); Stage 3\".\n[4]\tTS 24.588: \"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services in 5G System (5GS); User Equipment (UE) policies; Stage 3\".\n[5]\tTS 31.102: \"Characteristics of the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application\".\n",

When one of the above factors changes due to e.g. UE mobility, the EAS needs to be re-discovered to keep the path optimized.\nEAS discovery and re-discovery mechanisms for different connectivity models are specified. An EASDF (Edge Application Server Discovery Function) is introduced to support these mechanisms.\nEdge relocation: When EAS or PSA UPF relocates due to e.g. UE mobility, 5GS user plane path may be re-configured coordinating with AF to keep the path optimized and minimize the impact to the user experience. Both AF and network triggered edge relocation mechanisms are specified considering different application requirements on e.g. Packet loss and user plane latency.\nNetwork exposure to EAS: Network exposure with low latency is specified to expose QoS monitoring results to EAS. With this UPF based network exposure, the exposure path is shorten to enable the quick reaction of application to the change of network condition.\nSupport of 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge Computing: An Edge Configuration Server (ECS) is specified in TS 23.558[3] to support 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge Computing. The ECS address provisioning to UE via 5GC is defined to support such a mechanism.\nAF guidance to PCF determination of URSP rules: An AF related with Edge computing may need to guide PCF determination of proper URSP rules, so that the URSP configured on the UE can consider the requirements of application.

While there have been efforts at the system level, the overall application layer architecture needs supporting environment (such as provisioning, discovery, registration, enabler layer capability exposure, network capability exposure, support for service continuity) to enable edge applications over 3GPP networks.\nTS 23.558 [1] specifies the architecture, procedures and information flows to enable edge applications over 3GPP networks.\nArchitecture for enabling edge applications based on the architectures principles such as UE application portability, Edge Application portability, service differentiation and flexible deployment.\nThe Edge Data Network (EDN) is a local Data Network. Edge Application Server(s) and the Edge Enabler Server (EES) are contained within the EDN. EES is primarily responsible for enabling discovery of the EASs; Edge Enabler Client supports EAS discovery to the ACs in the UE; and, Edge Configuration Server, providing configurations to the EEC. The Edge Configuration Server provides configurations related to the EES, including details of the Edge Data Network hosting the EES. The UE contains Application Client(s) and the Edge Enabler Client (EEC). The Edge Application Server(s), the Edge Enabler Server and the Edge Configuration Server may interact with the 3GPP Core Network.\nWith the support of the enabling layer, TS 23.558 [1] provides many rich features at the application layer for support of the Edge Application, such as:\n• Service Provisioning: Enabling a UE with an Edge Enabler Client to find and connect to available Edge Data Networks.\n• Rich discovery: On-demand configuration provisioning by the Edge Configuration Server and the query support of Edge Enabler Server allows discovery of the Edges and the Edge Application Servers by a UE equipped with the Edge Enabler Client.\n• Dynamic availability: Due to the flexible nature, the availability of Edge and the EAS can change dynamically due to multiple reasons, such as change in deployments, mobility of the UE etc. UE can subscribe to such changes to fine tune the services provided accordingly.\n• Capability exposure: EES capability is exposed as APIs to EAS (e.g. via CAPIF as specified in TS 23.222 [2]) as value added services to the EASs. The EASs and EESs can also utilize 3GPP network capability exposure as SCEF/NEF northbound APIs.\n• Support for service continuity: With the UE being mobile, eventually, a different server on Edge or Cloud can become more suitable for serving the AC. To enable continuity of service in such scenarios, the architecture supports transfer of the UE’s application context to the new server whenever needed; allowing the new server to restore the service without losing the application context.\nManagement aspects of application layer support of the Edge Applications is specified in TS 28.538 [3].\nSecurity aspects of application layer support of the Edge Applications is specified in TS 33.558 [4].\nStage 3 normative work for application layer support of the Edge Applications are specified as open APIs in TS 24.558 [5] and 29.558 [6].\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 23.558: \"Architecture for enabling Edge Applications\".\n[2] \tTS 23.222: \"Functional architecture and information flows to support Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound APIs; Stage 2\".\n[3] \tTS 28.538: \"Management and orchestration; Edge Computing Management\".\n[4] \tTS 33.558: \"Security aspects of enhancement of support for enabling edge applications\".\n[5] \tTS 24.558: \"Enabling Edge Applications; Protocol specification\".\n[6] \tTS 29.558: \"Enabling Edge Applications; Application Programming Interface (API) specification; Stage 3\".\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by ZTE in SP-210890 for SA and CT aspects, and by CMCC, ZTE in RP-221376 for RAN aspects [note from the editor: one single summary was expected to cover ALL aspects].\nSA and CT aspects:\nThis work item specifies the system enhancements to support some parameters of GST (Generic Slice Template) as documented in NG.116. The following enhancements are specified in this work item.\n-\tA new NSACF(Network Slicing Admission Control Function) is defined to monitor and control the number of registered UEs per network slice and the number of PDU Sessions per network slice for the network slices that are subject to Network Slice Admission Control (NSAC)\n-\tA new QoS parameter \"Slice-Maximum Bit Rate\" (S-MBR) is defined to limit the aggregate data rate in UL and DL per UE across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows for all PDU sessions associated with an S-NSSAI for the UE. The S-MBR is enforced in RAN and is available in PCF for optional input to apply current QoS functionality. In addition the PCF for the PDU Session may also be configured to monitor the data rate per Network Slice for a UE and to strengthen or relax the traffic restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules accordingly\n-\tThe PCF is enhanced to monitor the data rate per Network Slice and based on operator policies, apply a policy decision to strengthen the traffic restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules to ensure that the data rate for the network slice does not exceed the NW Slice maximum data rate parameter which is configured and stored in the UDR. The PCF may use NWDAF service to monitor the data rate per Network Slice.\n-\tAn optional Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group (NSSRG) information for each S-NSSAI in UE subscription is defined to indicate which S-NSSAIs can be simultaneously provided to the UE in the Allowed NSSAI. The serving PLMN AMF may also provide the supporting UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network slicing configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information.\n-\tA mechanism is defined to allow the AMF to provide Target NSSAI and RFSP to RAN to steer the UE to another cell supporting network slices not available in a current cell and RA. The Target NSSAI includes at least one S-NSSAI from the Requested NSSAI not available in the current TA, but available in another TA in different frequency band possibly overlapping with the current TA, and optionally additional S-NSSAIs from the Requested NSSAI that are configured to be available within the same TAs as the S-NSSAIs not available in the current TA.\nRAN aspects:\nEnhancement of RAN slicing for NR was specified through this WI to define the slice aware cell reselection and slice specific RACH configuration and prioritization, as well as to define solutions to support slice-based service continuity, and to support the enforcement of Slice MBR, the usage of Target NSSAI as introduced by SA2.\nSupport slice aware cell reselection\nA new NSAG (Network Slice AS Group) mechanism is introduced for slice aware cell reselection and slice specific RACH configuration, in order to avoid exposing S-NSSAI over Uu interface for reason of security and overhead. In the system information, the NSAG information is broadcast instead of S-NSSAI.\nIn order to assist slice aware cell reselection, the NG-RAN node can provide NSAG specific cell reselection information of current cell and neighbour cell in system information and in RRCRelease message as specified in TS 38.331. The NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided per frequency per NSAG. If NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided in dedicated signalling, the UE shall ignore NSAG specific cell reselection information provided in system information.\nIn the UE, NAS provides the NSAG information and their priorities to be considered during cell reselection to the AS. When a UE supports slice aware cell reselection, and NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided to the UE, then the UE performs the slice aware cell reselection. The details of slice aware cell reselection are specified in TS 38.304. In general, the UE can derive reselection priorities for slice aware cell reselection, and then perform cell reselection evaluation using legacy evaluation criteria.\nSupport slice specific RACH configuration\nIn order to support slice specific RACH configuration, separated RACH partitioning (e.g., transmission occasions of time-frequency domain and preambles) and RACH prioritization parameters (i.e., scalingFactorBI and powerRampingStepHighPriority) can be configured per NSAG in system information as specified in TS 38.331. All slices of a NSAG use the slice specific RACH configuration of the same NSAG.\nIn a cell, there may be multiple slice-specific RACH configurations. One or more of the NSAGs can be linked to a slice-specific RACH configuration. If a NSAG is not linked to any slice specific RACH configuration, the common RACH configuration can be used.\nSupport service continuity\nIn order to support service continuity for specific slice(s), the NG-RAN node may use Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing or Resource Repartitioning to allocate resources to a slice in case of slice resources shortage.\nIn Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing the RAN node can setup the dual connectivity or carrier aggregation with different frequency and overlapping coverage where the same slice is available.\nThe Resource Repartitioning allows a slice to use resources from the shared pool or/and prioritized pool when its own dedicated or prioritized resources are not available and the use of unused resources in the prioritized pool is as specified in TS 28.541.\nSlice RRM policies/restrictions associated with Resource Repartitioning are configured from O&M.\nMeasurements of RRM policy utilization according to resource types defined in TS 28.541 are reported from RAN nodes to O&M and may lead O&M to update the configuration of the Slice RRM policies/restrictions.\nSupport the enforcement of Slice MBR and the usage of Target NSSAI\nThe UE-Slice MBR is introduced to limit the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows corresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) as specified in TS 23.501 and is ensured by the RAN.\nIn case of Dual Connectivity, the MN decides the DL UE Slice MBR and UL UE Slice MBR limits to be assigned to the SN, and indicates these to the SN. In addition, the PDCP entity at the SN applies the received DL UE Slice MBR limit to the set of all bearers for which the SN hosts PDCP for the concerned Slice, as defined in TS 23.501, and the MAC entity at the SN applies the received UL UE Slice MBR limit to the scheduled uplink radio traffic at the SN for the concerned Slice, as defined in TS 23.501.\nIn order to support the enforcement of Slice MBR, RAN interfaces including NG, Xn, F1 and E1 are enhanced to transmit UE-Slice-MBR.\nTarget NSSAI is determined by Core Network on a per UE basis, and used by NG-RAN to attempt to redirect the UE to a cell and TA in another frequency band and TA that supports the S-NSSAIs in the Target NSSAI, as defined in TS 23.501. In order to support the usage of Target NSSAI at NG-RAN, NG interface is enhanced to transmit Target NSSAI.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1] \tTdoc SP-200976, Work Item on \"Enhancement of Network Slicing Phase 2\"\n[2] \tTdoc SP-210269, Updated Work Item on \"Enhancement of Network Slicing Phase 2\"\n[3] \tTdoc SP-190931, Study Item on \"Study on Enhancement of Network Slicing Phase 2\"\n[4] \tTR 23.700-40, Technique Report on \"Study on enhancement of network slicing\"\n[5]\tTR 38.832 Study on enhancement of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing (Release 17)\n[6]\tRP-221375 Status report on enhancement of RAN slicing for NR\n\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Lenovo in SP-220591.\nThe Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSS) feature in 5G networks enables the establishment of a Multi Access (MA) PDU Session, which supports multipath data communication between the UE and UPF, by simultaneously exchanging data over a 3GPP access network (e.g., NG-RAN) and over a non-3GPP access network (e.g., WLAN).\nThe ATSSS work in Rel-17 (aka ATSSS_ph2) specified enhancements for supporting the following features (see [3]):\na) \tATSSS steering mode enhancements (based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-93, clause 8.1); and\nb) \tSupport of MA PDU Sessions with a 3GPP access over EPC and a non-3GPP access over 5GC (based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-93, clause 8.3).\nMore specifically, the following enhancements were specified for the ATSSS in Rel-17. They are grouped into two main categories: (1) Steering mode enhancements, and (2) supporting an MA PDU Session with a 3GPP access leg over EPC.\nSteering mode enhancements:\n- \tPMF measurements per QoS flow: To decide how to steer the traffic of a data flow, access network performance measurements may need to be taken, to estimate the RTT and/or the Packet Loss Rate over each of the accesses of a MA PDU Session.\nThe access network performance measurements (which apply the Performance Measurement Function (PMF) protocol) were enhanced to support RTT measurements and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurements over a certain QoS flow (aka access performance measurements per QoS flow). This is an improvement over Rel-16 wherein the access performance measurements are always conducted over the default QoS flow and, therefore, provide a rough estimate of the RTT / PLR.\nWhether the access performance measurements for a data flow are conducted over the default QoS flow (as in Rel-16), or over the same QoS flow used to carry the data flow, is determined by the network during the MA PDU Session establishment. More details can be found in [1], clause 5.32.5.\n-\tLoad-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an \"autonomous load-balance indicator\" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \"autonomous load-balance indicator\" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.\n-\tLoad-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication: When the network indicates that a data flow should be steered with the load-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a \"UE-assistance indication\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide how to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the UE's internal state (e.g., based on UE’s battery level), and that (b) the UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow.\nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows for which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example, when the network has no strong steering requirements for the default traffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this traffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% - 50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other split percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to optimize its operation (e.g., to minimize its battery consumption).\n-\tThreshold values: A steering mode can be linked with a threshold condition, which specifies how the steering mode should be applied according to this condition. For example, if the threshold condition \"RTT < 100ms\" is applied with the Load-Balancing steering mode, it indicates that traffic can be transferred on 3GPP access or non-3GPP access only if the measured RTT of this access is less than 100ms.\nOne or more threshold values may be provided when the steering mode is either Priority-based or Load-Balancing with fixed split percentages. A threshold value may be either a value for RTT or a value for Packet Loss Rate (PLR). For more details, see [1], clause 5.32.8.\nSupporting an MA PDU Session with a 3GPP access leg over EPC:\n-\tA Multi Access (MA) PDU Session established over the 5G core (5GC) network typically has user-plane resources over a 3GPP access connected to 5GC and user-plane resources over a non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. In Rel-17, however, the user-plane resources over 3GPP access may be established in EPC (through a PDC Connection). In other words, instead of using a 3GPP access connected to 5GC, a 3GPP access (e.g., E-UTRAN) connected to EPC may be used by the MA PDU Session. This enables a scenario where a MA PDU Session can simultaneously send traffic over a 3GPP access connected to EPC and over a non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. More details can be found in [2], clause 4.22.2.3.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 23.501, \"System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 17)\".\n[2]\tTS 23.502, \"Procedures for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 17)\".\n[3]\tATSSS_ph2 work item description: https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_sa/TSG_SA/TSGs_90E_Electronic/Docs/SP-200977.zip\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by CMCC in RP-220822.\nThis work item introduces enhancement of SON and MDT features support in NR standalone and MR-DC, including\nCCO, inter-system inter-RAT energy saving, inter-system load balancing, 2-step RACH optimization, mobility enhancement optimization, PCI selection, energy efficiency (OAM requirements), Successful Handovers Reports, UE history information in EN-DC, load balancing enhancement, MRO for SN change failure, RACH Optimisation enhancements, MDT enhancement and L2 measurements.\nThe key functionalities of this WI are described as below.\nNR Coverage and Capacity Optimization (CCO)\nNR Coverage and Capacity Optimization (CCO) function is to detect and mitigate coverage and cell edge interference issues. Each NG-RAN node may be configured with alternative coverage configurations by OAM. The alternative coverage configurations contain relevant radio parameters and may also include a range for how each parameter is allowed to be adjusted. An NG-RAN node may autonomously adjust within and switch between coverage configurations. When a change is executed, a NG-RAN node may notify its neighbour NG-RAN nodes using the NG-RAN NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message with the list of cells and SSBs with modified coverage included. The list contains the CGI of each modified cell with its coverage state indicator and optionally the SSB index of each modified SSB with its coverage state indicator.\nInter-system inter-RAT energy saving\nThe solution builds upon the possibility for the NG-RAN node owning a capacity booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to dormant state. The decision is typically based on cell load information, consistently with configured information. The switch-off decision may also be taken by O&M. The NG-RAN node indicates the switch-off action to the eNB over NG interface and S1 interface. The NG-RAN node could also indicates the switch-on action to the eNB over NG interface and S1 interface.\nThe eNB providing basic coverage may request a NG-RAN node’s cell re-activation based on its own cell load information or neighbour cell load information, the switch-on decision may also be taken by O&M. The eNB requests a NG-RAN node’s cell re-activation and receives the NG-RAN node’s cell re-activation reply from the NG-RAN node over the S1 interface and NG interface. Upon reception of the re-activation request, the NG-RAN node’s cell should remain switched on at least until expiration of the minimum activation time. The minimum activation time may be configured by O&M or be left to the NG-RAN node’s implementation.\nInter-system load balancing\nThe load reporting function for inter-system load balancing is executed by exchanging load information between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN. Both event-triggered and periodic inter-system load reporting are supported. Event-triggered inter-system load reports are sent when the reporting node detects crossing of cell load thresholds.\nThe following load related information should be supported:\n-\tCell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);\n-\tCapacity value (per cell: UL/DL available capacity);\n-\tRRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC Connection Capacity);\n-\tNumber of active UEs.\n-\tPRB usage (per cell: UL/DL)\nNGAP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer and Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer.\nS1AP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are eNB Configuration Transfer and MME Configuration Transfer.\n2-step RACH optimization\n2-step RACH optimization is supported by UE reported 2-step RACH related information made available at the NG RAN node and by PRACH parameters exchange between NG RAN nodes.\nPCI selection\nFor aggregated architecture and centralized PCI assignment in gNB, the OAM assigns a single PCI for each NR cell in the gNB, and the gNB selects this value as the PCI of the NR cell.\nFor Aggregated architecture and distributed PCI assignment in gNB, the OAM assigns a list of PCIs for each NR cell in the gNB, and the gNB selects a PCI value from the list of PCIs. The gNB may restrict this list by removing some PCIs that are reported by UEs, reported over the Xn interface by neighboring gNBs, and/or acquired through other methods, e.g. detected over the air using a downlink receiver.\nThe PCI Optimization Function in split gNB case, the OAM configures a PCI for each NR cell to the gNB-DU. For centralized PCI assignment in split gNB architecture, the gNB-CU detects PCI conflict of NR cells and reports the NR cells suffering PCI confilict to OAM directly. The OAM is in charge of reassigning a new PCI for the NR cell subject to PCI conflict. For distributed PCI assignment in split gNB architecture, the OAM assigns a list of PCIs for each NR cell and sends the configured PCI list to the gNB-CU. If the gNB-CU detects PCI conflict, the gNB-CU may select a new PCI value from the preconfigured PCI list for the NR cell and send it to the gNB-DU by either F1 Setup procedure or gNB-CU configuration update procedure.\nEnergy efficiency (OAM requirements)\nTo calculate the energy efficiency of base stations, ETSI ES 203 228 (\"Environmental Engineering (EE); Assessment of mobile network energy efficiency\") defines the following high-level EE KPI:\n\nIn which Mobile Network data Energy Efficiency (EEMN,DV) is the ratio between the performance indicator (i.e. Data Volume DVMN) and the energy consumption (ECMN).\nSuccessful Handovers Reports\nSuccessful Handovers Reports is reported by the UE to detect failure events happened during successful handovers.\nThe solution for the problem may consist of the following steps:\n1)\tUE is configured with triggering conditions to compile the Successful Handover Report;\n2)\tOnly if the conditions are met, UE generates Successful Handover Report comprising a set of measurements collected during the successful handover phase, i.e. measurement at the handover trigger, measurement at the end of handover execution or measurement after handover execution.\n3) The availability of a Successful Handover Report may be indicated by Completed message (RRCReconfigurationComplete, RRCReestablishmentComplete, RRCSetupComplete, RRCResumeComplete) transmitted from UE to NG-RAN node over RRC. The NG-RAN node may fetch information of a successful handover report via UE Information Request/Response mechanism.\n4) NG-RAN node could forward the Successful Handover Report to the source NR-RAN node to indicate failures experienced during a successful handover event.\nUpon reception of a Successful HO Report, the receiving node is able to analyse whether its mobility configuration needs adjustment.\nUE history information in EN-DC\nUE history information is introduced in EN-DC to avoid Ping Pong effect. The MN stores and correlates the UE History Information from MN and SN(s) as long as the UE stays in MR-DC, forwards UE History Information and optional UE History Information from the UE to its connected SNs. The resulting information is then used by SN in subsequent handover preparation. The SN is in charge of collecting SCG UE history information and providing the collected information to the MN based on MN request or MN subscription on the PSCell change.\nThe MN may retrieve the SCG UE history information via the SN Addition and SN Modification procedures. SN shall provide the SCG UE history information, if available, in the SN Addition, SN Modification, SN Release, and SN initiated SN Change procedures.\nLoad balancing enhancement\nThe load reporting function is executed by exchanging load information over the Xn/X2/F1/E1 interfaces. Besides the load metrics introduced in Rel-16, some more metrics are introduced for intra-system load balancing, including, PRB usage for slice(s): DL/UL GBR PRB usage, DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage, and DL/UL Total PRB allocation) and PRB utilisation for MIMO\nTo achieve load reporting function, Resource Status Reporting Initiation & Resource Status Reporting procedures are used.\nMRO for SN change failure\nFor analysis of PSCell change failure, the UE makes the SCG Failure Information available to the MN.\nMN performs initial analysis to identify the node that caused the failure. If the failure is caused by a SN, the MN forwards the SCG Failure Information to the SN. The SN performs the final root cause analysis. The details of the solution, including the description in this paragraph are FFS.\nOne of the functions of self-optimization for PSCell change is to detect PSCell change failures that occur due to Too late PSCell change or Too early PSCell change, or Triggering PSCell change to wrong PSCell. These problems are defined as follows:\n-\tToo late PSCell change: an SCG failure occurs after the UE has stayed for a long period of time in the PSCell; a suitable different PSCell is found based on the measurements reported from the UE.\n-\tToo early PSCell change: an SCG failure occurs shortly after a successful PSCell change from a source PSCell to a target PSCell or a PSCell change failure occurs during the PSCell change procedure; source PSCell is still the suitable PSCell based on the measurements reported from the UE.\n-\tTriggering PSCell change to wrong PSCell: an SCG failure occurs shortly after a successful PSCell change from a source PSCell to a target PSCell or a PSCell change failure occurs during the PSCell change procedure; a suitable PSCell different with source PSCell or target PSCell is found based on the measurements reported from the UE.\n\nMDT enhancement\n\n-\tSupport for NR MDT IDC mechanism\n-\tExtension to LoggedMeasurementConfiguration with a flag to indicate if an early measurement/idle mode configuration has relevance for logged measurement purposes\n-\tUE support to assist the network in preventing management based logged MDT overwriting signalling based logged MDT\n-\tExtension to LoggedMeasurementConfiguration with Logged MDT type indication used for signalling MDT protection\n-\tRACH failure report extension with 2-step RACH relevant information\n-\tSupport for multiple CEF reports\n-\tSupport of M5~M7 for EN-DC SN terminated MCG bearer/split bearers and MN terminated SCG/split bearers\n-\tImmediate MDT configuration support for MN terminated SCG bearer and SN terminated MCG/split bearer by the terminated node, e.g., MN in case of MN terminated SCG bearer\n-\tRLF report support for CHO and DAPS HO\n-\tSupport for logging of on-demand SI\nL2 measurement\nPRB usage for MIMO was first introduced to NR in Rel-16 to reflect the PRB usage at the case of MU-MIMO and multiple MIMO layers. Configuring the same constant value Alpha for all the cells sometimes is not suitable, especially for cells in bad radio condition. And it is also difficult to manually configure Alpha for each cell, considering the large number of NR base stations. In Rel-17, PRB Usage based on statistical MIMO layer and Enhanced PRB Usage for MIMO are specified. Comparing with R16 PRB usage measurement, the new PRB usage measurement can adjust Alpha autonomously, e.g., based on statistical data of MIMO layer. The objectives of the measurements are to measure usage of time and frequency resources. A use-case is OAM performance observability.\nIn addition, PDCP excess packet delay is also specified for delay sensitive services, e.g., URLLC. The objective of this measurement performed by UE is to measure Excess Packet Delay in Layer PDCP for QoS verification of MDT.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-22xxxx, Status report for WI on enhancement of SON_MDT support for NR and MR-DC, CMCC\n",

In 5GS, the UE obtains a new 5G-GUTI by performing a MRU without any specific indication.

Both schemes can be configured by the network separately.\nWhen determining it needs to leave RRC_CONNECTED, the UE sends the UEAssistanceInformation message, which indicates the UE’s preferred RRC state when leaving RRC_CONNECTED for MUSIM purpose. gNB may release the UE to RRC IDLE/INACTIVE when receiving this UAI. The UE is allowed to enter RRC_IDLE if it does not receive response message from network within a certain configured time.\nWhen determining it needs the MUSIM gaps, the UE sends the UEAssistanceInformation message, which indicates the UE’s preference on the MUSIM gaps. The UE can request at most a single aperiodic MUSIM gap and two periodic MUSIM gaps. The MUSIM gap is per UE level.\n-\tPaging cause objective: a paging cause field with only one codepoint voice was introduced in the NR/LTE Uu paging message, S1AP/NGAP paging message, and XNAP/F1AP paging message. The network provides this field for the upcoming paging triggered by IMS voice, only if the UE indicates the paging cause feature is supported to the network. In order to enable NG-RAN to deliver the paging cause in RAN paging for the UE in RRC-INACTIVE, the AMF provides an indication indicating the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature is supported to the NG-RAN. The NG-RAN node knows the downlink data which triggers the RAN Paging message is related to voice service based on the Paging Policy Indicator, in the header of the received downlink data.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220603, Status report for WI\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.\nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of experienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power consumption. UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the success of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to address outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power consumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption with traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the following new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:\n•\tEnhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs\n•\tEnhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH monitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG) switching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM and/or BFD in connected mode\nPaging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode\nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the group of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple subgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for paging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via associated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging probability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to monitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall monitor the paging in its PO.\nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n•\tSubgrouping is either CN controlled or UE ID based:\no\tFor CN controlled subgrouping, AMF is responsible for assigning subgroup ID to the UE. The total number of subgroups for CN controlled subgrouping which can be configured e.g. by OAM is up to 8. It is assumed CN-based paging subgrouping support in an RNA is homogeneous.\no\tFor UE ID based subgrouping, the gNB and UE can determine the subgroup ID based on the UE ID and the total number of subgroups for UE ID based subgrouping in the cell. The total number of subgroups for UE ID based subgrouping is decided by the gNB for each cell and can be different in different cells.\n•\tTotal number of subgroups allowed in a cell is up to 8 and represents the sum of CN controlled and UE ID based subgrouping configured by the network;\n•\tA UE with CN controlled subgroup ID shall apply CN controlled subgroup ID if there is a corresponding indication allocated in the PEI for the CN controlled subgroup; otherwise, it derives UE ID based subgroup ID if the cell supports only UE ID based subgrouping.\nPEI associated with subgroups has the following characteristics:\n•\tIf the PEI is supported by the UE, it shall at least support UE ID based subgrouping method;\n•\tPEI monitoring can be optionally limited via system information to the last used cell;\n•\tPEI monitoring is based on Type2A-PDCCH Common Search Space (CSS) set for a DCI format 2_7 with CRC scrambled by a PEI-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG. Each bit of paging indication field of DCI format 2_7 indicates one UE subgroup of a paging occasion;\n•\tA PEI occasion (PEI-O) is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions (MOs) and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. subframe or OFDM symbol) where PEI can be sent. The number of PO(s) associated with one PEI -O is a factor of total PO number associated with up to two paging frames (PFs).\n•\tThe time location of PEI-O for UE's PO is determined by a reference point and a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the start of the first PDCCH monitoring occasion of this PEI-O. The reference point is the start of a reference frame determined by a frame-level offset from the start of the first PF of the PF(s) associated with the PEI-O. The time location of PEI-O can be configured so that total UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode, including synchronization and RRM measurements, can be minimized.\nProvision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs\nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to synchronization for paging receptions, RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive UE(s) can be provided via system information (SIB17). By exploiting TRS for synchronization, UE can reduce the number of wake-up for SSB before a paging reception and potentially achieve longer sleep. It is noticed that RS configuration in SIB17 does not affect the UE behaviour in CONNECTED mode and can be ignored by UE in CONNECTED mode.\nThe maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is 64. If a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability indication is always enabled based on that configuration. A UE which acquired SIB17 with a TRS configuration but did not yet receive an associated L1-based availability indication considers the configured TRS as unavailable. The L1 availability indication is carried in a DCI format 2_7, if configured, and a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by P-RNTI. The TRS availability indication field in the DCI format(s) provides a bitmap for up to 6 groups of TRS resource sets where the configuration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit of the bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a validity duration for TRS resource sets with indicated presence. UE considers the validity duration for all TRS resource set groups is ended when UE receives the changed TRS/CSI-RS configuration in the modification period following a SI change notification or until the validity time duration expires, whichever is earlier.\nFurther PDCCH monitoring reduction, including enhanced SSSG switching and PDCCH skipping\nIn order to reduce UE power consumption on PDCCH monitoring, enhanced PDCCH monitoring adaptation mechanisms within an active BWP and triggered by scheduling DCI formats are provided. The adaptation applies to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell. The adaptation is triggered according to the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field, if present, in DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2. With the fast adaptation mechanisms, UE can be indicated to perform reduced PDCCH monitoring at the end of or after a duration of data scheduling, thereby achieving UE power saving with minimum impact to data scheduling.\nUE power saving can be achieved through Rel-17 SSSG switching mechanism when Rel-17 SSSG configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to switch to a target SSSG via the indication of a scheduling DCI. If search space switch timer is also configured, UE switches to the SSSG of the lowest group index after timer expiration if no detected DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI/CS-RNTI/MCS-C-RNTI for the configured timer duration. The switch delay is at least Pswitch symbols, and Pswitch depends on the numerology of the serving cell. For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 SSSGs.\nUE power saving can also be achieved through PDCCH skipping mechanism when PDCCH skipping duration configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to skip PDCCH monitoring for a duration, starting from next slot after the indication, and shall resume PDCCH monitoring after the indicated duration. For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 skipping durations. In the following cases, UE ignores PDCCH skipping:\n-\ton all serving cells of the corresponding Cell Group when SR is sent and is pending;\n-\ton SpCell while contention resolution timer is running;\n-\ton SpCell during monitoring of the RAR/MsgB window.\nUE can be configured with both Rel-17 SSSG configuration and PDCCH skipping durations. In this case, UE performs either SSSG switching or PDCCH skipping based on the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field in a detected DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2.\nRelaxation of UE measurements for RLM and/or BFD in connected mode\nUE power saving can be enabled by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD. When configured, UE determines whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than a threshold and, if criterion is configured, whether it is in low mobility state. The configuration for good serving cell quality criterion and, if included, low mobility criterion is provided through dedicated signalling.\nRLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately. Additionally, RLM relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per-CG basis while the BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per serving cell basis.\nThe UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation when relaxed measurement criterion for good serving cell quality and, if configured, for low mobility is met. If configured to do so, the UE shall trigger reporting of its RLM and/or BFD relaxation status through UE assistance information if the UE changes its respective RLM and/or BFD relaxation status while meeting the UE minimum requirements specified.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tRP-221543, \"Revised WID_UE Power Saving Enhancements for NR\", MediaTek Inc.\n[2]\tRP-220747, \"Status report for WI_UE Power Saving Enhancements for NR\", MediaTek Inc.\n[3]\tRP-212972, \"Introduction of UE power savings enhancements in NR\", RAN1\n[4]\tRP-220256, \"Rel-17 maintenance of UE power savings enhancements in NR\", RAN1\n[5]\tRP-220483, \"RAN2 CRs to UE power saving enhancements for NR\", RAN2\n[6]\tRP-220960, \"Introduction of UE power saving enhancements in 38.300\", Huawei, HiSilicon\n[7]\tRP-220961, \"Introduction of ePowSav in TS 38.331\", CATT\n[8]\tRP-220235, \"RAN3 CRs for UE power saving enhancements for NR\", RAN3\n[9]\tRP-220366, \"RAN4 CRs for Open REL-17 NR or NR+LTE WIs - Batch 23\", RAN4\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in RP-220802.\nThis WI introduces enhanced specification support for several key aspects on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) operation where Rel-15 and 16 NR were found deficient in terms of signalling latency, overhead, as well as spectral efficiency and coverage.\nFirst, although Rel-15/16 NR supports FR2 deployments via multi-beam operation, signalling latency and overhead especially for beam indication are high for common beam operation. This not only hampers deployments in high-speed scenarios, but also scenarios where the number of configured TCI states is large. In addition, it lacks the support for inter-cell operation, multi-panel UEs, and maximum permissible exposure (MPE) mitigation.\nSecond, although Rel-16 NR introduced mTRP support for PDSCH, it still lacks ample support for PDCCH, PUSCH, and PUCCH. In addition, enhancements for inter-cell mTRP and beam management aspects specific to mTRP are introduced along with features to facilitate high-speed train deployment on single frequency network (HST-SFN).\nThird, SRS has been a useful tool to acquire UL or DL CSI since Rel-15. However, the triggering mechanism of aperiodic SRS limits its flexibility. Further, antenna switching SRS only supports up to 4 antennas, which limits the performance for use cases requiring larger than 4 receive antennas. In addition, along with the expansion of 5G deployment, the demand to further improve SRS capacity and coverage appears.\nFourth, although Rel-16 has enhanced the Rel-15 Type-II to allow improved performance-overhead trade-off, CSI enhancements designed for mTRP non-coherent JT and Type-II assuming FDD (angle-delay) reciprocity can be beneficial to support additional deployment scenarios.\nEnhancements for multi-beam operation\nIn Rel-15/16, UL beam indication utilizes a different framework from DL beam indication. As DL and UL beam indication share similar characteristics, a unified TCI-based framework for DL and UL beam indication is introduced in Rel-17 where UL TCI is used to represent UL spatial relation. Depending on whether DL and UL share the same TCI (e.g. in relation to the beam correspondence assumption supported by the UE), a UE can be configured with either joint DL/UL TCI (where DL and UL share the same TCI state hence a single TCI state update applies to both) or separate DL/UL TCI (which includes the signalling of DL-only, UL-only, and DL+UL TCI state update).\nCentral to the Rel-17 TCI framework is the use of common beam for UE-dedicated PDCCH and the associated PDSCH intended to streamline multi-beam operation. While Rel-15/16 supports the use of common beam for UE-dedicated PDCCH and the associated PDSCH, beam indication is performed via MAC-CE. The latency and overhead associated with MAC-CE potentially detract the application of NR for high-speed scenarios in the FR2 regime. In Rel-17, such latency and overhead are reduced with the introduction of DCI-based beam indication using the existing DCI formats 1_1/1_2 (with and without DL assignments) via the TCI field. To ensure that the NW and the UE are aligned in terms of TCI state, an ACK mechanism for the beam indication is supported either via the ACK associated with the PDSCH (when beam indication is accompanied with DL assignment) or an ACK mechanism analogous to that used for SPS PDSCH release (when beam indication is not accompanied with DL assignment). When only one TCI state is activated via MAC-CE, the DCI-based beam indication is not used. In this case, beam indication is performed via MAC-CE.\nThe Rel-17 TCI framework also supports auxiliary features such as a common TCI state ID update using a common TCI state pool and/or reference CC for Carrier Aggregation, UL power control setting (including PL-RS) association with TCI state, as well as inter-cell beam management. Inter-cell beam management includes measurement and reporting of L1-RSRP as well as beam indication for TCI states associated with PCIs different from that of the serving cell. In addition, common beam operation can be configured to other signals such as non-UE dedicated reception associated with serving cell PCI, aperiodic CSI-RS, and aperiodic SRS.\nTo better support UEs equipped with multiple panels, UE reporting of the capability associated with the maximum number of SRS ports and its correspondence with CSI-RS or SSB resource indicators (CRI/SSB-RI) is introduced. This reporting is performed in conjunction with the supported beam reporting.\nDue to adherence to the MPE (maximum permissible exposure) regulation, some UL coverage penalty is incurred as the UE ends up using a sub-optimal UL transmit beam. To alleviate this issue, some enhancement in the existing PHR report is introduced where beam-specific P-MPR along with the associated CRI/SSBRI is added into the MAC-CE-based PHR report.\nEnhancements for multi-TRP operation\nIn Rel-17, PDCCH repetition is defined by explicit linkage between two search space sets. The two linked search space sets can be associated with corresponding CORESETs with different TCI states, hence, achieving beam-diversity for PDCCH transmission. In Rel-17, only intra-slot PDCCH repetition is supported, and also, PDCCH repetition is only supported for USS or Type3 CSS. In addition, the linkage is specified at the PDCCH candidate level by restricting configurations of two linked search space sets resulting in one-to-one mapping between monitoring occasions and between PDCCH candidates of the two linked search space sets. Two linked PDCCH candidates have the same aggregation level, same coded bits, and the same DCI payload. To avoid ambiguity at the UE, a reference PDCCH candidate is defined for various procedures such as timelines, PUCCH resource determination, PDSCH reception with mapping Type B or mapping Type A, determination of QCL assumption for PDSCH when TCI field is not present in DCI, etc. UE can report whether two blind decodes or three blind decodes are needed for two linked PDCCH candidates. In the case of three blind decodes, overbooking for PDCCH is enhanced accordingly. Furthermore, determination of two QCL-TypeD is specified for FR2 to support time-overlapping PDCCH repetitions. PDCCH repetition is supported also for cross-carrier scheduling through linking two search space sets in both scheduling cell and scheduled cell.\nIn Rel-17, to support multi-TRP PUCCH repetition, up to two sets of power control parameters in FR1 or up to two PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in FR2 can be activated per PUCCH resource or per PUCCH resource group via MAC-CE. In addition, multi-TRP PUCCH repetition can be configured by intra-slot PUCCH repetition as well as inter-slot PUCCH repetition for all PUCCH formats. Based on the number of activated PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or set of power control parameters for the scheduled PUCCH resource, dynamic switching between single-TRP PUCCH repetition and multi-TRP PUCCH repetition can be supported. Separate power control for multi-TRP PUCCH repetition is supported by two activated PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or two activated sets of power control parameters. Furthermore, up to two TPC field for PUCCH can be supported and each TPC field is applied for each closed loop index.\nIn Rel-17, multi-TRP PUSCH repetition is supported with up to two SRS resource sets with usage set to ‘codebook’ or ‘nonCodebook’. If UE is provided by two SRS resource sets with usage set to ‘codebook’ or ‘nonCodebook’, the second SRI field, second TPMI field (if CB-based PUSCH is supported), and second PTRS-DMRS association field are indicated by DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 for PUSCH transmission occasion(s) toward the TRP which is related to the second SRS resource set with usage set to ‘codebook’ or ‘nonCodebook’ for dynamic grant based PUSCH scheduling. In addition, the new DCI field is defined as ‘SRS resource set indicator’ with 2 bits to support dynamic switching between single-TRP PUSCH repetition (corresponding to codepoint ‘00’ and ‘01’) and multi-TRP PUSCH repetition (corresponding to codepoint ‘10’ and ‘11’). Separate power control for multi-TRP PUSCH repetition is supported by linking between two SRI fields and two sets of power control parameters via higher layer parameter. And also up to two TPC field for PUSCH can be supported and each TPC field is applied for each closed loop index. Furthermore, the aforementioned multi-TRP PUSCH repetition is also supported by configured grant type 1 and 2.\nIn Rel-16, multi-TRP PDSCH transmission is supported with two different mechanisms: single-DCI and multi-DCI. In Rel-17, multi-TRP PDSCH transmission is further extended to inter-cell operation. A UE can be configured with SSB associated with PCI which are different from serving cell PCI, known as additional PCI. At most 7 different additional PCI can be configured to the UE, and only one is activated for inter-cell multi-TRP operation. The additional PCI can be associated with one or more TCI states, and gNB can schedule PDSCH dynamically from either TRP by indicating TCI in DCI.\nIn Rel-17, beam reporting and BFR are enhanced for mTRP scenario specifically. For beam reporting enhancement, framework of Rel-15 group based beam reporting is extended to facilitate simultaneous transmission of multiple TRPs. To achieve that, one CSI resource setting including two resource sets corresponding to two TRPs can be configured. In a CSI-report, UE can report N (Nmax = {1, 2, 3, 4}) groups of simultaneously received beams, wherein each reported beam in one group corresponds to one TRP. Differential L1-RSRP reporting across all beam groups is supported, and 1-bit is added to indicate CMR set associated with the largest RSRP value in the first group. For BFR enhancements, both single-DCI and multi-DCI framework are supported. For multi-DCI, two explicit or implicit BFD-RS sets are introduced for two TRPs in one CC. BFRQ can be transmitted if any one of BFD-RS sets fails. BFRQ framework is enhanced based on Rel.16 SCell BFR. The maximum number of PUCCH-SR resources is extended to 2. After UE receives gNB’s response, per-TRP beam reset can be performed. When both BFD-RS sets in SpCell fail, CBRA based RACH transmission can be triggered. For single-DCI, only explicit BFD-RS set configuration can be supported.\nRel-17 defines two key approaches for frequency offset compensation in HST-SFN scenario: UE-based and TRP-based compensation schemes. For UE-based compensation (scheme A), UE receives additional reference signals transmitted by the TRPs in a non-SFN manner to facilitate more accurate frequency offset compensation. The corresponding non-SFN TRS configurations are provided to the UE by using two TCI states (containing reference to the TRS of two TRPs) using DCI and MAC signalling. The TRP-based compensation (scheme B) relies on frequency offset pre-compensation at the network side, where each TRP estimates the downlink frequency by using uplink signal, e.g., SRS, and compensates the downlink frequency per TRP prior to transmission. For TRP based pre-compensation, UE also receives two TRS transmitted by the TRPs in a non-SFN manner using two TCI states. However, since network pre-compensates the PDCCH and PDSCH by the difference of the frequency offsets observed between two TRPs, frequency offset tracking at the UE is performed using only one TRS transmitted by the reference TRP.\nSRS enhancements\nIn NR Rel-15/16, aperiodic SRS is triggered by DCI to provide dynamic indication of SRS transmission. However, only one triggering offset value can be configured in RRC per SRS resource set. This limits the valid combinations of the location to send the triggering DCI and the location to transmit SRS, esp. considering TDD slot format, where not all slots are available to transmit SRS. To address this issue, Rel-17 introduces SRS triggering offset enhancement based on available slot definition. Up to 4 offset values can be configured in RRC per SRS resource set, where each value is defined as the number of available slots counting from a reference slot. Reference slot is defined as the slot indicated by legacy triggering offset. In DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2, one new field \"SRS offset indicator\" (SOI) is added to select one available slot offset value from the configured ones. In addition, Rel-15/16 DCI format 0_1/0_2 cannot be indicated to trigger SRS only, i.e., without CSI request and without data. This limitation is removed in Rel-17 by allowing gNB to trigger SRS based on DCI format 0_1/0_2 without CSI request and without data.\nTo ensure performance for uses case with larger than 4 receive antennas, Rel-17 introduces antenna switching SRS to support 1T6R, 1T8R, 2T6R, 2T8R and 4T8R. In addition, to improve flexibility of antenna switching SRS, Rel-17 extends the P/SP configurations by supporting maximum 2 SP SRS resource sets and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource set for antenna switching, and the aperiodic configuration by supporting 1 or 4 aperiodic SRS resource sets for 1T4R and 2 aperiodic resource sets for 1T2R/2T4R.\nIn order to enhance the capacity and coverage for SRS, the following three schemes are specified in Rel-17.\nIncreased repetition: Rel-17 supports 8, 10, 12 and 14 consecutive repetition symbols in one slot in one SRS resource.\nPartial frequency sounding: Rel-17 supports to transmit SRS only in  contiguous RBs in one OFDM symbol, where  indicates the number of RBs configured by BSRS and CSRS. It can be applied on both frequency hopping case and non-frequency hopping case. The scaling factor PF is configured by RRC per SRS resource, which can be 2 or 4. The start RB index of the  RBs in the  RBs is  , where kF is configured by RRC with a value chosen from kF = {0, 1, …, PF-1}. khopping is same for all SRS occasions within a legacy FH period but can hop across legacy FH periods. When the hopping of khopping is not enabled, it is fixed to be 0 for all SRS symbols. When the hopping of khopping is enabled, one hopping pattern is supported for each PF value.\nComb 8: Rel-17 supports comb-8 for SRS other than for positioning, where the maximum number of cyclic shifts is 6.\n\n\nCSI for mTRP and FDD reciprocity\nThe Rel-17 eType-II port selection (PS) codebook assumes codebook structure as Rell-16. The key enhancement comes from exploiting angle-delay reciprocity in DL and UL which is applicable for both TDD and FDD. By doing so, spatial domain and frequency domain compression operation inherent in the Rel-16 eType-II PS codebook can be shifted toward the gNB thereby reducing UE computational burden. While the amplitude and phase per channel/ propagation path are generally not DL and UL reciprocal, the gNB can employ angle-delay information obtained from UL measurements to precode UE-specific CSI-RS. Therefore from CSI measurement perspective at the UE, a subset of CSI-RS ports based on beamformed CSI-RS resource are first selected by the UE and represented by W_1, frequency domain compression is represented by Wf giving rise to up to two selected DFT vectors, and lastly linear combination coefficients are quantized in amplitude and phase by W2 with configurable compression factors up to 1 by removing negligible coefficients.\nMoreover, to improve CSI measurement accuracy over NCJT transmission in Rel-16, Rel-17 NCJT CSI enhancement supports a joint channel measurement at the UE by configuring a CMR pair within the same CSI-RS resource set corresponding to two TRPs respectively. Therefore a CSI-RS resource set is divided as two CMR groups so that each CMR pair consists of one CMR from Group 1 and one CMR from Group 2. From CSI reporting perspective, two modes are supported, whereas Mode 1 is to report X (X=0,1,2) single-TRP CSI and one NCJT CSI versus Mode 2 is to report one single-TRP or NCJT CSI. For the reporting quantity of NCJT CSI (up to rank 4), the main differentiation from legacy releases is that only single CQI/CRI is reported per CMR pair by jointly considering the best companion PMI/RI from two CMRs simultaneously to mitigate TRP interference. Also to use CSI-RS resources and configurations efficiently, sharing mechanism can be enabled by the gNB to reuse a CMR pair (configured for NCJT CSI measurement) for single-TRP CSI measurement if needed.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated, Samsung in RP-221178.\nThis WI builds on Rel-16 \"IAB for NR\", which introduced wireless backhauling of F1 over NR to enable flexible and dense deployment of 5G cells while reducing the need for wireline transport infrastructure.\nThe enhancements to IAB introduced in Rel-17 improve on various aspects over Rel-16 IAB such as robustness, degree of load-balancing, spectral efficiency, and backhaul performance.\nThe Rel-17 IAB enhancements support the following new functionality:\n•\tIntroduction of inter-donor migration of the IAB-MT to increase robustness and allow for more refined load-balancing and topology management.\n•\tReduction of service interruption during IAB-node migration and BH RLF recovery to improve network performance, allow the network deployment to undergo more frequent topology changes, and provide more stable backhaul performance.\n•\tEnhancements to scheduling as well as flow and congestion control to improve end-to-end performance as well as spectral efficiency to the IAB network.\n•\tDuplexing enhancements to increase spectral efficiency and reduce latency through the support of SDM/FDM-based resource management and through simultaneous transmissions and/or reception on IAB-nodes.\nWith Rel-17 enhancements, IAB remains transparent to the UE. At the same time, legacy UEs can benefit from the enhancement provided by Rel-17. The Rel-17 IAB enhancements are further applicable to FR1 and FR2.\nInter-donor IAB-MT migration and connectivity\nInter-donor IAB-MT migration and recovery\nTo enhance robustness and load balancing, Rel-17 IAB introduces the inter-donor partial migration and RLF recovery. For inter-donor partial migration, the IAB-MT performs handover or conditional handover to migrate from the source IAB-donor to the target IAB-donor. For inter-donor RLF recovery, the IAB-MT performs the RRC Reestablishment procedure at the target IAB-donor. During these procedures, the IAB-MT obtains new IP addresses from the target IAB-donor that are anchored at the target IAB-donor-DU to enable IP connectivity via this target IAB-donor-DU. The F1 and non-F1 traffic of the migrating IAB-node and its descendent nodes is then routed via a new BAP path that uses the target IAB-donor-DU. The F1 connections, however, remain terminated at the source IAB-donor. This traffic migration is facilitated via coordination between source and target IAB-donors using the XnAP IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures introduced in Rel-17 for this purpose. In these procedures, the source IAB-donor sends QoS information of the traffic to be migrated to the target IAB-donor, so that the target IAB-donor can establish the backhaul transport on RLC and BAP sublayers on the target path. The target IAB-donor informs the source IAB-donor about all layer-2 and IP information needed by the source IAB-donor to configure the necessary end-to-end transport. The XnAP IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures are also used to allocate IP addresses for descendent nodes, and to ensure proper QoS and connectivity support via the target IAB-donor-DU over time, e.g., due to configuration or release of new F1-U GTP-tunnels.\nRel-17 introduces the concept of the IAB-topology, which contains all IAB-nodes and IAB-donor-DUs as well as all backhaul links that are controlled by the same IAB-donor via RRC and/or F1AP. After inter-donor partial or RLF recovery, all descendent node traffic has to pass through two IAB topologies controlled by separate IAB-donors. The migrating IAB-node is referred to as the boundary IAB-node since it is controlled by both IAB-donors and therefore resides in both topologies.\nThe concept of the IAB-topology is necessary to coordinate the L2 configurations across an IAB-network controlled by two IAB-donors. Each IAB-donor can independently use the full name space of BAP addresses, BAP path IDs and BH RLC CH IDs for the transport in its own IAB topology. Descendent-node traffic that travels across two IAB-topologies uses a separate BAP routing IDs for each of these two topologies. At the boundary node, the BAP routing ID used by a BAP PDU in one topology is rewritten to the BAP routing ID the BAP PDU uses in the other topology. The BAP routing ID mapping is coordinated between both IAB-donors during traffic migration.\nRel-17 enhancements also allow for the revocation of the traffic migration caused by inter-donor partial migration. For this purpose, the target IAB-donor conducts an Xn handover of the IAB-MT in reverse direction, i.e., back to the former source IAB-donor. The source IAB-donor can request the revocation of this traffic migration.\nSource and target IAB-donors can further coordinate the use of radio resources used on parent and child links via the XnAP IAB Resource Coordination procedure introduced in Rel-17 for this purpose.\nInter-donor topological redundancy\nFor the enhancement of load balancing, Rel-17 IAB further introduces inter-donor topological redundancy. For this purpose, the IAB-MT executes the NR DC procedure to concurrently connect to two IAB-donors. The collocated IAB-DU can establish F1 with either of these two IAB-donors. Inter-donor topological redundancy also interconnects two IAB-topologies where the dual-connected IAB-node assumes the role of the boundary node. F1 and non-F1 traffic of the dual-connected IAB-node and its descendent nodes can be gradually migrated between the two paths via either the MN’s or the SN’s IAB-donor-DU. The XnAP IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures are used for the coordination between MN and SN IAB-donors for this traffic migration. The boundary node applies BAP header rewriting for all traffic that passes through both IAB-topologies. The MN and SN further coordinate the use of radio resources used on the parent links and child links of the dual-connecting IAB-node.\nCP-UP separation\nFor the enhancement of robustness, Rel-17 IAB introduces CP-UP separation for an IAB-node that is dual-connected with an IAB-donor and a gNB, which does not assume IAB-donor role. In this case, the IAB-node’s F1-C can be exchanged via the backhaul with the IAB-donor or, alternatively, via the path containing the access link between IAB-node and gNB and the Xn connection between gNB and IAB-donor. For CP-UP separation, the gNB can either assume MN or SN role. In the former case, SRB2 is used on the NR access link for the passing of F1-C traffic, and split SRB in the latter case.\nReduction of service interruption\nIntra-donor migration with parallel migration of descendent nodes\nFor the reduction of service interruption during intra-donor IAB-node migration, Rel-17 introduces enhancements to enable concurrent traffic migration by the descendent nodes and the migrating IAB-node. For this purpose, the IAB-donor sends the RRC Reconfiguration messages to the descendent nodes prior to migration. It includes an indicator in the F1AP Transfer message for the descendant’s parent node to withhold the RRC message from delivery until the migration has succeeded. When the migration succeeds, all RRC messages withheld are released in a top-down sequence through the tiers of the subtree. In this manner, all IAB-nodes affected can conduct the migration of F1-C in a concurrent rather than sequential manner.\nSupport of inter-donor-DU local re-routing\nFor the reduction of packet loss due to link unavailability, Rel-17 introduces inter-donor-DU local re-routing for UL traffic.\nThe NR dual-connected IAB-node can perform inter-donor-DU re-routing in case its parent backhaul links connect to separate IAB-donor-DUs, but do not share a single route to a common IAB-donor-DU. When one of the parent links is not available, the IAB-node can re-route the UL traffic via the other parent link to the alternative IAB-donor-DU. To ensure proper routing on the BAP sublayer, the IAB-node rewrites the BAP header of these re-routed UL PDUs with a BAP routing ID that contains the BAP address of this alternative IAB-donor-DU.\nThe alternative IAB-donor-DU can forward the traffic to the peer IAB-donor-DU, which was the packet’s original destination, via a statically configured GTP-U tunnel. The alternative IAB-donor-DU selects a packet for tunneling by matching the packet’s source IP address with a IAB-donor-configured IP address list. In case the alternative IAB-donor-DU and its peer belong to separate IAB-donor-CUs, the IP address list is forwarded between the IAB-donors.\nEnhancements to BH RLF indications\nFor the reduction of packet loss due to BH RLF, Rel-17 introduces the BH RLF detection indication and the RLF recovery indication. In case an IAB-node attempts RRC Reestablishment due to BH RLF, it can send the RLF detection indication to each child node. If the child node has an alternative backhaul path available, it can apply UL rerouting for upstream packets. If it has no such alternative backhaul path, it can propagate the BH RLF detection indication to the next tier. When the IAB-node has recovered from the BH RLF, it can send the RLF recovery indication to each child node, which revokes all behaviour triggered by the BH RLF detection indication before. The BH RLF recovery indication is propagated in the same manner as the BH RLF detection indication.\nPerformance enhancements in BH transport and scheduling\nEnhancements to QoS\nFor the improvement of UL QoS scheduling on the backhaul, Rel-17 introduces an extension of the LCG space. The extended LCG space supports 256 instead of just 8 LCGs. Extended LCGs can be signalled via new short and long BSR MAC CEs. The extended LCGs can also be used for pre-emptive BSR.\nEnhancements to congestion mitigation\nFor the improvement of congestion mitigation, Rel-17 introduces DL local re-routing based on flow-control feedback on BAP sublayer as well as DL congestion reporting to the IAB-donor-CU-CP.\nThe IAB-node can apply DL local re-routing for a BAP destination when the congestion control feedback for this destination exceeds an IAB-donor-configured threshold.\nThe IAB-DU can report congestion with child BH RLC channel granularity to the IAB-donor-CU-CP. This allows the IAB-donor-CU-CP to apply congestion mitigation measures such as the configuration of routing changes, topology adaptation, or changes to the radio-resource configuration.\nEnhancements in multiplexing\nThe following enhancements to physical layer procedures have been made in Rel-17 in the context of enhanced multiplexing:\nFDM of IAB-MT and IAB-DU operation is enabled by extending the concept of Hard, Soft and Unavailable IAB-DU symbol resources to Hard, Soft, and Unavailable IAB-DU sets of RBs within a component carrier, provided through a Rel-17 IAB-DU frequency domain resource configuration in addition to the Rel-16 IAB-DU time domain resource configuration. The DCI 2_5 mechanism is extended to support explicit release of Soft resources with RB set granularity. Similarly, the rules for implicit determination of availability of a Soft RB set are extended for FDM operation.\nInterference mitigation is facilitated by the ability to exchange of semi-static Rel-16 IAB-DU time domain resource configuration information and the Rel-17 IAB-DU frequency domain resource configuration information among neighbouring IAB-nodes and IAB-donors.\nSDM of IAB-MT and IAB-DU operation is facilitated by the introduction of two new timing alignment modes for IAB-MT transmit timing: Case 6 timing aligns the IAB-MT transmit timing with the IAB-DU transmit timing, facilitating SDM Tx at the IAB-node. Case 7 timing aligns the IAB-DU receive timing with the IAB-MT receive timing, facilitating SDM Rx at the IAB-node.\nThe provision for over-the-air synchronization, introduced in Rel-16 to enable an IAB-node to derive its IAB-DU Tx timing from the received DL signal by the collocated IAB-MT, is updated to account for the newly introduced Case 6 and Case 7 timing modes.\nSimultaneous operation of the IAB-MT and the IAB-DU is further facilitated by the ability of an IAB-node to indicate to a parent node a list of preferred IAB-MT beams with the associated conditions under which such beam preference applies, and by the ability of a parent node to indicate to the IAB-node a list of restricted IAB-DU beams with the associated conditions under which such beam restriction applies. Additionally, concurrent IAB-MT and IAB-DU operation, is aided by the ability of the IAB-node to indicate to a parent node a desired DL power adjustment and/or a desired IAB-MT Tx power spectral density range, where each indication includes the associated conditions for the desired adjustments.\nOptimizations for dual-connectivity operation of an IAB-node are introduced by supporting coordination of IAB-MT’s TDD configuration to avoid conflicts from the two parent nodes, by supporting the exchange of IAB-DU resource configurations between parent nodes, by applying Rel-16 CA TDD prioritization rules, and by supporting a per-child MT link Unavailable resource configuration.\nRF and RRM requirements\nRAN4 decided to adopt following update to RF and RRM requirements for IAB enhancement:\nRF perspective: the requirement applicability for simultaneous operation is agreed to be included in specification with clarification that the different declaration on transmission power in simultaneous transmission is allowed for ACLR and Modulation quality. Timing error between IAB-DU and IAB-MT of the same IAB-Node is also defined for transmission mode case 6.\nRRM perspective: No impact is identified for RRM aspect to enable Rel-17 IAB enhancement except update with applicability clarification that existing transmit timing and timing adjust requirements of IAB-MTs apply when transmission mode is set to \"case 1\".\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1] \t RP-213668: New WID on Enhancements to Integrated Access and Backhaul; TSG RAN Meeting #94, electronic meeting, December 6-17, 2021.\n[2] \t RP-221176: Status Report for integrated access and backhaul; TSG RAN Meeting #96, Budapest, Hungary, June 3-6, 2022.\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in RP-220564.\nCoverage is one of the key factors that an operator considers when commercializing cellular communication networks due to its direct impact on service quality as well as CAPEX and OPEX. The Rel-17 study item 860036 \"Study on NR coverage enhancements\" evaluated the baseline performance and identified the potential bottleneck channels for both FR1 and FR2 [1]. This work item [2] specifies enhancements for PUSCH, PUCCH and Msg3 PUSCH, including enhancements on PUSCH repetition Type A, TB processing over multiple slots PUSCH, DMRS bundling for PUSCH/PUCCH, dynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication and Type A PUSCH repetitions for Msg3.\nThe following key functionalities are introduced as part of the Work Item:\nEnhancements on PUSCH repetition Type A\nFor PUSCH repetition Type A, the maximum number of repetitions is increased up to 32. The increased maximum number of repetitions is applicable to PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0_1 and DCI format 0_2 as well as PUSCH repetition Type A with Type 1 and Type 2 configured grant. In addition, PUSCH repetition Type A supports the repetitions counted based on available slots, and the maximum of repetitions for counting based on available slots is 32. When the counting based on available slots is enabled, a UE follows the 2-step procedure to perform PUSCH transmissions: in the first step, the UE determines available slots for K PUSCH repetitions; in the second step the UE determines whether to drop each of the K PUSCH repetition or not according to PUSCH dropping rules, where the PUSCH repetition is still counted in the K repetitions even if it is dropped.\nTB processing over multiple slots PUSCH (TBoMS)\nA single Transport Block (TB) using a resource allocated over multiple slots is introduced for PUSCH except Msg3. A UE scheduled to perform a TBoMS transmission, via either dynamic or configured grant (Type 2), uses the resource allocated across multiple slots to calculate the transport block size (TBS) for the transmission. Advantages of this approach as compared to single-slot PUSCH operations are in the form of lower effective coding rate and/or energy per resource element (EPRE) increase, both advantages leading to coverage enhancement. A TBoMS transmission can be performed w/ or w/o repetition, where a TBoMS transmission w/o repetition is referred to as single TBoMS transmission. The number of slots allocated for TBoMS is counted based on available slots. The UE transmits the TB across the slots determined as available for the TBoMS transmission, applying the same symbol and PRBs allocation in each slot, regardless of whether TBoMS is scheduled w/ or w/o repetition. Collision handling rules of Type A PUSCH repetition apply for TBoMS. TBS of a single TBoMS transmission is calculated using the resource in all the slots allocated for the single TBoMS transmission. The maximum supported TBS for TBoMS does not exceed legacy maximum supported TBS in Rel-15/16, for the same number of layers. TBoMS supports the transmission of only one layer and one code block. A single redundancy version (RV) is used for the transmission of a single TBoMS, irrespective of the number of slots allocated for a single TBoMS transmission, as per Figure 1. RV cycling is used across repetitions of a single TBoMS, as per Figure 2 . Rate Matching (RM) for TBoMS is performed per slot.\n\nFigure 1. Example of single TBoMS transmission (w/o repetitions) where 4 slots are allocated for the single TBoMS.\n\nFigure 2. Example of TBoMS transmission w/ repetitions, where 2 slots are allocated for the single TBoMS and 4 repetitions are configured.\nDMRS bundling for PUSCH/PUCCH\nDMRS bundling to enable improved channel estimation is introduced for PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0_1 or 0_2, for PUSCH repetition Type A with configured grant, for PUSCH repetition Type B, for TB processing over multiple slots PUSCH and for PUCCH repetitions of PUCCH formats 1, 3, and 4. A UE can report the maximum duration, in number of consecutives slots, during which the UE is able to maintain power consistency and phase continuity under certain tolerance level. With the duration of the nominal TDWs (Time Domain Windows), not longer than the maximum duration, configured by gNB, one or multiple nominal TDWs can be determined for PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions. A nominal TDW consists of one or multiple actual TDWs. Events, which cause power consistency and phase continuity not to be maintained across PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions within the nominal TDW, are defined. An actual TDW is terminated in case an event occurs. A new actual TDW is created in response to semi-static events not triggered by DCI or MAC-CE. Whether a new actual TDW is created in response to dynamic events triggered by DCI is subject to UE capability. Frequency hopping and UL beam switching for multi-TRP operation are regarded as semi-static events. The UE shall maintain power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW across PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions.\nInter-slot frequency hopping with DMRS bundling to enable improved channel estimation within the same frequency hop is introduced for PUSCH repetition Type A, PUSCH repetition Type B, TBoMS and PUCCH repetitions. With the frequency hopping interval, N consecutive slots, configured by gNB, the UE performs inter-slot frequency hopping every N consecutive slots for PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions.\nDynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication\nDynamic repetition factor indication is introduced for PUCCH. This feature allows network to adjust PUCCH repetition factor in a flexible fashion based on channel conditions and traffic load. The mechanism to support this feature is an enhanced RRC configuration to configure different repetition factor per PUCCH resource. With this configuration, network can use existing PRI (PUCCH resource indicator) in DCI to point to a PUCCH resource where the associated repetition factor will be applied to the PUCCH transmission. By pointing to a different PUCCH resource via PRI, a different PUCCH repetition factor could apply, which implements the dynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication.\nType A PUSCH repetitions for Msg3\nUp to 16 repetitions is introduced for a Msg3 PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant or DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This is beneficial to enhance the coverage on both NUL and SUL. After carrier selection and BWP selection during the RACH initialization procedure, a UE requests repetition of Msg3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant via separate PRACH resource when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference fulfils a configured threshold. If requested by the UE, gNB decides whether or not to schedule repetition of the Msg3 PUSCH transmission.

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated, China Telecom in RP-221589.\nThis work item enables a UE to indicate a capability to transmit a maximum output power higher than what the power class for a UL CA or DC configuration would have previously allowed. In particular, for a UE supporting PC3 (23 dBm) in one band and PC2 (26 dBm) in another band, the carrier aggregation configuration may have been specified for PC2 (26 dBm). In such an example, the maximum composite power from both transmitters would be limited to 26 dBm. With this newly introduced Increased MOP capability, the UE is allowed to transmit at its maximum potential when simultaneously transmitting at maximum power on each carrier, in other words, the maximum allowed power is increased to 27.8 dBm for this example.\nHigher maximum UE transmit power is nearly universally accepted as a desirable feature for cellular radio systems to enable greater range, capacity, and cell edge user throughput. This can be seen by the introduction of PC2 (26 dBm) first in Rel-14 followed by PC1.5 (29 dBm) in Rel-16 along with the proliferation of operator requests for specification support of CA and DC combinations supporting these higher power classes. At the same time, UE front-end architectures are evolving to include multiple transmit chains capable of operating simultaneously in time. UL MIMO, UL CA, and transmit diversity are some of the recent developments where dual PA configurations are assumed in RAN4. It is therefore beneficial to introduce methods to unlock the maximum transmit capability of multiple PA’s across different bands transmitting at the same time. This work item has enabled the possibility for a UE supporting PC3 within an NR TDD or FDD band and supporting PC2 within a second NR TDD band to signal a [HigherPowerLimitCADC] capability whereby the maximum output power indicated by the power class of the CA or DC configuration can be exceeded.\nUsing CA for illustration but without loss of generality to DC, this is achieved by replacing the PPowerClass,CA term in the expression for the upper and lower limits of the maximum configured output power. Specifically,\nPCMAX_L = MIN {10log10∑ MIN [ pEMAX,c/ (tC,c), pPowerClass.c/(MAX(mprc·∆mprc, a-mprc)·tC,c ·tIB,c·tRxSRS,c) , pPowerClass,c/pmprc], PEMAX,CA, PPowerClass,CA-ΔPPowerClass, CA}\nPCMAX_H = MIN{10 log10 ∑ pEMAX,c , PEMAX,CA, PPowerClass,CA-ΔPPowerClass, CA}\n-\tPPowerClass,CA is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2A.1.3-1 without taking into account the tolerance specified in the Table 6.2A.1.3-1; If the UE indicates [HigherPowerLimitCADC] for an eligible CA configuration as specified in Table 6.2A.1.3-1 and ΔPPowerClass, CA = 0, PPowerClass,CA is replaced by 10 log10 ∑ pPowerClass,c.\nFrom these equations, it can be seen that both the lower limit PCMAX_L and the upper limit PCMAX_H are increased by virtue of replacing the PPowerClass,CA term which appears in both lower and upper limits. Raising the upper limit has the effect of allowing the UE to increase its maximum aggregated configured output power. On the other hand, also raising the lower limit has the effect of ensuring that the UE will increase its maximum aggregated configured output power. The agreement in the CR to raise both lower and upper limits somewhat reduces the flexibility for the UE, but the UE has the freedom to not signal the optional capability, increasing both limits facilitates testability of the feature and imbues meaning to the signalled capability, provides assurance that the UE can indeed raise its power when signalled, and reduces the uncertainty to the base station by shrinking the difference between the upper and lower limits.\nThe scope of this work for Rel-17 as reflected in the agreed CR’s is limited to specific PC2 + PC3 power configurations as indicated by the UE’s reported power class, by [powerClassPerBand], or by the default power class specified in 38.101-1 for the band. The scope does not include greater than two PA’s since three PA and higher configurations are not considered in RAN4 Rel-17 specifications. This limitation in scope for Rel-17 then omits CA configurations with both intra-band CA in one band and inter-band CA with another band, for example.\nMoreover, during the course of the work item, the impact of increasing MOP on MSD, MPR and A-MPR, and SAR mechanisms was also studied by companies. It was found that specification changes were not needed for any of these within the context of this Rel-17 CR. Rather the existing specifications for MSD, MPR and A-MPR, and SAR can still apply. Hence, these requirements have not been adjusted.\nReferences\n[1]\tRP-221302, \"New WID: Increasing UE power high limit for CA and DC,\" China Telecom, Qualcomm\n[2]\tRP-221588, \"Status Report to TSG: Increasing UE power limit high for CA and DC,\" Qualcomm Incorporated\n[3]\tR4-2210767, \"Increasing the maximum power limit for inter-band UL CA\", Qualcomm Incorporated, Verizon, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, US Cellular, T-Mobile USA, AT&T, China Unicom, NTT DOCOMO, INC., China Telecom, Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell, CableLabs, Charter Communications, Inc., Dish Network, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., ZTE, Huawei, HiSilicon, SGS Wireless\n[4]\tR4-2210768, \"Increasing the maximum power limit for inter-band UL DC,\" Qualcomm Incorporated, Verizon, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, US Cellular, T-Mobile USA, AT&T, China Unicom, NTT DOCOMO, INC., China Telecom, Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell, CableLabs, Charter Communications, Inc., Dish Network, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., ZTE, Huawei, HiSilicon, SGS Wireless\n[5]\tR4-2211189, \"Rel-17 RAN4 UE feature list for NR,\" CMCC\n\n",

New RF requirements, corresponding new feature groups and functionalities are introduced for the WI as follows:\n-\tSpecification restrictions for SUL bands supporting UL MIMO are removed in both RAN4 and RAN2 specs\n-\tIn Rel-16, switching period between case 1 and case 2 was introduced to enable enhancement on UL performance with 2Tx transmission on one UL carrier for inter-band UL CA, SA SUL and inter-band EN-DC. UE capability on uplinkTxSwithingPeriod is introduced as 35μs, 140μs and 210μs (210μs only for inter-band UL CA and SA SUL). Meanwhile, UE DL interruption is allowed when configured with difficult band combinations. In Rel-17, the feature is extended to dynamic Tx switching between 2CC 2Tx-2Tx switching, 3CC 1Tx-2Tx switching and 3CC 2Tx-2Tx switching. In addition, capability to indicate whether UL-MIMO coherence is supported when dynamic Tx switching between 3CC (within 2 bands) 1Tx-2Tx switching and 2CC or 3CC (within 2 bands) 2Tx-2Tx switching are introduced.\n-\tRF Requirements for PC3 and PC2 intra-band UL contiguous CA with UL MIMO are specified. During the study in Rel-17, it was agreed that no explicitly indication of specific UE architectures in the spec, i.e. 23+23, 23+26, 26+26. Also the conclusion is reached that MPR for 1T PC2 is applied for PC2 UL contiguous CA w/o UL MIMO or TxD indication while MPR for 2T 23+23 is applied for PC2 UL contiguous CA with UL MIMO and/or TxD indication.\n-\tRF Requirements for PC3 and PC2 intra-band non-contiguous UL CA are specified, especially the MPR values are defined based on different UE architectures (indicated via supporting dualPA-Architecture or not).\n-\tSCell dropping solution as a WI objective for preventing transmission power dropping on the cell with lower priority for both FR1 and FR2 CA is also discussed. As the solutions may have spec impact to other WGs, also there is no consensus whether it should be considered as a solution to address the potential in-field issue, the only possibility is to drop the discussion in Rel-17. Meanwhile, there was some discussion on PCMAX,CA and PHRCA reporting, similar to SCell dropping solution, no further discussion is considered in Rel-17.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220680, SR on NR_RF_FR1_enh, RAN#95e\n[2] \tR4-2107847, Reply LS on Rel-17 uplink Tx switching, China Telecom\n[3] \tR2-2203986, RRC configuration for UL Tx switching enhancement, Huawei, HiSilicon, China Telecom, Apple, CATT\n[4] \tR2-2203987, stage 2 CR for UL Tx switching enhancement, Huawei, HiSilicon, China Telecom\n[5] \tR2-2203998, Introduction of Rel-17 Tx switching enhancements, China Telecom, Huawei, HiSilicon, Apple, CATT\n",

Corresponding network RRC signalling and measurement requirements are specified in TS38.331 and TS38.133, respectively.\n1)\tPre-configured MG pattern(s)\n- Introduced 2 activation/de-activation mechanisms and corresponding UE capabilities to support these two mechanism: Network controlled mechanism, in which UE follows the 1-bit per-BWP indications in active servings cell and 1-bit indication in deactivated serving cells to decide the ON/OFF status of the pre-configured MG; UE autonomous mechanism, in which UE follows the defined rules in TS38.133 to decide the ON/OFF status of the pre-configured MG. If MG is not needed for all measurements, the pre-configured gap should be deactivated (OFF) ; Otherwise, activated (ON). Events that may trigger UE to re-check the ON/OFF status includes: [DCI/Timer based BWP switching, activation/de-activation of SCell(s), addition/removal of any measurement object(s), addition/release/change of a SCell under CA, BWP switching by RRC, initiation of LocationMeasurementIndication];\n- Introduced additional delay for pre-configured MG activation/deactivation which is 5ms on top on the legacy procedure delay that may trigger pre-configured MG status change;\n- Updated the corresponding UE requirements regarding gap interruption, measurement delay and L1 measurement impact.\n2)\tMultiple concurrent and independent MG patterns\n- Introduced multiple gap configurations and corresponding UE capability\n- Introduced a mandatory association between gap and dedicated use cases (e.g. PRS, SSB, CSI-RS, EUTRA) by indicting a gap ID in the measurement objective or MG configuration (for PRS only). So that UE’s measurement behaviour is well-defined, because UE is only required to perform the measurement associated to the gap during that gap occasion.\n- Introduced the maximum supported concurrent gap patterns for per-FR gap incapable/capable UEs. For per-FR gap incapable UE, up to 2 concurrent gap patterns can be configured. For per-FR gap capable UE, up to 3 concurrent gap patterns can be configured, which up to 2 gaps in one FR.\n- Introduced a definition for the proximity condition of colliding gap occasions. Upon colliding, UE drops the gap with a lower priority level which is configured by network. Data scheduling is resumed on dropped gap occasion.\n- Updated the corresponding UE requirements regarding gap interruption, measurement delay and L1 measurement impact.\n3)\tNetwork controlled small gap (NCSG)\n- Introduced a UE capability reporting based on RRCReconfigurationComplete and RRCResumeComplete messages (similar to NeedforGap). So that UE can report whether to support ‘no-gap-no-interruption’, ‘ncsg’ or ‘gap’ for each target band to be measured based on UE’s current CA configuration.\n- Introduced 24 NCSG patterns with visible interruption (VIL1 and VIL2, which are 1ms for FR1 and 0.75ms for FR2) before and after the measurement length (ML). UE is expected to continue DL reception or UL transmission with serving cells during ML. A new MG timing advance 0.75ms was introduced correspondingly.\nThe figure depicts a collection of 24 NCSG patterns, each representing a different network configuration. The patterns are arranged in a grid format, with each row representing a different network configuration and each column representing a different network element. The patterns are labeled with their respective network elements, such as the number of nodes, the number of links, and the number of switches. The figure provides a visual representation of the complexity and diversity of network configurations, highlighting the importance of network planning and design.\nFigure 1: 24 NCSG patterns with visible interruption\n- Introduced the UE behaviours for the cases when UE reports different capabilities on ‘no-gap-no-interruption’, ‘ncsg’ or ‘gap’ but with a different a network configuration (NCSG or legacy MG) which may not perfectly match UE’s reported capability.\n- Introduced a new synchronization indication between the target NR band to be measured and a reference serving cell of UE to reduce the OFDM symbols restricted from data scheduling, when UE is incapable for simultaneous Tx/Rx or independent beamforming (FR2-specific).\n- Introduced the corresponding UE requirements regarding gap interruption, scheduling restriction and measurement delay. Update the impact to L1 measurements.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-213350, \"Status report for WI: NR and MR-DC measurement gap enhancements\", Rapporteur (MediaTek Inc., Intel Corporation)\n",

New UE/BS demodulation requirements, and the corresponding new features and/or network assistant signalling for UE side enhancement are introduced in the WI.\nThe different enhancements are:\nPDSCH demodulation and CQI reporting requirements of MMSE-IRC receiver for suppressing inter-cell interference in FR1 with slot-based transmission and aligned SCS among cells scenario [2]. The interference covariance estimation for MMSE-IRC is based on the serving UE’s PDSCH DMRS and serving cell’s CSI-RS for PDSCH demodulation and CQI reporting respectively.\nPDSCH demodulation requirements of MMSE-IRC receiver for suppressing intra-cell inter-user interference in FR1 with slot-based transmission and aligned SCS among cells scenario [3]. DMRS based interference covariance estimation for MMSE-IRC is assumed for PDSCH demodulation.\nFor the two points above, one UE feature without capability signalling is introduced for MMSE-IRC receiver in scenarios with both inter-cell and intra-cell inter-user interference. The requirements defined in objective #1 and #2 are release independent from Rel-15, optional for Rel-15 and Rel-16 UE, and mandatory for Rel-17 UE.\n3.\tNR PDSCH demodulation requirements for neighbouring cell LTE CRS-IM in scenarios with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR [4].

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-222107.\nThe purpose of BCS4 (Bandwidth Combination Set 4) for inter-band and intra-band NR-CA was for band combinations to indicate that all the possible defined bandwidths for each band in that band combination are supported.\nIt was in the scope of the WI to ensure that all required analysis including MSD, MPR/A-MPR, etc. be performed for BCS4 for every existing band combination configuration (up to 3 bands). Also, in the scope of the WI was to study and define the most suitable UE capabilities signalling methods to enable BCS4 support.\nThe technical work on introduction on BCS4 started from RAN#90-e Dec. 2020 [1].\nIn the study for possible new signalling, it was decided that BCS4 was to be introduced without signalling so that these band combinations can be introduced in a release independent manner. A new BCS5 were added to be used with signalling. It was decided that BCS4 and BCS5 need to be requested and introduced simultaneously.\nFor BCS5 supportedMinBandwidthDL-r17 signalling were introduced that indicates minimum DL channel bandwidth supported for a given SCS that UE supports within a single CC (and in case of intra-frequency DAPS handover for the source and target cells), which is defined in Table 5.3.5-1 in TS 38.101-1 for FR1 and Table 5.3.5-1 in TS 38.101-2 for FR2. This parameter is only applicable to the Bandwidth Combination Set 5. This field does not restrict the bandwidths configured for a single CC (i.e. non-CA case).\nThe MSD tables were rewritten to a more generic template to support accommodation of BCS4/BCS5 band combination requests more easily. For these requests, the MSD template reduces RAN4 workload, simplifies TS 38.101-1 maintenance, ensures that MSD tables due to harmonic interference and cross-band isolation interference are consistent with the template adopted for MSD due to dual-uplink intermodulation interference, and by doing so, it reduces the size and complexity of these MSD tables.\nTo introduce BCS4/BCS5 into the 3GPP core part specifications, RAN2 and RAN4 agreed the necessary changes in the corresponding CRs below.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\nand the following CRs:\n38.306\tIntroduction of BCS4 and BCS5\tRP-220838\n38.331\tIntroduction of BCS4 and BCS5 \tRP-220838\n38.101-1\tCR for 38.101-1: Introduction of BCS4 and BCS5\tRP-211896\n38.101-1\tCR 38.101-1 to improve how to include BCS4 and BCS5\tRP-212827\n38.101-1\tBig CRs to TS 38.101-1 for NR_BCS4\tRP-220353\n38.101-1\tCR for 38.101-1 to introduce the missing requirements for BCS4\tRP-221680\n38.101-3\tCR for 38.101-3: Introduction of BCS4 and BCS5\tRP-211896\n38.101-3\tImproved wording for BCS4 and BCS5\tRP-212827\n38.101-3\tCR for 38.101-3 to clarify that BCS4 and BCS5 can't be reported together\tRP-221680\n38.307\tCR to TS 38.307 on Release independence of BCS4 and BCS5\tRP-220353\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in RP-222478.\nThis WID extends NR operation to 71GHz with the introduction of new unlicensed band n263. Relevant system parameters have been updated to consider the new sub-frequency range FR2-2, larger subcarrier spacings and channel bandwidths. This NR extension includes definition of n263 requirements for various form-factors (PC1, PC2, PC3), for both single carrier and CA operation.\nIntroduction\nNR Rel-15 defined two frequency ranges for operation: \tFR1 spanning from 410 MHz to 7.125 GHz and FR2 spanning from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz.\nRAN carried out a Rel-16 study on NR beyond 52.6 GHz (FS_NR_beyond_52GHz) with corresponding TR in 38.807. From this study, it became apparent the global availability of bands in the 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz range, most notably in the form of the original 60 GHz band (57-66 GHz) and extended 60 GHz band (57-71 GHz). Moreover, WRC19 recently identified the 66-71 GHz frequency range for IMT operation in certain regions.\nThe proximity of this frequency range (57-71 GHz) to FR2 and the imminent commercial opportunities for high data rate communications makes it compelling for 3GPP to address NR operation in this frequency regime.\nTo minimize the specification burden and maximize the leverage of FR2 based implementations, 3GPP has decided to extend FR2 operation up to 71 GHz with the adoption of one or more new numerologies (i.e., larger subcarrier spacings). Those new numerologies were identified in the study on waveform for NR>52.6 GHz in the first half of 2020.  NR-U defined procedures for operation in unlicensed spectrum were also leveraged towards operation in the unlicensed 60 GHz band.\nRAN1 completed a Rel-17 study on supporting NR from 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz. Subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 120 kHz with NCP was recommended to be supported. New subcarrier spacings 480 kHz, and 960 kHz along with 120 kHz were introduced for this frequency range. The spec impact for each subcarrier spacing choice was identified. Additional areas for further physical layer enhancements were also identified. For channel access, both LBT mode and no-LBT mode were recommended to be supported to cover a wide range of use cases and regulatory requirements. For LBT mode, the channel access mechanism defined in EN 302 567 was identified as the baseline and enhancements were chosen for further discussion.\nThe objectives of this work item are presented below.\nPhysical layer aspects including [RAN1]\nIn addition to 120 kHz SCS, specify new SCS, 480 kHz and 960 kHz, and define maximum bandwidth(s), for operation in this frequency range for data and control channels and reference signals, only NCP supported. Note: Except for timing line related aspects, a common design framework shall be adopted for 480 kHz to 960 kHz\nTimeline related aspects adapted to 480 kHz and 960 kHz, e.g., BWP and beam switching timing, HARQ timing, UE processing, preparation and computation timelines for PDSCH, PUSCH/SRS and CSI, respectively.\nSupport of up to 64 SSB beams for licensed and unlicensed operation in this frequency range.\nSupports 120 kHz SCS for SSB and 120 kHz SCS for initial access related signals/channels in an initial BWP. \tStudy and specify, if needed, additional SCS (480 kHz, 960 kHz) for SSB for cases other than initial access. \tNote: coverage enhancement for SSB is not pursued.\nIn addition to 120 kHz, support 480 kHz SSB for initial access with support of CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH configuration in the MIB with following constraints:\nLimited sync raster entry numbers. It is assumed that RAN4 supports a channelization design which results in the total number of synchronization raster entries considering both licensed and unlicensed operation in a 52.6 – 71 GHz band no larger than 665 (Note: the total number of synchronization raster entries in FR2 for band n259 + n257 is 599). If the assumption cannot be satisfied, it’s up to RAN4 to decide its applicability to bands in 52.6 – 71 GHz.\nonly 480 kHz CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH SCS supported for 480 kHz SSB SCS.\nPrioritize support SSB-CORESET#0 multiplexing pattern 1. Other patterns discussed on a best effort basis.\n960 kHz numerology for the SSB is not supported by the UE for initial access in Rel-17.\nNote: Strive to minimize specification impact by reusing tables for CORESET#0 and type0-PDCCH CSS set configuration defined for FR2 in Rel-15, as much as possible\nNote: 480 kHz is an optional SSB numerology for initial access for the UE. A UE supporting a band in 52.6-71 GHz must at least support 120 kHz SCS (for initial access and after initial access)\nNote: Dependency or lack thereof for a UE supporting 480 kHz and/or 960 kHz numerology for data and control to also support 480 kHz SSB numerology for initial access is to be tackled as part of UE capability discussion.\n\nSupport ANR and PCI confusion detection for 120, 480 and 960 kHz SCS based SSB, support CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH configuration in MIB of 120, 480 and 960 kHz SSB\nFFS: additional method(s) to enable support to obtain neighbour cell SIB1 contents related to CGI reporting\nOnly 1 CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH SCS supported for each SSB SCS, i.e., (120, 120), (480, 480) and (960, 960).\nPrioritize support SSB-CORESET#0 multiplexing pattern 1. Other patterns discussed on a best effort basis.\nNote: Strive to minimize specification impact by reusing tables for CORESET#0 and type0-PDCCH CSS set configuration defined for FR2 in Rel-15, as much as possible\nNote: From UE perspective, ANR detection for 480/960 kHz SCS based SSB is not supported if the UE does not support 480/960 SCS for SSB.\nNote: for ANR, when reading the MIB, the cell containing the SSB is known to the UE, as defined in 38.133 specification.\n\nSpecify timing associated with beam-based operation to new SCS (i.e., 480 kHz and/or 960 kHz), study, and specify if needed, potential enhancement for shared spectrum operation: Rel-15/16 and any Rel-17 beam management enhancements can be considered for 52.6-71 GHz. Whether particular features should be excluded for 52.6-71 GHz can be further discussed. \tNote: As per usual procedure, duplication of work between work items in Rel-17 should be avoided\nSupport enhancement for PUCCH format 0/1/4 to increase the number of RBs under PSD limitation in shared spectrum operation.\nSupport enhancements for multi-PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling and HARQ support with a single DCI. Note: coverage enhancement for multi-PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling is not pursued\nSupport enhancement to PDCCH monitoring, including blind detection/CCE budget, and multi-slot span monitoring, potential limitation to UE PDCCH configuration and capability related to PDCCH monitoring.\nSpecify support for PRACH sequence lengths (i.e., L=139, L=571 and L=1151) and study, if needed, specify support for RO configuration for non-consecutive RACH occasions (RO) in time domain for operation in shared spectrum\nEvaluate, and if needed, specify the PTRS enhancement for 120 kHz SCS, 480 kHz SCS and/or 960 kHz SCS, as well as DMRS enhancement for 480 kHz SCS and/or 960 kHz SCS.\nPhysical layer procedure(s) including [RAN1]\nChannel access mechanism assuming beam-based operation in order to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to unlicensed spectrum for frequencies between 52.6 GHz and 71 GHz.\nSpecify both LBT and No-LBT related procedures, and for No-LBT case no additional sensing mechanism is specified.\nStudy, and if needed specify, omni-directional LBT, directional LBT and receiver assistance in channel access\nStudy, and if needed specify, energy detection threshold enhancement\n\nRadio interface protocol architecture and procedures [RAN2]:\nFor operation in this frequency range: Introduce higher layer support of enhancements listed above that are agreed to be specified.  Note: RAN2 is to prioritize protocol support of RAN1 design and not on optimizations on items not discussed in RAN1.\nCore specifications for UE, gNB and RRM requirements [RAN4]:\nSpecify new band(s) for the frequency range from 52.6 GHz-71 GHz. The band(s) definition should include UL/DL operation and excludes ITS spectrum in this frequency range.\nSpecify gNB and UE RF core requirements for the band(s) in the above frequency range, including a limited set of example band combinations (see Note 1). For the case of FR2-2 DC or CA with an anchor in FR1 the following three example band combinations shall be considered: n79 + Nx ; n77 + Nx  and n41 + Nx , where Nx is the 57-71 GHz band for unlicensed operation and the [66-71] GHz for licensed operation. RAN4 to further discuss the need for single or multiple bands relevant for FR2-2 licensed/unlicensed operation.\nSpecify RRM/RLM/BM core requirements. Notes: The WI can be completed provided requirements for at least one band combination involving a new NR-U band is specified as long as it is in line with country-specific regulatory directives. UEs supporting a band in the range of 52.6 GHz-71 GHz are not required to support 480 kHz SCS and 960 kHz SCS. The maximum FFT size required to operate the system in 52.6 GHz-71 GHz frequency is 4096, and the maximum of RBs per carrier is 275 RBs. The system is designed to support both single-carrier and multi-carrier operation. FR2 is extended to cover 24.25 GHz to 71 GHz with FR2-1 for 24.25-52.6 GHz and FR2-2 for 52.6-71 GHz.\nThe related UE capabilities and their applicability to the frequency range 52.6 to 71 GHz will have to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis\nThe application of any of the UE feature introduced for 52.6-71 GHz to existing FR1/FR2 should be discussed case by case.\nTSG RAN specifications shall make it very clear (to readers) that frequency bands in the 52.6-71 GHz range are only Release-independent from Rel-17 onwards, to ensure that there is clear industry understanding about which FR2 features are applicable for operation in 52.6-71 GHz range. Notes: Whenever the FR2 is referred, both FR2-1 and FR2-2 frequency sub-ranges shall be considered in this release, unless otherwise stated. The designations FR2-1 and FR2-2 should only be used when needed.\nDescription\nSimilar to regular NR and NR-U operations below 52.6 GHz, NR/NR-U operation in the 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz can be in stand-alone or aggregated via CA or DC with an anchor carrier.\nPhysical Layer enhancements\nIn addition to 120 kHz SCS already supported in FR2-1, new SCSs of 480 kHz and 960 kHz are introduced, that can support wider bandwidth up to 2 GHz. For operation in FR2-2, SCSs 480 kHz and 960 kHz are optionally supported by UE, while SCS 120 kHz is mandatory.\nInitial access aspects\nSSB of SCS 120 kHz, 480 kHz and 960 kHz are supported in FR2-2, and SCS 120 kHz and 480 kHz SSBs can support initial access. Up to 64 SSB candidate positions are allowed for FR2-2 and Discovery Burst Transmission Window (DBTW) is supported with ssb-PositionQCL being 32 or 64.\nCORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH SCS is always the same as SSB SCS. SSB-CORESET#0 multiplexing pattern 1 and pattern 3 are supported for FR2-2.\nTime locations for SCS 120 kHz SSB in FR2-1 are reused for FR2-2. Time locations for SCS 480 kHz and SCS 960 kHz SSBs are newly defined.\nFor PRACH, length 139 sequence is supported for all SCS, length 571 sequence is supported for SCSs 120 kHz and 480 kHz, and length 1151 sequence is supported for SCS 120 kHz.\nPDCCH monitoring enhancements\nFor SCS 480 kHz and 960 kHz, since slots are short, and UE power consumption to monitor PDCCH in each slot will be high, multi-slot PDCCH monitoring capability is introduced where UE monitors PDCCH in Y slots out of every X slots.\nEnhancements for PUCCH formats 0/1/4\nTo support higher transmit power under PSD limitation for PUCCH formats 0/1/4, enhanced PUCCH formats 0/1/4 are supported such that the number of RBs can be RRC configured from 1 to 16. For PUCCH format 0/1, type-1 long sequence occupying all REs over the configured number of RBs is used. For PUCCH format 4, OCC 2 or 4 is supported, and the number of RBs is restricted to in the form of  N_RB=2^(α_2 )∙3^(α_3 )∙5^(α_5 ).\nBeam managements for new SCSs\nBeam switching related timing values for SCS 480 kHz and 960 kHz are defined.\nPDSCH/PUSCH enhancements\nMulti-PDSCH scheduling with a single DCI and multi-PUSCH scheduling with a single DCI are supported, where the time domain allocations of the multiple PDSCH or multiple PUSCH can be discontinuous. Time domain HARQ-ACK bundling is supported for both Type 1 HARQ codebook and Type 2 HARQ codebook.\nProcessing timelines for 480 kHz and 960 kHz SCS are defined, such as HARQ timeline, UE processing timeline, etc. DMRS enhancements for 480 kHz and 960 kHz are introduced that allows the indication to the UE that FD OCC is disabled for rank 1 transmission. The maximum number of HARQ processes supported for FR2-2 are increased to 32 in both DL and UL.\nChannel access mechanism\nIn frequency range 2-2, Rel-17 NR supports licensed spectrum operation (Draft CRs for FR2-2 licensed band n264 were endorsed, but won’t be agreed until the regulation is available in at least one country or region), shared spectrum operation with LBT and shared spectrum operation without LBT. gNB will indicate UE if LBT is used for channel access by higher layer signalling.\nWhen LBT mode is enabled, a maximum channel occupancy time (COT) of 5ms is supported. COT sharing from gNB to UE and UE to gNB are supported, similar to Release 16 NR-U.\nFor channel access for LBT mode, 3 types of channel access are defined\nType 1 channel access can be performed by gNB or UE to initiate a channel occupancy. Type 1 channel access involves sensing the channel multiple times with a counter with maximum contention window size 3.\nType 2 channel access requires a single sensing slot channel sensing and can be used to share a COT.\nType 3 channel access does not require channel sensing and can be used to share a COT, or to initiate Discovery RS transmission when regulation allows.\nThe directional LBT is defined for gNB and UE with or without beam correspondence. The bandwidth on which LBT is performed by gNB/UE should at least include active DL/UL BWP bandwidth.\nMAC Enhancements\nRel-16 NR-U has introduced several enhancements to MAC procedures to alleviate the impact of LBT mechanism which can cause delays or dropped transmissions. The following were also adopted for FR2-2: \tConsistent LBT failure detection and recovery; Configured Grant (CG) changes; Changes to RACH procedures (e.g., extended RAR window duration) and \tHARQ handling for uplink multi-TTI transmissions.\n\nConsistent LBT failure detection and recovery is applicable to FR2-2 with no changes, assuming LBT is configured on the considered serving cell.\nThe changes to configured grant transmission in Rel-16 NR-U were mainly due to autonomous retransmission on CG resources, autonomous HARQ process ID. and RV selection. A new CG retransmission timer was introduced where the UE is allowed to retransmit a packet on a CG after this timer expires without any ACK from the gNB for the earlier transmission. The only change for FR2-2 is that this timer is now optional and configured by RRC. Thus, when the timer is configured, the UE follows Rel-16 NR-U procedures while it uses the licensed spectrum procedures otherwise.\nFor FR2-2, extended values were introduced for several DRX parameters due to the shorter symbol duration for SCS of 480 and 960 kHz.\nUpper Layer Enhancements\nThe support of RSSI and Channel Occupancy (CO) measurements was also carried over to FR2-2. For FR2-2, the configuration can also include bandwidth serving cell and TCI information for the RSSI measurement.\nThe enhancements to Idle/Inactive mode mobility (due to the possible existence of multiple independent operators on the same carrier) and paging (multiple paging monitoring occasions per PO) for NR-U are also re-used in FR2-2.\nWe note that Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC) which is used for QoS in NR-U as well as LTE LAA are not applicable to FR2-2.\nSince LBT is optional for FR2-2, a new parameter is broadcast in SIB1 to indicate the LBT mode. The same information for neighbor cells can be included in measurement object for RRM and SIB3/SIB4 for Idle/Inactive mobility (RAN2 is still discussing this).\nMany RRC parameters with values dependent on symbol duration or bandwidth were enhanced to support the new SCS and bandwidths.\nThe legacy UE capabilities which had FR1/FR2 differentiation in Rel-15/16 required, in some cases, further differentiation between legacy FR2 and FR2-2. These capabilities also included some upper layer capabilities such as IMS voice, Rel-16 Power Saving, and Rel-16 DCCA. For the new UE capabilities which needed FR2-2 differentiation, per-band signaling was adopted with consistent signaling across the FR2 bands.\nNew signaling and procedures were also introduced in LTE specifications to support handover from E-UTRAN to NR FR2-2.\nSystem parameters\nSpectrum and operating band\nFR2 has been divided into two sub-frequency ranges: FR2-1 which covers the original range of 24.25-52.6 GHz, and FR2-2 which extends NR operation from 52.6 to 71 GHz. Given the prevalence of unlicensed spectrum in this frequency range, a new NR band for unlicensed operation was introduced in this work item, band n263. This band extends from 57 to 71GHz, ensuring the unlicensed spectrum of all regions is supported.\n\nChannel arrangement\nUE channel bandwidth for n263: Compared to FR2-1, FR2-2 supports larger channel bandwidths including 800, 1600 and 2000MHz. In this release, only 400MHz channel bandwidth support is mandatory for band n263. An optional capability enables the UE to indicate its supported channel bandwidths for 480 and 960kHz SCS [3].\nChannel spacing for band n263:\n\n\nChannel raster: Band n263 is defined to support 138 entries of non-overlapping 100MHz CBW with 100.8MHz channel spacing, 34 entries of non-overlapping 400MHz CBW with 403.2MHz channel spacing, and 30 to 34 entries of overlapping 800, 1600, and 2000MHz CBW that are spaced part by 403.2MHz. Additionally, band n263 supports one 120kHz SCS-based synchronization raster entry for each 100MHz CBW, and one 480kHz SCS-based synchronization raster entry for 400MHz CBW. Initial access using 960kHz SCS is not supported.\nCore requirements\nExtending requirement definition to 71GHz\nMany core requirements, either their definition or approach used to define them in FR2-1, were reused in FR2-2. For example, given the highly integrated nature of designs in this frequency range, characteristics continue to be specified over-the-air in FR2-2.\nAs with FR2-1, minimum performance requirements for FR2-2 were defined per-band and per-UE power class. Tx and Rx requirements were defined for power class 1 (FWA UE), power class 2 (vehicular UE), and power class 3 (handheld UE) operation in band n263. These power classes use the same reference form-factor used in FR2-1, but the number of antenna elements used to derive the requirements was increased to help alleviate the impact of higher losses and more complex integration of this frequency range.\nCarrier aggregation in FR2-2\nIn addition to single carrier requirements, FR2-2 requirements to support intra-band contiguous CA operation have also been defined. In this release, contiguous DL CA configurations within FR2-2 may only contain multiples of the same channel bandwidth. The supported CA band combinations include FR2-2 with an FR1 anchor; combinations for n48 + n263 were introduced in RAN4 #104e [4].\nBeam correspondence\nFor band n263, support of beam correspondence without UL beam sweeping is defined for power class 3.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n\n[1]\tR4-2211189, “Rel-17 RAN4 UE feature list for NR,” CMCC, RAN4 #103e, May 2022\n[2]\tR4-2215256, Big CR of TS38.101-3 to add new NR_CADC 2BDL_xBUL combinations containing FR1 + FR2-2, Intel Corporation\n",

The NG-RAN node can configure the UE to use UDC or not. If UDC is configured for a DRB, ROHC or EHC is not used for that DRB. One byte UDC header is introduced to indicate whether the PDCP SDU is compressed by UDC or not, whether the compression buffer is reset or not, and 4 validation bits of checksum are used to indicate whether the compression and decompression buffers are synchronous. For each DRB, the maximum compression buffer is 8192 bytes. If there are errors or failures due to buffer mismatching, the NG-RAN node can send a PDCP control PDU for error notification to the UE, the UE may reset the compression buffer when such notification has been received.\nSimilar as for LTE UDC, to improve compression efficiency of the first packets, two types of pre-defined dictionary can be used for UDC. One is standard dictionary for SIP and SDP signalling as defined in RFC 3485, and another is operator defined dictionary. The NG-RAN node configures whether or which dictionary is used for a UDC DRB.\nNR UDC can be applied to NR-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC scenarios. Also, NR UDC can be applied to split bearer type. For NR-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC scenarios, MN can send an indication to SN regarding the maximum number of UDC DRBs allowed to SN terminated bearer. Furthermore, NR UDC can also be applied to CU CP and UP splitting scenario, where corresponding configuration parameters can be carried via E1 interface.\nNR UDC continuity is also supported, which is similar as the ROHC continuity mechanism.\nUDC related capabilities are also defined for UEs. There are four capabilities defined: supporting basic UDC function, supporting standard dictionary, supporting operator defined dictionary, and supporting UDC continuity. If the UE supports operator defined dictionary, it shall report the version of the dictionary and the associated PLMN ID to assist the NG-RAN node to identify the dictionary stored by the UE. The NG-RAN node configures UDC according to the signalled UE capabilities.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220141\tStatus Report for WI: NR Uplink Data Compression (UDC)\tCATT\n",

The measurements are supported for Streaming services, MTSI services, and VR services. Both signalling based and management based QoE measurement collection are supported. In this Release, basic application layer measurement collection mechanism is supported, and RAN visible QoE measurement mechanism and metrics are supported.\nIn the WI, the feature of QoE Measurement Collection function is activated in the NG-RAN either by direct configuration from the OAM system (management-based activation), or by signalling from the OAM via the Core Network (signalling-based activation), using UE-associated signalling. One or more QoE measurement collection jobs can be activated at a UE per service type. The application layer measurement configuration and measurement reporting is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. The QoE Measurement Collection deactivation permanently stops all or some of QoE measurement collection jobs towards a UE, resulting in the release of the corresponding QoE measurement configuration(s) in the UE. When a service is provided within a configured slice, the QoE Measurement Collection for this service type could also be configured together with the corresponding slice scope, so that the user experience of this service could also be evaluated on a per-slice basis.\nThe QoE Measurement Collection pause/resume procedure is used to pause/resume the reporting for all QoE reports or to pause/resume QoE reporting per QoE configuration in a UE for RAN overload situation. The gNB can send a downlink RRC message to temporarily stop the application layer measurement reports associated to one or multiple QoE configurations from UE to the network.\nThe QoE Measurement Collection continuity for intra-system intra-RAT mobility is supported in R17, with the area scope parameters configured by the OAM. The NG-RAN node is responsible for keeping track and identify whether the UE is inside or outside the area scope. A UE should continue an ongoing measurement even if it leaves the area scope, unless the NG-RAN node indicates to the UE to release the QoE configuration.\nRAN visible QoE measurements are configured by the NG-RAN node, where a subset of QoE metrics is reported from the UE as an explicit IE to NG-RAN node. RAN visible QoE measurements (e.g., RAN visible QoE metrics, RAN visible QoE values) could be utilized by the NG-RAN node for network optimization. RAN visible QoE measurements are supported for the DASH streaming and VR service.\nRadio-related measurements may be collected via immediate MDT for the supported services. The MCE/TCE performs the correlation of the immediate MDT results and the QoE measurement results collected at the same UE.\nThe following alignments are supported in this Release:\n- Alignment between a signalling-based QoE measurement and a signalling-based MDT measurement.\n- Alignment between a management-based QoE measurement and a management-based MDT measurement.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220554, Status report of SR for WI on NR QoE, China Unicom\n",

In Release 16, E1 interface was limited to support interconnecting a gNB-CU-CP (control plane part of the gNB central unit) and a gNB-CU-UP (user plane part of the gNB central unit) in NG-RAN.\nIn the WI, a split of eNB into an eNB-CP and an eNB-UP is defined for E-UTRAN, and a split of ng-eNB-CU into an ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP is defined for NG-RAN. The eNB-CP hosts the RRC/ RLC/MAC/PHY and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol, and the eNB-UP hosts the user plane part of the PDCP protocol [3]. The split of ng-eNB-CU into an ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP are defined for NG-RAN [4]. The ng-eNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol of the ng-eNB-CU, and the ng-eNB-CU-UP hosts hosting the user plane part of the PDCP protocol and the SDAP protocol of the ng-eNB-CU. The E1 interface is used between an eNB-CP and an eNB-UP as shown in Figure 1, or between an ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP as shown in Figure 2. The ng-eNB-CU-CP is connected with the ng-eNB-DU via the W1-C interface, while the ng-eNB-CU-UP is connected with the ng-eNB-DU through the W1-U interface.\nThe architectures in Figure 1 and 2 enable the following deployment scenarios.\n•\tAn eNB may consist of an eNB-CP and multiple eNB-UPs.\n•\tThe eNB-UP is connected to the eNB-CP, while one eNB-UP is connected to only one eNB-CP.\n•\tThe eNB-CP and the eNB-UP terminates the UP interface used to convey E-UTRA or NR PDCP PDUs. NR user plane protocol, as defined in TS 38.425 [5], is used for this interface.\n•\tAn ng-eNB may consist of an ng-eNB-CU-CP, one or more multiple ng-eNB-CU-UP(s) and one or more multiple ng-eNB-DU(s).\n•\tOne ng-eNB-DU is connected to only one ng-eNB-CU-CP, while one ng-eNB-CU-UP is connected to only one ng-eNB-CU-CP.\n•\tOne ng-eNB-DU can be connected to multiple ng-eNB-CU-UPs under the control of the same ng-eNB-CU-CP;\n•\tOne ng-eNB-CU-UP can be connected to multiple ng-eNB-DUs under the control of the same ng-eNB-CU-CP;\n•\tAn ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP is connected via the E1 interface.\n•\tAn ng-eNB-DU is connected to an ng-eNB-CU-CP via the W1-C interface, and to an ng-eNB-CU-UP via the W1-U interface.\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture of an eNB-CP and eNB-UP, illustrating their separation and the use of separate control planes. The eNB-CP is responsible for managing the network's traffic and resources, while the eNB-UP handles the network's user equipment (UE) traffic. The figure shows the separation of these two components through the use of separate control planes, which allows for efficient management and control of the network's operations.\nFigure 1: Overall architecture for separation of eNB-CP and eNB-UP\nThe figure depicts the overall architecture for the separation of the Network Gateway (NG-eNB-CU-CP) and the Network Gateway (NG-eNB-CU-UP) in a 5G network. The architecture includes a base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The figure highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and the use of SDN principles for network management.\nFigure 2: Overall architecture for separation of ng-eNB-CU-CP and ng-eNB-CU-UP\nThe general aspects and principles for E1 interface is specified in TS 37.480 [6], and layer 1 of E1 is specified in TS 37.481 [7].The E1 signalling transport supporting for ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP, eNB-CP/eNB-UP, which is based on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described in TS 37.482 [8]. The E1 application protocol (E1AP) supporting for ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP, eNB-CP/eNB-UP is specified in TS 37.483 [9], including the relevant descriptions of E1 interface management procedures and E1AP elements, which allow to setup the E1 interface, exchange the relevant configuration data and date usage report in MR-DC between ng-eNB-CU-CP and ng-eNB-CU-UP, or between eNB-CP and eNB-UP.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-22xxxx, \"Status report of Enhanced eNB(s) architecture evolution for E-UTRAN and NG-RAN\", China Unicom\n[2]\tR3-214487\tCR to 36.401: Baseline CR for introducing Rel-17 Enhanced eNB Architecture Evolution\tEricsson, Huawei, Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell\n[3]\tR3-214488\tFurther discussions on logical entities and corresponding definitions\tHuawei, Ericsson\n[4]\tTS 38.425 v16.3.0 NG-RAN; NR user plane protocol\n[5]\tTS 37.480 v1.1.0 E1 general aspects and principles\n[6]\tTS 37.481 v1.0.0 E1 layer 1\n",

                            "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSiliconin RP-220410.\nThis WI introduces the following enhancements:\n-\tfor Carrier Aggregation, faster SCell activation\n-\tfor EN-DC and for NR DC: a mechanism to deactivate and activate the NR Secondary Cell Group\n-\tsupport of inter-SN Conditional PSCell Change and of Conditional PSCell Addition\nThe enhancement to SCell activation allows faster usage of SCells. For traffic consisting primarily in short bursts, this allows deactivating SCells while there is not traffic, and reduce the UE power consumption, and having the additional carrier more quickly available when the next traffic burst appears.\nThe new SCG deactivation/activation mechanism allows keeping the NR SCG while saving UE power when the data traffic is lower and to activate the SCG again when needed due to increased traffic. This is also useful for bursty or variable data traffic.\nConditional PSCell Change was introduced in Rel-16 but limited to intra-SN PSCell change. This WI is adding the support inter-SN Conditional PSCell Change, thus extending the benefits to wider areas. In addition, Conditional PSCell Addition is supported, so that a PSCell can be added as soon as allowed by radio conditions.\nEfficient SCell activation\nTo enable fast SCell activation when Carrier Aggregation is configured, for each configured SCell, the network can configure a number of aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking for fast SCell activation. A new MAC Control Element (CE) that indicates SCell activation can indicate the aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking that is activated by the network to assist the UE for activation of the SCell. This aperiodic CSI-RS can be used to assist Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and time/frequency synchronization.\nSCG deactivation/activation\nSCG deactivation/activation applies to an NR SCG, in EN-DC and in NR-DC.\nUE behaviour while the SCG is deactivated\nWhen the SCG is deactivated, UE activities on the SCG are reduced:\n-\tthe UE does not transmit or receive any data via the SCG;\n-\tthe UE does not perform/report any physical layer measurements;\n-\tall SCG SCells are deactivated.\nHowever, other activities remain:\n-\tif configured to do so, the UE performs radio link monitoring and beam failure detection on the PSCell\n-\tthe UE performs measurements for mobility, including measurements for SCG mobility configured by the SN;\n-\tthe UE can exchange RRC signalling with the SN via the MCG as in Rel-15 (e.g. to report SCG radio link/beam failure, mobility measurement results);\n-\tin case of PSCell change, the UE does not perform random access towards the new PSCell if the SCG is to remain deactivated.\nData transmission while the SCG is deactivated\nWhen the SCG is deactivated:\n-\tdata can be transmitted or received via MCG bearers or via the MCG leg of split bearers;\n-\tSCG bearers can remain configured;\n-\tif there are uplink data to transmit on an SCG bearer, the UE indicates it to the network via RRC signalling.\nSCG activation/deactivation\nThe network activates or deactivates the SCG by sending an RRC reconfiguration message to the UE.\nFor SCG activation, if the PSCell hasn't changed since the SCG deactivation, the timing advance is still valid and beam/radio link failure was not detected, it is possible to perform SCG activation without random access, i.e. the UE starts monitoring PDCCH and can receive downlink assignments and uplink grants. Otherwise, random access is necessary.\nOn the network side, SCG activation and SCG deactivation is coordinated between the MN and the SN using the existing procedure for SN addition and SN modification. Both the MN and the SN can request SCG activation or SCG deactivation and the other node can accept or reject the request.\nConditional PSCell Addition/Change\nFrom the UE perspective, inter-SN conditional PSCell change is very similar to intra-SN conditional PSCell change, with a few main differences:\n-\tthe conditional reconfiguration is received from the MCG;\n-\tthe conditional reconfiguration can include a reconfiguration of both MCG and SCG;\n-\tthe associated execution condition may refer to a conditional measurement configured by the MN (if initiated by the MN) or to a conditional measurement configured by the SN;\n-\tat CPC execution, the UE indicates to the MN which conditional reconfiguration was applied.\nOn the network side, there are a number of new procedures.\nFor instance, CPA and inter-SN CPC preparation requires exchanges between the MN, the SN and candidate target SN(s):\n-\tthe initiating node (MN or SN) indicates a list of candidate target PSCells and associated execution conditions;\n-\tthe MN provides this information to candidate target SN(s);\n-\tcandidate target SN(s) provide conditional reconfigurations for all or a subset of the candidate target PSCells;\n-\tthe MN transmits the conditional configurations to the UE, possibly with a MCG and SCG reconfiguration, as for any reconfiguration.\nAfter CPA or CPC is prepared:\n-\tthe initiating node can request candidate target SNs to update their conditional reconfigurations according to a new UE configuration, or to release them;\n-\tcandidate target SN can initiate a modification or release already configured conditional reconfigurations.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tRP-220409, Status report for WI: Multi-Radio Dual-Connectivity enhancements, Huawei, HiSilicon;\n",

Broadcast UHF spectrum, however, is channelized typically in channels of 6/7/8MHz (depending on the region). The objective of this work item [1] is to introduce support of PMCH bandwidths of 6/7/8MHz in MBMS-dedicated cells to enable deployment of 5G terrestrial broadcast in broadcast UHF spectrum.\nThe detailed operation to enable the above feature is as follows:\n•\tThe eNB indicates in MIB a system bandwidth of 5MHz (25PRBs) or 3MHz (15PRBs).\n•\tIn system information, the eNB indicates, per MBSFN area, whether the PMCH in that MBSFN area uses a bandwidth larger than the system bandwidth. The possible values for this bandwidth are 6MHz (30PRBs), 7MHz (35PRBs) and 8MHz (40PRBs).\n•\tThe PMCH and MBSFN-RS are received with the indicated bandwidth.\nA figure depicting the operation is shown below:\nThe figure depicts a high-level overview of the operation of a 6/7/8MHz PMCH (Phase-Locked Loop) system, illustrating the various components and their interactions.

In particular, new TV sets and 5G mobile devices entering the market since 2020 support up to 8K video decoding as well as 8K display capabilities.\n8K is recently trialled and introduced in several services. In addition, other ecosystem support is happening, such as 8K encoders are announced, 8K TV sets are shipped and content is produced in 8K. Furthermore, it is evident that distribution of 8K TV content is feasible with 5G. In order to provide full interoperability for 8K TV services in the context of 5G, this work item specifies an HEVC-based 8K TV operation point in TS 26.116 as well as the corresponding media decoding capabilities for 5GMS in TS 26.511 in order to enable support for up to 8K video.\nMore specifically, this work item completed the following work:\nDefined new 8K TV operation point(s) for TV Video profiles with conforming bitstream requirement based on H.265/HEVC Main-10 Profile Main Tier Profile in TS 26.116 [1]\nDefined the relevant ISO BMFF encapsulation, CMAF media profile and DASH signalling for the new 8K TV operation point in TS 26.116 [1].\nIncluded the newly defined decoding capabilities and associated profiles and operation points into 5G Media Streaming for TV Services in TS 26.511 [2].\nDocumented typical traffic characteristics of 8K TV video services in TR 26.925 [3].\nThe work was carried out in close collaboration with MPEG CMAF and DVB to align the media profiles.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 26.116, \"Virtual Reality (VR) profiles for streaming applications\"\n[2]\tTS 26.511, \"5G Media Streaming (5GMS); Profiles, codecs and formats.\"\n[3]\tTR 26.925, \"Typical traffic characteristics of media services on 3GPP networks\"\n",

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220637.\nThe Technical Report provides a full characterization framework for video codecs in the context of 5G services. This framework permits the evaluation of the performance of existing 3GPP codecs, and also permits the identification of potential benefits of new codecs.\nNote: \tAlthough Studies are usually not reported in this document, it was estimated by the rapporteur that this study deserves a summary.\nThe framework fulfils the following aspects:\nA comprehensive set of scenarios relevant to 3GPP services is described in clause 6. For each scenario the anchors for existing 3GPP codecs (H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC), the version of the reference software for the anchors, and their associated configurations are defined.\nA set of reference sequences is identified per scenario and each sequence is described in more details in Annex C.\nFor each scenario, one or more performance metrics are defined. Each metric is described in more details in clause 5.5.\nThe overall characterization framework process is defined in clause 5 and in Annex B, D, E, F, and G.\nNew codecs, namely H.266/VVC, MPEG-5 EVC and AOMedia AV1 are identified in clause 8. For each scenario, a version of their respective reference software is identified and configurations as close as possible to the anchor configurations are defined.\nFor all codecs, metrics are computed and documented as part of the Technical Report. The report only documents objective metrics.\nAccording to Figure 1, all of those metrics are used in order to characterize test codecs against anchor codecs using the Bjöntegard-Delta (BD)-Rate gain expressing the bitrate savings in percentage of the new codec against the existing one.\nThe TR is supported by a huge set of data that is available here: https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/ including raw video sequences, anchor and test bitstreams, results, png plots and annotation, etc as well as a fully functional set of scripts that allow to replicate the setup and results.\nThe figure depicts a characterization framework for a 5G network, illustrating the various components and their interactions. It highlights the importance of signal propagation, including NLOS and multi-path scenarios, and the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference. The framework also showcases the layered design of the network, emphasizing the importance of redundancy and failover reliability.\nFigure 1: Characterization Framework\nThis is the first time that 3GPP has done such an extensive baseline work for video codec evaluation and characterization. The study item was backed and supported by 23 3GPP members. While the framework is comprehensive, it was also identified that it clearly has some limitations; for example, encoder configurations for each scenario may have not been stringent enough in their definition, leading to results that may not be fully comparable. Furthermore, the encoders used for the evaluation of the various codecs have different maturity and features. Results in this document should always be considered with a clear understanding of the characterization conditions and these results were derived. The framework does not include subjective evaluation; it is purely based on objective metrics.\nOne important outcome of the work documented in this Technical Report is the characterization and evaluation of H.265/HEVC against relevant scenarios and its characterization against H.264/AVC. Also, a first understanding of H.265/HEVC performances versus new codecs was developed. From the scenarios and results in this Technical Report it is observed that:\n-\tH.265/HEVC does not show any functional deficiencies or gaps, nor does it lack any relevant features.\n-\tIn terms of compression efficiency, H.265/HEVC, evaluated based on the HM, performs sufficiently well for all the scenarios in this technical report.\nProviding consistent HEVC-based interoperability in 3GPP services, for traditional and new scenarios, is definitely beneficial. It is recommended that 3GPP consider upgrading specifications to support profiles, levels, and possibly features available in HEVC. Features may include better support for screen content and computer-generated content, XR/AR type of services, as well as low and very low latency services.\nThe framework and the initial results for new codecs demonstrate coding performance improvements over H.265/HEVC for some codecs of up to 50%. However, the initial results are not considered mature enough to support concrete recommendations on adding new codecs. The potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications requires diligent preparation, including the identification of needs and requirements for different scenarios, as well as a complete characterization against existing codecs. The information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications. However, no immediate need has been identified to initiate such follow-up work.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1] \tTdoc SP-200052, Feasibility Study on \"5G Video Codec Characteristics\"\n[2]\tTR 26.955, \"5G Video codec characteristics\"\n",

Recently, UEs have come to market featuring other means of radiating sound to the user, e.g., through vibrating displays, necessitating an update of 3GPP test specifications.\nThe HaNTE work item developed new test methods and assessed those methods through round-robin testing and listening experiments.

                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220635\nThis work item [1] relates to the support of generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure, and the 5G Media Streaming instantiation of the generic functionality. It is related to two other 3GPP Rel-17 work items:\n-\t SA2 work item \"eNA_Ph2\" with regards to UE data collection and event exposure by an AF to event consumers such as the NWDAF, and\n-\t CT3 work item \"EVEX\" with regards to extending relevant stage 3 specifications in support of event exposure and NEF mediation of interactions pertaining to UE data collection, reporting and event exposure functionality specific to 5G Media Streaming.\nSA4 specifications on generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure\nThe SA4 specifications on UE data collection, reporting and event exposure describe and define the mechanisms whereby different types of data collection clients, such as a UE, an application server in the network, or a server entity of an Application Service Provider, to collect and report a variety of application-level UE information, in accordance with their respective configurations, to a Data Collection AF (Application Function). The Data Collection AF can subsequently process its collected UE data to be offered, as Event Exposure services, to external entities for device, network and service performance monitoring and data analytics purposes.\nThe system architecture, reference points, and high-level procedures regarding generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure are described in the stage 2 specification TS 26.531 [2]. The stage 3 specification TS 26.532 [3] defines the detailed procedures and associated APIs for the generic UE data collection and reporting functionality.\nFigure 1 depicts the generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure architecture.\nThe figure depicts a reference architecture for generic UE data collection, reporting, and event exposure. It includes a data collection subsystem, reporting subsystem, and event exposure subsystem, each with its own set of components and interfaces. The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration with other subsystems and components.\nFigure 1 – Reference architecture for generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure\nThe functional entities and reference points pertaining to EVEX in figure 1 are described below:\n-\tData collection clients including the Direct Data Collection Client in the UE, Indirect Data Collection Client of the Application Service Provider, and the AS (Application Server, which contains and delivers user plane data to end-user devices). These entities obtain their UE data collection and reporting configuration from, and reports collected UE data to, the Data Collection Client, at the R2, R3 and R4 reference points, respectively.\n-\tData Collection AF – This entity is provisioned with its UE data collection, reporting and event exposure configuration by the Provisioning AF of the Application Service Provider at the R1 reference point. It utilizes that information to provide data collection and reporting configuration(s) to relevant data collection clients. Subsequently, the Data Collection AF processes UE data reports received from the data collection client(s) for event exposure services to eligible consumer entities (e.g., the NWDAF and Event Consumer AF of the Application Service Provider, at reference points R5 and R6, respectively) according to its event exposure restriction configuration.\n-\tProvisioning AF – This entity provisions the Data Collection AF with UE data collection, reporting and event exposure information via reference point R1. A portion of that configuration information is intended to be forwarded by the Data Collection AF to data collection clients.\n-\tUE Application – This optional entity in the UE, if instantiated, is responsible for interacting with the Direct Data Collection Client, via reference point R7, to obtain a UE data collection and reporting configuration, and subsequently send collected UE data reports to the Direct Data Collection Client to be in turn reported to the Data Collection AF.\n-\tNEF – This entity is optionally present to mediate the configuration, reporting and event exposure related interactions between associated pairs of the above-described entities when those reside in separate trust domains.\nSA4 specifications on 5G Media Streaming specific data collection, reporting and event exposure\nInstantiation of the generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure architecture for 5G Media Streaming is specified in TS 26.501 [4], as shown in figure 2.\nFigure 2 illustrates the instantiation of generic data collection, reporting, and event exposure for 5G Media Streaming. The figure depicts a simplified representation of a 5G network, with various components such as base stations (BSs), mobile edge computing (MEC), and network slicing. The figure highlights the importance of data collection, reporting, and event exposure in 5G networks, as they are crucial for ensuring the efficient and reliable delivery of multimedia services.\nFigure 2 – Instantiation of generic data collection, reporting and event exposure for 5G Media Streaming\nAs shown in figure 2, the Data Collection AF is instantiated as a subfunction of the 5GMS Media Streaming Application Function (5GMS AF). The Direct Data Collection Client for 5GMS is instantiated as a subfunction of the 5GMS Client’s Media Session Handler. The AS in figure 1 is instantiated as the 5GMS AS and could either reside within the 5G System or is hosted externally in the Application Service Provider domain.\nIt should be noted that in the 5G Media Streaming instantiation of the generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure architecture, the 5GMS-specific reference points M1 and M5, and whose APIs are specified in TS 26.512 [5], are employed instead of R1 and R2, to support the provisioning of the Data Collection AF, and the configuration and reporting related interactions between the Data Collection AF and data collection clients. In particular, the M1 API in [5] has been extended to support event exposure restriction configuration in the form of Data Access Profiles to enable the Application Service Provider to control the granularity of access by subscriber entities to UE data related event information by the dimensions of user, time, and location.\nCT3 specifications on 5G Media Streaming specific data collection, reporting and event exposure\nThree CT3 specifications are extended in Rel-17 in support of EVEX:\n-\tTS 29.517 [6], which defines the stage 3 protocol, message flows and Service Based Interface (SBI) of the Application Function Exposure (Naf_EventExposure) Services offered by the AF to NF service consumers (e.g. NWDAF, NEF). The Application Function Exposure Service are usually defined in SA2 specifications TS 23.502 [9] and TS 23.288 [10]), as indicated in clause 4 of TS 29.517. However, for producing stage 3 protocol and API specification in TS 29.517 for 5G Media Streaming specific event exposure services, SA2 has directed CT3 to reference stage 2 and stage 3 specifications in TS 26.501 [4] and TS 26.512 [5] from SA4. The 5G Media Streaming related Naf_EventExposure service comprise the following components: QoE metrics; Consumption reports; Network Assistance invocations; Dynamic charging and policy invocations; and Media streaming access activity.\n-\tTS 29.522 [7], which defines the NEF Northbound interfaces between the NEF and AF and the associated RESTful/RPC APIs that allow an external AF to access the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network entities via secure exposure by the NEF. Like the case of TS 29.517 [6], in accordance with SA2 directive, the SA4 EVEX specifications in TS 26.531 [2] and TS 26.532 [3] are referenced in the TS 29.522 specification of the Nnef_DataReportingProvisioning and Nnef_DataReporting service APIs, which are functionally equivalent to the Ndcaf_DataReportingProvisioning and Ndcaf_DataReporting services and associated APIs specifications in [2] and [3].\n-\tTS 29.591 [8], which provides the stage 3 protocol definitions and message flows and specifies the API for each service offered by the NEF. It is extended with the various 5G Media Streaming specific event types as defined in TS 26.501 [4] and TS 26.512 [5].\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1] \tTdoc SP-201374, \"New WID on 5GMS AF Event Exposure (EVEX)\".\n[2]\tTdoc S4-220807, \"Presentation of Specification to TSG: TS 26.531, Version 2.1.0\".\n[3] \tTdoc S4-220819, \"Presentation of Specification to TSG: TS 26.532, Version 2.0.0\".\n[4]\tTS 26.501, \"5G Media Streaming (5GMS); General description and architecture\".\n[5]\tTS 26.512, \"5G Media Streaming (5GMS); Protocols\".\n[6]\tTS 29.517, \"5G Systems; Application Function Event Exposure Service; Stage 3\".\n[7]\tTS 29.522, \"5G Systems; Network Exposure Function Northbound APIs; Stage 3\".\n[8]\tTS 29.591, \"5G Systems; Network Exposure Function Southbound Services; Stage 3\".\n[9]\tTS 23.502, \"5G; Procedures for the 5G System (5GS)\".\n[10]\tTS 23.288, \" Architecture enhancements for 5G System (5GS) to support network data analytics services\".\n",

Using AKMA, a user can log in to an application service only based on the 3GPP credential which is the permanent key stored in the user’s tamper-resistant smart card UICC. The application service provider can also delegate the task of user authentication to the mobile network operator by using AKMA.\nThe AKMA architecture and procedures are specified by SA3 in TS 33.535 [1], with the related study showing how its general principles are derived documented in TR 33.835 [2]. The AKMA feature introduces a new Network Function into the 5G system, which is the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF). Its detailed services and API definitions are specified by CT3 in TS 29.535[3]. Earlier generations of cellular networks include two similar standards specified by SA3, which are generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA) and battery-efficient security for very low throughput machine type communication devices (BEST). Since the AKMA feature is deemed as a successor of these systems, the work is launched by SA3 without the involvement of stage 1.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 33.535: \"Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) based on 3GPP credentials in the 5G System (5GS)\"\n[2]\tTR 33.835: \"Study on authentication and key management for applications based on 3GPP credential in 5G\"\n[3]\tTS 29.535: \"5G System; AKMA Anchor Services; Stage 3\"\n",

In Release 16, it was made mandatory for UEs to support User Plane Integrity Protection (UPIP) in NR at the full data rate that the UE supports in both the Uplink and Downlink. This provides protection against certain security attacks but only for NR capable devices while using NR and the 5G Core.\nIn Release 17, the SA 3 work item \"User Plane Integrity Protection for LTE\" was agreed in SP-210105 with the intention of protecting LTE devices from these security attacks. Subsequently, in RP-213669, TSG-RAN agreed the Building Block WID \"User Plane Integrity Protection support for EPC connected architectures\" to enable full data rate Uu interface UPIP for EPS, but only on EN-DC capable devices. This provides useful protection to NR capable smartphones in case they are, for example, forced off NR and onto an E-UTRA-only connection or an EN-DC connection.\nThe overall security architecture is specified in TS 33.401 and system architecture details are specified in TS 23.501 and TS 23.401.\nThe UE indicates its support for EPS UPIP in the UE Network Capability sent in NAS signalling (TS 24.301) from the UE to the MME. The MME stores this UPIP support information and sends it to the eNB in the S1AP Initial Context Setup Request and Handover Request messages. The eNB uses this indication (and not any information in the UE Radio Access Capabilities IE) to determine whether the UE supports EPS UPIP.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may supply the MME with a security policy (UPIP required/preferred/not needed). The MME stores this policy information and passes it onto the eNB on a per-EPS bearer basis in the Security Indication IE. If the eNB does not receive any security policy, the eNB can be configured with a default UPIP policy to use (e.g. \"UPIP preferred\").\nX2AP (TS 36.423), and S1AP (TS 36.413) signalling supports UPIP continuity at handover. X2AP supports the use of UPIP in the SgNB when EN-DC is in use. E1AP interface signalling (TS 37.483) supports UPIP when the eNB is split into eNB-Control Plane and eNB-User Plane functions.\nAt X2, S1 (intra and inter-MME) and inter-RAT handovers, mechanisms are specified in X2AP and S1AP to ensure that EPS bearers with a security policy of \"UPIP required\" are not handed over to eNBs that do not support UPIP.\nRRC signalling (TS 36.331 and TS 38.331) enables the use of UPIP with the UE in both EN-DC and LTE-only configurations. As described in the LS from RAN2 to SA3 in R2-2203663:\nUPIP for the EPC connected architectures uses NR PDCP and is configured in following way:\n-\t(as is done for legacy LTE UE) an LTE algorithm code point is configured in field integrityProtectionAlgorithm in IE SecurityAlgorithmConfig in the TS 36.331 SecurityModeCommand message, and this is used to derive KUPint (and also to derive KUPEnc, as for legacy LTE UE).\n-\tThe NR algorithm code point (corresponding to the LTE algorithm code point used in the SecurityModeCommand) indicated by the integrityProtAlgorithm included in the securityConfig in the TS 38.331 RadioBearerConfig is used to configure the UP IP algorithm applied by NR PDCP to perform integrity protection.\n-\tThe integrityProtection indicated in pdcp-Config in the DRB-ToAddMod(list) in the TS 38.331 RadioBearerConfig is used to activate the UP IP for a DRB using the configured algorithm, which can be done only at DRB setup. Consequently, UP IP activation/deactivation for a DRB can be changed only by DRB-release-and-add.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220321.\nThe existing Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) was firstly introduced in Rel-6 and prior to Rel-17 the architecture included network functions interacting with each other via dedicated reference point interfaces. The integration of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) to the 5G Core (5GC) introduces Service Based Interfaces (SBA) for the related GBA Network Functions as well as specific GBA services for the User Data Management (UDM) network function in 5GC. In this way GBA can be used in 5GC deployments.\nThe 3GPP authentication infrastructure employed in GBA includes Home Network (HN) functions User Equipment (UE) functions and the 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) protocol. This infrastructure is a very valuable asset of 3GPP operators and could be leveraged to enable application functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side to establish shared cryptographic material based on 3GPP credentials. This is the motivation and purpose of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) and GBA Push features developed in 3GPP since Rel-6.\nThe GBA architecture in releases prior to Rel-17 includes a Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) which is the anchor of the cryptographic key hierarchy, the Home Subscriber System (HSS), which handles the user subscriptions and provides authentication vectors to the BSF, UE applications and Network Application Functions (NAFs). GBA includes a bootstrapping protocol for authentication and key agreement for a root security key between the UE and BSF and a framework of application session protocols (Ua protocols) to establish an application security key between a UE and a NAF. The application security key is derived from the bootstrapping key. The GBA Push feature includes a protocol between the NAF and the UE in order to establish the application security key with a more efficient message exchange suitable for constrained devices. GBA is specified to support at least the following Diameter-based reference point interfaces: (a) Zh between the BSF and HSS for mutual authentication between the HN and the UE, (b) Zn between the BSF and NAF for the application security key establishment and (c) Zpn between the BSF and a GBA Push enabled NAF (Push-NAF) for a combined mutual authentication and application security key establishment. The use of these interfaces has allowed GBA to be used in 3G and also in 4G core networks since the HSS in 3G and 4G supported Diameter-based interfaces.\nWith the advent of 5G, the 5G Core (5GC) has introduced Network Functions which expose SBA interfaces and among other network functions a new subscription management network function, the User Data Management (UDM). Enabling GBA and GBA Push functionality to be used in 5GC, resulted in the inclusion of the GBA and GBA Push functions in SBA as well as the specification of the SBA interfaces for the BSF, HSS and UDM. More specifically, a Service Based Interface (SBI) capable BSF exposes not only the aforementioned reference point interfaces but also SBA interfaces towards an SBI capable NAF. An SBI capable HSS provides an SBA interface for the BSF to retrieve authentication vectors and other GBA related subscription information for the GBA and GBA Push procedures. Finally, the UDM exposes a new service operation for an SBI capable BSF to retrieve authentication vectors provided by the UDM.\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 23.501: \"System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\".\n[2]\tTS 33.501: \"Security architecture and procedures for 5G System\".\n[3]\tTS 33.220: \"Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA); Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA)\".\n[4]\tTS 33.223: \"Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA); Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) Push function\".\n[5]\tTS 23.510: \"5G System; Network function repository services; Stage 3\".\n[6]\tTS 23.562: \"5G System; Home Subscriber Server (HSS) services; Stage 3\".\n",

This capability may be needed for reasons such as reselection to a higher priority PLMN based on business arrangements (TS22.261 – clause 6.30.1).\nSteering of Roaming (SOR) is used since GSM, and the requirements are provided in TS22.011.\nIn 5G, the Control Plane SOR solution (CP-SOR) was introduced using the same requirements in TS22.011.\nIn Rel-17, additional requirements specific for CP-SOR were provided in TS22.261 that allows the HPLMN to control the timing when a UE registered on a VPLMN, in automatic mode (see clause 3.1 of TS 23.122 [25]) and currently in CONNECTED mode, enters IDLE mode and initiates higher priority PLMN selection based on the type of ongoing communication.\nUpon receiving CP-SOR information defined in Rel-15 and Rel-16, while the UE is in CONNECTED mode, the UE waits until it moves to idle mode before performing SOR and attempting to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN.\nThe UEs in 5G may stay in connected mode for a rather long time, whole day or longer, without going to idle mode. The HPLMN operator may have means to evaluate what is more convenient to provide the service for the user (e.g., based on their subscription profile, more efficient economically from wholesale perspective, allow users to use dedicated \"economical\" retail plans on specific VPLMN, etc.) and decide which VPLMN is more appropriate for the user to register on. Therefore, new requirements are introduced to allow the HPLMN to enforce the interruption of the ongoing sessions for the sake of performing SOR and moving the UE to another VPLMN to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN.\nThis feature introduces means to send additional steering of roaming information, called steering of roaming connected mode control information (SOR-CMCI) that enables the HPLMN to control the timing of a UE in connected mode to move to idle mode to perform the steering of roaming. The UE shall support the SOR-CMCI. The support and use of SOR-CMCI by the HPLMN is based on the HPLMN's operator policy.\nThe SOR-CMCI is provided by the HPLMN operator using different means, a specific application function (SOR-AF) or the information can be stored in the repository system (UDR). This information can be provided to the UE during registration procedure or after the registration (triggered by some parameters in the SOR-AF or the UDR).\nThe UE's type of ongoing communication / session(s) should be taken into consideration. The high priority services and emergency services are exempted from being interrupted (i.e. this feature is not applicable).\nThe new SOR related information is to be exchanged between the HPLMN UDM and the UE in a secured manner therefore the HPLMN data management application function ensures the security of the information using the Authentication Server Function (AUSF). The SOR information is transparent for the VPLMN, and if the VPLMN manipulates the information then the security of the information will break. To ensure the security of the information, the HPLMN may request the UE to provide an acknowledgement that the information is received securely.\nThis feature is optional for the HPLMN. This means that if this optional feature is not selected by the HPLMN operator, then there shall be no impact on the existing SOR functionality.\nThis feature is applicable only when the UE is in automatic network selection mode (see TS 23.122).\nReferences\nRelated CRs: set \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 22.011: \"Service accessibility\".\n[2]\tTS 22.261: \"Service requirements for the 5G system; Stage 1\".\n[3]\tTS 23.122: \"Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode\".\n[4]\tTS 24.501: \"Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3\".\n",

A simple way to achieve such binding is to select the same Policy Control Function (PCF) for the AMF and the SMF.\nIn Rel 15 and 16, the same PCF selection for the AMF and the SMF is achieved by the mechanism of AMF optionally forwarding the selected PCF to SMF instance(s) during the PDU Session Establishment procedure(s), and the SMF may select the received PCF for SM Policy Control based on local policies. But it is applicable only in the UE initially accessing via 5GS scenario.\nThis Rel 17 work item specifies a mechanism to achieve the same PCF selection for AMF and SMF in the EPS to 5GS mobility scenario, where the PCF selection for AMF may be performed after the PCF selection for SMF/PGW-C. In this WI, subscription data is expanded to assist the same PCF selection, to offer more flexibility for operation of corresponding service.\nThe mechanism in this WI is based on the PGW-C+SMF registration of the selected PCF for SM Policy Control into the UDM+HSS. When performing PCF selection, based on subscription data for the PCF selection received from the UDM, the AMF determines that the same PCF for AMF and the SMF serving a specific DNN and/or S-NSSAI needs to be selected, then it selects the PCF ID serving the specific DNN and/or S-NSSAI received from UDM before initiating the Establishment of AM Policy Association. It is applicable for EPS to 5GS Mobility.\nFor the scenario of pure 5GS, based on subscription data for the PCF selection received from the UDM, the AMF determines that the same PCF for AMF and SMF serving a specific DNN and/or S-NSSAI needs to be selected, then it forwards the PCF ID for AM policies to the SMF and may additionally indicate to the SMF that the same PCF should be selected for SM Policy Control.\nReferences\nList of related CRs:\n[1]\tTS 23.501: \"System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)\"\n[2]\tTS 23.502: \"Procedures for the 5G System; Stage 2\"\n[3]\tTS 29.502: \"5G System; Session Management Services; Stage 3\"\n[4]\tTS 29.503: \"5G System; Unified Data Management Services; Stage 3\"\n[5]\tTS 29.513: \"5G System; Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and QoS parameter mapping; Stage 3\"\n",

In this context the metric identifier for trace metrics, covering Immediate MDT, Logged MDT, Logged MBSFN MDT, Trace, RLF reports and RCEF reports, has been introduced in TS 32.422[4].\nThe methods of file-based reporting of performance metrics are enhanced to allow implicit notification subscriptions for notifyFileReady notifications indicating the availability of new performance metric reports, see TS 28.622[2], TS 28.623[3].\nReferences\nList of related CRs: select \"TSG Status = Approved\" in:\n[1]\tTS 28.537: “Management and orchestration; Management capabilities”\n[2]\tTS 28.622: “Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)”\n[3]\tTS 28.623: “Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions”\n[4]\tTS 32.422: \" Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace control and configuration management\"\n",
