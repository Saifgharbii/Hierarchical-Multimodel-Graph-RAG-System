In case that the SMS recipient belongs to a PLMN different from the PLMN of the SMS sender, the signaling takes place across PLMN borders.\nWhen using service-based interface between the SMS-GMSC and the UDM, if the GPSI is the only known SMS recipient's identifier, the SMS-GMSC needs to determine the target PLMN to be able to interact with the UDM in the home PLMN of the SMS recipient. The SMS-GMSC can determine the target PLMN using one of the following mechanisms:\n-\tGPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the NF consumer, described in clause 5.1.7.2.\n-\tGPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution using NRF, described in clause 5.1.7.4.\n-\tGPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution delegated by SCP, described in clause 5.1.7.3\nIt is assumed that the domain part in an External Identifier identifies the home PLMN and hence it is not required to determine the target PLMN when the GPSI is an External Identifier. The procedures described in the present clause 5.1.7 apply only when the GPSI is an MSISDN.\nNOTE:\tWhile these mechanisms are defined to determine the target PLMN for interactions between the SMS entities such as SMS-GMSC and the UDM requiring routing based on the GPSI of the SMS recipient, it can be applicable to any use case and procedure requiring selection of the target PLMN based on GPSI in 5GS.\nWhen the recipient GPSI belongs to the same country as the originating network and MNPF is not implemented in the country, the SMS-GMSC may skip the procedure and may directly discover UDM profile for invoking UDM service operation for routing information retrieval. In this case the SMS-GMSC determines the target PLMN ID from the recipient's GPSI Prefix (e.g. CC+NDC) while sending the discovery request to the NRF.\nThe figure depicts a GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the SMS-GMSC, illustrating the resolution of GPSI signals in a mobile network. The resolution is measured in GPSI (Global Positioning System Interferometer) units, which are used to measure the distance between two GPS satellites. The SMS-GMSC is a component of the mobile network that enables the transmission of SMS messages. The figure shows the resolution of GPSI signals in relation to the SMS-GMSC, highlighting the importance of this component in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of mobile network communication.\nFigure 5.1.7.2-1: GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the SMS-GMSC\n1a-1b.\tThe MNPF registers in the NRF with a new NF Type (e.g. MNPF).\n2.\tMT SMS interaction between SC and SMS-GMSC follow the current procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [2].\n3a-3b.\tThe SMS-GMSC should query the NRF to find the MNPF instance that manages the PLMN ID of the recipients GPSI's subscription network. The MNPF may belong to the same PLMN with SMS-GMSC or belong to the number range holder network which is different with the PLMN of SMS-GMSC. In latter case, the local NRF forwards the discovery request to the NRF of the number range holder PLMN.\n4.\tSMS-GMSC invokes Nmnpf_NPStatus_Get (GPSI) to the MNPF to get the target PLMN ID of the GPSI.\n5.\tMNPF checks the portability status of the recipient GPSI and responds back with the target PLMN ID.\nAfter step 5, the Mobile Terminated short message transfer procedures defined in clause 5.1 is performed from step 2a. The SMS-GMSC uses the target PLMN ID to discover the UDM NF profile via NRF for sending the routing information query to the UDM. If the target PLMN ID is not own network, the local NRF forwards the discovery request to the NRF of the target PLMN.\nWhen MNP is implemented in a country or number portability domain with direct routing mechanism, the originating network first does the number portability query to identify the recipient GPSI's subscription PLMN before routing any messages based on GPSI.\nThe figure depicts a GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the SMS-GMSC (Direct Routing) in a 5G network. It illustrates the process of GPSI (Global Positioning System Inertial) data being transmitted to the Subscription Network, which is essential for ensuring reliable and efficient communication. The figure also highlights the role of the SMS-GMSC (Service Management System for GSM) in managing the SMS-GMSC (Service Management System for GSM) in the 5G network.\nFigure 5.1.7.2.2-1 GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the SMS-GMSC (Direct Routing)\n1.\tIf the MNPF is deployed, the MNPF registers in the NRF with a new NF Type (e.g. MNPF).\n2-3.\tThe SMS-GMSC should query the NRF to find the MNPF instance that manages the PLMN ID of the recipients GPSI's subscription network.\n4.\tSMS-GMSC invokes Nmnpf_NPStatus_Get (GPSI) to the MNPF to get the target PLMN ID of the GPSI.\n5.\tMNPF checks the portability status of the recipient GPSI and responds back with the target PLMN ID.\nNOTE:\tWhen the recipient GPSI belongs to the same country as the originating network and MNPF is not implemented in the country, the steps 1-5 is skipped. In this case the SMS-GMSC determines the target PLMN ID from the recipient's GPSI Prefix (e.g. CC+NDC) based on local configuration.\n6-7.\tSMS-GMSC shall query the NRF to find the UDM instance serving the target PLMN based on target PLMN ID received in step 6. For step 7b-8b, if the target PLMN ID is not the originating network, the local NRF forwards the discovery request to the NRF of the target PLMN.\n8-9.\tSMS-GMSC invokes Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM (GPSI) to the UDM of the target PLMN to get the serving node instance for UE. The UDM shall check the registration/reachability flags to determine the potential target nodes and responds to the SMS-GMSC by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response, in this procedure the SMSF instance Id is included in the response message.\nWhen MNP is implemented in a country or number portability domain with indirect routing mechanism, the signalling messages are always routed to the number range holder network, the number range holder then performs a number portability check and forwards the request to the subscription network if the number is ported out. For the case of international SMS termination also indirect routing is applied. In the case of international SMS termination, the originating network is outside the number portability domain and may not have any knowledge of whether number portability is implemented in the country of the recipient GPSI.\nThe figure depicts a GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the SMS-GMSC (Indirect Routing) mechanism, illustrating the step-by-step process of how SMS-GMSC resolves GPSI (Global Positioning System Information) to a Subscription Network. The figure illustrates the SMS-GMSC process, which involves the use of GPSI to determine the correct Subscription Network, and the subsequent steps to resolve the GPSI to the correct Subscription Network.\nFigure 5.1.7.2.3-1 GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution triggered by the SMS-GMSC (Indirect Routing)\n1.\tIf the MNPF is deployed in the Number Range Holder PLMN, the MNPF registers in the NRF of the number range holder PLMN with a new NF Type (e.g. MNPF).\n2-3.\tThe SMS-GMSC should query the local NRF to find the MNPF instance that manages the PLMN ID of the recipients GPSI's subscription network, the local NRF forwards the discovery request to the NRF of the number range holder PLMN.\n4.\tSMS-GMSC invokes Nmnpf_NPStatus_Get (GPSI) to the MNPF to get the target PLMN ID of the GPSI.\n5.\tMNPF checks the portability status of the recipient GPSI and responds back with the target PLMN ID.\nNOTE: When the recipient GPSI belongs to the same country as the number range holder network and MNPF is not implemented in the country, the steps 1-5 is skipped.

The UDM shall check the registration/reachability flags to determine the potential target nodes and responds to the SMS-GMSC by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response, in this procedure the SMSF instance Id is included in the response message.\nThis procedure is used to retrieve the PLMN ID of the recipients GPSI for further discovery of UDM NF profiles for invoking UDM service operation for routing information retrieval. In indirect Communication with Delegated Discovery, the SCP is the service consumer of the GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution service in MNPF and routes an SBI message based on GPSI when MNPF is implemented. The SCP shall use the discovery factors (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [11], clause 6.10) provided by the SMS-GMSC to determine when to invoke the MNPF resolution, and to obtain the identity (GPSI) of the recipient.\nThe SMS-GMSC sends routing information retrieval request to the SCP and the SCP uses the PLMN ID as the target PLMN ID in the discovery request towards NRF to discover the UDM NF profiles in the subscription network of the SMS recipient.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a GPSI-to-Subscription-Network (GPSIN) resolution mechanism in a satellite communication system. The figure illustrates the SCP (Signal Classification and Prediction) process, which is used to improve the accuracy of GPSI (Signal to Interference plus Noise) measurements. The MNPF (Multipath Noise Prediction Filter) is a key component in this process, which helps to mitigate noise and improve the accuracy of GPSI measurements. The figure also shows the use of MNPF in conjunction with the SCP, which enhances the overall performance of the GPSIN system.\nFigure 5.1.7.3.2-1: SCP supports GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution with MNPF\n1a-1b.\tIf the MNPF is deployed, the MNPF registers in the NRF with a new NF Type (e.g. MNPF).\n2.\tMT SMS interaction between SC and SMS-GMSC follow the current procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [2].\n3.

As specified in the Indirect Communication with Delegated Discovery model, the Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSMt shall contain the discovery factors containing the GPSI (pointing to the Number Range Holder Network) and an indicator (i.e. \"target-nw-resolution\") that Subscription Network resolution is delegated to the SCP. The \"target-nw-resolution\" may also be sent by an SCP to the next hop SCP.

In latter case, the local NRF forwards the discovery request to the NRF of the number range holder PLMN.\n5.\tThe SCP determines the target PLMN of the recipients GPSI's subscription network using the SBI service of the MNPF i.e. the SCP invokes Nmnpf_NPStatus_Get (GPSI) to the MNPF.\n6.\tMNPF checks the portability status of the recipient GPSI and responds back with the target PLMN ID.\nNOTE: If SCP is co-located with MNPF, steps between SCP and NRF to discover the MNPF, and steps between SCP and MNPF can be skipped.\n7a-7b.\tSCP shall query the NRF to find the UDM instance serving the target PLMN based on target PLMN ID received in step 6.\n8.\tSCP invokes Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM (GPSI) to the UDM to get the serving node instance for UE.\n9.\tThe UDM shall check the registration/reachability flags to determine the potential target nodes and responds to the SCP by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response, in this procedure the SMSF instance Id is included in the response message.\n10. SCP forward the responds to the SMS-GMSC by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response (SMS Router address).\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a GPSI-to-Subscription-Network (S2N) resolution system, highlighting the support for GPSI (Global Positioning System Inertial) to Subscription-Network (S2N) resolution. The system utilizes NRF (Near Field Communication) technology to enable precise positioning and synchronization between GPS signals and Subscription-Network signals. This system is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture, and smart city infrastructure.\nFigure 5.1.7.3.3-1: SCP supports GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution with NRF\n1a-1b.\tIf the MNPF is deployed, the MNPF registers in the NRF with a new NF Type (e.g. MNPF).\n2.\tMT SMS interaction between SC and SMS-GMSC follow the current procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [2].\n3. The SMS-GMSC sends Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM to the SCP to get the serving node instance for UE from the UDM. The Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM contains the NF service discovery factors with the GPSI (pointing to the Number Range Holder Network) and an indicator (i.e. \"target-nw-resolution\") indicating that Subscription Network resolution is delegated to the SCP. The \"target-nw-resolution\" may also be sent by an SCP to the next hop SCP.\n4.\tThe SCP should query the NRF to find the UDM instance that manages the user subscriptions using the GPSI. The NRF receives the \"target-nw-resolution\" shall query the NF service consumer (MNPF) to obtain the PLMN ID of the recipient GPSI's subscription network.\n5.\tThe NRF determines the target PLMN of the recipients GPSI's subscription network using the SBI service of the MNPF i.e. the NRF invokes Nmnpf_NPStatus_Get (GPSI) to the MNPF. As an implementation choice the NRF may determine the target PLMN by other means, e.g. local configuration of ENUM query.\n6.\tMNPF checks the portability status of the recipient GPSI and responds back with the target PLMN ID.\n7.\tNRF returns the UDM instance related to the GPSI and target PLMN Id to the SCP. For inter-PLMN discovery, the local NRF shall query the NRF in the target PLMN to find the UDM instance. If there are not NF instances available that can serve the request, the local NRF provides the discovery response indicating the consumer NF to use a legacy interface for the next operation request in the procedure.\n8.\tSCP invokes Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM (GPSI) to the UDM to get the serving node instance for UE.\n9.\tThe UDM shall check the registration/reachability flags to determine the potential target nodes and responds to the SCP by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response, in this procedure the SMSF instance Id is included in the response message.\n10. SCP forward the responds to the SMS-GMSC by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response (SMS Router address).\nFigure 5.1.7.3.4-1 shows the procedure for Direct Communication with Delegated Discovery, the SCP is the service consumer of the GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution service in MNPF and routes an SBI message based on GPSI when direct routing of MNPF is implemented.\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of a GPSI-to-Subscription-Network (GPSIN) support in a 5G network. It illustrates the use of Multi-Path Signal Processing (MPSP) to improve the resolution of GPSI signals, which are used for Direct Routing (DR). The figure shows the various components involved in the GPSIN process, including the GPSI, Subscription Network (SN), and MNPF. The MNPF is used to ensure reliable and efficient routing of GPSI signals, while the SN is responsible for routing the GPSI to the appropriate Subscription Network. The figure also highlights the importance of redundancy in the GPSIN process, as it ensures that the network can continue to function even if a component fails. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the GPSIN support in a 5G network, highlighting the role of MNPF and SN in improving the resolution of GPSI signals.\nFigure 5.1.7.3.4-1 SCP supports the GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution with MNPF for Direct Routing\n1.\tIf the MNPF is deployed, the MNPF registers in the NRF with a new NF Type (e.g. MNPF).\n2.\tThe SMS-GMSC sends Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM to the SCP to get the serving node instance for UE from the UDM.

In this case the SMS-GMSC or SCP determines the target PLMN ID from the recipient's GPSI Prefix (e.g. CC+NDC) based on local configuration.\n7-8.\tSCP shall query the NRF to find the UDM instance serving the target PLMN based on target PLMN ID received in step 6.

The figure shows a 4-1-7 layout with a target point marked as 4, a reference point marked as 1, and a reference point marked as 7. The figure illustrates the process of determining the target's position by calculating the difference between the GPSI readings of the target and the reference points. This method is used in network planning and positioning applications to ensure accurate and reliable positioning of target points.\nFigure 5.1.7.4-1: Determination of target PLMN based on GPSI using NRF\n1.\tThe SMS-GMSC located in the PLMN of the SMS sender contacts the NRF in the originating PLMN to perform NF/NF service discovery of the UDM instance(s). The discovery request is based on the GPSI of the SMS recipient and includes an indication for the NRF to determine the target PLMN and interface to be used (SBI or legacy interface).\n2.\tBased on the indication to determine the target PLMN and interface to be used included in the discovery request, if direct routing mechanism is used the NRF in the originating PLMN retrieves the target PLMN ID from the MNPF in the originating PLMN by consuming the SBI services of the MNPF described in clause 6.7. The NRF performs an NP query to the MNPF using SBI for the GPSI of the SMS recipient.\nIf indirect routing mechanism is used, steps 2-3 are skipped and the procedure continues in step 4a.\n3.\tThe MNPF provides in the response the target PLMN information corresponding to the GPSI of the SMS recipient and the procedure continues in step 4.\n2a-3a.\tThe NRF may, as an alternative implementation option to steps 2-3, obtain the target PLMN information by other means, e.g., using DNS/ENUM resolution, local configuration in the NRF or direct access to Number Portability (NP) databases via non-SBI, if applicable.\nNOTE 1:\tNP applies to GPSIs representing E.164 addresses (i.e., MSISDN). NP is subject to regional and regulatory requirements and is accomplished through the retrieval of ported data from NP databases. Support of ENUM or direct access to NP via non-SBI interfaces and the exact means to make the number portability data available to the NRF is subject to and configured per operator policy.\nThe NRF may use the DNS/ENUM translation mechanism to resolve the GPSI of the SMS recipient in E.164 format to a URI as specified in IETF RFC 6116 [12]. The NRF performs an ENUM query for the GPSI of the SMS recipient in step 2a. The output of the lookup process in the DNS/ENUM server is a URI that is provided in the ENUM response and points to the originating PLMN or the NRF in the target PLMN with which the originating PLMN has an interconnection agreement using SBI, so that the NRF in the originating PLMN can send an inter-PLMN service discovery request to the NRF in the target PLMN.\nNOTE 2:\tThe DNS/ENUM server searches for an ENUM record matching the GPSI of the SMS recipient. An ENUM record for the individual GPSI or number series provisioned in the DNS/ENUM server can be used to indicate whether the user belongs to the same PLMN or another PLMN in the same or different country. A URI as a result of the lookup process in the DNS/ENUM server can be provided by provisioning an ENUM service using the http or https scheme URI as defined in IETF RFC 4002 [13] and IETF RFC 6118 [14].\n4.\tBased on the response from the MNPF, the NRF in the originating PLMN determines the target PLMN where to search for UDM instances.\nIf the NRF has obtained the target PLMN information by other means in steps 2a-3a, the NRF determines the target PLMN based on the information from ENUM response, NP databases via non-SBI and/or local configuration.\nIf the GPSI belongs to the originating PLMN (i.e. originating network is the same as subscription network), the NRF searches for UDM instances matching the discovery criteria that can serve the request in the originating PLMN using SBI services and provides the discovery response in step 7.\nIf the GPSI belongs to a different PLMN, the NRF checks whether the originating PLMN has an interconnection agreement using SBI with the subscription PLMN and, in that case, sends an inter-PLMN discovery request including the GPSI to the NRF in the subscription PLMN to retrieve the UDM instances that can serve the SMS recipient, as defined in clause 4.17.5 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4] and 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], and the procedure continues in step 6.\n4a.\tIf indirect routing mechanism is used (i.e., no interaction as in steps 2-3 between NRF and MNPF in the originating PLMN), the NRF in the originating PLMN determines the PLMN ID of the number range holder network (e.g. from the recipient's GPSI prefix (CC+NDC) based on local configuration) and sends an inter-PLMN discovery request of UDM instances to the NRF in the number range holder network. In this case, the discovery request across PLMNs shall include the GPSI of the SMS recipient and the indication to determine the target PLMN and interface to be used.\n5.\tBased on the indication to determine the target PLMN and interface to be used included in the discovery request from the NRF in the originating PLMN, the NRF in the number range holder PLMN applies the behaviour described for the NRF in steps 2-3 (or alternatively, steps 2a-3a) and step 4.\nThe NRF in the number range holder network may perform a query to the MNPF using SBI if NP is required and NP information has not been retrieved previously (e.g., if originating and number range holder PLMNs belong to different countries or portability domains and NP is required in the country of the recipient GPSI). The NRF in the number range holder network obtains the PLMN ID of the subscription network in the response from the MNPF (or alternatively by other means such as ENUM/NP) and, if applicable, sends an inter-PLMN discovery request of UDM instances including the GPSI to the NRF in the subscription network.\n6.\tThe NRF in the subscription network provides the inter-PLMN discovery response including UDM instance(s) matching the discovery criteria or no UDM instance(s) found in the target PLMN, implying that SBI interactions should not be used.\nWhen using indirect routing, the NRF in the number range holder network forwards the discovery response from the NRF in the subscription network to the NRF in the originating network.\n7.\tIf the NRF in the originating network finds UDM instances matching the filter criteria in the originating PLMN or receives UDM instances in the response to a discovery request across PLMNs in step 6, the NRF provides the UDM instances in the discovery response to the SMS-GMSC.\nIf no UDM instances can serve the request using SBI, the NRF provides the discovery response indicating the SMS-GMSC to use a non-SBI interface for the next operation request in the procedure.\n8a.\tIf the discovery response includes UDM instances that can serve the SMS recipient, the SMS-GMSC sends the operation request using SBI to e.g., retrieve the SMS routing information from the UDM, and the SBI-based MT SMS procedure can be executed as described in clause 5.1.\n8b.\tIf no UDM instances are provided in the discovery response, the SMS-GMSC sends the operation request via legacy interface using MAP/Diameter to e.g., retrieve the SMS routing information from the HLR/HSS/UDM.\n",
