The SEALDD function exhibits service-based interfaces which are used for providing and consuming SEALDD services. The service-based interface for SEALDD function is representation as Sdd.\nFigure 7.2-1 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\nThe figure depicts a 5G SBA (Service Based Architecture) representation, illustrating the utilization of 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA. The figure shows various services such as 5G Core, 5G Core-Enhanced, 5G Core-Enhanced-Enhanced, and 5G Core-Enhanced-Enhanced-Enhanced, each represented by different colored lines and symbols. The figure also includes a 5GS SBA-based service, represented by a solid line, and a 5GS SBA-based service-based service, represented by a dashed line. The figure highlights the importance of 5GS SBA in enabling efficient and reliable network services.\nFigure 7.2-1: Utilization of 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA – service based representation\nThe SEALDD server acts as AF for consuming network services from the 3GPP 5G Core Network entities over the Service Based Architecture specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\nFigure 7.2-2 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound APIs via CAPIF.\nThe figure depicts a utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF (Capability-based Interface Framework) service-based representation, showcasing the various APIs and their respective functionalities.\nFigure 7.2-2: Utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF – service based representation\nThe SEALDD server acts as authorized API invoker to consume services from the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound API entities like SCEF, NEF, SCEF+NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3].\nThe mechanism for northbound APIs discovery using the service-based interfaces depicted in figure 7.2-3 is as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3].\nFigure 7.2-3 illustrates the architecture for SEAL Data Delivery enabler service.\nThe figure depicts the architecture of the SEAL Data Delivery Service, showcasing its components and their interconnections. The service utilizes a combination of wired and wireless technologies, with a focus on efficient data delivery. Key components include the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage, as well as the network interface controller (NIC) and network interface module (NIM). The figure also highlights the use of virtualization and cloud computing to optimize resource utilization and improve performance.\nFigure 7.2-3 Architecture for SEAL Data Delivery Service\nThe SEALDD server can communicate with the control plane of 3GPP core network via N33/N5 interface with the SEALDD control plane functionality.\nNOTE 1: Relationship and API interactions between SEALDD and NRM are out of scope of this release.\nFor uplink traffic, VAL client sends application data traffic to SEALDD client for SEALDD service over SEALDD-C. After data plane packet processing by SEALDD client, the application data traffic is converted to SEALDD data traffic and transferred to SEALDD server over SEALDD-UU. The SEALDD server restores the application data traffic and sends it to VAL server over SEALDD-S. For downlink traffic, VAL server sends application data traffic to SEALDD server for SEALDD service over SEALDD-S. After data plane packet processing by SEALDD server, the application data traffic is converted to SEALDD data traffic and transferred to SEALDD client over SEALDD-UU. The SEALDD client restores the application data traffic and sends it to VAL client over SEALDD-C. Optionally, VAL deployments may choose to route application signalling traffic and application data traffic for some or all functions it offers using SEALDD service and figure 7.2-4 illustrates the architecture for achieving this. In this case the VAL client and VAL server may choose not to maintain application connection by themselves and transfer all the application traffic over SEALDD connections for those functions. The data storage functionality may be provided by SEALDD server or provided by other storage functions in VAL server, or other cloud platform.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is up to the implementation of VAL server about which storage entity (e.g. VAL server, SEALDD server, or other cloud platform) is selected and used.\nNOTE 2:\tSEALDD capabilities are provided as APIs to the VAL Layer, it is up to VAL layer to decide which traffic to be transferred (e.g. application signalling, application data).\nThe figure depicts the architecture of application traffic transfer in a 5G network, illustrating the various components such as the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. Key features include the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference, and the presence of redundant paths to ensure failover reliability. The layered design aligns with SDN principles, emphasizing the importance of network virtualization and automation.\nFigure 7.2-4: Architecture for application traffic transfer\nThe SEAL Data Delivery client interacts with the SEAL data delivery server to establish application layer data transport path.\nThrough this path, the SEALDD server and client provides data transport service capabilities such as data plane packet processing (e.g. packet duplication, elimination or transport coordination), data forwarding, data caching, background data transfer, etc. to support the VAL server and VAL client. Annex C describes a typical lifecycle of SEALDD to establish the SEALDD connection for the VAL client and VAL server.\n",

The figure includes a diagram of the communication setup, with the interpreter's hand as the source of the sign language, and the hearing-impaired individual's hand as the receiver. The figure also includes a flowchart to guide the process, with arrows indicating the sequence of actions.\nFigure 9.2.2.1-1: SEALDD signalling transmission connection establishment procedure\n1.\tThe VAL server decides to use SEALDD service for application signalling transfer and allocates address/port as SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information for receiving the application signalling packets from SEALDD server. The VAL server sends Sdd_RegularTransmission request to the SEALDD server. The service request includes the VAL server ID, VAL service ID to identify the VAL application traffic, the SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information of the VAL server side.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, the SEALDD server allocates a specific address or port used for SEALDD traffic transfer with the incoming SEALDD client(s) for the VAL server and responds with a SEALDD service response.\nNOTE 1: The SEALDD server does not allocate address/port in this step and VAL server treats the SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information as wildcard endpoint for SEALDD-S reference point to receive all the application signalling traffic.\n3.\tThe VAL client sends a SEALDD service request to SEALDD client. The service request also indicates to establish application signalling transmission connection. The VAL client receives a SEALDD service response to the SEALDD client. The response indicates that whether the SEALDD service request is successful or not.\n4.\tThe VAL/SEALDD client discovers and selects the proper SEALDD server for the VAL application, as described in clause 9.4.3. After this step, the VAL server is discovered and selected along with the associated SEALDD server, the SEALDD client can get the SEALDD server's address.\n5.\tThe SEALDD client allocates a SEALDD flow ID mapping to application traffic for application signalling transmission. The SEALDD client sends Sdd_RegularTransmissionConnection_Establish request to SEALDD server with the SEALDD client ID, the SEALDD flow ID, VAL server ID, VAL service ID and the SEALDD traffic descriptor of the SEALDD client side (the address/port of the SEALDD client for receiving the downlink SEALDD traffic). The request message also contains the selected VAL server endpoint information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SEALDD flow ID is used by the SEALDD client and SEALDD server to identify different application traffic, and it is mapped to the VAL service ID.\n6.\tThe SEALDD server responds to the SEALDD client with the SEALDD traffic descriptor of SEALDD server side (e.g. address/port allocated in step 2, transport layer protocol) mapping to the application traffic.\n7.\tThe SEALDD server stores the SEALDD client ID, SEALDD flow ID to identify the SEALDD traffic and establishes SEALDD-S connection with VAL server for the VAL client to transmit application traffic mapping to the SEALDD traffic. SEALDD server may use different address/port to establish the SEALDD-S data transmission connection for application signalling transfer towards the VAL server for different SEALDD client and SEALDD flow. Then each VAL client will have different SEALDD-S data transmission connection at the SEALDD server side.\n8.\tThe SEALDD client uses the SEALDD traffic descriptor of SEALDD server side for SEALDD connection establishment.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the UE's address for SEALDD traffic transfer is different from the address used in the control plane interaction (step 5 and 6), another SEALDD interaction procedure may be triggered to notify the SEALDD server about the address/port used by the SEALDD client for SEALDD traffic transfer. Or the SEALDD server reuses the SEALDD client's address used in step 5 for SEALDD traffic transfer.\nAfter this step, the SEALDD client and SEALDD server both get the whole SEALDD traffic descriptor (including the UE's address/port and SEALDD server's address/port for the SEALDD traffic transmission). The SEALDD client gets the mapping information (i.e. SEALDD flow ID for the application signalling transfer). The SEALDD server gets the mapping information between the SEALDD flow ID, the signalling transmission Session ID and the SEALDD-S connection. The SEALDD client and SEALDD server store the mapping between the application traffic and SEALDD traffic.\nUpon receiving application signalling traffic from VAL client, the SEALDD client maps it into SEALDD traffic with SEALDD traffic descriptor as negotiated with SEALDD server. The SEALDD server maps the SEALDD traffic to the application traffic according to the stored SEALDD traffic descriptor, SEALDD client ID, SEALDD flow ID. The SEALDD server sends the recovered application traffic to VAL server via the connection established in step 7 according to the mapping relationship between the SEALDD-S connection and the SEALDD traffic.\nFor the downlink application signalling traffic in response to the uplink application signalling, the VAL server can respond to the source address/port (SEALDD-S address/port of the SEALDD server side) of the uplink signalling traffic. Upon receiving the downlink application signalling traffic from the SEALDD-S connection, the SEALDD server can map the downlink application signalling traffic to the related SEALDD client ID and SEALDD flow ID and send the mapped SEALDD traffic to the SEALDD client. The rest of the downlink application traffic transfer is processed similarly with the uplink traffic.\nAfter the connection establishment, the VAL server can communicate with VAL client for application layer signalling traffic transfer via the established SEALDD connection.\nFigure 9.2.2.2-1 illustrate the procedure for establishing regular SEALDD data transmission connection.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe VAL server can discover and select the SEALDD server by CAPIF functions.\nThe figure depicts the SEALDD (Secure End-to-End Link Downlink Data) enabled regular data transmission connection establishment procedure. It shows the steps involved in establishing a secure data transmission connection between two devices, with emphasis on the use of SEALDD for enhanced security.\nFigure 9.2.2.2-1: SEALDD enabled regular data transmission connection establishment procedure\n1.\tThe VAL server decides to use SEALDD service for application traffic transfer and allocates address/port as SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information for receiving the data packets from SEALDD server. The VAL server sends Sdd_RegularTransmission request to the SEALDD server discovered by CAPIF. The service request includes UE ID/address, VAL server ID, VAL service ID, SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information of the VAL server side, and optionally, the QoS information for the application traffic, e.g. QoS requirements.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, SEALDD server allocates address/port of the SEALDD server to receive the packets from the VAL server for application data transfer as SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side. The SEALDD server allocates a specific address or port used for SEALDD traffic transfer with the specific UE for the VAL server and responds with a SEALDD service response (including SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side). The VAL server and SEALDD server can use SEALDD-S data transmission connection information to establish the data transmission connection between VAL server and SEALDD server for application data transfer.\nThe SEALDD server may send the AF request to provide the required QoS information to 5GC via N33/N5, as defined in clause 5.2.6.9 and in clause 5.2.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6]. The AF request includes the application traffic descriptor containing the address or ports allocated by SEALDD server, and the QoS information for application traffic. The QoS information may be determined by SEALDD server according to VAL service ID for different service type of application traffic if the QoS information is not provided by VAL server. The SEALDD server relies on the northbound Policy Authorization Service API exposed by the PCF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [7], if the SEALDD server is connected to the PCF via the N5 reference point, or the northbound AF Session with QoS Service APIs and/or the PFD Management northbound APIs exposed by the NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [7], if the SEALDD server is connected to the PCF via NEF. SEALDD may also rely upon the EES Session with QoS API as specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] and/or the NRM QoS functionality as described in 3GPP TS 23.434 [4].\nNOTE 1:\tThe SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side is optional to respond to the VAL server, if the SEALDD server uses the downlink pull mode to obtain the data/content from the address provided by the VAL server in step 1, and uses the uplink push mode to send the data/content to the address provided by VAL server.\n3.\tData transmission session information is provisioned to the VAL client by the VAL server via application signalling.\nNOTE 2:\tThe application signalling may be transmitted via direct application layer connection or via the SEALDD layer.\n4.\tThe VAL client sends a SEALDD service request to SEALDD client. The VAL client receives a SEALDD service response to the SEALDD client. The response indicates that whether the SEALDD service request is successful or not.\n5.\tThe VAL/SEALDD client discover and select the proper SEALDD server for the VAL application, as described in clause 9.4.3. After this step, the VAL server is discovered and selected along with the associated SEALDD server, the SEALDD client can get the SEALDD server's address.\n6.\tThe SEALDD client allocates a SEALDD flow ID mapping to the identifiers of the application traffic. The SEALDD client sends Sdd_RegularTransmissionConnection_Establish request to SEALDD server with the SEALDD client ID, the SEALDD flow ID, the SEALDD traffic descriptor of the SEALDD client side (the address/port of the SEALDD client for receiving the downlink SEALDD traffic), VAL server ID, VAL service ID. The request message also contains the selected VAL server endpoint information and UEID.\nNOTE 3: The SEALDD server can use or update the association between SEALDD-UU connection and SEALDD-S connection that associated with UE ID, VAL service ID, VAL server endpoint, which is used to correlate the SEALDD traffic and the VAL application traffic.\nNOTE 4:\tThe SEALDD flow ID is used by the SEALDD client and SEALDD server to identify different VAL application traffic of the same SEALDD client. The SEALDD flow ID may be same with the identifiers of the application traffic or new simplified IDs allocated by SEALDD.\n7.\tThe SEALDD server responds to the SEALDD client with the SEALDD traffic descriptor of SEALDD server side (e.g. address/port allocated in step 2, transport layer protocol) mapping to the application traffic.\n8.\tIf the connection between VAL server and SEALDD server is not established in step 2, the SEALDD server establishes connection with VAL server for the VAL client to transmit application traffic mapping to the SEALDD traffic according to the SEALDD-S information negotiated in step 1-2.\n9.\tThe SEALDD client uses the SEALDD traffic descriptor of SEALDD server side for SEALDD connection establishment.\nAfter this step, the SEALDD client and SEALDD server both get the whole SEALDD traffic descriptor (including the UE's address/port and SEALDD server's address/port for the SEALDD traffic transmission).\nAfter the negotiation and establishment of the connections, the SEALDD client gets the mapping information between application traffic and SEALDD flow ID. The SEALDD server gets the mapping information between the SEALDD flow ID and the SEALDD-S connection. Upon receiving application traffic from VAL client, the SEALDD maps it to SEALDD traffic with SEALDD traffic descriptors as negotiated with SEALDD server in step 6 and step 7. The SEALDD traffic is sent to the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server maps the SEALDD traffic to the application traffic according to the stored SEALDD traffic descriptor, SEALDD client ID and SEALDD flow ID. The SEALDD server sends the recovered application traffic to the address provided by VAL server in step 1, via the connection established in step 2 or 8 according to the mapping information. The downlink application traffic sent from VAL server to VAL client is processed similarly.\nThe SEALDD servers has Data Delivery (DD) policy being provisioned. Before the application communication between VAL client and VAL server starts, the DD policy is enforced by the SEALDD server to establish the SEALDD connection.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe SEALDD server has DD policies available.\nThe figure depicts a policy enforced by SEALDD server for connectivity, with a focus on the role of the SEALDD server in ensuring network connectivity. The figure shows a network topology with various nodes, including the SEALDD server, which is responsible for enforcing policies related to network connectivity. The presence of the SEALDD server in the network topology indicates that it is a crucial component in ensuring network stability and security.\nFigure 9.2.2.3-1: Policy enforced by SEALDD server for connectivity\n1.\tThe VAL server subscribes to SEALDD event exposure for connection status.\n2.\tWhen the time for data transmission is about to start, the SEALDD server enforces the policy to trigger regular data transmission connection establishment. If spatial condition for UE is provided, the SEALDD server also ensures the UE’s location requirement is satisfied when establishing regular data transmission connection (e.g. by using NEF service for monitoring UE location or SEAL location service for UE entering area of interest).\n3.\tIf there is a special routing requirement for SEALDD user plane traffic (e.g. running on a specific slice and DNN), the SEALDD server interacts with 3GPP CN to provision service specific parameters with NEF as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6], clause 4.15.6.10 and clause 4.15.6.7.\nIf there are QoS requirements in the DD policy, the SEALDD server also applies QoS to ensure the quality for SEALDD traffic by utilizing NEF/PCF/NRM/EES service for QoS adjustment. Specifically, the SEALDD server relies on the northbound Policy Authorization Service API exposed by the PCF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [7], if the SEALDD server is connected to the PCF via the N5 reference point, or the northbound AF Session with QoS Service API and/or the PFD Management northbound APIs exposed by the NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [7], if the SEALDD server is connected to the PCF via NEF. SEALDD may also rely upon the EES Session with QoS API as specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] and/or the NRM QoS functionality as described in 3GPP TS 23.434 [4].\nIf the DD policy specifies failure detection report, the SEALDD server may subscribe to CN analytics (e.g. DN performance analytics) from NEF/NWDAF and further notify data delivery status of application traffic to VAL client (via SEALDD client) and VAL server based on analytics result.\n4.\tThe SEALDD server allocates an IP address and port for sending and receiving packet over SEAL-S reference point, then SEALDD server sends SEALDD connection establishment notification to the VAL server with VAL service ID, the IP address and port.\n5-6.\tThe SEALDD server allocates an IP address and port for sending and receiving packet over SEAL-Uu reference point, then SEALDD server sends regular data transmission connection establishment request to the SEALDD client with SEALDD flow ID, VAL service ID, the IP address and port. The request is responded by the SEALDD client. UE IP address (and port) may be included by the SEALDD client in the response or sent in a separate update message by SEALDD client if a different UE IP address is to be used in SEALDD connection user plane.\nNOTE 1:\tStep 4 and step 5 can be done in parallel.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 5 can be sent via PDU session (if exist) or via application triggering (if no PDU session exists).\n7.\tThe SEALDD client further notifies the VAL client about the SEALDD connection being established.\nUpon receiving application traffic from VAL client (not shown in the figure), the SEALDD client sends it to SEALDD server in SEALDD traffic. The SEALDD server identifies application traffic based on the VAL service ID and further sends the application traffic to VAL server. The downlink application traffic sent from VAL server to VAL client is processed similarly.\nThe figure depicts a 4G/LTE network with SEALDD enabled, showing regular data transmission connection deletion.\nFigure 9.2.2.4-1: SEALDD enabled regular data transmission connection deletion\n1.\tSEALDD server decides to remove the connection. Such a decision may be based on decision in SEALDD server in the following cases:\na.\tDD policy removal or validity time expiration;\nb.\tDD policy specified end time reached for SEALDD communication;\nc.\tUE is leaving the area of interest (if spatial condition for UE is provided in the policy).\n2-3.\tThe SEALDD server notifies SEALDD connection deletion to the VAL server. The VAL server removes the connection information. The application traffic is stopped on both sides.\n4-5.\tThe SEALDD server requests regular data transmission connection deletion to the SEALDD client. The request is responded by the SEALDD client. The application traffic is stopped on both sides.\nNOTE 1:\tStep 2 and step 4 can be done in parallel.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 5 can be sent via PDU session (if exist) or via application triggering (if no PDU session exists).\n6.\tThe SEALDD client further notifies the VAL client about the SEALDD connection being removed. The application traffic is stopped on both sides.\n7.\tIf a special routing requirement for SEALDD user plane traffic was provided to 3GPP CN, the SEALDD server interacts with 3GPP CN to remove service specific parameters with NEF as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6], clause 4.15.6.7.\n8.\tThe SEALDD server removes the SEALDD connection (i.e. deletes the SEALDD connection context).\nFigure 9.2.2.5-1 illustrates the procedure for SEALDD client initiated connection release procedure from the SEALDD client to the SEALDD server.\nThe figure depicts a client initiated connection release in the SEALDD protocol, which is a secure and reliable communication protocol used in the telecommunications industry. The figure shows the client initiating a connection, followed by the release of the connection, and finally the client disconnecting. The figure is important for understanding the flow of communication in SEALDD and the steps involved in a successful connection release.\nFigure 9.2.2.5-1: SEALDD client initiated connection release\n1.\tThe SEALDD client sends the SEALDD connection release request to the SEALDD server to release the established connection.\n2.\tThe SEALDD server releases the SEALDD-UU data transmission connection (which was established by SEALDD client or SEALDD server) and sends the response in the SEALDD connection release response message. Upon receiving the acknowledgement, the SEALDD client can release the connection resources.\n",

For uplink data delivery, VAL client sends application traffic to SEALDD client, the SEALDD client duplicates the application packets and maps them into two SEALDD traffic. Then the two SEALDD traffic are transferred to SEALDD server via the two redundant PDU sessions shown in figure 9.3.1-1.

This procedure can be triggered by a VAL server for data transfer per application layer transaction.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has discovered and selected the SEALDD server by CAPIF functions as specified in clause 9.4.2.\n2.\tThe VAL server has established application connection with the VAL client and can get the VAL client’s UE ID or UE address via the application connection.\nThe figure depicts the establishment of an E2E redundant transmission path, which is crucial for ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network. The path is established through the use of redundant optical fiber links, ensuring that the signal can be recovered in case of any failure. This is achieved through the use of redundant paths, which are shown in dashed lines, and the layered design of the network, aligning with SDN principles.\nFigure 9.3.2.1-1: E2E redundant transmission path establishment\n1.\tThe VAL server decides to use SEALDD service to help ensuring data transmission quality for application traffic transfer and send a Sdd_URLLCTransmission request to the SEALDD server discovered by CAPIF. The request includes UE ID/address, VAL server ID, VAL service ID, SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information of the VAL server side, and optionally, the QoS information for the application traffic, e.g. QoS requirements. The VAL server ID and VAL service ID can be used to identify the VAL application traffic.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server decides to establish redundant transmission path. The SEALDD server allocates two different addresses or ports for the two redundant transmission paths and sends an AF request to 5GS to create or update URSP rules as described in clause 4.15.6.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] for the UE(s) going to use the redundant transmission service. The AF request includes Identifiers of the UE(s) and application traffic descriptor containing the addresses or ports allocated by SEALDD server. The SEALDD server may send the AF request to provide the required QoS information to 5GC via N33/N5, as defined in clause 5.2.6.9 and in clause 5.2.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6].\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, SEALDD server allocates address/port of the SEALDD server to receive the packets from the VAL server for application data transfer as SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side. The SEALDD server responds with a SEALDD service response (including SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side) and indicates to the VAL server that redundant transmission service should be activated. The VAL server and SEALDD server can use SEALDD-S data transmission connection information to establish the data transmission connection between VAL server and SEALDD server for application data transfer.\n4.\tIf the redundant transmission requirement is not preconfigured or notified to the VAL client, the VAL server may notify the VAL client(s) which is going to use the redundant transmission service through application layer message.\nNOTE 1:\tThe application signalling may be transmitted via direct application layer connection or via the SEALDD layer.\nNOTE 2:\tThe VAL client can be preconfigured that the VAL service should always be transmitted via redundant transmission. Or this application layer notification may be notified to the UE in another period before the VAL application traffic is really transmitted.\n5.\tThe VAL client sends a SEALDD service request to use E2E redundant transmission for the application traffic.\n6.\tThe SEALDD client discovers and selects the proper SEALDD server for the VAL application as specified in clause 9.4.3. After this step, the SEALDD client can get the SEALDD server's address.\n7.\tThe SEALDD client allocates a SEALDD flow ID mapping to the application traffic. The SEALDD client sends Sdd_URLLCTransmissionConnection_Establish request to SEALDD server. The request includes the SEALDD client ID, SEALDD flow ID, VAL server ID, VAL service ID for SEALDD server to identify the specific application traffic.\n8.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server sends SEALDD traffic descriptor for redundant transmission of the SEALDD server side (i.e. the addresses or ports for the redundant transmission paths allocated in step 2 and the transport protocol used for the SEALDD traffic) to SEALDD client.\n9.\tThe UE uses the SEALDD traffic descriptor of the SEALDD server and the created or updated URSP rules to trigger two redundant PDU Sessions establishment procedure via 5GS as specified in clause 5.33.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\n10.\t[Optional] The SEALDD client sends Sdd_URLLCTransmissionConnection_Update request to SEALDD server. The request includes the SEALDD client ID, the SEALDD flow ID, the SEALDD traffic descriptors for redundant transmission of the SEALDD client side (i.e. UE addresses and ports of the two redundant PDU Sessions). The two redundant SEALDD traffic use the same SEALDD flow ID for identification.\n11.\t[Optional] The SEALDD server sends a response to SEALDD client. After this step, the SEALDD client and SEALDD server both get the whole SEALDD traffic descriptors (including the UE's addresses/ports and SEALDD server's addresses/ports for the SEALDD traffic transmission). The SEALDD client and SEALDD server store the mapping between the application traffic and SEALDD traffic.\n12.\t[Optional] If the connection between VAL server and SEALDD server is not established in step 3, the SEALDD server establishes connection with VAL server for the VAL client to transmit application traffic mapping to the redundant SEALDD traffic according to the SEALDD-S information negotiated in step 1-3\nNOTE 3:\tStep 10 and Step 11 are optional. If the redundant PDU sessions are already established before step 7, the IP addresses of the UE may be notified to the SEALDD server in step 7. In other cases, after the establishment of the two redundant PDU sessions, the SEALDD client may communicate with SEALDD server through the redundant PDU sessions to let the SEALDD server know the UE's address(es) of the redundant PDU session to fulfil the traffic mapping or the SEALDD client and SEALDD server may use other mapping mechanisms, it is up to the transport protocol used by SEALDD client and SEALDD server for the SEALDD traffic.\n13.\tThe SEALDD client responds with a SEALDD service response.\nAfter the negotiation and establishment of the connections, the SEALDD client gets the mapping information between the application traffic and SEALDD flow ID. The SEALDD server gets the mapping information between the SEALDD flow ID and the SEALDD-S connection. Upon receiving application traffic from VAL client, the SEALDD client duplicates the application packets and maps them into two SEALDD traffic flows with SEALDD traffic descriptors as negotiated with SEALDD server in step 8 and step 10. The two SEALDD traffic is sent through two redundant PDU sessions to the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server maps the two SEALDD traffic to the same application traffic according to the stored SEALDD traffic descriptors, SEALDD client ID and SEALDD flow ID. After packet elimination and reordering the SEALDD server sends the aggregated application traffic to VAL server via the connection established in step 3 according to the mapping information. The downlink application traffic sent from VAL server to VAL client is processed similarly.\nFigure 9.3.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for client initiated redundant transmission establishment for data transfer per application layer transaction.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe SEALDD client is authorized to request redundant transmission services on behalf of the VAL client when the VAL client initiates redundant transmission service.\nThe figure depicts a client-initiated E2E redundant transmission path establishment in a 5G network, illustrating the process of establishing a reliable and redundant communication path. The figure shows the client initiating the transmission, followed by the network's response, and finally the path being established. Key components include the client, network, and the path, with the client initiating the transmission and the network responding. The figure highlights the importance of redundancy in ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network.\nFigure 9.3.2.2-1: Client initiated E2E redundant transmission path establishment\n1.\tA VAL client determines to use SEALDD service to ensure that the data transmission quality for the application traffic is met and makes a service request to the SEALDD client.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD client decides to establish redundant transmission path according to the QoS requirements. The SEALDD client discovers and selects the proper SEALDD server for the VAL application as specified in clause 9.4.3.\n3.\tThe SEALDD client sends a request to the SEALDD server to configure redundant transport for the application traffic. The SEALDD client allocates a SEALDD flow ID mapping to the application traffic. The SEALDD client sends Sdd_URLLCTransmissionConnection_Establish request to SEALDD server. The request includes the SEALDD client ID, the SEALDD flow ID, the application ID, the UE ID/address, the VAL server ID/address, the QoS requirements, the UE location, and a request for redundant transport.\n4.\tThe SEALDD server allocates IP addresses and ports for the redundant transport paths and initiates the application guidance for URSP determiniation procedure with the 5G network to create or update URSP rules for the UE, as described in clause 4.15.6.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6]. The request includes the UE ID and application traffic descriptor containing the addresses or ports allocated by SEALDD server. The UE receives the new or updated URSP rules from the 5G core network.\n5.\tThe SEALDD server responds to the SEALDD client providing the configuration status. The response includes the IP addresses and ports for the redundant transmission paths allocated in step 4. The SEALDD client and SEALDD server store the mapping between the application traffic and SEALDD traffic.\n6.\tThe UE establishes redundant PDU sessions with the 5G network using the new or updated URSP rules as specified in clause 5.33.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\n7.\t[Optional] The SEALDD client sends Sdd_URLLCTransmissionConnection_Update request to SEALDD server. The request includes the SEALDD client ID, the SEALDD flow ID, the application traffic descriptors for redundant transmission of the SEALDD client side (i.e. UE addresses and ports of the two redundant PDU Sessions). The two redundant SEALDD traffic use the same SEALDD flow ID for identification.\n8.\t[Optional] The SEALDD server establishes connection with VAL server for the VAL client to transmit application traffic mapping to the redundant SEALDD traffic. The SEALDD server sends a response to the SEALDD client. After this step, the SEALDD client and SEALDD server both get the application traffic descriptors (including the UE's addresses/ports and SEALDD server's addresses/ports for the SEALDD traffic transmission). The SEALDD client and SEALDD server store the mapping between the application traffic and SEALDD traffic.\n9.\tThe SEALDD client responds with a SEALDD service response.\nNOTE:\tDetails of the VAL client service request in step 1 and the corresponding response in step 9 are out of scope of the current specification.\nThe VAL client sends application traffic to the SEALDD client, which duplicates the application data on the redundant PDU sessions. The SEALDD server receives the redundant traffic and reassembles the data to send to the VAL server. Similarly, the SEALDD server duplicates downlink traffic from the VAL server and sends the data to the SEALDD client on the redundant PDU sessions. The SEALDD client eliminates the redundant data and reassembles data to send to the VAL client.\n",

The request includes the VAL service ID and the data length.\n2.\tThe SEALDD server checks for the authorization of the storage service Creation request. If the request is successfully authorized, then the SEALDD server allocates and reserves the address for data storage.\n3.\tThe SEALDD server sends a response to the requesting consumer (e.g. SEALDD client, VAL server). The response indicates if the request is accepted and the address for data storage. Upon receiving the response, the stored data may be delivered via push mode from the requesting consumer to the SEALDD server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tVAL client/server has stored data in SEALDD server.\n2.\tThe consumer (e.g. SEALDD client/VAL server/other SEALDD server) requesting the stored data has got the identifier of the stored data (e.g. via application layer signalling or other mechanisms).\nThe figure depicts a network architecture with multiple layers, including a storage server (SEALDD) and a client-server architecture. The storage server is accessed through a client-server model, with the client-server model being a key component of the network's architecture.\nFigure 9.5.2.3-1: Access to stored data in SEALDD server\n1.\tThe consumer (e.g. SEALDD client/VAL server/other SEALDD server) sends a Sdd_DataStorage_Query request to the SEALDD server with the identifier of the stored data.\nNOTE:\tThe consumer requesting for the stored data can be the data storage creator or other network functions.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check to verify if the requested data (according to the data access control policy) can be accessed by the consumer. The SEALDD server will also check whether the stored data is expired.\n3.\tIf the verification was successful, the SEALDD server responds with the requested data.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe SEALDD service is configured to track and maintain data storage access information (i.e. status information).\n2.\tA storage service creation request procedure from the consumer (e.g. SEALDD client, VAL server) to the SEALDD server has been performed. The request includes a subscription to data storage access information (i.e. status information).\nThe figure depicts a storage management procedure, illustrating the steps involved in managing storage resources in a network. It shows the storage nodes, storage controllers, and storage arrays, with various interfaces and protocols for data transfer and management. The figure highlights the importance of data protection and security measures, such as encryption and access control.\nFigure 9.5.2.4-1: Storage management procedure\n1.\tBased on the received stored data status information, the requesting consumer (e.g. SEALDD client, VAL server) determines to perform a management operation, such as to update, refresh, or delete the stored data. The VAL client/server sends a Sdd_DataStorage_Management request to the SEALDD server to perform the determined management operation.\n2.\tThe SEALDD server processes the storage management request. If the request is accepted, the SEALDD server performs the required management operation on the stored data.\nNOTE:\tBased on the data management or storage status information available in SEALDD server as per the procedure in clause 9.5.2.1, the SEALDD server may send a notification to the requester (e.g. SEALDD client, VAL server) with the collected management or storage status information.\n3.\tThe SEALDD server sends a response to the requesting consumer (e.g. SEALDD client, VAL server) with the result of the management operation, which may include updated information of the stored data.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe source VAL server already obtains the serving target SEALDD server of the target VAL server.\n2.\tThe source VAL server may have stored data to the source SEALDD server and obtained the identifier of the stored data by invoking Sdd_DataStorage_Creation API in clause 9.5.2.1.\nThe figure depicts a detailed storage transfer procedure between VAL servers, illustrating the steps involved in data transfer between the servers. The diagram shows the data flow from the source server to the destination server, with each step clearly labeled and annotated. This figure is crucial for understanding the storage system's operation and for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.\nFigure 9.5.2.5-1: Stored data transfer procedure between VAL servers\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a SEALDD data storage delivery subscription request to its serving SEALDD server with the VAL server information, and the VAL server address to receive the stored data delivery.\n2.\tThe SEALDD sever responds to the requested VAL server with the subscription result, if successful, the response includes the subscription ID, expiration time.\n3.\tThe source VAL server determines to use the stored data transfer service provided by the serving SEALDD server. The source VAL server invokes a SEALDD data storage delivery request, the request includes the identifier of the stored data needed to be delivered, or the stored data (i.e., the source VAL server does not use data storage creation to store data to the source SEALDD server before), the target VAL server information and the target SEALDD server information.\n4.\tThe source SEALDD server sends a SEALDD delivery connection establish request towards the target SEALDD server with the source SEALDD server information, the target VAL server information, and the supporting transport layer protocols for data delivery.\n5.\tThe target SEALDD server responds to the source SEALDD server with the traffic descriptor of target SEALDD server (e.g. address/port, transport layer protocol). The target SEALDD server may allocate the storage for the target VAL server.\nNOTE: \tThe transport layer protocol between SEALDD server connection can be different depending on the specific application scenarios, compared with the connection between SEALDD client and SEALDD server in clause 9.2.\n6.\tUpon receiving the traffic descriptor of target SEALDD server, the source SEALDD server sends the requested data corresponding to the identifier of the stored data to the target SEALDD server.\n7.\tThe source SEALDD server responds to the source VAL server with the result of data delivery.\n8.\tThe target SEALDD server sends the received data to the target VAL server via the notification message. Optionally, the target SEALDD server may only send the identifier of the received data to the target VAL server in the notification message, the target VAL server can obtain the stored data originated from the source VAL server, by invoking the Sdd_DataStorage_Query API to the target SEALDD server, as specified in clause 9.5.2.2.\n",

If SEALDD is not adapted to EDGEAPP, for UE mobility, the SEALDD client can discover (e.g. using DNS) a new SEALDD server in the target area and establish a new SEALDD communication channel including the old SEALDD communication channel information. For load re-balance, the SEALDD server can discover (e.g. using DNS) an equivalent SEALDD server and communicate with the new SEALDD server.\nBased on existing service continuity mechanism supported by 3GPP core network (e.g. BP/ULCL), during SEALDD server relocation with UPF change, the new UPF takes care of the existing unfinished application traffic flow towards the old VAL server and inter-UPF tunnel is used to forward the traffic. For new application traffic flow which may have UE's new IP address as source IP address, the new SEALDD server sends it directly to the new VAL server.\nFor SEALDD server relocation, the inter-SEALDD server communication via SEALDD-E reference point is needed, which transfers the SEALDD context from the old SEALDD server to the new SEALDD server.\nThe following procedures detail the EDGEAPP ACT part between old SEALDD server (i.e. S-EAS) and new SEALDD server (i.e. T-EAS) as described in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10], clause 8.8.2.2 to clause 8.8.2.6. Also, a high-level flow is provided to show the scenario used in EDN.\nNOTE 1:\tThe way to provide SEALDD server endpoint can be via VAL server or via EES, and discovery of the new SEALDD server can utilize procedure described in clause 9.4. The ACT procedure in the VAL server is also executed according to EDGEAPP ACR scenario but its detail is out of scope of SA6.\nNOTE 2: \tThe SEALDD context scope (e.g. service level and/or UE level) has the same granularity with SEALDD transmission request information in clause 9.2.3.1.\nNOTE 3:  How context synchronization is performed between SEALDD server and VAL server in context transfer is out of scope in this document.\n",

The diagram shows the flow of data from the source to the destination, with various network elements such as routers, switches, and firewalls. The figure highlights the importance of network segmentation and the use of network functions virtualization (NFV) to improve network performance and efficiency.\nFigure 9.6.2.1-1: SEALDD context transfer\nThe transferred SEALDD context includes the service subscription information created upon VAL server's interaction for requesting SEALDD transmission service (e.g. step 1 and 2 in Figure 9.2.2.1-1), and also the SEALDD client and SEALDD server communication tunnel management information (e.g. UE IP address) which is created upon SEALDD client's interaction for requesting data transmission (e.g. step 5 and 6 in Figure 9.2.2.1-1). If new SEALDD server supports transportation layer service continuity, additional transport layer context (e.g. TCP/TLS/QUIC) is transferred from old SEALDD server to new SEALDD server. If the new SEALDD Server is not provisioned with the VAL server configured SEALDD policy, then it can pull from the Old SEALDD server via the pull operation. The push operation does not support the transfer of the VAL server configured SEALDD policy between Old and New SEALDD server.\nThe new SEALDD server, after receiving the SEALDD context from the old SEALDD server, allocates IP address and port for SEALDD-Uu user plane communication. The new SEALDD server also sends back to the old SEALDD server with the allocated endpoint information If operation is push. Then the old SEALDD server can request 5GC to perform IP replacement procedure, as defined in clause 6.3.3 of 3GPP 23.548 [8]. The request includes the traffic descriptor of old SEALDD server (i.e., SEALDD-UU address/port), the traffic descriptor of new SEALDD server (i.e., SEALDD-UU address/port) and/or the target DNAI.\nOptionally, after receiving the SEALDD context with the SEALDD-UU endpoint from the old SEALDD server, the new SEALDD server can request 5GC to perform IP replacement procedure.\nNOTE:\tThe TCP/TLS/QUIC context transfer is required to support the SEALDD server relocation with IP replacement procedure, as described in clause 9.6.2.2.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tVAL Server 1 and 2 are adapted to the EDGEAPP as EAS.\n2.\tVAL Server 1 and 2 register its associated SEALDD server in EES as described in clause 9.4.3.2.\n\nThe figure depicts a schematic representation of the SEALDD (Service-Enhanced ULTRA-Low-Latency Data) support for UE's service continuity, highlighting the various components and their interconnections. The figure illustrates the network's architecture, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the network's physical infrastructure. The diagram also shows the use of redundancy paths to ensure reliability and failover capabilities.\nFigure 9.6.2.2-1: SEALDD support of UE's service continuity\n1.\tAn application client on a UE, acting as a VAL client, establishes a SEALDD flow over SEALDD-UU to send application data to VAL Server 1. SEALDD client and SEALD server 1 maintain SEALDD flow information (e.g., SEALDD flow ID, VAL IDs/addresses, VAL requirements).\n2.\tApplication data is sent via the SEALDD flow between the VAL Client and VAL Server 1.\n3.\tThe UE moves and generates a mobility event in the 5GC.\n4.\tThe UE's mobility event triggers the execution of an Application Context Relocation (ACR) procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10]; or VAL server 1 triggers ACR due to load re-balancing reason. Any of the ACR scenarios detailed in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] clauses 8.8.2.2-8.8.2.6 may occur. In this step, the first three phases of the ACR procedure are performed, up to ACT. In this step VAL Server 1 acts as EAS 1 and VAL Server 2 as EAS 2, therefore participating in corresponding signaling. VAL server 2 has been selected as SEALDD-enabled server meeting the ACR criteria to be the target EAS. The associated SEALDD server 2 has also been selected and may support transportation layer (e.g. UDP/TCP/QUIC) service continuity.\n5a.\tBefore triggering ACT, VAL Server 1 sends a SEALDD notification of ACR event to SEALDD Server 1.\n5b. Before triggering ACT, VAL Server 2 sends a SEALDD notification of ACR event to SEALDD Server 2.\n6a.\tSEALDD server 1 transfers the SEALDD context to the SEALDD server 2 which serves VAL Server 2 as described in clause 9.6.2.1, with push operation. The SEALDD server 1 can obtain the SEALDD server 2 endpoint for SEALDD-Uu user plane to the SEALDD client, as specified in clause 9.6.2.1.\n6b. SEALDD server 2 can obtain the SEALDD context from the SEALDD server 1 by using the pull operation, as described in clause 9.6.2.1.\n7.\tSEALDD server 1 applies the functionality specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] clause 5.2.6.7 for AF traffic influence, providing the N6 routing information for the SEALDD client and SEALDD server 2. The SEALDD server 1 may:\n-\tIf the SEALDD server 2 supports transportation layer service continuity, additionally includes SEALDD IP replacement information (i.e. SEALDD server 1 endpoint and SEALDD server 2 endpoint for SEALDD-Uu user plane) in the AF traffic influence. Since the UE is not aware of SEALDD server change, the new SEALDD traffic (due to new VAL traffic sent by VAL client) is sent by UPF towards the new SEALDD server, this handling in UPF is agnostic to the SEALDD server 2. Or,\n-\tsend AF traffic influence with target DNAI of SEALDD server 2, and simultaneous connectivity indicator, to request 5GC to maintain the simultaneous connectivity over source PSA and target PSA with source SEALDD server and target SEALDD server, as described in clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.548 [8].\n8.\tIf the SEALDD server 2 has no transportation layer service continuity support, a SEALDD Connection info update notification is sent to SEALDD client, e.g. to update the allocated IP address and port for SEALDD-Uu user plane communication. Then the SEALDD client acknowledges the received SEALDD Connection info update notification. After SEALDD client is aware of the new SEALDD-Uu IP address and port, it starts to send new SEALDD traffic (received from the VAL client) over the new connection. The new SEALDD server maps the received SEALDD traffic to the application traffic according to the SEALDD traffic descriptor and VAL service ID. The new SEALDD server sends the recovered application traffic to new VAL server. The downlink application traffic sent from the new VAL server to VAL client is processed similarly.\n9.\tSEALDD Server 1 notifies VAL Server 1 of the completion of the SEALDD flow transfer.\n10.\tVAL Server 1 (acting as EAS1) and VAL Server 2 (acting as EAS 2) execute the Application Context Transfer (ACT) procedure step corresponding to the pending ACR scenario (3GPP TS 23.558 [10] clauses 8.8.2.2-8.8.2.6), which is out the 3GPP scope.\n11.\tThe post-ACR clean-up phase is executed, as described in the corresponding ACR scenario (3GPP TS 23.558 [10] clauses 8.8.2.2-8.8.2.6).\n12.\tThe application data from the VAL Client is sent via the SEALDD flow (with SEALDD server 2) to VAL Server 2.\nNOTE:\tThe SEALDD-UU client endpoint of the SEALDD flow in this step is maintained the same as in step 1\n",

The SEALDD client and SEALDD server is enhanced to carry out the data transmission quality measurement.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe SEALDD server and SEALDD client are synchronized to the time source provided by 5GS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\n2.\tThe VAL server discovers and selects the SEALDD server by CAPIF functions.\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for measuring the data transmission quality of SEALDD (Software-Defined Networking) enabled networks. The procedure includes various steps such as setting up the measurement environment, configuring the measurement equipment, and conducting the measurement. The results of the measurement are presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the performance of the network.\nFigure 9.7.2.1-1: SEALDD enabled data transmission quality measurement procedure\n1.\tAn on-going regular data transmission connection is established according to clause 9.2.2.2.\n2.\tThe VAL server sends a SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request to the SEALDD server. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), requirement of transmission quality measurement (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate, packet loss rate) and measurement target UE (e.g. a single UE, a group of UEs or all UEs), and may also include reporting criteria, reporting frequency, spatial condition and temporal condition.\nNOTE:\tThe spatial and/or temporal condition can be used by SEALDD server to apply when and where the measurement is performed. For instance, the measurement is expected to be done for a group of VAL UEs with a scheduled route (from city A to city B via highway A2 and A3), from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.\n3.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, the SEALDD server sends a response to the VAL server with the subscription ID, expiration time.\n4.\tIf the transmission quality measurement requirement list provided by VAL server in step 2, indicates that the latency is needed to be measured, the SEALDD server initiates the DL packet delay measurement. The SEALDD server encapsulates the DL monitoring packet (i.e. DL SEALDD packet with SEALDD DL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload, or dummy DL SEALDD packet generated for data transmission quality monitoring) with local time T1 when the SEALDD server sends out the DL monitoring packets. The SEALDD server considers the spatial and/or temporal conditions when starting/resuming the transmission quality measurement. If the conditions are not satisfied, the SEALDD server stops/suspends the transmission quality measurement.\nNOTE:\tFor other metrics in transmission quality measurement requirement list (e.g. bitrate), the transmission quality result can be obtained by performance detection on the SEALDD server within a period of time.\n5.\tThe SEALDD client receives the DL monitoring packet, and records the local time T2.\n6.\tSimilarly, the SEALDD client encapsulates the UL monitoring packet (i.e. UL SEALDD packet with SEALDD UL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload, or dummy UL SEALDD packet generated for data transmission quality monitoring) with local time T2 recorded in step 5 and local time T3 when the SEALDD client sends out the UL monitoring packet.\n7.\tThe SEALDD server records the local time T4 when the SEALDD server receives the UL monitoring packet and calculates the latency with T1, T2, T3, T4. The SEALDD server can also calculate the bitrate, jitter and packet loss rate over a certain period over a specific SEALDD connection by recording the status of the SEALDD packets carrying VAL traffic or dummy SEALDD packets generated for transmission quality measurement reports. The SEAL DD server also evaluates the reporting criteria if present in the SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request in order to generate the transmission quality measurement report.\n8.\tThe SEALDD server reports the data transmission quality measurement results (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate, packet loss rate) to the VAL server via the notification message.\nWhen a VAL group ID or a list of VAL UE IDs or all VAL UEs indication is received in step 2, step 4 to step 7 is repeated for VAL UEs in the group/list or for all VAL UEs. The SEALDD server maps the VAL UE group ID to a list of VAL UE IDs if a VAL group ID is received. The SEALDD server identifies SEALDD connections corresponding to the desired VAL UE(s) to trigger measurement. And depending on the reporting requirement for multiple UEs, the SEALDD server calculates the needed report for the VAL server. When the VAL server decides to update or unsubscribe transmission quality measurement subscription after performing step 2 and step 3, the VAL server can send data transmission quality measurement subscription update request and data transmission quality measurement unsubscribe request to SEALDD server, as specified in Table 9.7.3.9-1 and Table 9.7.3.11-1, respectively.\nFigure 9.7.2.2-1 illustrate the procedure for SEALDD enabled data transmission quality query. This procedure is used to obtain the historical transmission quality result already measured as described in clause 9.7.2.1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe SEALDD server performs the data transmission quality measurement procedure, as described in clause 9.7.2.1.\n\nThe figure depicts a SEALDD (Software-Defined Networking) enabled data transmission quality query procedure. It illustrates the steps involved in monitoring and managing network performance, including the use of SEALDD to enable data transmission quality monitoring and control. The figure includes a flowchart, which outlines the process from start to finish, and a list of steps, providing a clear and concise overview of the procedure.\nFigure 9.7.2.2-1: SEALDD enabled data transmission quality query procedure\n1. The consumers (e.g. VAL server, SEALDD server, NSCE server, ADAE server) can send a SEALDD transmission quality query request to the SEALDD server to obtain the transmission quality measurement result. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), VAL UE ID or VAL UE group ID.\n2. The SEALDD server responds with the transmission quality measurement result (e.g. packet delay, bitrate, packet loss rate).\nFigure 9.7.2.3-1 illustrate the procedure for SEALDD enabled data transmission quality measurement for VAL traffic. The SEALDD client receives transmission quality measurement requirement, decides to start VAL data transmission monitoring and generates measurement reports.\nThe figure depicts a VAL data transmission quality measurement report from a SEALDD client, which is a tool used to measure the quality of data transmission in a 5G network. The report includes various metrics such as packet loss, jitter, and delay, which are crucial for ensuring reliable and high-quality data transmission. The figure also shows the client's network configuration, including the number of base stations (BSs) and the number of users, which are essential for managing the network efficiently. Overall, the figure provides valuable insights into the performance of the 5G network and the tools used to monitor and improve it.\nFigure 9.7.2.3-1: VAL data transmission quality measurement reported by SEALDD client\n1.\tAn on-going regular data transmission connection is established according to clause 9.2.2.2.\nThe transmission quality measurement can be triggered by VAL server or VAL client, which is described in step 2 to step 5 and step 6, correspondingly.\n2.\tThe VAL server sends a SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request to the SEALDD server. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), requirement of transmission quality measurement (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate) and measurement target UE (e.g. a single UE, a group of UEs or all UEs), and may also include reporting criteria, reporting frequency, spatial condition and temporal condition.\nNOTE 1:\tThe spatial and/or temporal condition can be used by SEALDD client to apply when and where the measurement is performed. For instance, the measurement is expected to be done for a group of VAL UEs with a scheduled route (from city A to city B via highway A2 and A3), from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.\n3.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, the SEALDD server responds to the VAL server.\n4-5.\tThe SEALDD server sends a SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request to the SEALDD client and the SEALDD client responds to the SEALDD server. The SEALDD client, based on the received service quality guarantee policy including thresholds and action, can take corrective action as described in clause 9.7.2.3.\n6.\tThe VAL client triggers the SEALDD transmission quality measurement procedure to the SEALDD client, in order to collect the measurement report information.\n7.\tAfter SEALDD client determines to start measurement process, upon UL packet arrival, the SEALDD client initiates the UL packet delay measurement. The SEALDD client encapsulates the UL monitoring packet (i.e. UL SEALDD packet with SEALDD UL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload for VAL data transmission quality monitoring) with local time T1 when the SEALDD client sends out the UL monitoring packet. The SEALDD client considers the spatial and/or temporal conditions when starting/resuming the transmission quality measurement. If the conditions are not satisfied, the SEALDD client stops/suspends the transmission quality measurement.\n8.\tThe SEALDD server receives the UL monitoring packet, and records the local time T2.\n9.\tSimilarly, the SEALDD server encapsulates the DL monitoring packet (i.e. DL SEALDD packet with SEALDD DL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload, or dummy UL SEALDD packet generated for data transmission quality monitoring in case there is no DL VAL traffic for DL packet delay monitoring) with local time T2 recorded in step 8 and local time T3 when the SEALDD server sends out the DL monitoring packet.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the SEALDD server sends the dummy UL packet as monitoring response to the SEALDD client depends on SEALDD server implementation.\n10.\tThe SEALDD client records the local time T4 when the SEALDD client receives the DL monitoring packet and calculates the latency with T1, T2, T3, T4. The SEALDD client can also calculate the bitrate and jitter over a certain period over a specific SEALDD connection by recording the status of the SEALDD monitoring packets. The SEALDD client also evaluates the reporting criteria if present in the SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request in order to generate the transmission quality measurement report.\nDepending on which entity triggers the data transmission quality measurement, step 11 and step 12 corresponds to step 2 to step 5, step 13 corresponds to step 6.\n11-12.\tThe SEALDD client reports the data transmission quality measurement results (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate) to the VAL server via the SEALDD server.\n13.\tThe SEALDD client reports the data transmission quality measurement results to the VAL client.\nWhen a VAL group ID or a list of VAL UE IDs or all VAL UEs indication is received in step 2, step 4 to step 11 is repeated for VAL UEs in the group/list or for all VAL UEs. The SEALDD server maps the VAL UE group ID to a list of VAL UE IDs if a VAL group ID is received. The SEALDD server identifies SEALDD connections corresponding to the desired VAL UE(s) to trigger measurement. And depending on the reporting requirement for multiple UEs, the SEALDD server collects and aggregates the needed report for the VAL server.\n",

Figure 9.8.2-1 illustrates the procedure for bandwidth control for different VAL users.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has discovered and selected the SEALDD server by CAPIF functions as specified in clause 9.4.2.\n2. The SEALDD server has subscribed to 5GC for QoS monitoring of the specific UE related to the VAL user, as defined in clause 5.2.6.9 in 3GPP TS 23.502 [6].\n3. The SEALDD policy (i.e, the bandwidth control policy) has been configured in SEALDD server, as described in clause 9.10.\nThe figure depicts a SEALDD (Software-Defined Networking) enabled bandwidth control transmission procedure, illustrating the steps involved in managing network bandwidth. The figure includes various components such as the network interface controller (NIC), network function virtualization (NFV), and network virtualization (NV). The figure also highlights the use of software-defined networking (SDN) to control the network's bandwidth, allowing for efficient and flexible network management.\nFigure 9.8.2-1: SEALDD enabled bandwidth control transmission procedure\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a Sdd_regularTransmission request to the SEALDD server. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), the VAL server’s total bandwidth limit and the bandwidth limits (i.e. minimum bandwidth requirement and maximum bandwidth limit) for VAL users.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, the SEALDD server sends a response to the VAL server.\n3.\tThe VAL client sends a SEALDD service request to SEALDD client.\n4.\tThe VAL/SEALDD client discover and select the proper SEALDD server for the VAL application. After this step, the VAL server is discovered and selected along with the associated SEALDD server, the SEALDD client can get the SEALDD server's address.\n5.\tThe SEALDD client sends Sdd_RegularTransmissionConnection_Establish request to SEALDD server with the SEALDD client ID, the VAL user or UE identity.\n6.\tThe SEALDD server performs bandwidth limit check according to the VAL user’s bandwidth limit, the current SEALDD traffic delivery status, the VAL server’s total bandwidth limit and/or the related UE’s current network status (i.e. via QoS monitoring report from the 5GC). If the available bandwidth (i.e. the remaining bandwidth that can be used for the VAL user without exceeding the VAL server’s total bandwidth limit) cannot meet the VAL user’s minimum bandwidth requirement, the SEALDD server will reject the SEALDD client’s connection establishment request.\n7.\tWhen the available bandwidth can meet the VAL user’s requirement, the SEALDD client can establish the SEALDD connection with the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server can calculate the suggested traffic transmission bandwidth to the SEALDD client according to the VAL user’s bandwidth limit and the related UE’s current network status (i.e. via QoS monitoring report or ECN marking for L4S report from the 5GC).\n8.\tIf the bandwidth limit check is failed (i.e., the available bandwidth cannot meet the VAL user’s minimum bandwidth requirement) in step 6, the SEALDD server can send Sdd_RegularTransmissionConnection_Establish response with the failed result (i.e., reject the connection establishment) and the pending timer to trigger the re-connection from SEALDD client. If the bandwidth limit check is successful (i.e., the available bandwidth can meet the VAL user’s requirement) in step 6, the SEALDD server can send Sdd_RegularTransmissionConnection_Establish response with the successful result and/or the suggested traffic transmission bandwidth.\nNOTE:\tThe SEALDD server can re-allocate the available bandwidth resource to different VAL users according to the configured bandwidth control policy, as described in clause 9.10.\nIf the connection establishment is rejected, the SEALDD client can re-establish SEALDD connection by performing steps 5-8, when the pending timer is expired.\nFor the uplink application traffic, the SEALDD client can buffer or drop some packets when the uplink traffic from VAL client exceeds the suggested traffic transmission bandwidth. Similarly, for the downlink application traffic, the SEALDD server can buffer or drop some packet when the downlink traffic from VAL server exceeds the suggested traffic transmission bandwidth.\n",

It outlines the steps to switch the SEALDD server, which is crucial for managing network traffic and ensuring reliable data transmission. The figure includes a flowchart and a list of steps, providing a clear and concise guide for network administrators to follow.\nFigure 9.9.2.1-1: SEALDD enabled data transmission quality guarantee procedure by switching SEALDD server\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a Sdd_RegularTransmission request to the SEALDD server, as specified in clause 9.2.2.2. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), and optionally, the QoS information for the application traffic, e.g. QoS requirements.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, the SEALDD server sends a response to the VAL server. The QoS information may be allocated by SEALDD server according to VAL service ID for different service type of application traffic if the QoS information is not provided by VAL server.\n3.\tThe regular data transmission connection is established according to clause 9.2.2.2.\n4.\tThe S-SEALDD server (i.e., SEALDD server#1) can generate the transmission quality measurement report according to the SEALDD enabled transmission quality measurement procedure in clause 9.7.2.1, and detect whether the current transmission quality can satisfy the QoS requirements of VAL application.\n5.\tThe S-SEALDD server subscribes to 5GC for QoS monitoring of the specific UE related to the VAL user, as defined in clause 5.2.6.9 in 3GPP TS 23.502 6]. If the S-SEALDD server diagnoses that QoS deterioration is caused by N6/SEALDD overload (i.e., based on QoS monitoring between UE and UPF, and the E2E transmission quality measurement). The S-SEALDD server can determine to trigger the data transmission quality guarantee procedure (i.e., switching the connected SEALDD server according to SEALDD service policy) based on the QoS monitoring and E2E transmission quality measurement.\nNOTE 1:\tThe QoS monitoring subscription request may be triggered after step 4 when the current transmission quality cannot satisfy the QoS requirements of VAL application.\nNOTE 2:\tThis procedure cannot solve the QoS deterioration issue caused by NG-RAN (e.g. RAN congestion).\n6.\tThe S-SEALDD server performs target SEALDD server discovery procedure by using EEL, as specified in clause 9.4.\n7.\tThe S-SEALDD server can select the T-SEALDD server (i.e., SEALDD server #2) based on N6 traffic and/or SEALDD server load from performance of the available target SEALDD servers in step 6.\n8.\tThe SEALDD relocation procedure is performed for the switched SEALDD servers and the switched VAL servers, as specified in clause 9.6.2.2.\nAfter the SEALDD relocation procedure, the SEALDD client can connect to the selected T-SEALDD server to obtain the data transmission quality guarantee service (i.e. the QoS requirements of VAL application can be satisfied).\nFigure 9.9.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure of using redundant transmission as the action to meet connection reliability requirements specified by a SEALDD service policy.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA SEALDD service policy, which includes data transmission quality guarantees, is available to SEALDD server. The policy can be used to configure measurements and determine the necessary SEALDD layer actions for meeting the service policy requirements.\n2. The SEALDD Client is authorized to request redundant transport services on behalf of the VAL client.\nThe figure depicts a SEALDD data transmission quality guarantee with redundant transmission, illustrating the importance of redundancy in ensuring reliable data transmission.\nFigure 9.9.2.2-1: SEALDD data transmission quality guarantee with redundant transmission\n1.\tA VAL client and server establish a SEALDD connection to transport the application data. As part of the connection establishment, the SEALDD service policy in precondition 1 is shared so that it is available to both the SEALDD client and the SEALDD Server. The SEALDD Server may use the data transmission quality requirements of this policy in conjunction with other local policies pre-provisioned at the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server determines whether to start data transmission quality measurement by itself or by the SEALDD client. As a result, SEALDD measurements (e.g. packet loss rate, latency) are configured either at the SEALDD client as described in clause 9.7.2.3 or at the SEALDD server as described in clause 9.7.2.1 and started accordingly. Then either the SEALDD client or server receives measurement reports.\n2.\tBased on measurement reports and the SEALDD service policy, depending on the which entity started the measurement, either the SEALDD client or server determines to perform an action so that the data transmission quality requirements of the policy are met.\n3.\tSpecifically, if the measurement was started by the SEALDD client, the SEALDD client triggers the establishment of redundant transmission services. If the measurement was started by the SEALDD server, the SEALDD server triggers the establishment of redundant transmission services by sending a Transmission quality management request to the SEALDD client requesting to establish redundant transmission path.\nNOTE:\tThe request can be sent to SEALDD client via Application Triggering (specified in clause 4.13.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6]) with payload indicating a trigger of a redundant connection setup for SEALDD packet transmission.\n4.\tThe SEALDD client uses steps 6 to 9 of the procedure in clause 9.3.2.1 to request the use of redundant transmission service from the SEALDD server. As part of this step, the UE may end the initial PDU session and establish redundant PDU sessions.\n5.\tThe SEALDD client updates the SEALDD connection with the redundant transmission information, i.e., the UE addresses and ports for the redundant PDU sessions, the SEALDD flow identifier, and the application traffic descriptors. The SEALDD client or server also configures the parameters for enabling any necessary SEALDD measurements for the new SEALDD flow.\n6.\tThe SEALDD server may subscribe to receive notifications from the 5G network for user plane measurements (e.g., the network latency requirements specified in 3GPP TS 28.541 [12]), network analytics (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [11], etc.).\n7.\tThe SEALDD client and server handle data duplication and elimination of application traffic on the redundant SEALDD flows and the necessary measurements are collected by the SEALDD client or server.\nWhen the SEALDD measurement results indicating that the SEALDD data transmission has good performance according to policy guarantee threshold, if the measurement was started by the SEALDD client, the SEALDD client may release one transmission path and return back to single SEALDD connection mode, otherwise the SEALDD server may send a Transmission quality management request to the SEALDD client requesting to use single transmission, then the SEALDD client releases one transmission path and returns to single SEALDD connection mode.\n",

            "description": "MSGin5G functionalities described in 3GPP TS 23.554 [9] are integrated in SEALDD enabler layer. As shown in Figure B.2-1, MSGin5G client functionality is integrated in SEALDD client, and MSGin5G server functionality is integrated in SEALDD server. SEALDD server and SEALDD client can use MSGin5G functionalities to send SEALDD traffic in MSGin5G message format.\nThe figure depicts a simplified representation of the SEALDD (Signal Enhancement and Load Reduction) technique used in 5G networks. It illustrates the process of signal enhancement and load reduction, which is crucial for improving the quality of service (QoS) in 5G networks. The figure shows the use of multiple signal paths, including the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, to enhance the signal quality. The figure also highlights the use of load reduction techniques, such as beamforming, to mitigate interference and improve the overall performance of the network.\nFigure B.2-1 SEALDD utilizing MSGin5G\nThe figure depicts the overall lifecycle of SEALDD, a software-defined network (SDN) solution. It illustrates the various stages, including planning, design, deployment, operation, and maintenance, with key components such as network virtualization, network slicing, and network orchestration. The figure also highlights the importance of network slicing, which allows for the creation of virtual networks based on specific requirements, such as security, performance, or cost. The figure provides a comprehensive overview of the lifecycle, highlighting the importance of planning, design, deployment, operation, and maintenance in the SDN ecosystem.\nFigure C-1: Overall lifecycle of SEALDD\nAs shown in Figure C-1, the whole lifecycle of SEALDD to establish the SEALDD connection for the VAL client and VAL server includes two phases:\n1.\tSEALDD server Service Preparation Phase (This Phase is used by the VAL server to get SEALDD server prepared for SEALDD client access):\n(1)\tWhen the VAL server decides to use the SEALDD service for data transmission enhancement, it discovers the SEALDD server (e.g. by CAPIF).\n(2)\tThen the VAL server triggers SEALDD service subscription procedure to the discovered SEALDD server, in that procedure, SEALDD server is associated with the VAL server, and specific SEALDD server resource (e.g. address/port of the SEALDD server for redundant transmission) is allocated for the VAL server's service to transfer SEALDD traffic.\n(3)\tFor EDN scenario, the SEALDD server or VAL server will register the association information to the EES.\n2.\tSEALDD client Service Consuming Phase (When SEALDD server is prepared in SEALDD server Service Preparation Phase, the VAL client(s) can trigger SEALDD client to connect to specific prepared SEALDD server for SEALDD service):\n(1)\tWhen VAL client request to use SEALDD service to transmit the VAL traffic to VAL server, the VAL client or SEALDD client can discover the proper SEALDD server associated with the VAL server (e.g. via EAS discovery, DNS query, pre-configuration or Application layer signalling).\n(2)\tThen SEALDD client can interact with SEALDD server to negotiate for SEALDD data transfer. If Address/Port is allocated in SEALDD service subscription phase, it will be notified to SEALDD client in this step.\n(3)\tData transmission connection is established between the SEALDD client and SEALDD server for SEALDD traffic transfer.\n(5)\tThe whole configuration is accomplished and the VAL traffic is transferred via the SEALDD connection.\n\n",
