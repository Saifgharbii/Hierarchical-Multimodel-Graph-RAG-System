For example, in the rail environment, more dynamic is anticipated because a train can use several partner organizations for its communication needs regardless of time during its mission (e.g., cargo trains commute between Rotterdam and Genoa). Terminating communication requirements are particularly affected and only the MC service server of the primary MC system has the current association with the respective partner MC system of its MC service client. Such information is decisive for the determination of the partner MC system to control the call routing accordingly. Accordingly, for each migrated MC service client call routing, a lookup to determine the currently visited partner organization need to be preceded.\nThe proposed MC system interrogation is a real time query to obtain current up-to-date status information of the corresponding MC service client. The resulting MC system interrogation status information of the MC service client will determine corresponding call routing, message delivery etc. towards the corresponding MC service user. In general, the MC system interrogation can be used for various purposes to obtain status information of a dedicated MC service client.\nFigure 7.7.2.2-1 shows the procedure where an MC service client in MC system 1 initiates a private call to an MC service client which is migrated to MC system 3.\nPreconditions:\n-\tThe corresponding MC systems are interconnected.\n-\tMC service client belonging to primary MC system 2 migrated to partner MC system 3.\n-\tInterconnected MC systems can derive the corresponding primary MC system of the targeted/migrated MC service users.\n-\tFunctional alias resolution is executed prior call request forwarding starts.\nThe figure depicts a network diagram with various components, including a MC system, MC service client association, and a network interface controller (NICA). The MC system is responsible for managing the network's resources and ensuring efficient communication between the MC service client and the NICA. The MC service client is the client that requests the MC system to manage the network resources. The NICA is the central controller that manages the network's resources and ensures the efficient communication between the MC system and the MC service client.\nFigure 7.7.2.2-1: Interrogation to determine the MC system and MC service client association\n1.\tMC service client associated with MC system 1 initiates a call request to a target MC service client belonging to MC system 2. MC system 1 need to figure out to which target MC system the call request needs to be forwarded. The called MC service ID is used to determine the primary MC system to request necessary MC user information to be able to route the communication/media.\n2.\tRequest MC user info is used to retrieve the current MC user migration status and to obtain relevant routing information of the corresponding MC system where the MC service client is currently located.\n3.\tMC system 2 looks up MC service user information to figure out current MC service users to MC system association. In the illustrated case, the MC service user is migrated to MC system 3.\n4.\tMC system 2 responds to the request with Response MC user info, which includes the MC service ID of MC service client 2, currently migrated to MC system 3\n5.\tMC system 1 uses the received MC user information to forward the communication/media to MC system 3 addressing MC service client belonging to MC system 2.\n6.\tThe call response acknowledges the communication request toward MC service client of MC system 1.\n7.\tNecessary media, if necessary, floor control and transmission control is established between the corresponding MC service client.\nThe corresponding primary MC service server needs to keep track about the migration status of its associated MC service user. This information gets looked up to route communications/media to the corresponding MC system who the MC service user is located. The information necessary for routing calls/communications towards a MC service user need to contain unique MC system identifier e.g., organisation identifier.\nThe information flows address the aspect that various MC service communications may use the proposed flows to forward a communication directly to the target MC system without passing through the primary MC system of the migrated MC service user.\nThe MC system uses the flow to determine the primary MC system ID based on the targeted MC service user primary MC system association.\nTable 7.7.2.4.2-1: Request MC user info - information elements\n\nThe response MC user info is used to inform the requesting MC system about the migration status of the interrogated MC service user.\nTable 7.7.2.4.3-1: Response MC user info - information elements\n\n",

As a common form of an URI it is represented as userinfo@host where the user info part can be the functional alias and the host part can be the domain that hosts the functional alias controlling server. With this clarification in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], the functional alias shall identify where its MC service functional alias controlling server locates.\nWe have standardized how the functional alias is used in a private call in the same MC system in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.2 that includes end-to-end encryption security and the same mechanism is proposed to be used in a private call between 2 MC systems, i.e. the resolution of the called party functional alias (i.e. the MCPTT ID) shall be used by the originating party to setup the private call. Doing this the primary MCPTT FA controlling server shall query the partner MCPTT FA controlling server to resolve the called party functional alias for the private call.\nTo clarify the architectural requirement of the format of the functional alias, it is proposed to add clarification to the 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] clause 8.1.5 as:\n-\tFunctional alias provides a complementary, role-based user identification scheme which can be used by MC service users for operational purposes in the form of meaningful elements such as the function, the order number or vehicle identifications that can be used within any form of MC service communication. Functional alias takes a form of a URI where the host part of the URI shall identify the home MC system functional alias controlling server. The application addressing remains in its form and forms the foundation for the association with the corresponding functional alias. An MC service user can simultaneously activate several functional aliases but only one can be associated to a certain communication.\n-\tEach functional alias is subject to the uniqueness principle within an organization and can be shared simultaneously by several MC service users, depending on the assignment. In this case, all assigned MC service users sharing a functional alias can be included in a communication.\n-\tAn MC service user can simultaneously use different functional aliases from multiple service organizations to allow the MC service user to be reachable by different organizations.\n-\tThe use of a functional alias always requires an association with the MC service ID. The MC service ID needs to be used to provide the security context for a communication.\nWhen the MCPTT FA controlling server receives a request to resolve a functional alias and if the requested functional alias belongs to a different MC system, the MCPTT FA controlling server sends a request to the partner MC system's MCPTT FA controlling server for resolution. The partner MC system's MCPTT FA controlling server will resolve the functional alias with a terminating MCPTT ID and returns it to the requesting MCPTT FA controlling server.\nThe information flow in 3GPP TS 3GPP 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.1.8 is modified as:\nTable 7.8.2.3-1 describes the information flow MCPTT functional alias resolution response from the MCPTT functional alias controlling server to another MCPTT functional alias controlling server, the MCPTT functional alias controlling server to the MCPTT server and the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client.\nTable 7.8.2.3-1: MCPTT functional alias resolution response information elements\n\nTable 7.8.2.3-2 describes the information flow MCPTT functional alias resolution request from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server and from the MCPTT functional alias controlling server to another MCPTT functional alias controlling server.\nTable 7.8.2.3-2: MCPTT functional alias resolution request information elements\n\nThe MCPTT private call setup procedure between MCPTT servers is modified to allow using the functional alias as called party address, i.e. the MCPTT ID address is resolved by the partner MC system through the primary MCPTT server and primary MCPTT functional alias controlling server.\nProposed changes against 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode - MCPTT users in multiple MC systems with additional functional alias resolution steps similar to the mechanism used in TS 3GPP 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.2.1:\nNOTE:\tThe changes are applicable when using manual commencement mode as well.\nAdditional new pre-condition:\n1.\tA secured connection has been established between the MCPTT functional alias controlling servers in different MC systems.\nThe figure depicts a private call setup in automatic commencement mode, with users in multiple MCs. The setup includes a call setup, a call control, and a call termination.\nFigure 7.8.2.4-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode - users in multiple MC\nsystems\n1-2.\tsame as step 1-2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.1, no change.\n3.\tThe MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or functional alias of invited user.\n4.\tIf the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID as called party, the MCPTT server 1 shall resolve the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias is active using steps 5-8 below. The MCPTT server shall also check whether MCPTT client 1 can use the functional alias to setup a private call. If authorized, proceed to step 5.\nOtherwise (using MCPTT ID for the MCPTT private call) the MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate the private call to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2; if authorized proceed to step 11.\n5-10\tnew additional steps as:\n5.\tThe MCPTT server 1 sends MCPTT functional alias resolution request message to the MCPTT FA controlling server 1 to resolve the functional alias of the called party.\n6.\tThe MCPTT FA controlling server 1 determines that the function alias belongs to MCPTT service provider 2 and forwards the MCPTT functional alias resolution request message to MCPTT FA controlling server 2.\n7.\tThe MCPTT FA controlling server 2 resolve the functional alias and determines the corresponding MCPTT ID shall be used to terminate the call and returns it to the MCPTT FA controlling server 1 in the MCPTT functional alias resolution response message.\nNOTE:\tDepending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the private call request is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to implementation. This selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.\n8.\tThe MCPTT FA controlling server 1 returns the corresponding MCPTT ID to MCPTT server 1 in the MCPTT functional alias resolution response message. The MCPTT server 1 shall check if MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate the private call to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2. If not authorized stop the procedure, otherwise continue with step 9.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server 1 responds with a MCPTT functional alias resolution response message that contains the resolved MCPTT ID back to MCPTT client 1.\n10.\tThe MCPTT client 1 sends a new MCPTT private call request towards the resolved MCPTT ID.\n11.\tsame as step 6 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.1, no change.\n12.\tsame as step 5 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.1, no change.\n13-15.\tsame as step 7-9 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.1, no change.\n16.\tThe receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and an acknowledgement is sent to the MCPTT server 2.\n17.\tThe MCPTT server 2 forwards the MCPTT private call response message to MCPTT server 1.\n18-19.\tsame as steps 11-12 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.1, no change.\n",

Below are the proposed modifications in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.6.1.1 and clause 10.7.6.1.3.\n10.7.6.1.1\tMCPTT private call transfer request (MCPTT client – MCPTT server)\nTable 10.7.6.1.1-1 describes the information flow MCPTT private call transfer request from the MCPTT client to the MCPTT server and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT server.\nTable 10.7.6.1.1-1: MCPTT private call transfer request (MCPTT client to MCPTT server and MCPTT server to MCPTT server) information elements\n\n10.7.6.1.3\tMCPTT private call transfer response (MCPTT server – MCPTT client)\nTable 10.7.6.1.3-1 describes the information flow MCPTT private call transfer response from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT server.\nTable 10.7.6.1.3-1: MCPTT private call transfer response (MCPTT server to MCPTT client and MCPTT server to MCPTT server) information elements\n\nThe procedure for MCPTT private call announced transfer covers the case where an MCPTT client requests an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) to be transferred to another MCPTT user with prior announcement.\nFigure 7.12.3.2.1-1 below illustrates the procedure for MCPTT private call announced transfer with target in partner MCPTT system.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure for MCPTT private call unannounced transfer is very similar, the only difference is that steps 2 to 6 are skipped.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT client 2 is authorized to use call transfer.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 2.\n3.\tMCPTT client 2 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 3.\n4.\tMCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer private calls to MCPTT client 3.\n5.\tMCPTT client 2 supports simultaneous sessions for MCPTT private calls as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.8.\n6.\tMCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3, and MCPTT client 2 has the necessary security information to initiate a private call with MCPTT client 3 if end2end encryption is required for the private call.\nThe figure depicts a private call announcement transfer with a target in a partner MCPTT system. The call is initiated by the sender, who announces the transfer to the receiver. The receiver then initiates the call by announcing the transfer to the sender. The transfer is initiated by the sender, who announces the transfer to the receiver. The transfer is initiated by the sender, who announces the transfer to the receiver.\nFigure 7.12.3.2.1-1: MCPTT private call announced transfer with target in partner MCPTT system\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 2 using the normal MCPTT call establishment as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.2. The user at MCPTT client 1 can talk with the user at MCPTT client 2. The user at MCPTT client 2 decides to transfer the call.\n2.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 puts the call with MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 on hold.\n3.\tMCPTT client 2 initiates an MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 3 using the normal MCPTT call establishment procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3.\nNOTE 2:\tThe solution for private call using functional alias towards a partner MC system is defined in clause 7.8.\n4.\tThe user at MCPTT client 2 can talk with the user at MCPTT client 3 and announces the call transfer.\n5.\tThe MCPTT client 2 releases the MCPTT private call with MCPTT client 3 using the normal MCPTT call release procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.7.2.3. This step can occur at any time after step 4.\n6.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 puts the call with MCPTT client 1 off hold and confirms that the call will be transferred.\n7.\tThe MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT call transfer request to the MCPTT server 1.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server 1 verifies that MCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer the MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 3. This check is based on entries in the user profile of the user at MCPTT client 2. First, the MCPTT server 1 checks the value of the \"Allow private call transfer\" entry. If it is false, the authorization check has failed, and the procedure continues with step 10. Otherwise, the MCPTT server 1 checks if the \"Authorised to transfer private calls to any MCPTT user\" entry is true. If this is the case the check has passed, and for target type of MCPTT ID the procedure continues with step 10 and for target ID type of functional alias the procedure continues with step 9. The subsequent checking depends on the type of target ID. If the target ID is a MCPTT ID, the MCPTT server 1 checks for a matching entry of the target MCPTT ID in the \"List of MCPTT users that the MCPTT user is authorised to use as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the check has passed, if no matching entry is found the check has failed, for any outcome the procedure continues with step 10. If the target ID is a functional alias, the MCPTT server 1 checks for a matching entry of the target functional alias in the \"List of functional aliases that the MCPTT user is authorised to use as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the check has passed, and the procedure continues with step 9. If no matching entry is found, the authorization check has failed, and the procedure continues with step 10.\n9.\tIf the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server 1 resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias is active.\nNOTE 3:\tDepending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to implementation. The selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.\n10.\tIf the authorization check has failed, or the target of the transfer is a functional alias that is not active, or the target of the transfer is a functional alias that is simultaneously active by multiple users and the outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call transfer is cancelled, and the MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call transfer response with result \"fail\" back to MCPTT client 2. The MCPTT private call between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 remains up, and the procedure stops. Otherwise, the procedure continues.\n11.\tThe MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer request towards the MCPTT client 1.\n12.\tThe user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call transfer is in progress.\n13.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT server 1 that includes a call transfer indication set to true.\n14.\tThe MCPTT server 1 verifies that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to perform the MCPTT private call as a result of the MCPTT private call transfer request based on the fact that the transfer indication is present and set to true in the MCPTT private call request.\nNOTE 4:\tFor call transfer the MCPTT server does not check if the initial originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3.\n15.\tThe MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT call request to MCPTT server 2.\n16.\tThe MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT call request to MCPTT client 3.\nNOTE 5:\tMCPTT server 2 detects that the private call request contains a transfer indication set to true and therefore skips the authorization checking.\n17.\tThe user at MCPTT client 3 is notified about the incoming call.\n18.\tMCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT private call response back to the MCPTT server 2.\n19.\tMCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT private call response back to the MCPTT server 1.\n20.\tThe MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT private call response towards MCPTT client 1.\n21.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer response back to MCPTT server 1.\n22.\tThe MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT private transfer response towards MCPTT client 2.\n23.\tMCPTT client 2 initiates release of the private call between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 as described in subclause 10.7.2.3.\n24.\tThe media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 3 is established.\nThe procedure for MCPTT private call announced transfer covers the case where an MCPTT client requests an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) to be transferred to another MCPTT user with prior announcement.\nFigure 7.12.3.2.2-1 below illustrates the procedure for MCPTT private call announced transfer with transferring MCPTT user in partner MCPTT system.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure for MCPTT private call unannounced transfer is very similar, the only difference is that steps 2 to 6 are skipped.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT client 3 is authorized to use call transfer.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 3.\n3.\tMCPTT client 3 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 2.\n4.\tMCPTT client 3 is authorized to transfer private calls to MCPTT client 2.\n5.\tMCPTT client 3 supports simultaneous sessions for MCPTT private calls as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [2] clause 10.8.\n6.\tMCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3, and MCPTT client 3 has the necessary security information to initiate a private call with MCPTT client 2 if end2end encryption is required for the private call.\nThe figure depicts a private call announcement transfer in a 12-channel 12-point system, with the user in the partner system.
