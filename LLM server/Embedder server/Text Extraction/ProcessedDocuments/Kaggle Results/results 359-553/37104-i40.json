The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.1.3.1-6 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,B54,a, PEM,B54,b, PEM,B54,c, PEM,B54,d, PEM,B54,e and PEM,B54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.1.3.1-6: Declared Band 54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NB-IoT and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nNOTE:\tFor co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.\nTable 6.6.1.4.1-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [7].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.1.4.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.5-1 or Table 4.5-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\n",

However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nNOTE 8:\tThe requirement is not applicable when fmax < ΔfOBUE.\nNOTE 9:\tAll limits in Table 6.6.2.2-1, Table 6.6.2.2-3, Table 6.6.2.2-4 and Table 6.6.2.2-7 are identical to the corresponding limits for Band Category 1 and 3.\n\nThe following requirements in TS 45.005 [5] shall apply to an MSR Base Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band Category 2:\n-\tSpectrum due to the modulation and wide band noise, applicable parts of subclause 4.2.1.1, 4.2.1.2, 4.2.1.3-a2, 4.2.1.3-b2, 4.2.1.3-c2 and 4.2.1.4.2.\n-\tSpectrum due to switching transients, applicable parts of subclause 4.2.2.1-b.\n-\tEmission requirement for frequency offsets of between 2 and 10 MHz outside relevant transmit band, applicable parts of subclause 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.1.\n-\tIntra BTS Intermodulation, applicable parts of subclause 4.7.2, 4.7.2.1-b, 4.7.2.3-b and 4.7.2.3-c.\nIn addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.2.1 and 6.6.2.2, the BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [8], when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.\nIn certain regions, the following requirements may apply to a TDD BS operating in BC3 in the same geographic area and in the same operating band as another TDD system without synchronisation. For this case the emissions shall not exceed -52 dBm/MHz in each supported downlink operating band except in:\n-\tThe frequency range from 10 MHz below the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge to the frequency 10 MHz above the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge of each supported band.\nNOTE 1:\tLocal or regional regulations may specify another excluded frequency range, which may include frequencies where synchronised TDD systems operate.\nNOTE 2:\tTDD base stations that are synchronized and operating in BC3 can transmit without these additional co-existence requirements.\nNOTE 3:\tUnsynchronized operation for BC3 BS with any NR configuration is not covered by the present release of this specification.\nIn certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of DTT. For a BS operating in Band 20, the level of emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre frequencies Ffilter according to Table 6.6.2.4.3-1, shall not exceed the maximum emission level PEM,N declared by the manufacturer. This requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range falls in the spurious domain.\nTable 6.6.2.4.3-1: Declared emissions levels for protection of DTT\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined using the method outlined in Annex G of TS 36.104 [4].\nTable 6.6.2.4.4-1:Void\n\nIn regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48 applies for operation in Band 24. The following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used together with other information about the site installation to verify compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement applies to BS operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to the 1541 – 1650 MHz band. This requirement applies to the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz.\nThe level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.2.4.5-1 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,B24,a, PEM,B24,b, PEM,B24,c, PEM,B24,d, PEM,B24,e and PEM,B24,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.2.4.5-1: Declared emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements in FCC Order DA 20-48 are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\nTable .4.6-1: Void\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirements may apply to BS operating in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz, in Band 75 within 1432-1517 MHz and in Band 76 within 1427-1432 MHz.
