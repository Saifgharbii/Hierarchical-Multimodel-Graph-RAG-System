The purpose of this TR is to further optimize and improve the working procedure for specifying band combination. A technical report will be created to collect the rules of band combination during the timescale of Rel-18 so as to improve the efficiency of band combination specifying and the quality of specifications. The dependency and applicability for RF requirements among different features for the same spectrum combination to reduce the redundant tests will also be investigated in the TR.

A set of new guidance on band combination handling, rule collections and band combination optimization for RAN4 specifications will be approved. The feasibility to reduce the test burden of band combinations will be discussed. It is suggested that the rules related to the band combinations should be applied to the latest RAN4 specifications after the completion of the SI.\n",

The specific steps are listed as below.\n#1 Band combinations should be requested by contact person using request template. And the request spread sheet should be shared in the reflector 3GPP_TSG_RAN_WG4_NR_BANDS for NR CA, MR DC and SUL band combinations or 3GPP_TSG_RAN_WG4_CA for LTE CA band combinations before RAN4#(X-1) meeting.\n#2 Band combinations should be captured into the draft revised WIDs during RAN4#(X-1) meeting by rapporteurs.\n#3 The official revised basket WIDs can be approved together with requested band combinations during RAN#(Y-1) meeting.\n#4 Proponents should prepare and submit the corresponding contributions, e.g. draft CR, TP before RAN4#X meeting. If a draft CR or TP is depending on approval of lower order fallbacks submitted at the same meeting, this need to be clearly mentioned in the cover sheet of the draft CR or in the heading of the TP.\n#5 The Block/Approval procedure is applicable to the band combinations in one week before formal RAN4#X meeting, if there is no general issues observed.\n#6 The contributions will be discussed during RAN4#X meeting. If there are no technical concerns and if all the needed fallbacks are completed, the band combinations can be approved. And the final decision will be made by chairman.\n#7 If the contributions are approved or endorsed, the corresponding band combinations should be captured into the big CRs and/or TRs by rapporteurs. Note: The big CR is an official CR which is used to capture all the corrections for one specification by rapporteur under basket WI.\n#8 Email approval can be used for the big CRs and/or TRs in one week after formal RAN4#X meeting.\n#9 The status of band combinations should be shared by contact person after formal RAN4#X meeting.\n#10 The status of band combinations should be captured into the WID and/or SR by rapporteurs.\n#11 RAN #Y will approve the big CRs and revised WIDs.\n#12 The agreed band combinations will be introduced into the specification in next version.\nThe figure depicts a workflow for the introduction of band combinations for block approval in a telecommunications network. It illustrates the process of selecting the appropriate bands for each block, ensuring that the network operates efficiently and securely. The figure includes various stages such as band selection, band allocation, and band management, all of which are crucial for the smooth functioning of the network.\nFigure 5.1A.1.1-1 The workflow on the introduction of band combinations for block approval\n",

Cover sheet can be further updated after additional basket WIs are approved in RAN plenary.\n#4 Rapporteurs can choose some of these BCS table sheets to suit their WID. For BCS4/BCS5 there is no need to add information in the BCS sheet since there is no channel BW details to be filled in for them.\n#5 Only one sheet/Excel attachment is used for both the WID and the status report by rapporteurs.\n#6 The following rules and marks can be used to indicate the change marks for the band combinations in the Excel spread sheet.\n1) The Excel sheet included in the status report and the WID would have 2 worksheets.\n-\tDetails of band combinations status of RAN #Y-1. It’s the simple copy from last RAN meeting.\n-\tDetails of band combinations status of RAN #Y\n2) The worksheet of RAN #Y would have an extra column A \"Are there any change marks?\" which includes 4 words:\n-\tNew for new if the whole line is new.

Therefore, the original templates of band combination request sheet, status report and band combination table should be updated accordingly.\nThe updated EXCEL templates of band combination request sheet, status report and band combination table for Rel-18 PC3 band combinations can be found in the following 3GPP ftp server.\n\n(Editor’s note: The approved latest templates for PC3 band combinations are in R4-2307985)\nBesides the updated EXCEL templates, the other general rules captured in the section 6.2.2 in TR 38.862 [7] are still valid.\nThe update templates for PC3 NR CA, EN-DC, SUL and V2X band combinations in Rel-18 include the sheets for ‘Cover sheet’, ‘Band combination table’, ‘FR1 intra-band CA BCS table’, ‘FR2 intra-band CA BCS table’, ‘FR2 intra-band NCCA BCS table’, ‘Intra-band ENDC BCS table’, ‘FR1 inter-band BCS table’, ‘FR2 inter-band BCS table’, ‘FR1+FR2 inter-band BCS table’, ‘SUL band combination BCS table’, ‘V2X band combination BCS table’ and ‘FR1 Mixed intra-band CA BCS’:\n-\tMerging all the channel bandwidth columns into one column.\n-\tUsing ‘,’ between two adjacent channel bandwidths.\n-\tRemoving the channel bandwidth number in the table head.\n–\tOnly for inter-band NR CA) Using simple texts like ‘CA_nXC_BCS0’ or ‘CA_nX(2A)_BCS0’  for the constitute band supporting intra-band contiguous or  non-contiguous CA , respectively, associated with a new note of “The CA configurations are given in Table 5.5A.1-1 or Table 5.5A.2-1 in this specification”.\n\n",

Then either a list of LTE or NR carriers is following, where the carriers or bands are always separated by “-”. LTE and NR carriers cannot be combined, that would be a DC combination. Examples:\n-\tCA_1A-2A (LTE)\n-\tCA_n1A-n2A (NR)\n-\tExamples for wrong notations: CA_1A_2A (“_” instead of “-” between the carriers/bands), CA-1A-2A (no “_” but “-” after “CA”, CA_1A_n2A (this would need to be a DC combination)\n-\tNOTE: LTE examples are provided for information only\nDual Connectivity: Starts with “DC_” as the first three characters, then for EN-DC configurations followed by the list of LTE carriers, a “_” as separation between the LTE and NR carriers and then the list of NR carriers. For NE-DC configurations the list begins with NR carriers, a “_” as separation between the NR and LTE carriers, and then the list of LTE carriers. There are exceptions for SUL EN-DC combinations, which separate the LTE and NR carriers by “_SUL_” instead of “_”, and contiguous intra-band EN-DC combinations using “(n)” instead of “_” and the “n” of the first NR band in the list. DC configurations within LTE or NR just list the carriers after “DC_”. For EN-DC combinations for V2X the “DC_” at the beginning is replaced by “V2X_”, even if it is still an EN-DC combination. Examples:\n-\tDC_1A_n2A (EN-DC)\n-\tDC_1A-2A (LTE-DC)\n-\tDC_n1A-n2A (NR-DC)\n-\tDC_(n)1AA (EN-DC with contiguous intra-band LTE and NR carriers)\n-\tDC_1(n)AA (NE-DC with contiguous intra-band NR and LTE carriers)\n-\tDC_1A-(n)2AA (EN-DC with one LTE carrier followed by contiguous intra-band LTE and NR carriers)\n-\tDC_2(n)AA-1A (NE-DC with one LTE carrier followed by contiguous intra-band NR and LTE carriers)\n-\tDC_n78A_1A-3A (NE-DC)\n-\tExamples for wrong notations: DC_1A-n2A (“-” instead of “_” between the LTE and NR carriers/bands for EN-DC combinations), DC-1A-2A (no “_” but “-” after “DC”, DC_n1A_n2A (“_” instead of “-” between the NR carriers/bands for NR-DC combinations)\nSupplementary UL: NR SA configurations start with “SUL_” as the first four characters for SUL band combination with single carrier, as it is only NR without LTE, if it is within an EN-DC combination there is a “_SUL_” between the LTE and the NR part instead of the “SUL_” at the beginning, using the usual “DC_” as the first characters. For uplink EN-DC configuration, if TDM operation of uplink sharing from UE perspective (ULSUP) is chosen, the notation of “_ULSUP-TDM_” is used. The FDM operation of uplink sharing from UE perspective is not supported in current specifications. If SUL band combination with intra-band contiguous CA, intra-band non-contiguous CA or inter-band CA, the notation starts with “CA_” as the first three characters. Examples:\n-\tSUL_n2A-n80A (n80 being the SUL band)\n-\tCA_n41C-n80A (n80 being the SUL band)\n-\tCA_n78(2A)-n86A (n86 being the SUL band)\n-\tCA_n1A_n78A-n81A (n81 being the SUL band)\n-\tDC_1A_SUL_n2A-n80A (n80 being the SUL band)\n-\tDC_3A_n80A_ULSUP-TDM_n78A (TDM operation on SUL_n78-n80)\nIn summary the following types and notations are defined:\n-\tCA_ …: A Carrier Aggregation configuration followed by the list of either LTE or NR carriers, or SUL band combination with NR intra-band contiguous, non-contiguous or inter-band CA carriers.\n-\tDC_ …: A Dual Connectivity configuration followed by the list of either LTE carriers for LTE-DC or NR carriers for NR-DC or for EN-DC first LTE carriers, then “_” and the NR carriers or for NE-DC first NR carriers, then “_” and the LTE carriers. In case of a DC combination for V2X, the “DC_” is replaced with “V2X_”.\n-\tSUL_ …: A Carrier Aggregation configuration including one SUL band followed by a single NR carrier. In case of a DC configuration with SUL, the “SUL_” is shifted behind the “_” separating the LTE and NR carriers and the configuration starts with “DC_” as usual for DC configurations. In case of an uplink EN-DC configuration with SUL, “_ULSUP-TDM_” is applied for TDM operation for uplink sharing from UE perspective.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "A list of LTE or NR carriers within a CA or DC configuration is a either a single or multiple LTE or NR carriers. The simplest one is just a single carrier. It consists of the band number followed by the bandwidth class, which is “A” for a single carrier. For LTE the band number is just the number of the band, for NR carriers the numerical part of the band notation is preceded by an “n”, indicating this is a NR band, not a LTE band. NR bands above n256 are FR2 bands, below n256 are FR1 bands. The band number is always followed by the bandwidth class, which can be quite complicated for NR combinations with intra-band CA. Bandwidth classes other than “A” indicate multiple carriers in that band. In the list there can be multiple entries for inter-band CA configurations (in LTE also intra-band non-contiguous CA), which are always separated by “-”. The band numbers are sorted in increasing numbers. LTE and NR bands in the same frequency range usually have the same band number. Examples:\n-\tNotation of a single LTE carrier: 1A, 2A, 3A etc.\n-\tNotation of a single NR carrier: n1A, n2A, n3A etc.\n-\tList of multiple LTE carriers on different bands: 1A-2A-3A.\n-\tList of multiple NR carriers on different bands: n1A-n2A-n3A.\n",

                            "text_content": "An entry within the list of carriers always starts with the band number followed by the bandwidth class. In LTE the bandwidth classes (if not “A”) mean this is a contiguous CA configuration with multiple carriers. They are specified in table 5.6A-1 in 36.101 and can range from “A” for a single carrier up to F for 5 carriers. BW class I is specified for 8 carriers, but is not used. Non-contiguous CA combinations are just listing multiple sub-blocks separated by “-”. Examples:\n-\tCA_1B: Two contiguously aggregated LTE carriers with 20MHz or less in band 1.\n-\tCA_2F: Five contiguously aggregated LTE carriers with up to 100MHz in band 2.\n-\tCA_3A-3A: Two non-contiguously aggregated LTE carriers in band 3\n-\tCA_4A-4E: A single carrier followed by a gap and then followed by four contiguously aggregated carriers with up to 80MHz\n-\tA single carrier is no CA configuration as there is nothing aggregated, so there is no CA_5A, this is just 5A.\nNR bandwidth classes are much more complicated. Also here an entry within the list of carriers always starts with the band number followed by the bandwidth class. But in NR the bandwidth class includes contiguous and non-contiguous CA and a mixture of contiguous and non-contiguous CA. For contiguous CA the bandwidth classes are specified similar to LTE, but separate for FR1 and FR2. For FR1 contiguous CA BW classes are specified in table 5.3A.5-1 in 38.101-1 ranging from A to O (F is not used), in which the classes M, N and O are applicable for the use with shared spectrum channel access. For FR2 in 5.3A.4-1 in 38.101-2 ranging from A to W(N is not used), and R2 to R12, in which the classes V and W are applicable only for FR2-2 operating bands. The CA bandwidth classes for NR are categorized into different fallback groups (FBG). It is mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to lower order NR CA bandwidth class configuration within a FBG, and not mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to lower order NR CA bandwidth class configuration that belong to a different FBG.\nA special kind or BW class specification is when there are intra-band contiguous LTE and NR carriers within an EN-DC combination like DC_(n)1AA. In this case the LTE and NR carriers within that band are combined to a single entry of the list of carriers starting with (n) indicating that it can be “n” for the NR carrier, or no “n” for the LTE carrier. This is followed by the numerical value of the band (here “1”) and then the contiguous BW class for the LTE part and the contiguous BW class for the NR part. So DC_(n)1AA means that there is a single carrier for LTE and a single carrier for NR side-by-side contiguously aggregated in band 1. This can be extended by more contiguous carriers on the LTE or NR side or both, for example DC_(n)41DA means three contiguous carriers for LTE besides a single carrier for NR. This can be extended by other LTE carriers in front of  the combination of carriers with (n) or with other NR carriers behind the (n) part, for example DC_1A-(n)2AA or DC_(n)2AA-n3A. The (n) part is considered as the last LTE combination in the list or the first NR combination in the list, therefore adding it with a “-” instead of a “_”. For intra-band contiguous NE-DC configuration, instead of (n)X in EN-DC, the notation X(n) is used. In this case, DC_X(n)yz indicates the contiguous NR Band carriers with channel bandwidth class y in Band nX is followed by the contiguous LTE carries with channel bandwidth z in Band X. For example, DC_3(n)AA denotes the NE-DC combination of single carrier for NR in Band n3 and single carrier for LTE in Band 3.\nHowever, the BW class part of a NR configuration also includes non-contiguous intra-band CA. For a combination containing any non-contiguous CA, i.e. a gap between any aggregated carriers, each block of single or contiguously aggregated carriers is called a sub-block, where a sub-block can also consist of the contiguously aggregated carriers as stated above. While in LTE single non-contiguously aggregated carriers are just duplicated like CA_1A-1A, in NR the number of non-contiguous carriers of a BW class is counted and put in parenthesis with the number of sub-blocks of this type preceding the bandwidth class. Therefore a configuration with two non-contiguous carriers will have a BW class (2A) in NR, so the combination will be named CA_n1(2A), meaning there are two non-contiguous carriers with BW class A in band n1.\nHowever, there can also be the combination of contiguous and non-contiguous intra-band CA in NR. In. this case the sub-blocks of each BW class are separately counted and added within the brackets. For example if there are in a n260 FR2 CA combination two sub-blocks of BW class “A” (single carriers), three of BW class “G” (two contiguous carriers up to 100MHz) and one of BW class O (two carriers with 50 or 100MHz), the full combination will be named CA_n260(2A-3G-Q), having 6 sub-blocks with in total 10 carriers. Examples:\n-\tCA_n1B: Two contiguously aggregated NR carriers with 100MHz or less in band n1 (FR1).\n-\tCA_n2D: Three contiguously aggregated NR carriers with up to 300MHz in band n2.\n-\tCA_n3(2A): Two non-contiguously aggregated NR carriers in band n3\n-\tCA_n260G: Two contiguously aggregated NR carriers with 150 or 200MHz in band n260 (FR2).\n-\tCA_n260M: Eight contiguously aggregated NR carriers with 750 or 800MHz in band n260 (FR2).\n-\tCA_n260(2A): Two non-contiguously aggregated NR carriers in band n260 with up to 800MHz (2x400MHz)\n-\tCA_n260(A-M): A single carrier followed by a gap and then followed by eight contiguously aggregated carriers with up to 100MHz each\n-\tCA_n260(2A-3G-Q): Two single carriers up to 400MNHz each, three sub-blocks with two carriers each of 150 or 200MHz per sub-block followed by another sub-block with two carriers of 50 or 100MHz each.\n",

Below are the general rules how to implement these band combinations within the CA/DC configurations within the tables in clause 5.5:\n-\tEach cell of the configuration table should contain only one combination of bands in the first column with the exception that combinations having the same bands but different intra-band contiguous BW classes can be listed in the same cell. Also all non-contiguous combinations can be listed in one cell, but separated from the contiguous combinations in another cell.\n-\tIn the UL column there shall only be UL configurations that belong to the configurations in the first column. Unfortunately this means that in the UL column there can be higher order configurations than some of the configurations in the first column, however, they cannot be used with such a lower order combination. This was agreed some time ago as a “table simplification”, but creates some hassle as there are UL combinations listed that cannot be supported with the DLs.\n-\tMultiple configurations with different bandwidth classes shall be separated by pressing the return key, you will see the  sign at the end of the line if you activated the button to view these special characters, no other special characters to separate configuration shall be used.\n-\tThere shall be no special characters not belonging to the combinations in any configuration cell, no spaces “ ”, “/”, “.”, or any other special characters.\n-\tIf there are notes for a specific configuration, the note shall be using superscript font and added at the end of the configuration list within a cell, not anywhere within the configuration or separated with any other characters, multiple notes shall be separated just by a comma, all in superscript.\n",

There are already many rules and definitions for these configurations.\nDefinitions:\n–\tA fallback DC, CA or SUL configuration is a configuration, where one of the carriers of the higher order configuration is removed.\n– \tA mandatory fallback is a fallback that is mandatory to be specified in the UE specification and supported by the UE.\n– \tA Fallback Group is specified for contiguous CA, only fallback configurations within the same fallback group need to be supported.\nExplanations and rules:\n–\tA higher order configuration has generally the same number of fallbacks as it has carriers, i.e. a configuration with 4 carriers has 4 next level fallbacks.\n-\tExample: CA_n1A-n2A-n3A-n4A has the 4 next level fallbacks CA_n2A-n3A-n4A, CA_n1A-n3A-n4A, CA_n1A-n2A-n4A, CA_n1A-n2A-n3A, where the first, the second, the third and the fourth carrier have been removed.\n-\tFor intra-band CA some of the fallbacks are identical, so that the number of unique fallbacks can be lower than the number of carriers. For contiguous intra-band CA there is only one unique fallback, for non-contiguous intra-band CA as well. For contiguous intra-band configurations removing one of the middle carriers would not result in a valid fallback, since this would transform the contiguous configuration to a non-contiguous configuration. But for the combination of contiguous and non-contiguous intra-band CA there will usually be more than one unique fallback left.\n-\tExample: CA_n1(3A) would have three fallbacks, where the first, the second or the third carrier would be removed, but in all three cases the resulting fallback is the same: CA_n1(2A), so we only have one unique fallback configuration left out of the three.\n-\tExample: CA_n1D would have three fallbacks, where the first, the second or the third carrier would be removed, but in all three cases the resulting fallback is the same: CA_n1C, so we only have one unique fallback configuration left out of the three. Additionally removing the middle carrier doesn’t result in a valid fallback, since it would change the contiguous configuration to a non-contiguous one.\n-\tExample: CA_n265R12 would have twelve fallbacks, where the first, the second … twelfth carrier would be removed, but in all twelve cases the resulting fallback is the same: CA_n265R11, so we only have one unique fallback configuration left out of the twelve. Also here removing one of the middle carrier doesn’t result in a valid fallback, since it would change the contiguous configuration to a non-contiguous one.\n-\tExample: CA_n1(A-C) would have three fallbacks, where the first, the second or the third carrier would be removed, this would result in CA_n1C, CA_n1(2A), CA_n1(2A) as fallbacks, where the last two are duplicates, so in this case we have two unique fallback configurations left out of the three: CA_n1C and CA_n1(2A).\n-\tFor intra-band contiguous CA we have to follow the fallback groups. Only fallbacks within this group can be used, BW classes outside the fallback group are no legal fallbacks.\n-\tExample: CA_n1D falls back to CA_n1C.\n-\tExample: CA_n1C falls back to CA_n1A, BUT NOT to CA_n1B, since this is in a different fallback group.\n-\tExample: CA_n265I (FR2) falls back to CA_n265H, this falls back to CA_n265G, this falls back to CA_n265A, NOT to CA_n265F.\n-\tFor combined contiguous and non-contiguous intra-band CA, which is mainly used for FR2, there will be many fallbacks, especially when there is a large number of carriers, but also there some fallbacks after removing a carrier may be duplicates.\n-\tExample: CA_n265(A-G-H), removing the “A” carrier results in CA_n265(G-H), removing one of the “G” carriers results in CA_n265(A-A-H), which will be correctly written as CA_n265(2A-H), removing one of the “H” carrier will result in CA_n265(A-G-G), which will be correctly written as CA_n265(A-2G), so we get three unique configurations out of these six carriers.\n",

                            "text_content": "In general all fallbacks need to be specified and supported until we end up at a single carrier. So it is necessary to generate a fallback tree starting at the configuration with the highest number of carriers down to a single carrier.\n–\tA configuration has as many fallback levels as the highest order combination has carriers. For example a four carrier combination will have four three carrier fallbacks, each of these has three two carrier fallbacks, each of these would end up in single carriers. However, in this chain there will again be some duplicates.\nExample: CA_n1A-n2A-n3A-n4An has these fallbacks:\n-\tCA_n2A-n3A-n4A, CA_n1A-n3A-n4A, CA_n1A-n2A-n4A, CA_n1A-n2A-n3A.\nThese four combinations have these two carrier fallbacks (colors as above):\n-\tCA_n3A-n4A, CA_n2A-n4A, CA_n2A-n3A, CA_n3A-n4A, CA_n1A-n4A, CA_n1A-n3A, CA_n2A-n4A, CA_n1A-n4A, CA_n1A-n2A, CA_n2A-n3A, CA_n1A-n3A, CA_n1A-n2A.\nAs we see there are several duplicates, removing these we end up with these second level fallbacks:\n-\tCA_n3A-n4A, CA_n2A-n4A, CA_n2A-n3A, CA_n1A-n4A, CA_n1A-n3A, CA_n1A-n2A.\n-\tAll of these end up in 4 single carriers of n1A, n2A, n3A and n4A.\n-\tThis is a recursive action, we first have to check the next lower level fallbacks, then take these as the basis for the next lower level and so on, until we end up with single carriers.\n-\tAll fallbacks for these DC, CA or SUL combinations are mandatory to be supported, as long as the corresponding UL is supported as well.\nOne relatively simple example of such a combination is DC_2A_n261(H-I). But already this simple example generates a fallback tree with 12 fallbacks when going from 8 carriers to a single dual carrier DC combination. This is shown in figure 6.2.2-1:\n\nThe given telecommunication figure, labeled as \"Figure 6.2.2-1: Fallback tree for DC_2A_n261(H-I)\", depicts a network diagram illustrating the fallback tree for the DC_2A_n261(H-I) device. The diagram shows the network topology, including the device, its associated ports, and the connections to other devices. The fallback tree is a crucial component of the network, providing a means to restore connectivity in the event of a device failure. The diagram is a visual representation of the network's structure, allowing for easy understanding and maintenance.\nFigure 6.2.2-1: Fallback tree for DC_2A_n261(H-I)\nThere are much more complicated CA combinations that will create many more combinations like CA_n260(2A-2O-Q) and there are many of these combinations. For CA_n260(2A-2O-Q) for example there is a fallback tree with 46 unique fallback combinations (all duplicates already removed). This combination is already in 38.101, however, most of these fallbacks were initially missing and added later.\nAll of these fallbacks have to be specified in 38.101 specs and need to be supported by the UE.\n",

The reason is that there can be combinations, for which the UL is not supported, of course when there is no UL, also the DL combination doesn’t make sense anymore.\n-\tAssumption: DC_1A-2A_n3A is the DL configuration and DC_1A_n3A is supported as the UL.\n-\tDC_1A-2A_n3A as DL configuration has DC_1A_n3A, DC_2A_n3A as next level fallbacks.\n-\tThe fallback DC_1A_n3A has the same UL DC_1A_n3A as the higher order combination, therefore this fallback is mandatory to be supported.\n-\tThe fallback DC_2A_n3A would need DC_2A_n3A as the UL, but only DC_1A_n3A is supported for the UL of the higher order combination, therefore this fallback is not mandatory to be supported.\nFallbacks from EN-DC to E-UTRA only or NR only configurations need to be supported as well. For example if we have a configuration DC_1A-2A-3A_n4A-n5A of course the constituent LTE combination CA_1A-2A-3A as well as NR CA_n4A-n5A need to be specified in 36.101 and 38.101 respectively and it is mandatory to support them, since the EN-DC combination is based on them.\n",

                            "text_content": "In NR band combination, it is a challenge for operators to request new NR CA and SUL band combinations when new channel bandwidths are added to existing bands in the band combinations. Operators have to go back and create new Bandwidth Combinations Sets for existing band combinations in order to be able to use those new channel bandwidths in NR CA and SUL. To reduce the workload in RAN4, a new WID for creating a new type of BCS was approved in [8].\nBCS4/BCS5 are allowed to be applied to new band combinations in RAN4 which indicate UE to support up to all of the channel bandwidths for the band in the band combination. BCS4 is release independent to Rel-15 with no new signalling while BCS5 is functionally equivalent to BCS4 except that the new signalling [supportedMinBandwidthDL/supportedMinBandwidthUL] introduced in Rel-17 such as the limitation to the supporting channel bandwidth in each band within the band combination would apply, and BCS5 with the signalling [supportedMinBandwidthDL/supportedMinBandwidthUL] is allowed for early implementation from Rel-15. For a legacy gNB that was not upgraded to understand BCS4 or BCS5 with the new signalling, it would enable to ignore BCS4 or BCS5 with the new signalling.\nConsidering that BCSs are not defined or reported separately for UL and DL for traditional BCSs, there is also no need to differentiate BCS4/BCS5 for UL and DL. BCS4/BCS5 can be used for FR1 intra-band UL CA. Table 6.6.1-1 shows the template for NR CA configurations for intra-band contiguous CA with BCS4/BCS5. Table 6.6.1-2 shows the template for NR CA configurations for intra-band non-contiguous CA with BCS4/BCS5. For inter-band CA combinations including FR1 intra-band CA and with BCS4/BCS5, the bandwidth combination sets for the FR1 intra-band CA are BCS4/BCS5. The BCS4/BCS5 are represented in the inter-band CA configuration table by using the option which covers inter-band and intra-band as shown in Table 6.6.1-3. For SUL band combinations, BCS4/BCS5 reuse the same template with inter-band CA as in Table 6.6.1-3.\nTable 6.6.1-1: Template for NR intra-band contiguous CA configurations with BCS4/BCS5\n\nTable 6.6.1-2: Template for NR intra-band non-contiguous CA configurations with BCS4/BCS5\n\nTable 6.6.1-3: Template for NR inter-band CA configurations including FR1 intra-band CA with BCS4/BCS5\n\nWith regards to the applicability of BCS4/BCS5 to FR2 intra-band combinations, since all FR2 combinations only have BCS0 and new channel bandwidth have not been added, BCS4/BCS5 are probably not needed for FR2. For FR1+FR2 BCS4/BCS5 combinations the configuration table shall state that BCS0 applies for the intra-band FR2 part (when applicable).\n",

The figure is a visual representation of the configuration, allowing for easy comparison and understanding of the inter-band CA configurations.\nFigure 6.8.1-2 Example for “sub-table-group” tag for two bands inter-band CA configurations\nFor CA within FR1 bands, TS 38.101-1 [4] provides the CA configuration tables for intra-band contiguous CA, intra-band non-contiguous CA and inter-band CA for NR FR1 bands. The additional information for maximum aggregated bandwidth is set for intra-band contiguous and intra-band non-contiguous CA configuration tables for FR1.\nFor CA within FR2 bands, TS 38.101-2 [5] provides the CA configuration tables for intra-band contiguous CA, intra-band non-contiguous CA and inter-band CA for NR FR2 bands. The additional information for maximum aggregated bandwidth is set for intra-band contiguous and intra-band non-contiguous CA configuration tables in TS 38.101-2 [5]. For intra-band non-contiguous CA, the concept of sub-block is applied to FR2. Sub-blocks belonging to a CA configuration can be in any order. This means a certain CA configuration acronym includes all sub-block arrangements which have exactly the same sub-block set. As an example, CA_n260(2G-3O) denotes CA_n260(2O-2G-O), CA_n260(G-3O-G) etc, but these are not listed in tables separately.\nFor CA between FR1 and FR2 bands, TS 38.101-3 [6] provides the inter-band CA configuration tables for NR bands between FR1 and FR2.\nFor the uplink CA configuration, “-” in the configuration table denotes that non-CA operation is supported in this configuration, i.e. only single carrier operation for the constituent band is used for uplink.\nFor the sake of brevity and to reduce the size of CA configuration tables, instead of showing explicitly in the CA configuration tables, the SCS info for each NR band in the configuration is referred to the channel bandwidths for each NR band in clause 5.3.5 of TS 38.101-1 [4] and TS 38.101-2 [5]. For configurations including intra-band contiguous part, the detail configuration for this part is referred to the corresponding intra-band contiguous CA configuration table. Examples:\nFor NR inter-band CA configuration with two bands in FR1, Table 6.8.1-1 illustrates that,\n-\tCA_n1A-n3A consists of two NR bands n1 and n3 whose SCS values are defined in Table 6.8.1-2. For example, for NR band n1, the supported channel bandwidth in BCS0 is 5MHz, 10MHz, 15MHz and 20MHz where channel bandwidth 5MHz supports SCS with only 15kHz, channel bandwidths 10MHz, 15MHz and 20MHz support all SCS of {15kHz, 30kHz, 60kHz}.\n-\tCA_n1B-n3A having intra-band contiguous part CA_n1B, the configuration of band n1 for the corresponding CA part is referred to CA_n1B_BCS0 defined in intra-band contiguous CA configuration table.\n-\tCA_n2A-n66A consists of two BCSs. The UL CA configurations denote the allowed UL CA configurations supported by the specification. For BCS0, the uplink configuration “-” indicates that non-CA operation is supported and only single carrier operation is used in uplink. For BCS1, the uplink configuration supports CA configuration CA_n2A-n66A.\n-\tFor some configurations, there are regional spectrum limitations to the corresponding bands and the notes can be found in the configuration table, such as for CA_n2A-n48A_BCS0, the channel bandwidths 50MHz, 60MHz, 80MHz, 90MHz and 100MHz are applicable only to downlink.\nFor channel bandwidth per operating band defined in clause 5.3.5 of TS 38.101-1/-2 and TS 38.104, Table 6.8.1-2 illustrates that,\n-\tThe requirements for each configuration should be complied with the combination of channel bandwidths, SCS for each operating band defined in the table.\n-\tFor some bands the limitations to the bandwidth may be captured with notes in the table, such as for NR band n48, the channel bandwidth 5MHz is restricted to operation when carrier is configured as an SCell part of DC or CA configuration.\n\nTable 6.8.1-1: NR CA configurations and bandwidth combinations sets defined for inter-band CA (two bands)\n\n\nTable 6.8.1-2: Channel bandwidths for each NR band\n\n",

                            "text_content": "NR-DC configurations within FR1 are specified in clause 5.5B of TS 38.101-1. In the configuration table, only NR-DC configurations and uplink NR-DC configurations are listed. The bandwidth combination sets for the corresponding inter-band CA, i.e., dual uplink inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands, are applicable to Dual Connectivity.\nEN-DC and NE-DC configurations are specified in clause 5.5B of TS 38.101-3. In the configuration table, in addition to the downlink configurations and uplink configurations, the combinations of intra-band contiguous, non-contiguous and inter-band within FR1 also include the column of “Single UL allowed”. The combination of some frequency bands in the configuration might be a bit problematic due to self-interference, as defined in TS38.306. UE may indicate capability of not supporting simultaneous dual and triple uplink operation due to possible intermodulation interference to its own primary downlink channel bandwidth if the intermodulation order is 2 or if the intermodulation order is 3 for the combinations when both operating bands are between 450 MHz – 960 MHz or between 1427 MHz – 2690 MHz. In case for the EN-DC configurations for which the intermodulation products caused by the dual and triple uplink operation fall into the receive band but do not interfere with the own primary downlink channel bandwidth as defined in Annex-I of TS 38.101-3 the UE is mandated to operate in dual and triple uplink mode. Single Uplink is also allowed for certain band combinations where intermodulation or reverse intermodulation products could create difficulty for meeting emission requirements. For EN-DC and NE-DC combinations of order 3 or higher, “Single Uplink allowed” UL configurations captured in the corresponding order 2 tables apply. As for an example, to mitigate the self-interference issue, the EN-DC configuration DC_3A_n78A has specified which band combinations are allowed to stray from the stringent requirement for simultaneous transmission and reception. The uplink needs to alternate between 1.8GHz and 3.5GHz. While 3.5GHz uplink transmission is ongoing, no data should be scheduled by the network on the 1.8GHz LTE carrier.\nApart from the above EN-DC and NE-DC configurations, TS 38.101-3 also specified inter-band NR-DC configuration between FR1 and FR2. The configurations and bandwidth combination sets for the FR1-FR2 NR-DC combinations are defined in the tables for FR1-FR2 inter-band carrier aggregation.\nIn order to reduce the EN-DC, NE-DC and NR-DC configuration table size, the following rules should be applied to the grouping of the configurations.\n-\tGrouping of DC configurations is based on common band combination.\n-\tIn case E-UTRA or/and NR has non-contiguous CA, it will be on a separate row compared to cases when DC configuration has only single carrier or contiguous CA operation.\n-\tCommon band combination should be considered as the configurations having the same band sequence, such as DC_x-y-y_nz and DC_x-x-y_nz are different band combinations, while all configurations with DC_x-y_nz(*) having non-contiguous parts in band nz are considered as common band combination.\n\nExamples (EN-DC with NR band having non-contiguous part):\n\nExamples (EN-DC with E-UTRA band having non-contiguous part):\n\nExamples (NE-DC with E-UTRA band having non-contiguous part):\n\nExamples (NR-DC with NR band having non-contiguous part):\n\nExamples (Incorrect grouping case):\n\nIn this case, for DC_2_n261, the configurations with non-contiguous CA part CA_n261(*) such as DC_2A_n261(2A), DC_2A_n261(3A) and DC_2A_n261(4A) are mis-grouped with DC_2A_n261A which has only single carrier. They should be revised as follows.\n\nRegarding to the common band combination, it means the configurations having the same band sequence. For example, DC_x-x-y_nz and DC_x-y-y_nz are not considered as the common band combination.\nExamples (Incorrect understanding of common band combination):\n\nIn this case, the configurations DC_2-66_n261, DC_2-2-66_n261 and DC_2-66-66_n261 are not common band combinations. They should be re-grouped as follows.\n\nFor the uplink support in the configuration table, the valid uplink configurations are specified that uplink does not have more carriers than downlink. For the UL configuration type, it should be consistent within one row, i.e., there should not be a mixture of contiguous and non-contiguous UL CA within a row. If multiple UL DC configurations are indicated with multiple DL DC configurations, only UL DC configurations with the same or a lower number of carriers in the same fallback group are valid UL configurations.\nExamples:\n-\tDC_5A_n261G is not a valid uplink configuration for DC_5A_n261A.\n-\tDC_5A_n261(2A) and DC_5A_n261A are not allowed to be in the same row in the configuration table.\nFor the sequence of EN-DC combinations, the following rules apply.\n-\tEN-DC configurations should be sorted by LTE band combination, then NR band combination.\n-\tLTE combinations should be sorted by the first band number, then the first bandwidth character, then the second band number, then the second bandwidth character and so on.\n-\tThe same sort order should be applied for the NR part, there combinations with () should be sorted alphanumerically within the brackets after the contiguous combinations.\nFor the sequence of NE-DC combinations, the following rules apply.\n-\tNE-DC configurations should be sorted by NR band combination, then LTE band combination.\n-\tNR combinations should be sorted by the first band number, then the first bandwidth character, then the second band number, then the second bandwidth character and so on. For the combinations with () should be sorted alphanumerically within the brackets after the contiguous combinations.\n-\tLTE combinations should be sorted by the first band number, then the first bandwidth character, then the second band number, then the second bandwidth character and so on.\nFor the sequence of NR-DC combinations, the following rules apply.\n-\tDC combinations should be sorted by the first band number, then the first bandwidth character, then the second band number, then the second bandwidth character and so on.\n-\tFor the combinations with () should be sorted alphanumerically within the brackets after the contiguous combinations.\nExamples:\n-\tDC_1A_n77A\n-\tDC_1A_n77C\n-\tDC_1C_n77A\n-\tDC_1C-2A_n77A\n-\tDC_41A-42A_n79A\n-\tDC_41A-42C_n79A\n-\tDC_41C-42A_n79A\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n79A\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n257A\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n257M\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n257(2A)\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n257(2A-2O)\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n257(8A)\n-\tDC_41C-42C_n257(D-G)\n",

Currently, the main RF requirements related to specific band combinations include maximum output power (MOP), spurious emission for UE-to-UE coexistence, REFSENS and REFSENS exceptions due to harmonic/harmonic mixing/cross band isolation/IMD interference. Obviously, RF requirements for different features on the same band combination have some similarities and dependency. Especially, the RF implementations are similar and RF architectures can be reused for different features on the same band combination. It’s very meaningful to study the similarity and dependency of RF requirements for different features on the same band combination and find out the feasibility to further optimize the specification structure and reduce the test burden. For example, CA_nA-nB (NR CA), DC_nA-nB (NR-DC), DC_A_nB (EN-DC), DC_B_nA (EN-DC), DC_nB_A (NE-DC), DC_nA_B (NE-DC) (different features on same band combination) can use same RF implementation.\n",

The test points in the reference sensitivity requirements specified for the single band are relaxed by the amount of the corresponding MSD values, shown as an example in Table 7.4-1. For some CA configurations such as CA_n2-n77, CA_n3-n77 and CA_n3-n78, multiple test points with different order IMD are defined, while for some other CA configurations such as CA_n2-n78, only 2nd order IMD2 having the worst case MSD are defined, although the corresponding band is subject to the 5th order IMD5. At the end of the table, a “Note 4” is set to indicate that MSD is not specified for the interfered band although IMD5 may fall into the Rx frequencies of the interfered band. To reduce the test burden, the following guidelines for handling multiple MSD should be taken into consideration.\nTable 7.4-1: Example for inter-band reference sensitivity with multiple MSD\n\nFor a given 2 band DL CA combination, MSD test points corresponding to type 1,2,3 UL configuration are captured in the same table entry.\n-\tType 1: UL configuration = 2 UL CCs configured with intra-band UL CA configured in one of the two band. Intra-band UL CA may be contiguous (like UL CA_n41C) or non-contiguous (like UL CA_n78(2A)).\n-\tType 2: UL configuration = 2 UL CCs configured inter-band UL CA with 1UL CC in each of UL band. Example: UL CA_n3A_n78A.\n-\tType 3: UL configuration = 3 UL CCs with 1 CC in one UL band, and 2 UL CCs configured intra-band CA in the other band. Example: UL CA_n3A-n41C.\nGuideline 1: It is proposed that for the test points with reference sensitivity exceptions due to intermodulation interference with 2UL CA, the limitation to higher order IMD source could be a solution to reduce test burden.\n-\tThe existing IMD MSD requirements in Rel-17 specifications are kept unchanged.\n-\tFor Rel-18 new introduced band combinations,\n–  For type 1 UL configurations (e.g. UL_CA_n41C or CA_n78(2A))\n-\tThe lowest order IMD is recommended as worst case to represent single band UL transmission with UL configured intra-band CA.\n-\tIf the DL band may be affected by a mix of even and odd order IMD products, the MSD value of the lowest even and the lowest odd order IMD, if any, shall be defined in the specifications.\n-\tA footnote shall be attached to the DL band to indicate that MSD may occur for higher order IMD products, and these orders shall be specified in the footnote.\n-\tAs an exception to this rule, a second MSD test point may be specified to capture the MSD that may occur due to the next highest odd order or due to the next highest even order IMD product. This exception ensures regional frequency restrictions are accounted for. For example, in CA_n66_n77 the type 1 IMD7 MSD test point (next highest odd order) may be retained in addition to the type 1 IMD5 MSD test point (lowest odd order).\n-\tA footnote shall be attached to the UL band that is configured intra-band UL CA to distinguish the case of intra-band contiguous vs intra-band non-contiguous CA.\n-\tFor type 2 UL configurations (e.g. UL_CA_n1A-n3A)\nIf only one IMD order occurs per victim band, the MSD value if any shall be defined in the specifications.\nIf the DL band may be affected by a mix of even and odd order IMD products, then the MSD value of the lowest even and the lowest odd order IMD, if any, shall be defined in the specifications.\nA footnote shall be attached to the DL band to indicate that MSD may occur for higher order IMD products, and these orders shall be specified in the footnote.\nIf the DL band may be affected only by multiple even order IMD products, or only by multiple odd order IMD products, then the MSD value of the lowest even order IMD or the MSD value of the lowest odd order IMD, if any, shall be defined in the specifications.\nThe lowest order IMD is recommended as worst case to represent the whole spectrum of the inter-band CA combinations.\nOptionally, a second MSD test point may be specified on a case-by-case basis to account for additional IMD orders. It is recommended this 2nd MSD test point corresponds to the lowest even and the lowest odd order IMD. For example, if DL band is affected by IMD2/3/5, we may consider a maximum of test points: one for IMD2 and one for IMD3.\nAny additional IMD order that is not specified shall be indicated by a note in the table.\n-\tFor type 3 UL configurations (e.g. CA_n3A-n41C or DC_3C_n1A-n75A)\nFor the case when the victim band may be affected by a 1st order triple-beat product Proponents should systematically check if the downlink band may be affected by dual uplink IMD3 interference. If the test point is missing, a dual UL IMD3 MSD test point should be specified.\nIf TB frequency is composed of the frequency sum of the 2 discrete RBs in the contiguous UL CA, there is no need to specify the TB test configuration as the requirement can already be verified by the fallback 2UL IMD3. With reference to WF R4-2220556 [9], only the TB1 product |f1+f2-f3| and TB2 product |f1-f2+f3| should be considered – refer to TB landscape example of Figure 7.4-1.\nThe figure depicts a landscape of 1st order triple beat products for the example of DC_3 C _n1A-n75A, illustrating the various components and their relationships. The figure includes a detailed representation of the 1st order triple beat products, highlighting the relationship between the components and their respective frequencies. The figure also includes a legend to aid in understanding the components and their relationships.\nFigure 7.4-1: Landscape of 1st order triple beat products for the example of DC_3C_n1A-n75A\n-\tIf TB consists of intra-band contiguous UL CA in a FDD band, the selection of test configuration should strive to avoid FDD band self-interference to its own DL carriers with at least up to IMD7.\n-\tThe following WF [9] guidelines remain applicable:\n-\t2.1 WF on Pre-Condition for TB MSD Analysis with 3UL CCs\n-\t2.2 WF on Pre-Condition for TB MSD Analysis with 4UL CCs\n-\t2.3 WF on Triple-Beat Detection for two-band combinations\n-\t2.5 WF on MSD analysis\n-\t2.6 WF on Capturing MSD Test Points\n",
