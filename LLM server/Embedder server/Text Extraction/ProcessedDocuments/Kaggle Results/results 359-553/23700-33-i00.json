The direct communication path over Uu reference point means that the communication with another UE is performed via the network.\nIn this figure, we see a direct communication path switching scenario between PC5 and Uu, illustrating the concept of path switching in a 5G network. The figure depicts the direct communication path between two nodes, PC5 and Uu, with a switch in between. The switch is labeled as Figure a and Figure b, respectively. The figure highlights the importance of path switching in 5G networks, as it allows for efficient communication between different paths, reducing latency and improving network performance.\nFigure 5.3.1-1: Example scenario of direct communication path switching between PC5 and Uu (i.e. switching between Figure a and Figure b)\nWhen switching the path between the direct communication path over PC5 reference point and the direct communication path over Uu reference point, the ProSe service disruption to the UE should be minimized.\nThis key issue addresses the following:\n-\tWhether and how to support path switching from direct NR Uu communication path to direct NR PC5 communication path or vice versa for both commercial and public safety services.\n-\tHow to support any IP, Ethernet or Unstructured PDU type for direct communication path switching.\n-\tWhat functional entities and triggers are responsible for direct communication path switching and their impact on the corresponding interfaces.

The relay is responsible for relaying the signal from the UE to the network, ensuring that the signal is transmitted without any interference.

If the source UE cannot reach the target UE directly, it will try to discover a UE-to-UE relay to reach the target UE which may also trigger the relay to discover the target UE. To be more efficient, this solution tries to integrate target UE discovery and UE-to-UE relay discovery and selection together, including two alternatives:\n-\tAlternative 1: UE-to-UE relay discovery and selection can be integrated into the unicast link establishment procedure as described in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3].\n-\tAlternative 2: UE-to-UE relay discovery and selection is integrated into Model B direct discovery procedure.\nA new field is proposed to be added in the Direct Communication Request or the Solicitation message to indicate whether relays can be used in the communication. The field can be called relay_indication. When a UE wants to broadcast a Direct Communication Request or a Solicitation message, it indicates in the message whether a UE-to-UE relay could be used. For Release 18, it is assumed that the value of the indication is restricted to single hop.\nWhen a UE-to-UE relay receives a Direct Communication Request or a Solicitation message with the relay_indication set, then it shall decide whether to forward the message (i.e. modify the message and broadcast it in its proximity), according to e.g. Relay Service Code if there is any, Application ID, authorization policy (e.g. relay for specific ProSe Service), the current traffic load of the relay, the radio conditions between the source UE and the relay UE, etc.\nIt may exist a situation where multiple UE-to-UE relays can be used to reach the target UE or the target UE may also directly receive the Direct Communication Request or Solicitation message from the source UE. The target UE may choose which one to reply according to e.g. signal strength, local policy (e.g. traffic load of the UE-to-UE relays), Relay Service Code if there is any or operator policies (e.g. always prefer direct communication or only use some specific UE-to-UE relays).\nThe source UE may receive the responses from multiple UE-to-UE relays and may also from the target UE directly, the source UE chooses the communication path according to e.g. signal strength or operator policies (e.g. always prefer direct communication or only use some specific UE-to-UE relays).\n",

                            "text_content": "The figure depicts a relay selection scenario for a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE communication link, with two alternative relay selection methods: 1) using a single-hop relay (Option 1) and 2) using a multi-hop relay (Option 2). The figure illustrates the process of selecting a relay based on the distance between the source and destination, the signal strength, and the network topology. The relay selection is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient communication in 5G networks.\nFigure 6.1.2.1-1 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay selection (Alternative 1)\nFigure 6.1.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure of the proposed method.\n0.\tUEs are authorized to use the service provided by the UE-to-UE relays. UE-to-UE relays are authorized to provide service of relaying traffic among UEs. The authorization and the parameter provisioning can use solutions for KI#5. The authorization can be done when UEs/relays are registered to the network. Security related parameters may be provisioned so that a UE and a relay can verify the authorization with each other if needed.\n1.\tUE-1 wants to establish unicast communication with UE-2 and the communication can be either through direct link with UE-2 or via a UE-to-UE relay. Then UE-1 broadcasts Direct Communication Request with relay_indication enabled. The message will be received by relay-1, relay-2. The message may also be received by UE-2 if it is in the proximity of UE-1. UE-1 includes source UE info, target UE info, Application ID, as well as Relay Service Code if there is any. If UE-1 does not want relay to be involved in the communication, then it will made relay_indication disabled.\nNOTE 1:\tThe data type of relay_indication can be determined in Stage 3. Details of Direct Communication Request/Accept messages will be determined in stage 3.\n2.\tRelay-1 and relay-2 decide to participate in the procedure. They broadcast a new Direct Communication Request message in their proximity without relay_indication enabled. If a relay receives this message, it will just drop it. When a relay broadcasts the Direct Communication Request message, it includes source UE info, target UE info and Relay UE info (e.g. Relay UE ID) in the message and use Relay's L2 address as the source Layer-2 ID. The Relay maintains association between the source UE information (e.g. source UE L2 ID) and the new Direct Communication Request.\n3.\tUE-2 receives the Direct Communication Requests from relay-1 and relay-2. UE-2 may also receive Direct Communication Request message directly from the UE-1 if the UE-2 is in the communication range of UE-1.\n4.\tUE-2 chooses relay-1 and replies with Direct Communication Accept message. If UE-2 directly receives the Direct Communication Request from UE-1, it may choose to setup a direct communication link by sending the Direct Communication Accept message directly to UE-1. After receiving Direct Communication Accept, a UE-to-UE relay retrieves the source UE information stored in step 2 and sends the Direct Communication Accept message to the source UE with its Relay UE info added in the message.\nAfter step 4, UE-1 and UE-2 have respectively setup the PC5 links with the chosen UE-to-UE relay.\nNOTE 2:\tThe security establishment between the UE1 and Relay-1, and between Relay-1 and UE-2 are performed before the Relay-1 and UE-2 send Direct Communication Accept message. Details of the authentication/ security establishment procedure are determined by SA WG3. The security establishment procedure can be skipped if there already exists a PC5 link between the source (or target) UE and the relay which can be used for relaying the traffic.\n5.\tUE-1 receives the Direct Communication Accept message from relay-1. UE-1 chooses path according to e.g. policies (e.g. always choose direct path if it is possible), signal strength, etc. If UE-1 receives Direct Communication Accept / Response message request accept directly from UE-2, it may choose to setup a direct PC5 L2 link with UE-2 as described in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3], then step 6 is skipped.\n6a.\tFor the L3 UE-to-UE Relay case, UE-1 and UE-2 finish setting up the communication link via the chosen UE-to-UE relay. The link setup information may vary depending on the type of relay, e.g. L2 or L3 relaying. Then UE-1 and UE-2 can communicate via the relay. Regarding IP address allocation for the source/remote UE, the addresses can be either assigned by the relay or by the UE itself (e.g. link-local IP address) as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3].\n6b. For the Layer 2 UE-to-UE Relay case, the source and target UE can setup an end-to-end PC5 link via the relay. UE-1 sends a unicast E2E Direct Communication Request message to UE-2 via the Relay-1, and UE-2 responds with a unicast E2E Direct Communication Accept message to UE-1 via the Relay-1. Relay-1 transfers the messages based on the identity information of UE-1/UE-2 in the Adaptation Layer.\nNOTE 3:\tHow Relay-1 can transfer the messages based on the identity information of UE-1/UE-2 in the Adaptation Layer requires cooperation with RAN2 during the normative phase.\nNOTE 4:\tIn order to make a relay or path selection, the source UE can setup a timer after sending out the Direct Communication Request for collecting the corresponding response messages before making a decision. Similarly, the target UE can also setup a timer after receiving the first copy of the Direct Communication Request / message for collecting multiple copies of the message from different paths before making a decision.\nNOTE 5:\tIn the first time when a UE receives a message from a UE-to-UE relay, the UE needs to verify if the relay is authorized be a UE-to-UE relay. Similarly, the UE-to-UE relay may also need to verify if the UE is authorized to use the relay service. The verification details and the how to secure the communication between two UEs through a UE-to-UE relay is to be defined by SA WG3.\nDepicted in Figure 6.1.2.2-1 is the procedure for UE-UE Relay discovery Model B, and the discovery/selection procedure is separated from hop by hop and end-to-end link establishment.\nThe figure depicts a relay selection scenario for a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE communication link, with two alternative relay selection methods: 1) using a 5G ProSe relay and 2) using a 4G ProSe relay. The figure illustrates the process of selecting a relay based on the signal strength and the distance between the source and destination. The relay selection is crucial for ensuring reliable communication in a 5G network, as it helps to overcome potential signal attenuation and interference.\nFigure 6.1.2.2-1 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay selection (Alternative 2)\n1.\tUE-1 broadcasts discovery solicitation message carrying UE-1 info, target UE info (UE-2), Application ID, Relay Service Code if any, the UE-1 can also indicate relay_indication enabled.\n2.\tOn reception of discovery solicitation, the candidate Relay UE-R broadcasts discovery solicitation carrying UE-1 info, UE-R info, Target UE info. The Relay UE-R uses Relay's L2 address as the source Layer-2 ID.\n3.\tThe target UE-2 responds the discovery message. If the UE-2 receives discovery solicitation message in step 1, then UE-2 responds discovery response in step 3b with UE-1 info, UE-2 info. If not and UE-2 receives discovery solicitation in step 2, then UE-2 responds discovery response message in step 3a with UE-1 info, UE-R info, UE-2 info.\n4.\tOn reception of discovery response in step 3a, UE-R sends discovery response with UE-1 info, UE-R info, UE-2 info. If more than one candidate Relay UEs responding discovery response message, UE-1 can select one Relay UE based on e.g. implementation or link qualification.\n5.\tThe source and target UE may need to setup PC5 links with the relay before communicating with each other. Step 5a can be skipped if there already exists a PC5 link between the UE-1 and UE-R which can be used for relaying. Step 5b can be skipped if there already exists a PC5 link between the UE-2 and UE-R which can be used for relaying.\n6a.\tSame as step 6a described in clause 6.1.2.1.\n6b.\tFor the Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay, the E2E unicast Direct Communication Request message is sent from UE1 to the selected Relay via the per-hop link (established in steps 5a) and the Adaptation layer info identifying the peer UE (UE3) as the destination. The UE-to-UE Relay transfers the E2E messages based on the identity information of peer UE in the Adaptation Layer. The initiator (UE1) knows the Adaptation layer info identifying the peer UE (UE3) after a discovery procedure. UE3 responds with E2E unicast Direct Communication Accept message in the same way.\nNOTE 1:\tFor the Layer 2 UE-to-UE Relay case, whether step5b is performed before step 6b or triggered during step 6b will be decided at normative phase.\nNOTE 2:\tHow Relay-1 can transfer the messages based on the identity information of UE-1/UE-2 in the Adaptation Layer requires cooperation with RAN2 during the normative phase.\n",

These UEs will be configured according to the service authorization and provisioning mechanism defined in TS 23.304 [3] to operate in the UE-to-UE Relay mode.\n-\tProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay discovery:\n-\tThe ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay sends out a Relay Discovery message periodically, announcing its availability for serving other UEs in the area.\n-\tThe ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay also supports the query and response mode for discovery. The ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay listens on a configured Layer-2 ID for the query, and would respond with its address and corresponding information to enable to other UE to establish a unicast connection with it. This process is similar to the unicast L2 link establishment procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3].\nNOTE 2:\tThe Layer-2 ID used for the discovery can be specific for UE-to-UE Relay discovery, or shared with other discoveries, e.g. UE-to-Network Relay discovery.\n-\tProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay operation:\n-\tAny UE that wants to make use of the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay needs to establish a unicast L2 link with the UE-to-UE Relay, with IP configuration. The ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay allocates IP address/prefix to the other UEs.\n-\tAs part of the unicast L2 link establishment procedure, the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay stores an association of the User Info of the peer UE of the unicast link (or ProSe Service provided by the peer UE) and the IP address/prefix allocated to the UE into its DNS entries. The ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay acts as a DNS server to other UEs.\n-\tWhen a (source) UE needs to communicate with another (target) UE or needs to discover a ProSe service via the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay, it sends a DNS query for the target UE (based on Target User Info) or for the ProSe Service to the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay over the unicast link, which will return the IP address/prefix of the target UE or the IP address(es)/prefix(es) of UEs which provide the ProSe Service.\nIf there are multiple UEs supporting the same ProSe Service, the (source) UE can select a UE(s) based on UE implementation.\n-\tThe source UE sends the IP data or non-IP data encapsulated in IP to the target UE or to the selected UE(s) which provide(s) the ProSe Service via the unicast L2 link to UE-to-UE Relay that returned the IP address/prefix of the target UE or UE(s) which provide(s) the ProSe Service. The ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay acts as an IP router, and forwards the packets to the corresponding unicast L2 link towards the target UE or UE(s) which provide(s) the ProSe Service. Each of the unicast L2 link is treated as an IP interface.\n-\tIf there are multiple ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relays in the proximity, UE can choose either one or more ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relays to establish the unicast L2 link based on UE implementation. For example, the UE sends a DNS query on each of the unicast L2 link to the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relays. Then, the source UE may choose to use the first ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay that returns a positive DNS query for the target UE.\nNOTE 3:\tThe selection of the UE-to-UE Relay may be based on local configured rules on the UE, or based on other discovery solutions, e.g. \"Stateful UE-to-UE Relay\" described in clause 6.3.\n-\tQoS handling:\n-\tWhen the source UE establishes the unicast L2 link with the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay, it can establish corresponding PC5 QoS Flows according to procedure defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3]. It can also modify the PC5 QoS Flows at any time using procedure defined in clause 6.4.3.4 of TS 23.304 [3].\n-\tCorrespondingly, the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay can also establish and modify the PC5 QoS Flows using the above-mentioned procedures over the unicast L2 Link with the target UE based on PC5 Packet Filter received from the source UE during the PC5 QoS flow establishment/modification procedure or destination IP address of IP packet received from the source UE for the forwarding of source UE's traffic. The ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay determines the PC5 QoS parameters of PC5 QoS Flows with target UE based on corresponding PC5 QoS Flows with target UE.\n-\tSecurity handling:\n-\tsource UE and target UE can establish bearer level security with the UE-to-UE Relay for the unicast L2 Link, using procedures defined in TS 23.304 [3].\n-\tIf end-to-end security protection is required between source UE and target UE, IPSec can be used.\nNOTE 4:\tThe security protection of the traffic of source UE and target UE will be specified by SA WG3.\n-\tCharging Support:\n-\tProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay can follow the charging solution defined in TS 32.277 [10] to report the source and target UEs and corresponding traffic to the charging function.\n",

The figure illustrates the process of selecting a relay and the steps involved in the relay discovery process. The figure also includes a model A for the relay discovery process, which is a simplified version of the actual process.\nFigure 6.3.3.1.1-1: UE-to-UE Relay discovery with Model A\n1.\tUE-1 (\"this UE\") performs the Group Member Discovery procedure (either Model A or Model B) as defined in TS 23.304 [3].

The figure illustrates the process of selecting a relay node based on the distance between the two UEs, the signal strength, and the quality of the network. The relay node is then connected to the UE, and the UE sends a request to the relay node to establish the connection. The relay node then sends a response back to the UE, confirming the connection and providing the necessary information for the UE to proceed with the connection.\nFigure 6.3.3.1.2-1: UE-to-UE Relay discovery with Model B\n1-2.

The frame format is crucial for ensuring efficient data transmission and is used in the ProSe protocol, which is a 5G communication standard. The figure also includes a relay node, which is a key component in the ProSe communication system, facilitating the transmission of data packets between the sender and receiver.\nFigure 6.3.3.2.2-1: Layer-2 frame format for ProSe 5G communication via Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay\nWhen UE1 sends a packet to UE2 via the Relay, in reference to Figure 6.3.3.2.2-1 the fields in the Layer-2 header are ste as follows:\n-\tSource Layer-2 ID: Identifies the sender of the data (UE-1).\n-\tDestination Layer-2 ID: Identifies the Relay (UE-R).\nThe final destination (i.e. UE-2) is identified via the Destination IP address in the IP packet header.\nNOTE:\tThe Layer-2 frame in Figure 6.3.3.2.2-1 is a high-level illustration of the required addressing functionality in Layer-2 header. The exact Layer-2 frame format is in the scope of RAN WGs.\nThe procedures for communication via the stateful UE-to-UE Layer-3 Relay are performed at layer-3 as described in clause 6.2, the stateful UE-to-UE Relay acting as an IP router.\nWhen the communication via the stateful UE-to-UE Relay is performed at layer-2, the Layer-2 frame header is used as illustrated in Figure 6.3.3.2.3-1. In addition to the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID fields, the header has in addition a \"Relay Layer-2 ID\" field and a \"Direction\" field:\n-\t\"Relay Layer-2 ID\": identifies the UE-to-UE Relay.\n-\t\"Direction\" indicates whether the Layer-2 frame is being transmitted \"To the Relay\" or \"From the Relay\".\nThe figure depicts an extended Layer-2 frame format for ProSe 5G communication, which is used for relaying data between the UE (User Equipment) and the Layer-2 network. The frame format is designed to support the ProSe protocol, which is a lightweight and efficient communication protocol for 5G networks. The figure shows the structure of the frame, including the header, data, and control sections, and illustrates the use of the extended Layer-2 frame format for efficient data transmission.\nFigure 6.3.3.2.3-1: Extended Layer-2 frame format for ProSe 5G communication via Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay\nWhen UE-1 wishes to send data to UE-2 via UE-R, the addressing identifiers in the Layer-2 frame are set as follows:\n-\tSource Layer-2 ID: identifies UE-1.\n-\tDestination Layer-2 ID: identifies UE-2.\n-\tRelay Layer-2 ID: identifies the Relay (UE-R).\n-\tDirection = \"To Relay\".\nWhen UE-R forwards the Layer-2 frame to UE-2, the addressing identifiers in the Layer-2 frame are set as follows:\n-\tSource Layer-2 ID: identifies UE-1.\n-\tDestination Layer-2 ID: identifies UE-2.\n-\tRelay Layer-2 ID: identifies UE-R.\n-\tDirection = \"From Relay\".\nNOTE1:\tThe Layer-2 frame in Figure 6.3.3.2.3-1 is a high-level illustration of the required addressing functionality in Layer-2 header.

This solution is applicable for both Layer 2 UE-to-UE Relay and Layer 3 UE-to-UE Relay.\nNOTE:\tThe solution was Solution #31 of TR 23.752 [2].\nWhen a source UE wants to establish unicast communication with a target UE, the source UE will decide the E2E QoS parameters between source UE and target UE based on the application layer requirements. The E2E QoS parameters, especially the PDB, needs to be split between the two PC5 interface. The PER of the two PC5 interfaces also needs to be set properly to achieve the PER target in the E2E QoS parameters.\nRelay will split the E2E QoS parameters into two parts: one part is the QoS parameters between source UE and Relay (we call it \"Source side PC5 QoS parameters\"), the other part is the QoS parameters between Relay and the target UE (we call it \"Target side PC5 QoS parameters\").\nWhen standardized PQI is used, the Source side PC5 QoS parameters and the Target side PC5 QoS parameters include PQI and other optional QoS parameters, e.g. GFBR. When non-standardized PQI is used, the whole set of PC5 QoS characteristics is also included.\nRelay ensures the PDB and PER associated with the PQI in the Source side PC5 QoS parameters and the PDB and PER associated with the PQI in the Target side PC5 QoS parameters supports the E2E PDB requirements between Remote UE and target UE. Relay also ensures other QoS parameters/QoS characteristics in the Source side PC5 QoS parameters and Target side PC5 QoS parameters are compatible, e.g. have the same value. The Relay decision may be based on the local policy or the low layer measurement.\nOptionally, it's possible that the source UE is pre-configured with authorized service(s) and the related Source side PC5 QoS parameters, the UE-to-UE Relay is pre-configured with authorized service(s) and the related Target side PC5 QoS parameters. These can be provided by PCF during provisioning procedure. The authorized service can be identified by Relay Service Code etc. With the preconfigured QoS parameters, the source UE provides the Source side PC5 QoS parameters to the UE-to-UE Relay by the procedure defined in clause 6.4.3.1 or clause 6.4.3.4 of TS 23.304 [3], then the UE-to-UE Relay identifies the authorized service and establishes the corresponding PC5 QoS Flows with the Target UE using the preconfigured Target side PC5 QoS parameters.\nE2E QoS parameters splitting is common for both Layer 2 UE-to-UE Relay and Layer 3 UE-to-UE Relay. The difference lies in the QoS flow. In the Layer 3 UE-to-UE Relay case, two QoS flows are setup, one QoS flow between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay UE, and another QoS flow between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay UE. In the Layer 2 UE-to-UE Relay case, the end-to-end QoS flow is setup between the Source UE and the Target UE.\n",

Since there is no IP headers in the Non-IP packets, the UE-to-UE relay cannot use destination IP addresses to forward the packets, In this solution, the UE-to-UE relay uses the Layer-2 IDs in the incoming Layer-2 frames to find the correct outgoing PC5 links. Basically, the solution is based on the following principles:\n1.\tFor a specific source UE, it establishes a PC5 link for Non-IP traffic with the UE-to-UE relay for each target UE it wants to communicate via that relay. This principle means that the Non-IP traffic to different target UEs from the same source UE cannot share the same PC5 link between the source UE and the UE-to-UE relay.\n2.\tFor each pair of source and target UEs, the UE-to-UE relay assigns itself a Layer-2 ID, denoted as L2-ID_R, which is used in the Non-IP PC5 link to the source UE and the Non-IP PC5 link to the target UE. The UE-to-UE relay maintains a mapping between L2-ID_R and a pair of source and target UEs. The source and target UEs store the mapping information when establishing relay path between the source and target UEs via the UE-to-UE relay. When the source and target UEs send Non-IP traffic to each other via the UE-to-UE relay, they use L2-ID_R as the destination Layer-2 ID. When the UE-to-UE relay receives a packet, according to the L2-ID_R and the source L2-ID it can forward the packet to the correct PC5 link based on the mapping, it also changes the destination L2-ID from L2-ID_R to the correct Layer2 ID of the target UE. The source and target UEs identify the original UE when receiving packets from the UE-to-UE relay according to the mapping information.\nThe figure depicts a user plane protocol stack of PC5 when using Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay to forward Non-IP traffic. It illustrates the various protocols and their interactions, including the use of a relay to forward non-IP traffic.\nFigure 6.6.1.1-1: User plane protocol stack of PC5 when using Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay to forward Non-IP traffic\nRegarding QoS handling, solution #4 is adopted to achieve end-to-end QoS control via UE-to-UE relay. Basically, for a specific PC5 QoS flow, say PFI_s, in the Non-IP PC5 link with the source UE, the UE-to-UE relay maps it to a specific PC5 QoS flow, say PFI_t, in the Non-IP PC5 link with the target UE. Incoming traffic from one of the flows is forwarded by the UE-to-UE relay to the other flow.\nFor end-to-end security, IPsec cannot be used, since it is not IP traffic. It is up to the application to implement end-to-end security for non-IP traffic.\nEditor's note:\tHow to handle end-to-end security for Non-IP traffic is FFS and shall be co-ordinated with SA WG3 group.\n",

In this step, any solution for UE-to-UE relay selection can be applied here.\n1.\tSource UE wants to start Non-IP communication with the target UE. It starts to establish a PC5 unicast link with the relay by sending a Direct Communication Request to the relay as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3]. In the request, the source UE indicates that the PC5 link is used for Non-IP communication to the target UE.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS if traffic type, e.g. IP or Non-IP, can be derived from the ProSe Application ID.\n2.\tThe UE-to-UE relay assigns itself a Layer-2 ID, denoted as L2-ID_R, which is used in the Non-IP PC5 link to the source UE and the Non-IP PC5 link to the target UE.

If no new UE-to-UE Relay is chosen, the Target UE may not respond to Source UE or send a response indicating Relay reselection failure.\n6.\t[Optional] If the Target UE choses a new UE-to-UE Relay in step 5, the Source UE initiates the connection setup procedure via the new UE-to-UE Relay, and also releases the connection via Relay 1.\nFigure 6.7.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for UE-to-UE Relay re-selection for Layer-2 based.\nThe figure depicts a relay selection mechanism in a 7x7 grid-based network, where each cell is assigned a unique identifier (UE-to-UE relay). The relay selection process involves selecting the most suitable relay based on the current network conditions, such as the number of active connections and the distance between the source and destination. This mechanism ensures efficient network utilization and minimizes the number of redundant connections, which is crucial for maintaining high network performance.\nFigure 6.7.2.1-1: Layer-2 based UE-to-UE Relay Re-selection\n1.\tA PC5 unicast link is established between Source UE and Target UE via Relay 1 (using any L2 UE-to-UE Relay solution).\n2.\tTraffic is exchanged between the Source UE and the Target UE over the PC5 unicast link, via Relay 1.\n3.\tSource UE detects a condition or receives a trigger to change the UE-to-UE Relay. The Source UE may perform a discovery procedure to obtain a list of candidate UE-to-UE Relay IDs (i.e. RIDs).\n4.\tSource UE sends a Link Modification Request message to Target UE (via Relay 1) including a Relay re-selection indication, a list of candidate RIDs and a source UE link ID, which is used on the Source UE, at steps 9 and/or 10, to associate the existing PC5 unicast link via Relay 1 to the replacing PC5 unicast link with the selected Relay (e.g. Relay 2).\n5.\tTarget UE selects a Relay from the received list of candidate RIDs (e.g. Relay 2).\n6.\tTarget UE sends a Link Modification Accept message to Source UE (via Relay 1) including the Relay re-selection indication, its Selected RID and a target UE link ID, which is used on the Target UE, at step, 8 to associate the existing PC5 unicast link via Relay 1 to the replacing PC5 unicast link with the selected Relay (i.e. Relay 2).\nThere are two options for the E2E PC5 connection establishment with the newly selected UE-to-UE Relay. Option A is from Step 7 to Step 11, where the per-hop links are established during the E2E PC5 link establishment procedure. Option B is from Step 12 to Step 13, where the per-hop links are established before the E2E PC5 link establishment procedure.\n7.\tSource UE sends a broadcast Direct Communication Request (DCR) message including the Target UE user info, and the Selected RID and the target UE link ID received from Target UE during the Relay re-selection at step 6.\n8.\tRelay 2 receives the DCR message and verifies if the \"Selected RID\" value matches its own RID and forwards the DCR message only if the \"Selected RID\" value matches its own RID. The UE-to-UE Relay adds its RID to the forwarded DCR message (as specified in Layer-2 based sol #9 of TR 23.752 [2]). Target UE receives the DCR message and validates that the target UE link ID matches its link ID as previously sent to Source UE (at step 6). Target UE also verifies that the DCR message is received from its selected RID (i.e. RID2). Target UE uses the target UE link ID to find the previous PC5 unicast link to be replaced by the new PC5 unicast link. The association between the Application Layer identifier and the PC5 unicast link via Relay 1 is updated with the new PC5 unicast link via Relay 2 once the traffic is ready to be switched to the new PC5 unicast link (via Relay 2) (i.e. at step 12).\n9.\tTarget UE may trigger the security establishment procedure, via Relay 2, and include the source UE link ID, as received on the Link Modification Request at step 4. The security establishment procedure may be skipped if the existing security context used with the previous PC5 unicast link is re-used with the replacing PC5 unicast link, allowing a quicker link setup and path switching. Source UE uses the source UE link ID to find the previous PC5 unicast link with Relay 1 to be replaced by the new PC5 unicast link being established (i.e. via Relay 2). The association between the Application Layer identifier and the PC5 unicast link via Relay 1 is updated with the new PC5 unicast link via Relay 2 once the traffic is ready to be switched to the new PC5 unicast link (via Relay 2) (i.e. at step 12).\n10.\tTarget UE sends a Direct Communication Accept message which may include the source UE link ID from Source UE as received at step (4).\n11.\tA new PC5 unicast link is established between the Source UE and Target UE via the Relay 2.\n12.\tThis step is same as step 3 of Figure 6 30.2.1.2-1 in Sol#30.\n13.\tThis step is same as steps 4-6 of Figure 6.30.2.2-1 in clause 6.3.2.2 of Sol#30 with the target UE link ID received from Target UE during the Relay reselection at step 6 specified on the DCR message. Target UE uses the target UE link ID to find the previous PC5 unicast link to be replaced by the new PC5 unicast link. Target UE may trigger the security establishment procedure, via Relay 2, and include the source UE link ID, as received on the Link Modification Request at step 4. Source UE uses the source UE link ID to find the previous PC5 unicast link with Relay 1 to be replaced by the new PC5 unicast link being established (i.e. via Relay 2)\n14.\tSource UE and Target UE switch the data traffic to the new PC5 unicast link via Relay 2. Source UE or Target UE may terminate the PC5 unicast link via Relay 1.\nFigure 6.7.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for UE-to-UE Relay re-selection for Layer-3 based solution (as defined in Sol#2).\nThe figure depicts a relay selection mechanism in a 7x7 grid-based network, where each cell is assigned a unique identifier (UE-to-UE relay). The relay selection process is based on the layer-3 protocol, which is a key component of the 7x7 grid-based network architecture. The figure illustrates the process of selecting a relay for a specific UE, ensuring that the network remains reliable and efficient.\nFigure 6.7.2.2-1: Layer-3 based UE-to-UE Relay Re-selection\n1.\tSource UE has a PC5 unicast link established with Relay 1.\n1a.\tTarget UE has a PC5 unicast link established with Relay 1 and exchange IP packets via Relay 1.\n2.\tSource UE has a PC5 unicast link established with Relay 2.\n2a.\tTarget UE has a PC5 unicast link established with Relay 2.\n3.\tSource UE and Target UE exchange IP packets via Relay 1.\n4.\tSource UE detects or receives a trigger to change the Relay.\n5.\tSource UE sends a PC5 Link Modification Request message for Target UE (via the PC5 unicast link with Relay 1) which includes a Relay reselection indication, a list of candidate Relay IDs (RIDs), Source UE and Target UE IP addresses used to communicate via Relay 1. The IP addresses are specified since the PC5 Link Modification message does not include these IP addresses which are needed at the Relay to fetch the corresponding PC5 unicast link from its mapping table toward the Target UE (as specified in sol#2).\nThe list of candidate RIDs is selected based on the PC5 unicast links already established between Source UE and such Relays (RIDs). The IP address of multiple Target UE s may be specified in the case where Source UE is communicating with multiple Target UEs via Relay 1.\n6.\tRelay 1 determines that the message is destined to the Target UE based on the \"Relay reselection indication\" and Target UE's IP address. Relay 1 sends a PC5 Link Modification Request message to Target UE's IP address (as specified in the message); if multiple Target UEs are impacted, the Relay 1 sends a PC5 Link Modification Request to each of these Target UEs.\n7.\tBased on the relay reselection indication, Target UE knows that the communication with Source UE needs to be handled via another Relay. Target UE selects a RID from the list of candidate RIDs. Target UE may select a RID with which a PC5 unicast link is already established or Target UE may establish a new link with the selected RID.\n8.\tTarget UE sends a Link Modification Accept message to Relay 1, which includes a Relay reselection indication, Source UE and Target UE IP addresses used via Relay 1, and Target UE's IP address used via Relay 2 and the selected RID (e.g. RID2).\n9.\tRelay 1, based on the relay reselection indication, sends a PC5 Link Modification Accept message to Source UE using the specified Source UE's IP address.\n10.\tSource UE extracts the selected Relay ID (RID2) from the Link Modification Accept message and sends a Link Modification Ack message which includes its IP address associated to Relay 2.\n11.\tRelay 2 receives this message and forwards it to the Target UE since the Relay reselection indication is specified. This Ack message is needed to synchronise the switch of traffic between the Source UE and Target UE, via the selected UE (Relay 2), at the same time.\n12.\tFrom this point on, Source UE and Target UE switch the IP traffic to the new PC5 unicast link via Relay 2 (since Source UE and Target UE have exchanged their respective IP address in above steps they can skip performing DNS query steps with Relay 2).\n",

The relay is equipped with a 5G ProSe\nFigure 6.9.2-1: 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay operation\nFigure 6.9.2-1 provides an example operation for the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay\n1.\tAuthorization /parameter provisioning for UE-to-UE Relay Service has been performed.\n2a.\tA ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay sends out a Relay Announcement message periodically to its proximity, announcing its availability as a UE-to-UE relay. In the Announcement message, it includes its User Info ID, a Relay Service Code (RSC), a list of UEs that are reachable by the relay, we can call it target UE list.\n2b.\tWhen a UE receives a Relay Announcement message, it can decide if it can use the relay according to e.g. Relay Service Code, the User Info ID (e.g. only use some specific UE-to-UE relays). If the relay can serve the UE and the UE wants to be discovered by other UEs via this relay, the UE will send an Announcement message with its own User Info ID and the relay User Info ID. When the relay receives an Announcement message from a UE and the message contains the User Info ID of the relay, the relay will add the User Info ID of that UE into its target UE list.\nWhen a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay receives an Announcement message with target UE list, it may, according to its configuration or policy, add the target the UE list in it own target UE list for each target UE.\n3.\tWhen the source UE wants to communicate with the target UE via a UE-to-UE relay, the source UE will choose a relay whose target UE list includes the corresponding target UE ID. If there are multiple relays can reach the target UE, then the source UE may select the relay according to relay selection criteria.\n4a, 4b.\tThe source UE may establish a PC5 link with the selected 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay and the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay may establish a PC5 link with the target UE. The details will be addressed in other solutions of KI#1.\nThe ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay stores an association of the User Info of the peer UE of the unicast link and the IP address/prefix of the UE into its DNS entries. The 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay acts as a DNS server to other UEs.\n5.\tFor IP traffic, the source UE sends a DNS query for the target UE (based on Target User Info to the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay over the unicast link), which will return the IP address/prefix of the target UE.\n",

For example, the UE-to-UE Relay may perform the Group Member Discovery procedure (either Model A or Model B) or Direct Discovery procedure (either Model A or Model B) with the RSC it supports to discover target UEs it can announce.\nNOTE:\tIn order to keep an up-to-date target UE list, UEs want to be discovered by other UEs via the UE-to-UE Relay periodically performs the Discovery procedure, or response to the UE-to-UE Relay Announcement as described in sol#9.

The relay is connected to a Model A relay, which is part of a relay chain. The relay chain is designed to ensure reliable communication, with redundant paths to ensure failover in case of failure. The figure illustrates the concept of SDN (Software-Defined Networking) in a 5G network, where the network is designed to be flexible and adaptable to changing network conditions.\nFigure 6.12.2.1.1-1: UE-to-UE Relay discovery with Model A\n1.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay has discovered other UEs in proximity via the previous direct discovery or direct communication procedures. The UE-to-UE Relay obtains the User Info ID, Relay Service Code (RSC) and Layer-2 ID of other UEs in proximity. The UE-to-UE Relay may buffer these parameters for subsequent UE-to-UE Relay communication as described in clause 6.12.2.2. These parameters will be removed by UE-to-UE Relay if the buffer timer expired.\n2.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay sends an Announcement message.

The relay node is connected to a base station (BS) through a 2-hop relay, and the UE is connected to the BS through a 1-hop relay. The figure illustrates the use of a Model B relay discovery protocol, which is a key component in the 12-hop wireless network.\nFigure 6.12.2.1.2-1: UE-to-UE Relay discovery with Model B\n1.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay may have discovered other UEs in proximity via the previous direct discovery or direct communication procedures. The UE-to-UE Relay obtains the User Info ID, Relay Service Code (RSC) and Layer-2 ID of other UEs in proximity.\n2.\tThe Source UE sends a Solicitation message. The Solicitation message may include the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of Source UE, RSC, and User Info ID of Target UE.\nThe Source Layer-2 ID of the Announcement message is self-assigned by the Source UE, and the Destination Layer-2 ID is selected based on the ProSe policy.\n3.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay may perform direct discovery procedure to discover the Target UE if it has not been discovered in step 1. The UE-to-UE Relay obtains the User Info ID, Relay Service Code (RSC) and Layer-2 ID of Target UEs in proximity. The UE-to-UE Relay may buffer these parameters for subsequent UE-to-UE Relay communication as described in clause 6.12.2.2. These parameters will be removed by UE-to-UE Relay if the buffer timer expired.\n4.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay that match the values of the User Info ID of Target UE and RSC contained in the Solicitation message respond to the Source UE with a Response message. The Response message contains the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, RSC, and User Info ID of Target UE.\nThe Source Layer-2 ID of the Response message is self-assigned by the UE-to-UE Relay, and the Destination Layer-2 ID is set to the Source Layer-2 ID of the received Solicitation message.\nDepicted in figure 6.12.2.2-1 is the procedure for Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay communication.\nThe figure depicts a relay communication system in a 5G network, illustrating the communication between two base stations (UE-to-UE relay) and a central processing unit (CPU). The system uses a relay node to forward data packets between the two base stations, ensuring reliable communication. The figure also shows the use of relay nodes, which are essential for maintaining the network's performance and reliability.\nFigure 6.12.2.2-1: Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay communication\n1.\tService authorization and provisioning are performed for Source UE, Target UE and UE-to-UE Relay as described for solutions for Key Issue #6.\n2.\tThe Source UE performs discovery of a UE-to-UE Relay as described in clause 6.12.2.1.\n3.\tThe Source UE sends a Direct Communication Request message to initiate the unicast Layer-2 link establishment procedure with the UE-to-UE Relay. The Direct Communication Request message includes User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE and Relay Service Code (RSC).\nThe Source Layer-2 ID of the DCR message is self-assigned by the Source UE, and the Destination Layer-2 ID is set to the Source Layer-2 ID of the discovery message of UE-to-UE Relay.\n4.\tIf the User Info ID of Target UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay and RSC are included in the Direct Communication Request, the UE-to-UE Relay responds by establishing the security with Source UE. When the security protection is enabled, the Source UE sends IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address (if IP communication is used), QoS Info (PFI and PC5 QoS parameters).\nThe Source Layer-2 ID used for the security establishment procedure is self-assigned by the UE-to-UE Relay, and the Destination Layer-2 ID is set to the Source Layer-2 ID of the received Direct Communication Request message.\nUpon receiving the security establishment procedure messages, the Source UE obtains the UE-to-UE Relay's Layer-2 ID for future communication, for signalling and data traffic for this unicast link.\n5.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay sends a Direct Communication Accept message to the Source UE that has successfully established security with UE-to-UE Relay. The Direct Communication Accept message includes User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE, QoS Info (PFI and split PC5 QoS parameters), RSC, IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address (if IP communication is used).\n6.\tTriggered by step 3, the UE-to-UE Relay sends a Direct Communication Request message to initiate the unicast Layer-2 link establishment procedure with the Target UE. The Direct Communication Request message includes User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE and Relay Service Code (RSC).\nThe Source Layer-2 ID of the DCR message is self-assigned by the UE-to-UE Relay, and the Destination Layer-2 ID is set to the Source Layer-2 ID of the discovery message of Target UE.\n7.\tIf the User Info ID of Target UE and RSC are included in the Direct Communication Request, the Target UE responds by establishing the security with UE-to-UE Relay. When the security protection is enabled, the UE-to-UE Relay sends IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address (if IP communication is used), QoS Info (PFI and split PC5 QoS parameters).\nThe Source Layer-2 ID used for the security establishment procedure is self-assigned by the Target UE, and the Destination Layer-2 ID is set to the Source Layer-2 ID of the received Direct Communication Request message.\nUpon receiving the security establishment procedure messages, the UE-to-UE Relay obtains the Target UE's Layer-2 ID for future communication, for signalling and data traffic for this unicast link.\n8.\tThe Target UE sends a Direct Communication Accept message to the UE-to-UE Relay that has successfully established security with Target UE. The Direct Communication Accept message includes User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE, QoS Info (PFI and split PC5 QoS parameters), RSC, IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address (if IP communication is used).\nThe UE-to-UE Relay may further update the PC5 link with the Source UE based on the outcome of PC5 link establishment with the Target UE.\n9.\tFor IP communication, the UE-to-UE Relay stores an association of User Info ID and the IP address of Target UE into its DNS entries, and the UE-to-UE Relay acts as a DNS server to other UEs. The Source UE sends a DNS query to the UE-to-UE Relay to request IP address of Target UE after step 8, and the UE-to-UE Relay returns the IP address of the Target UE to the Source UE.\nNOTE:\tThe Source UE may send DNS query multiple times to obtain the IP address of Target UE.\n10.\tThe Source UE communicates with the Target UE via the UE-to-UE Relay. For IP communication, the UE-to-UE Relay acts as an IP router. For Unstructured communication, the UE-to-UE Relay performs traffic relaying based on the mapping between the two PC5 Layer-2 links and PC5 QoS Flows. For Ethernet communication, the UE-to-UE Relay acts as an Ethernet switch.\nIn the case of one Source UE communicates with multiple Target UEs, the PC5 link between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay can be shared for multiple Target UEs while the PC5 link is established individually between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UEs. For the shared PC5 link, the Layer-2 link modification procedure can be used.\nIn the case of multiple Source UEs communicate with one Target UE, the PC5 link is established individually between Source UEs and UE-to-UE Relay while the PC5 link between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UE can be shared. For the shared PC5 link, the Layer-2 link modification procedure can be used.\n",

                            "text_content": "Using the solution described in this clause, a UE-to-UE Relay is authorized to relay messages between two UEs over the PC5 interface via authorization and provisioning.\nA UE-to-UE Relay enables a source UE and a target UE to establish an end-to-end (E2E) PC5 unicast communication.\nThe UE-to-UE Relay listens for Direct Communication Request messages from surrounding UEs and, if the specified application matches one of the applications from its provisioned relay policy/parameters, the UE-to-UE Relay advertises it as a relayed application by adding a relay indication (e.g. Relay ID) to the message.\nThe target UE receives a broadcast Direct Communication Request message with a relay indication.\nA secure \"extended\" (end-to-end) PC5 link is set up between the source UE and the target UE via the UE-to-UE Relay. Source/Target UEs send and receive messages through the UE-to-UE Relay, however, the security association and the extended PC5 unicast link are established end-to-end between the source UE and the target UE. The UE-to-UE Relay forwards the messages transparently, without the ability to read, modify their content or replay them, with the exception of the Direct Communication Request message. As DCR is always sent unprotected the UE-to-UE Relay modifies the message to include the relay indication (e.g. Relay ID). The source/target UEs detect that the link establishment is going through a UE-to-UE Relay upon detecting a relay indication included in the received messages.\nA source/target UE uses a unique link (i.e. PC5 unicast link) with a UE-to-UE Relay to send messages to its peer UEs via this specific UE-to-UE Relay. The UE-to-UE Relay receives E2E PC5 messages over this PC5 unicast link and forwards them between the source UE and target UEs using an adaptation layer, which contains information identifying the specific source and/or target UE. The UE-to-UE Relay replaces the identifiers specified in the messages' headers with relay-specific identifiers to \"isolate\" the PC5 unicast links, i.e. different identifiers are used over each PC5 unicast link.\nNOTE 1:\tAdditional security-related parameters and procedures may be needed for the protection of relayed messages using the adaptation layer. Their definitions need to be coordinated with SA WG3.\nTo enable a single step for direct and indirect link establishment procedure, a source UE (i.e. UE1) sends a DCR message without an adaptation header. A target UE (i.e. UE2) may receive the DCR message directly from the source UE and establish a direct unicast link with the source UE. As well, a UE-to-UE Relay may receive the DCR message and add an adaptation header before forwarding it. Another target UE (i.e. UE3) may receive the DCR message via the UE-to-UE Relay and establish an indirect unicast link with the source UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe details about the identity information of source UE and/or target UE specified in the adaption header will be defined in cooperation with RAN WG2 during normative phase.\nLink management (i.e. keep-alive, link modification, link identifier update and link release) is supported over extended PC5 links. Since the security association of extended PC5 links is between the E2E peer UEs, all messages sent over the extended PC5 link, including link management (i.e. PC5-S) messages, may only be processed by those two UEs. No modifications to the keep-alive, link modification and link release procedures are needed when sent over the E2E PC5 link. Modifications for the support of the Link Identifier Update procedure related to extended PC5 links are expected and are specified in another contribution.\nThe PC5 unicast link, used by source/target UEs to send E2E messages via a specific UE-to-UE Relay, is also used as a management link, i.e. to manage the extended links (e.g. for QoS adaptation or privacy procedure). The management link is secured between the source/target UEs and the UE-to-UE Relay and doesn't make use of an adaptation layer.\nThe control and user plane protocols stacks are based on the architectural reference model described in Annex A.\n",

                            "text_content": "Connection establishment via a L2 UE-to-UE Relay is done after the discovery procedure (i.e. using Discovery messages as defined in clause 6.3 of TS 23.304 [3]) i.e. Models A/B or using the integrated discovery procedure (i.e. using the link establishment procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3]).\nIf the discovery procedure is run prior to the link establishment, the source UE determines the UE-to-UE Relay Layer-2 ID to be used to reach the target UE while the target UE Layer-2 ID may be discovered and kept at the UE-to-UE Relay or at the source UE or may not be kept. In the latter case, a broadcast Layer-2 is used when sending the DCR message towards the target UE. In this case, the Target User Info field is used to identify the target UE.\nIf the integrated discovery mechanism is used, the source UE sends the DCR message to a broadcast Layer-2 ID and the UE-to-UE relay forwards the message using the same value.\nFigure 6.13.2-1 shows the unicast link establishment over PC5 reference point via a Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay.\nThe figure depicts the connection establishment procedure for Layer-2 UEs (User Equipment) to Layer-2 UEs (User Equipment) through a relay, illustrating the steps involved in establishing a connection.\nFigure 6.13.2-1: Connection establishment procedure via Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay\n0.\tUE-to-UE Relay registers with the network and specifies its relay capabilities. UE-to-UE Relay is provisioned with relay policy parameters from the network.\n1.\tThe target UEs (i.e. UE2, UE3 and UE4) determine the destination Layer-2 ID (i.e. broadcast Layer-2 ID) for signalling reception for PC5 unicast link establishment as specified in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3].\n2.\tOn the source UE (i.e. UE1), the application layer provides application information to the ProSe layer for PC5 unicast communication. The application information includes the ProSe Service Info, source UE's Application Layer ID, and may include target UE's Application Layer ID, as specified in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3].\nProSe layer triggers the link establishment procedure by sending a Direct Communication Request (DCR) message which includes:\n-\tSource User Info: the initiating UE's Application Layer ID (i.e. UE1's Application Layer ID).\n-\tIf the ProSe application layer provided the target UE's Application Layer ID in step 2, the following information is included:\n-\tTarget User Info: the target UE's Application Layer ID (i.e. UE2's Application Layer ID).\n-\tProSe Service Info: the information about the ProSe identifier(s) requesting Layer-2 link establishment.\n-\tSecurity Information: the information for the establishment of security.\nThe message is sent using the source Layer-2 ID self-assigned by the source UE and the broadcast Layer-2 ID or the discovered UE-to-UE Relay Layer-2 ID as destination, and includes other parameters related to the application offered, as specified in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3]. The message may include the target UE Layer-2 ID, if learned during a prior discovery procedure.\nThe DCR message is sent without an adaptation layer header. This DCR message is used for either direct or indirect link establishment. A target UE receiving the DCR directly from UE1 may continue the link establishment procedure as usual, i.e. without involving the UE-to-UE Relay.\n3.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay receives the Direct Communication Request message and verifies if it's configured to relay this application, i.e. it compares the announce ProSe Service Info with its provisioned relay policy/parameters.\nThe UE-to-UE Relay forwards the Direct Communication Request message by using its own Layer-2 ID as Source L2 ID and specifies as destination either the target UE Layer-2 ID as specified in the received DCR message or as learned during the prior discovery procedure, or uses the broadcast Layer-2 ID. The UE-to-UE Relay adds an adaptation header containing info identifying UE1. The UE-to-UE Relay additionally includes its unique Relay ID and relay-specific security info. The UE-to-UE Relay keeps the association of UE1 security info as specified in the DCR message and its relay-specific security info as specified with the forwarded DCR message.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE-to-UE Relay handles DCR message in the ProSe layer. Any subsequent E2E messages (i.e. PC5-S and data) are forwarded based on UE identifier info specified in the adaptation header.\n4.\tTarget UE (i.e. UE3) receives the DCR message via the UE-to-UE Relay. UE3 is interested in the announced application thus it triggers a PC5 unicast link establishment with the UE-to-UE Relay, if such a link isn't already established between UE3 and this UE-to-UE Relay.\nUE3 may receive multiple DCR messages via different UE-to-UE Relays and even directly from UE1. UE3 may select the UE-to-UE Relay based on locally configured rules. UE3 establishes a PC5 unicast link only with the selected UE-to-UE Relay.\n5.\tUE3 continues E2E link establishment procedure by initiating the security procedures (i.e. PC5 Authentication and/or PC5 Direct Security Mode procedures) via the selected UE-to-UE Relay (i.e. over the direct PC5 link to the UE-to-UE Relay). UE3 adds an adaptation header including the info identifying UE1, as received with the DCR message, and UE3 security info and may include a UE3 identifier. UE3 associates the security info received on the DCR message and its UE3 security info to create the security context for the extended link. UE3 includes the Relay ID in the first protected message sent to UE1.\nThe UE-to-UE Relay forwards the messages from UE3 to UE1 including relay-specific info identifying UE3 in the adaptation header. The UE-to-UE Relay also specifies a relay-specific security info associated to UE3 and UE1 security info as received with the DCR message, and finally may include info identifying UE1 and associated with the DCR message (e.g. UE1 Layer-2 ID used by UE1 when sending the DCR message). UE-to-UE Relay puts its Layer-2 ID as the source and UE1 Layer-2 ID as the destination. The UE-to-UE Relay keeps the association of UE3 security info as specified in message received from UE3 and its relay-specific security info associated to UE3. UE1 keeps track of the security info specified with the received message (i.e. security info associated to UE3) and uses it to create the security context for the extended link.\n6.\tAt the reception of this first message from UE3 via the UE-to-UE Relay, UE1 extracts the Relay ID and verifies if a PC5 unicast link is already established between UE1 and this UE-to-UE Relay. If none already exists, UE1 triggers a PC5 unicast link establishment procedure before continuing security procedures of step 5.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether the PC5 unicast link establishment between UE and the Relay is triggered by UE or Relay is to be determined during normative phase, after RAN2 has provided more details about adaptation layer and Relay behavior.\n7.\tUE1 continues the E2E security procedure with the target UE (continuation of step 5). UE1 keeps track of the security info specified with the received message (i.e. security info associated to UE3) and uses it to create the security context for the extended link.\n8.\tOnce E2E link security establishment procedures are completed, UE3 completes the E2E link establishment procedure via the UE-to-UE Relay by sending a DCA message to UE1.\n9.\tUE1 receives the DCA message. An \"extended\" unicast link is established between UE1 and UE3, via the UE-to-UE Relay. The extended link may be secured end-to-end, i.e. a security association is created between UE1 and UE3.\n10.\tUE1 and UE3 exchange E2E data via the UE-to-UE Relay, using an adaptation header. The UE-to-UE Relay replaces the fields specified in the adaptation header with relay-specific identifiers, as specified above before forwarding the E2E messages.\nEditor's note:\tThe need and details of the E2E authentication and E2E security procedure will be investigated by SA WG3.\nEditor's note:\tThe details of the adaptation between two PC5 interfaces are confirmed by RAN WG2.\n",

When the measured signal strength is lower than a threshold, the 5G Prose Remote UE will perform the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay reselection for indirect network path switching. Currently the descriptions in clause 6.5.4 of TS 23.304 [3] for 5G ProSe Remote UE traffic handling are more suitable to initial UE-to-Network relay selection, it is not clear enough for a target indirect network path re-selection when to perform the indirect network path switching. For example, when a L3 remote UE(without N3IWF case) needs to perform path switching, then what the target indirect path should be selected, does it still selects the L3 relay without N3IWF, L3 relay with N3IWF, or L2 relay? Does it keeps evaluating the next RSD or re-evaluate the URSP?, etc. These issues are still not clear for studying. In this solution, taking the backward compatibility into consideration, the Remote UE still use the URSP evaluation to determine the UE-to-Network relay reselection as specified in clauses 6.14.2, 6.14.3 and 6.14.4.\nEditor's note:\tThe criteria on path switching from RAN perspective are FFS.\nNOTE:\tThis solution studies the criteria on how to select a UE-to-Network Relay for path switching.\n",

The direct communication path over direct PC5 reference point means that the communication with another UE is performed by using 5G ProSe Direct Communication only. The direct communication path over Uu reference point means that the communication with another UE is performed via the network (i.e. non-relay case) and the communication via 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay (Layer-2 or Layer-3) is not considered.\nNOTE 1:\tSession continuity (e.g. IP address preservation) is not supported during path switching in this solution.\nPath switching policy is provided to the UE to indicate which path(s) is allowed for all or specific ProSe services (i.e. direct PC5 allowed, direct Uu allowed or no allowed indicated). The path switching policy is defined as the mapping of ProSe services (i.e. ProSe identifiers) to path allowed (i.e. direct PC5 allowed, direct Uu allowed, or no allowed) and the path switching policy can be a one mapping for all ProSe services (i.e. same path allowed for all ProSe services).\nThe path switching policy can be (pre-) configured in the UE or provided by the PCF. The ProSe Application Server may provide a path allowed indication for ProSe Services to UDR and this may be used by PCF for path switching policy generation and update.\nThe UE may use the pre-configured/provisioned path switching policy to switching all or specific ProSe services to the appropriate communication path. The \"Procedures for Service Authorization and Provisioning to UE\" as defined in TS 23.304 [3] is reused for provisioning path switching policy to the UE.\nThe UE evaluates the path switching policy and switches the communication path as below:\n-\tIf direct PC5 allowed is indicated, the UE may switch to the direct PC5 reference point for communication path for the ProSe service.\n-\tIf direct Uu allowed is indicated, the UE may switch to the direct Uu reference point for communication path for the ProSe service.\n-\tIf no allowed is indicated or no path switching policy is provisioned, the UE may switch to either a direct Uu or direct PC5 communication path based on its pre-configuration or implementation for the ProSe service.\nNOTE 2:\tThe path switching policy is used to determine whether a communication path can be switched when a UE is communicating with another UE, so it is different to the path selection policy as defined in TS 23.304 [3].\nBased on the path switching policy, a UE may establish a PDU session or a PC5 connection in the target path and switch the traffic from the source path to the target path. The service continuity during path switching can be achieved by the application layer mechanism.\n",

Before UE1 sends the request, UE1 checks the path switch Policy/parameters to make sure that the service (s) are is allowed to switch from PC5 to Uu.\nUE1 informs UE2 in the request message which service(s) to switch based on path switch policy and optionally whether UE1 can establish the PDU Session/Uu path for the service.\n4.\tUE2 sends the path switch response to UE1 that indicates which if the services in the request can be switched to a Uu path. The response message includes the service identifier(s). Before UE2 sends the response, UE2 checks the path switch Policy/parameters to make sure that a service is allowed to switch from PC5 to Uu.\nThe response message from UE2 includes the service(s) from the request message that can be switched as acknowledgement.\tFor example, for UE1, both Service A and Service B are allowed to switch from PC5 to Uu, but Service C is not allowed to switch from PC5 to Uu, and for UE2, both Service A and Service C are allowed to switch from PC5 to Uu, but Service B is not allowed to switch from PC5 to Uu. In this case the request will contain Service A and Service B and the response will only contain Service A, resulting in Service A being switched to Uu and the remaining services continuing to use PC5.\nNOTE:\tPC5 connection is still valid to transfer the PC5 signalling in step 3 and step 4.\n5.\tUE1 and UE2 perform the Uu path preparation procedure. In particular, UE1 and UE2 each trigger PDU Session establishment/modification procedure, if needed, to make the Uu path ready for Service A transmission. During this procedure UE1 and UE2 can get the IP address of the PDU session that will be used for the Service A, and UE1 and UE2 can respectively request the Uu QoS 1 (used for Uu path of UE1) and Uu QoS 2 (used for Uu path of UE2) for Service A.\nBefore UE1 and UE2 request the Uu QoS for Service A, UE1 decides the Uu QoS 1 and Uu QoS 2 requirements for Service A based on PC5 QoS requirement for Service A and sends Uu QoS 2 requirements to UE2 via the PC5 connection. Uu QoS 1 and Uu QoS 2 requirements can be decided based on the configured mapping of PC5 QoS parameter to Uu QoS parameter or based on UE1 implementation.\nOptionally, UE1 and UE2 can also share the IP/port addresses used for Uu path with each other via the PC5 connection, to achieve the switch of the Service A transmission.\n6.\tUE1 and UE2 transmit the data of the Service A via the Uu path.\n7.\tAfter the step 6, UE1 and UE2 still transmit the data of the unswitched service(s) via the PC5 path. UE1 and UE2 may release the PC5 connection if no service uses it, using the existing Layer-2 link release over PC5 reference point, see clause 6.4.3.3 of TS 23.304 [3].\nFigure 6.17.2.2.1 presents a high-level procedure for path switch from Uu path to PC5 path (Scenario B).\nThe figure depicts a high-level procedure for path switch from Uu to PC5 in a 5G network. It illustrates the steps involved in switching paths between different network segments, such as base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). The figure includes key components like the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and scatterers. The diagram highlights the use of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 6.17.2.2-1: high-level procedure for path switch from Uu to PC5\n1.\tTriggered by an AF request, the PCF may provide the path switch Policy/parameters for Proximity Services to the UE (including UE1 and UE2) by using the procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.3 in TS 23.502 [8]. The path switch Policy/parameters may include whether the specific service (e.g. Service A, Service B, Service C) is allowed to switch from Uu to PC5.\n2.\tUE1 and UE2 have PDU Sessions and the Uu path is used for some service data transmission, e.g. Service A, Service B, Service C transmission. Before the Uu path transmission, UE1 and UE2 may get the path selection policy, which indicates that the Uu path is preferred for the services.\n3.\tUE-1 and UE-2 can be discover each other and establish the PC5 connection for service, when the Uu signal level is lower than the configured threshold or Uu QoS for a service cannot be satisfied.\nUE1 informs UE2 in the request message which service(s) to switch based on path switch policy. The response message from UE2 includes the service(s) from the request message that can be switched as acknowledgement.\nFor example, for UE1, both Service A and Service B are allowed to switch from Uu to PC5, but Service C is not allowed to switch from Uu to PC5, and for UE2, both Service A and Service C are allowed to switch from Uu5 to PC5, but Service B is not allowed to switch from Uu to PC5. In this case the request will contain Service A and Service B and the response will only contain Service A, resulting in Service A being switched to PC5 and the remaining services continuing to use Uu.\n4.\tUE1 and UE2 transmit the data of the Service A via the PC5 path.\n5.\tAfter the step 4, UE1 and UE2 still transmit the data of the unswitched service(s) via the Uu path and the PDU session(s) over Uu path may be released or deactivated if no service uses them.\n",

Once the negotiated triggers are satisfied, the 2 UEs perform the path switching between PC5 to Uu directly.

For the path switching from the Uu to PC5 interface, it requires that the 2 UEs establish the PC5 link firstly, then negotiate the ProSe services to be switched over the established PC5 link.

In this case, there may be the case that two UEs will be able to communicate over PC5 reference point with the satisfactory signal strength after a while, e.g. as temporary obstacle between two UEs does not exist anymore. In order to switch back from Uu to PC5, two UEs need to establish a unicast link again after discovering each other over PC5 reference point. These tasks may take some time. In addition, when the UE(s) triggers ProSe Direct Discovery or Layer-2 link establishment may be uncertain if they want to communicate over PC5 reference point again.\nTherefore, this solution proposes to reuse the unicast link when switching back from Uu to PC5 by maintaining the established unicast link after path switching to Uu. The maintained unicast link is also used to check whether switching back to PC5 path can be performed.\nThe outline of the proposed solution for switching back from Uu path to PC5 path is as below:\n-\tAfter path switching from PC5 to Uu is made due to the PC5 signal strength of the unicast link lower than configured signal strength threshold, the unicast link between two UEs is not released but kept.\n-\tOne UE of the unicast link keeps checking the PC5 signal strength of the unicast link through the Layer-2 link maintenance procedure. Based on the checking results, the UE can determine whether to perform switching back to PC5 path as below:\n-\tIf the PC5 signal strength of the unicast link is considered good (i.e. not lower than configured signal strength threshold) during a configured time, the UE determines to perform switching back to PC5 path by reusing the unicast link.\n-\tOtherwise, the UE determines not to perform switching back to PC5 path, thus, the unicast link is released.\n-\tIf the Layer-2 link maintenance procedure fails, e.g. because the UE initiating the procedure does not receive the Keep-alive Ack message from peer UE, the peer UE does not receive the Keep-alive message from the initiating UE, the unicast link is locally released.\nNOTE:\tThis solution does not preclude the switching back from Uu path to PC5 path without reusing the unicast link by releasing the unicast link after switching to Uu path.\n",

The figure shows the path switch, which is a crucial component in a 21st-century network, facilitating the transmission of data packets. The switch is designed to ensure efficient and reliable communication, with redundant paths to ensure failover in case of any failure. The figure also highlights the importance of SDN (Software-Defined Networking) principles in modern networks, as it demonstrates the use of switches to manage and control network traffic.\nFigure 6.21.2-1: Scenario A: Path switch from Uu to PC5 communication path\n1.\tPCF subscribes to the UDR to receive notifications on ProSe Application parameter changes when there is a change of service specific parameter as described in clause 6.2.5 of TS 23.304 [3].

UE1 decides on the path switch and sends direct communication request to initiate the unicast layer-2 link establishment incl. PC5 QoS parameters. UE2 accepts the request and confirms QoS Info and optionally PC5 QoS rule(s).\n6.\tFollowing existing procedure in clause 4.3.7, TS 23.502 [8], the SMF may deactivate the UP connection of the relevant PDU sessions after a specified inactivity period leading to releasing UPF resources and AN-level resources via AMF.

The figure illustrates the path switch configuration, which includes a path switch, a path controller, and a path relay. The path switch is responsible for routing the signal from PC5 to Uu, while the path controller and path relay are responsible for managing the signal path and ensuring reliability.

If the two PDU sessions terminate at different UPFs, the 5GC creates a forwarding tunnel between the UPFs.\nThe UPF serving the originally established path performs the role of anchor UPF and routes the traffic to and from the application server while the UPF terminating the additional path receives the downlink data for the Remote UE from anchor UPF and sends the uplink data from the Remote UE to the anchor UPF. With reference to Figure 6.27.1-1, UPF-1 acts as anchor when the direct path was established first, UPF-2 acts as anchor when the indirect path via the Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay path was established first.\nNOTE:\tMulti-path solution with Layer-3 relay without N3IWF defined in clause 6.27.2.2 across different PLMNs is not supported in this release.\nThe figure depicts a multi-path transmission scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the use of direct paths and relay paths. The figure shows the path setup, including the anchor path (UPF) and the path via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF. This setup is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient communication in 5G networks.\nFigure 6.27.1-1: Multi-path transmission using a direct path and a path via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF.

The figure illustrates the use of a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay, which is a technology that enables efficient and reliable communication in 5G networks. The figure also shows the use of a 5G ProSe UE, which is a device that can be used to transmit data over the network. The figure is important for understanding the multi-path transmission in 5G networks and the role of the relay network in ensuring reliable communication.\nFigure 6.27.2.1-1: Multi-path transmission with using 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF\nAs described in clause 6.5.4 of TS 23.304 [3], the application traffic on the 5G ProSe Remote UE is managed by URSP rules, the 5G ProSe Remote UE establishes indirect or direct path as the first path based on whether the selected RSD contains the component of \"5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication\". The 5G ProSe Remote UE triggers the establishment the second path when multipath transmission is desired, for example, the first path cannot satisfy the QoS requirement of the application traffic. When establishing the second path, the Remote UE determines the parameters of the second path using the following procedure:\n-\tIf the selected RSD contains the \"5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication\", then the indirect network path is 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, then to determine the direct network path:\n-\tThe 5G ProSe Remote UE determines the PDU session parameters (PDU Session type, DNN, SSC Mode, S-NSSAI, Access Type Preference) based on the UE ProSe policy as described in clause 5.1.4.1 of TS 23.304 [3].\n-\tThe 5G ProSe Remote UE takes the above determined PDU session parameters as the PDU session parameters of the direct network path, and to evaluate the existing PDU sessions, or establish a new PDU session.\n-\tIf the selected RSD does not contain the \"5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication\" and it determines to use direct network path as the first path, then to determine the indirect network path:\n-\tIf there is the configurations for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF and the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF is selected as the indirect path, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE takes UE ProSe policy as described in clause in clause 5.1.4.1 of TS 23.304 [3] to determine the RSC and corresponding PDU session parameters for the indirect network path setup.\nAnother option is that the indirect path and direct path are always established for transmitting the application traffic based on URSP rules. The 5G ProSe Remote UE establishes the indirect path and direct path based on the selected RSD containing the new component of \"Multi-Path 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication\". Either the indirect path or direct path can be used as the first path based on UE implementation. The 5G ProSe Remote UE can trigger the establishment of the indirect path and direct path consecutively in either order. The PDU session parameters together with \"Multi-Path 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication\" in the selected RSD are used as the PDU session parameters for the direct path, and the RSC used for the indirect path can be decided by ProSe policy as per Rel-17.\nFigure 6.27.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for establishing multipath transmission via a Layer 3 UE-to-Network relay by correlating direct path and indirect path. Steps 1a-2a illustrate the scenario1where an indirect path via a Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay is added to an existing direct path; steps 1b-2b illustrate the scenario where a direct path is added to an established indirect path via a Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay. The remaining steps are common to both scenarios.\nWhen establishing the second path, the Remote UE determines the PDU session parameters of the second path as specified in clause 6.27.2.1.\nIn this procedure, we always assume that AMF-1, SMF-1 and UPF-1 serve the PDU session of the Remote UE using the direct path, and AMF-2, SMF-2 and UPF-2 serve the PDU session of the Layer 3 UE-to-Network Relay in the indirect path. Which UPF performs the role of anchor UPF depends on which PDU session was first established, i.e. for scenario 1 the UPF-1 performs the role of anchor UPF and for scenario 2 the UPF-2 performs the role of anchor UPF.\nThe figure depicts the establishment of multipath transmission using Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, illustrating the process of signal reflection and re-propagation in a 5G network.\nFigure 6.27.2.2-1: Establishment of multipath transmission using Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay\n0.\tThe Remote UE is authorized by network to use Layer-3 multipath transmission with Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay. The Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay is authorized by network to provide indirect path for Remote UE performing Layer-3 multipath transmission with a Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.\n1a.\tThe Remote UE establishes PDU session-1 and QoS flow-1 as defined in TS 23.502 [8] for direct path.

This information will be used for correlating the direct and indirect communication paths in the core network.\nThe anchor path that indicates which path should be configured as anchor path. For scenario 1, the anchor path is the direct path and for scenario 2, the anchor path is the indirect path.\nThe Remote UE also indicates Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay PC5 QoS flow Identity on which traffic data is subject to multipath transmission.\nThe Remote UE may also indicate PC5 QoS rule if only some traffic on a PC5 QoS flow is subject to multipath transmission.\n4.\tThe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay initiates the PDU Session Modification procedure transmitting a NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Request)) to AMF-2 as defined in TS 23.502 [8] with the additional parameters in NAS: \"L3 relay multipath\", Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay PDU session ID (PDU session ID-2) and QFI (QFI-2) or QoS rule (QoS rule-2) used for the Remote UE traffic, Remote UE 5G-GUTI ,Remote User ID, PDU session ID-1 and QFI(QFI-1) or QoS rule (QoS rule-1) for the data for Layer-3 multipath transmission and anchor path.\n5.\tAMF-2 uses the Remote UE 5G-GUTI to determine AMF-1 which serves the Remote UE and gets the address of the SMF that serves the PDU session ID-1 (SMF-1).\nStep6~step11 are used to establish tunnel between UPF1 and UPF2 to forwarding data for multipath transmission.\n6.\tAMF-2 requests SMF-2 to modify the PDU session using Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request as defined in TS 23.502 [8]. In this step, AMF-2 forwards the additional parameters received in step 4 to SMF-2 with the addition of the address of SMF-1.\n7a.\tThe SMF-2 sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the UPF-2.\nIf the SMF-2 supports the Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay multipath transmission, SMF-2 instructs UPF-2 to establish a forwarding tunnel (CN downlink Tunnel for scenario 1 or CN uplink Tunnel for scenario 2).\nBased on the Remote User ID, the SMF-2 retrieves the Remote UE info and generate PDR for UPF-2 to identify traffic data of the Remote UE for multipath transmission.\nIf anchor path is the direct path (scenario 1), SMF-2 instruct UPF-2 to send the uplink data received from UPF-1 via forwarding tunnel to the Application Server.\nIf anchor path is the indirect path (scenario 2), SMF-2 instruct UPF-2 to send a copy of the downlink data for Layer-3 multipath transmission to UPF-1.\n7b.\tUPF-2 acknowledges the request to establish a tunnel by sending an N4 Session Modification Response.\nUPF-2 provides CN downlink Tunnel for scenario 1 or CN uplink Tunnel for scenario 2 to SMF-2.\n8.\tSMF-2 sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request as defined in TS 23.502 [8] to SMF-1 with the following parameters: \"L3 relay multipath\", Remote UE SUPI, Remote UE PDU session ID (PDU session ID-1) and QFI (QFI-1) or QoS rule (QoS rule-1) and anchor path.\n9a.\tSMF-1 sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the UPF-1.\nIf SMF-1 supports Layer-3 multipath transmission for the Remote UE, SMF-1 provides UPF-1 the information about the CN downlink/uplink Tunnel info established in step 7.\nThe SMF-1 also instructs UPF-1 to establish a forwarding channel (CN uplink Tunnel for scenario 1 or CN downlink Tunnel for scenario 2).\nIf anchor path is the direct path (scenario 1), SMF-1 also instruct UPF-1 to send a copy of the downlink data for Layer-3 multipath transmission to UPF-2.\nIf anchor path is the indirect path (scenario 2), SMF-2 instruct UPF-2 to send the uplink data received from UPF-2 via forwarding tunnel to the Application Server.\n9b.\tUPF-1 acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Modification Response.\nUPF-1 provides CN uplink Tunnel Info (scenario 1) or CN downlink Tunnel Info (scenario 2) as forwarding tunnel to SMF-1.\n10.\tSMF-1 to SMF-2: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (CN Uplink/Downlink Tunnel Info).\n11a.\tSMF-2 sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the UPF-2(CN uplink Tunnel Info (scenario 1) or CN downlink Tunnel Info (scenario 2)).\n11b.\tThe UPF-1 acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Modification Response.\n12-13.\tThe traffic data applied to Layer-3 multipath transmission are transmitted both on direct path (12a for scenario 1 and 13a for scenario 2) and indirect path (12b for scenario 1 and 13b for scenario 2) based on the Layer-3 multipath transmission strategy (switching/redundancy).\nFor the data to be transmitted on the first path, the Remote UE generates IP packets based on IP address and port number of the first path.\nFor the data to be transmitted on the second path, the following manipulation of the IP header is enhanced for the uplink and downlink as following:\nUplink\n-\tThe Remote UE sets two IP headers, the inner IP header is generated with the IP address and port of the first path, and the outer IP header is generated with the IP address and port of the second path.\n-\tThe UPF that serves the first path removes the outer IP header received from the UPF that serves the second path and performs IP layer elimination and sorting for the data from two path.\nDownlink\n-\tThe Remote UE removes the outer IP header and performs IP layer elimination and sorting for the data from two path.\n-\tThe UPF that serves the second path adds an additional IP header for the data received from the UPF that serves the first path based on the IP address and port number assigned for the Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay that serves the Remote UE (scenario 1) or the IP address and port number assigned to the Remote UE (scenario 2).\n",

Indirect network communication path can be via a Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with or without N3IWF access or Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay.\nThe figure depicts a multi-path transmission scenario in a 5G network, illustrating the use of direct Uu path and indirect network communication paths. The diagram highlights the importance of beamforming techniques to mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 6.28.1-1: Multi-path transmission using a direct Uu path and indirect network communication path\nSupporting multi-path connectivity using 3GPP features like ATSSS or Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) is dependent on whether the Remote UE has an AS connection or NAS connection with the Network.\nLayer-3 Remote UE does not have a 5G connection when connected via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF as defined in clause 6.5.1.1 of TS 23.304 [3]. Thus, Application layer mechanisms are used to support multi-path transmission for Layer-3 Remote UE. Application layer can decide when to setup the multi-path connectivity and how to aggregate/split the traffic on both paths.\nOn the other hand, when the Layer-3 Remote UE access the network via a Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF support, as defined in clause 6.5.1.2 of TS 23.304 [3], it has NAS connection with the 5GC and PDU session will be used for the application traffic. The ATSSS feature supports a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one 3GPP access network and one untrusted non-3GPP access network and two independent N3/N9 tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN. As the Layer-3 Remote UE connection via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF is considered as \"untrusted non-3GPP access to 5GC via N3IWF\", ATSSS feature can be used to support multi-path transmission for Layer-3 Remote UE connected to network using one 3GPP access network (i.e. direct path) and one non-3GPP access network (i.e. indirect path via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF), as shown in Figure 6.28.1-2.\nThe figure depicts a multi-path transmission scenario using ATSSS (Automatic Time and Frequency Switching System) for a direct path and indirect path via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF (Network-to-Network Interference-Free Waveform). The figure illustrates the use of ATSSS to ensure reliable communication, with the direct path and indirect path paths shown in dashed lines. The layered design of the optical backbone aligns with SDN principles, providing redundancy and failover reliability.\nFigure 6.28.1-2: Multi-path transmission using ATSSS for a direct path and indirect path via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF\nLayer-2 Remote UE has a NAS connection and AS connection, similar to a UE connected directly to the network via Uu connectivity. Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) is supported in NG-RAN to allow multi-path transmission for a UE connected to the network via two access nodes. Similar approach can be introduced to support multi-path transmission for a CM-CONNECTED Layer-2 Remote UE that has an AS connection via direct network communication path and indirect network communication path. The operation details of the MR-DCis within RAN WGs scope.\nEditor's note:\tSA WG2 to coordinate with RAN2 WG on support of multi-path transmission for Layer-2 Remote UE to determine the impacts for 5GC.\n",

The Relay stores the association of the UE's Application layer ID (also called User Info) and UE's IP address/prefix (e.g. into its DNS entries).\nWhen a (source) UE needs to communicate with another (target) UE via the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay, it sends a request (e.g. DNS query) to the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay, over the unicast link, to obtain to the target UE's IP address/prefix (based on Target User Info). The Relay returns the IP address/prefix of the target UE.\nThe source UE sends IP data to the target UE via the PC5 unicast link to UE-to-UE Relay. The UE-to-UE Relay acts as an IP router and forwards the packets to the corresponding PC5 unicast link towards the target UE.\n",

                            "text_content": "A source UE obtaining or registering an IP address from/to a UE-to-UE Relay may not want its IP address/prefix to be shared with every requesting target UEs. The source UE may want to divulge its IP address/prefix only with specific target UEs. This is similar to the restricted discovery mechanism where only an authorized Discoverer UE may discover a Discoveree UE.\nTo enable the support of IP address/prefix sharing authorization, a source UE indicates to the UE-to-UE Relay during the PC5 link establishment procedure if its IP address/prefix may be shared with target UEs without seeking source UE authorization or if prior authorization from the source UE is required. In addition, a source UE may provide a token to the UE-to-UE Relay, allowing the UE-to-UE Relay to itself authorize the source UE's IP address sharing using this token.\nThis procedure enables a source UE to indicate to the UE-to-UE Relay if its IP address/prefix may be shared with target UEs without seeking its authorization or if its authorization is required. It also enables the source UE to provide information to the UE-to-UE Relay to itself validate if the target UE is authorized to receive the source UE's IP address/prefix.\nThe figure depicts a scenario where an S-UE (Service User Equipment) is providing its authorization to the UE-to-UE Relay for IP address sharing. This is a crucial step in the IP network, as it allows the relay to forward packets between the S-UE and the UE. The figure illustrates the process with a diagram showing the S-UE, UE-to-UE Relay, and IP address sharing.\nFigure 6.31.2.2-1: S-UE provides its authorization to the UE-to-UE Relay for IP address sharing\n1.\tS-UE specifies an indication (authorization needed) and may specify a token during the PC5 Link Establishment procedure with the UE-to-UE Relay. UE-to-UE Relay keeps track of this indication and token (if received) with S-UE's User Info, IP address and PC5 related information. S-UE may be pre-provisioned with the authorization token.\nEditor's note:\tThe definition and usage of the token needs to be coordinated with SA3.\n2.\tUE-to-UE Relay receives a Query message (e.g. DNS Query) from T-UE specifying S-UE's User Info and possibly a token. UE-to-UE Relay fetches S-UE's info and if the authorization needed indication is set, UE-to-UE Relay validates the token received from T-UE with S-UE's saved token, if a token is received on Query and if a token from S-UE is saved on the UE-to-UE Relay.\nThe distribution of such token to the T-UE may be facilitated out of band or in band, e.g. by UE-to-UE Relay after/during the successful Query (as specified at step 5).\n3.\tIf no token is received from T-UE and/or no token has been provided by S-UE during the link establishment procedure, UE-to-UE Relay sends a PC5 message (e.g. Link Authorization Request) with T-UE's User Info, T-UE's IP address, and the token (if received on the Query) to S-UE, requesting authorization to share S-UE's IP address with T-UE.\n4.\tS-UE receives the Link Authorization Request message and replies with a Link Authorization Accept or Reject message, specifying T-UE's User Info. S-UE may provide a token at this point for further Query messages to be authorized directly at the UE-to-UE Relay using this token. S-UE's decision may be based on policies, Application's layer authorization, etc.\n5.\tUE-to-UE Relay sends a response (e.g. DNS response) to T-UE with S-UE's IP address (if token matches at the UE-to-UE Relay or if a Link Authorization Accept message is received from S-UE) or doesn't reply to the Query message (if no match with token or if a Link Authorization Reject message is received from S-UE). UE-to-UE Relay keeps track of the token, if provided by S-UE, and may send it to the T-UE with the response. T-UE may use this token the next time it needs to send a Query message to discover S-UE's IP address.\nEditor's note:\tThe authorization for IP address sharing procedure needs to be coordinated with SA WG3.\n",

A unique PC5 unicast link (also called per-hop or management link) is established between a UE and the UE-to-UE Relay. An end-to-end (E2E) PC5 unicast link is established with an E2E peer UE via the 2 per-hop links, i.e. between source UE and the Relay and between the Relay and target UE. The E2E PC5 packets are using an adaptation header containing information identifying the source UE and/or destination UE, enabling the forwarding of packets E2E between peer UEs. PC5 packets also carry E2E security information, as for regular non-relayed PC5 communication, in the headers (e.g. PDCP header).\nSA WG3 studied identity privacy for PC5 unicast link during V2X R16. The requirements stated that the 5GS should provide means for mitigating trackability and link ability attacks on a UE during PC5 unicast communications.  As concluded by SA3 during this study, \"all identifiers sent in cleartext in the message headers must be changed at the same time, i.e. during the same procedure run and from both UEs, to avoid trackability and linkability issues\".\nThus, considering the new adaptation layer and that all identifiers sent as cleartext must be updated at the same time, the Link Identifier Update procedure, designed in the context of direct communication only, is updated to support the periodic change of the source/destination UEs identity information carried into the adaptation header, at the same time as the per-hop identifiers (i.e. L2 IDs) and the end-to-end security information. In other words, all identifiers carried together, in cleartext, and that may be associated must be changed at the same time.\nFurthermore, the usage of multiple end-to-end unicast links via a single per-hop link means that source/destination UEs identity information carried in the adaptation header, of all end-to-end unicast links, may be associated (i.e. linked) to the same per-hop identifiers since they are sent in the clear when end-to-end peer UEs exchange messages via the UE-to-UE Relay. This implies that the source UE and all its peer UEs over the same per-hop link/Relay would need to change their identifiers (i.e. per-hop identifiers, end-to-end identifiers in adaptation layer and security information identifiers related to per-hop and to end-to-end communication) at the same time. This obviously could lead to a signalling storm of PC5-S message exchanges.\nTo overcome this problem, this solution isolates the identifiers on a per-hop basis, i.e. makes all identifiers sent in cleartext (i.e. in the headers), specific to the per-hop link. This is handled at the UE-to-UE Relay by replacing the received source UE identifiers with corresponding relay-specific identifiers before forwarding a message to a peer UE via another per-hop link. The reverse action is done when the peer UE sends a message to the source UE, i.e. the UE-to-UE Relay replaces the relay-specific identifiers with source UE identifiers before forwarding the message to the source UE.\nA UE does not know its peer UE's identifiers thus, when identifiers need to be changed on the UE, only the identifiers used between this UE and the UE-to-UE Relay need to be updated and only this UE and the UE-to-UE Relay are involved in the Link Identifier Update procedure.\nIn addition to the per-hop identifiers and E2E identifiers carried in adaptation header, the Application layer ID and the IP address/prefix may as well be changed periodically. The Application layer ID and the IP address/prefix, however, cannot be replaced by the UE-to-UE Relay with relay-specific identifiers to be isolated on the per-hop link since they are not exchanged in the message header (thus not visible at the UE-to-UE Relay). To overcome this problem, the Link Modification procedure is executed between the source UE and the E2E peer UE during (i.e. before completion of) the LIU procedure, in the case where the LIU procedure is triggered due to the change of Application layer ID and/or IP address/prefix.\nFigure 6.32.2.2-1 shows an enhanced LIU procedure when a Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay is used. The LIU procedure, as defined in TS 23.304 [3], is modified to allow the update of all identifiers sent in cleartext on the per-hop and adaptation layer headers. UE1 uses the per-hop link, as a management link, to exchange PC5 messages with the UE-to-UE Relay. In this case, the PC5 messages are consumed by the UE-to-UE Relay and are not forwarded to the E2E peer UE. In this case, we refer to the PC5 link as the management link. The management link is used to exchange new E2E identifiers between a UE and the UE-to-UE Relay as part of the enhanced LIU procedure.\nThe figure depicts a link identifier update procedure with Layer-2 UE-to-UE relay, illustrating the steps involved in updating the link identifier for a Layer-2 network. The diagram shows the process of updating the link identifier, which is crucial for maintaining network stability and performance.\nFigure 6.32.2.2-1: Link Identifier Update procedure with Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay\n0.\tUE1 and UE2 establish and end-to-end PC5 unicast link via the UE-to-UE Relay. Security is established E2E between UE1 and UE2. Both UEs have a PC5 unicast link (also called per-hop link or management link) established with the UE-to-UE Relay. The PC5 unicast link established with the UE-to-UE Relay is used for the transport of E2E messages, and also for the management of these E2E links when the UE-to-UE Relay needs to be involved, as defined in this TR Solution #13: Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay.\n1.\tUE1 receives a trigger to change its identifiers e.g. privacy timer expiry, Application layer ID change or IP address/prefix change. UE1 sends an LIU Request message to the UE-to-UE Relay via the management link. The LIU Request message includes a new L2 ID and new security information for the management link, as well as new E2E security info and a new E2E identifier for the E2E link with UE2 and used in the adaptation layer.\n2.\tThe UE-to-UE Relay receives the message, updates its mapping table with the new identifiers from UE1 while keeping the current values. The UE-to-UE Relay generates a new L2 ID and security information for the management link, and a new relay-specific E2E identifier and new relay-specific E2E security information associated to UE2. The UE-to-UE Relay sends a LIU Response message to UE1 which includes its new L2 ID and security information for the management link, the new relay-specific E2E identifier, and new relay-specific E2E security information.\nNOTE:\tFor UE-to-UE Relay solutions for which the UE-to-UE Relay doesn't perform Adaptation layer replacement between E2E ID and Relay specific ID, which information will be included in steps 1-2 and steps 3-4 will be determined during normative phase.\n3.\t[optional] If UE1 has triggered the LIU procedure because a new Application layer ID and/or a new IP address/prefix has been received from the upper layer, UE1 sends a Link Modification Request to UE2 including its new Application layer ID and new IP address/prefix. The Link Modification Request message is modified to support a new operation code, e.g. \"change-of-ID\", and the new Application layer ID and new IP address/prefix.\n4.\t[optional] UE2 sends a Link Modification Accept to acknowledge the new IDs from UE1. The new IDs received on the Request message are sent back with the Accept message. After step 4, UE2 may triggers LIU procedure with UE-to-UE Relay to update its E2E identifier and L2 ID used between UE2 and UE-to-UE Relay, as described at steps 1 and 2.\n5.\tUE1 completes the LIU procedure by sending a LIU Ack message to the Relay.\n",

As part of the PC5 unicast link establishment procedure, the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay allocates an IP address/prefix to the UE or the UE registers its IP address/prefix with the UE-to-UE Relay. The UE-to-UE Relay stores an association of the UE's Application layer ID (also called User info) and IP address/prefix. The source UE sends IP data to the target UE via the PC5 unicast link to UE-to-UE Relay. The UE-to-UE Relay acts as an IP router and forwards the packets to the corresponding PC5 unicast link towards the target UE.\nThe existing Link Identifier Update procedure as defined in TS 23.304 [3] may be used between the UE and the Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay. In the case where the IP address/prefix needs to be changed, the existing Link Identifier Update procedure is re-used with some modifications. The source UE triggers the Link Identifier Update procedure over the PC5 link established with the UE-to-UE Relay and if the UE-to-UE Relay is the one allocating the IP address/prefix for the source UE, the source UE requests a new IP address/prefix to the UE-to-UE Relay during the Link Identifier Update procedure. If the UE allocates its own IP address/prefix, then it is provided to the UE-to-UE Relay. Since the peer UE is communicating with the source UE using the source UE's IP address, the peer UE needs to be informed of the source UE's new IP address. The source UE thus also provides to the UE-to-UE Relay its peer UE's Application layer ID and IP address, allowing the UE-to-UE Relay to send the source UE's new IP address to its peer UE. The peer UE is informed during the LIU procedure thus the new IP address/prefix may be used as soon as the LIU procedure completes.\nFigure 6.32.3.2-1 shows the Link Identifier Update procedure when a Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay is used. The LIU procedure, as defined in TS 23.304 [3], is modified to request the UE-to-UE Relay to allocate a new IP address/prefix to the source UE and to send this new IP address/prefix to the peer UE.\nThe figure depicts a detailed procedure for updating the link identifier and IP address of a Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay in a 5G network. The update involves updating the link identifier and IP address of the relay, which is crucial for maintaining network connectivity and ensuring efficient communication. The figure also illustrates the process of changing the IP address of the relay, which is a critical step in ensuring that the relay remains operational and can continue to relay data packets.\nFigure 6.32.3.2-1: Link Identifier Update procedure and IP address change with Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay\n0.\tA PC5 link is established between UE1 and a UE-to-UE Relay. Another PC5 link is established between the UE-to-UE Relay and UE2. IP data may be exchanged between UE1 and UE2 via the UE-to-UE Relay over the PC5 links. During the link establishment, UE1 informs the UE-to-UE Relay that the link requires privacy.\n1.\tUE1 receives a trigger e.g. privacy timer expiry or new Application layer ID or new IP address/prefix to be changed. UE1 triggers the Link Identifier Update procedure, i.e. it auto-generates a new Layer-2 ID and new security information, and it sends a Link Identifier Update Request message to the UE-to-UE Relay including: its new Layer-2 ID, new security information, new Application layer ID (if provided by the upper layer) and a \"new IP address needed\" indication (if IP communication is used).\na.\tIf UE1's IP address/prefix needs to be changed, UE1 also provides its peer UE information (UE2's IP address, UE2's Application layer ID), allowing the UE-to-UE Relay to inform the peer UE (i.e. UE2) about UE1's new allocated IP address/prefix.\nb.\tIf UE1 self-assigns its IP address/prefix and has updated it then UE1 specifies its new IP address and does not specify \"new IP address needed\" indication. In this case, the UE-to-UE Relay keeps track of this new IP address associated to UE1.\n2.\tUE-to-UE Relay self-assigns a new L2 ID, new security information and possibly new IP address/prefix for PC5 link with UE1.\na.\tUE-to-UE Relay assigns a new IP address/prefix to UE1 and saves it locally if a \"new IP address needed\" indication is received.\nb.\tIf a \"new IP address needed\" indication is received, UE-to-UE Relay fetches UE2's entry from its local table based on the received Application layer ID or IP address/prefix. UE-to-UE Relay then sends a PC5 Relay Update Request message to UE2, including: UE1's old IP address/prefix, UE1's old and new Application layer ID, UE1's new IP address/prefix.\n3.\tUE2 receives the PC5 Relay Update Request message and saves UE1's new IP address/prefix. UE2 sends a PC5 Relay Update Response message to the UE-to-UE Relay including all parameters received on the PC5 Relay Update Request message.\na.\tUE2 should be able to receive IP data with UE1's old IP address (transit packets sent prior to UE1's receiving its new IP address) until an IP packet using UE1's new IP address is received. At this point, UE2 starts using UE1's new IP address and may forget UE1's old IP address.\n4.\tUE-to-UE Relay sends a Link Identifier Update Response message to UE1 including UE1's new IP address/prefix, UE-to-UE Relay's new Layer-2 ID, new security information and possibly new IP address/prefix and/or new Application layer ID.\n5.\tUE1 saves its new IP address/prefix and UE-to-UE Relay's new parameters and sends a Link Identifier Update ACK message to the UE-to-UE Relay, including its new IP address received on the Response message. UE1 and UE-to-UE Relay may then start using the new Layer-2 IDs for PC5 communication. UE1 starts using its new IP address for IP data exchange with UE2.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution address KI#1. This solution focuses on a unified route selection procedure for both Layer-2 and Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay operation, so that the UE can determine which 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay can provide connection to a target UE.\nIn this solution, the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay operation is supported with the following principles. Some of the aspects that are specific to Layer-2 operation are indicated explicitly:\n-\tAuthorization and configuration:\n-\tOnly the UEs authorized by the service authorization configuration can act as a 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay or a 5G ProSe U2U UE. These UEs will be configured according to the service authorization and provisioning mechanism defined in solutions for KI#6 to operate in the UE-to-UE Relay mode.\n-\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay discovery:\n-\tReuse the Model A and Model B UE-to-Network relay discovery procedures defined in clause 6.3.2.3 of TS 23.304 [3] for discovering the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay by the 5G ProSe U2U UEs. A RSC may be associated with multiple ProSe services. Relay discovery is supported independent of the 5G ProSe U2U UEs communicating with each other via the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Layer-2 ID used for the discovery can be specific for UE-to-UE Relay discovery.\n-\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Route discovery:\n-\tWhen 5G ProSe UEs cannot discover each other directly using the ProSe direct discovery procedures described in TS 23.304 [3], ProSe direct discovery messages are relayed via the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay to discover each other. During this end-to-end discovery relaying procedure, the 5G ProSe U2U UEs also discover the route, i.e. 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay UEs, that can reach another 5G ProSe U2U UE.\n-\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay discovery messages (both Model A and Model B) are reused to include the end-toend direct discovery message information to assist with 5G ProSe U2U UE route discovery. The End-to-End (E2E) direct discovery message information contains the User Info ID/ProSe discovery codes corresponding to the ProSe service supported by the 5G ProSe U2U UE, and it may be different from the User Info ID used in Relay discovery message.\n-\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Route selection:\n-\tWhen multiple routes, i.e. multiple 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay UEs are discovered during the Route discovery, the source 5G ProSe U2U UE selects a best route before U2U relay connection setup based on Radio link quality criteria and Upper layer criteria like E2E discovery message (i.e. ProSe service matching) information.\nNOTE 2:\tRadio link quality criteria for 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Route selection are in the scope of RAN WG2.\n-\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay operation:\n-\tPer-hop unicast links are established between the 5G ProSe U2U UEs and the selected 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay before U2U relay communication is supported. A unicast link that is already setup between the 5G ProSe U2U UE and 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay can be shared for relaying traffic to different 5G ProSe U2U UEs.\n-\tWhen a source 5G ProSe U2U UE needs to communicate with target 5G ProSe U2U UE via the Layer-3 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay, it sends a DNS query to obtain the IP address and IP/non-IP relaying is supported via the per-hop unicast links as described in sol#2.\n-\tIn the case of Layer-2 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay operation, an end-to-end unicast link is setup between the source 5G ProSe U2U UE and the target 5G ProSe U2U UE before relaying IP/non-IP data. When a per-hop unicast link is shared between different end-to-end unicast links, there is additional routing functionality that will be defined by RAN WG2 for Layer-2 relaying.\n-\tQoS handling:\n-\tFor Layer-3 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay connection, 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay configures the per-hop PC5 QoS flows to meet the E2E QoS, as described in sol#2.\n-\tFor Layer-2 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay connection, the source 5G ProSe U2U UE and the target 5G ProSe U2U UE establish and modify the PC5 QoS Flows using the procedures in TS 23.304 [3]. The E2E QoS flows are not known to the Layer-2 ProSe UE-to-UE relay. Hence, to support the E2E QoS, how the QoS parameters for the per-hop PC5 link RLC channels are configured by the Layer-2 ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay will be defined by RAN WG2.\n-\tSecurity handling:\n-\tSource 5G ProSe U2U UE and target 5G ProSe U2U UE can establish bearer level security with the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay for the unicast L2 Link, using procedures defined in TS 23.304 [3].\n-\tIf end-to-end security protection is required between source 5G ProSe U2U UE and target 5G ProSe U2U UE connected via Layer-3 ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay then IPSec can be used.\n-\tEnd-to-end security protection between source 5G ProSe U2U UE and target 5G ProSe U2U UE connected via Layer-2 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay is be supported via bearer level security for the E2E unicast link.\nNOTE 3:\tThe security protection of the traffic of source 5G ProSe U2U UE and target 5G ProSe U2U UE will be specified by SA WG3.\n",

The Discoverer UE selects one of the ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay(s), when response messages are received from multiple ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay.

The UE-to-UE Relay can decide this based on local configuration, e.g. split the QoS requirements equally among the two hops.\n4a.\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay send the per-hop QoS parameters and QoS flow information to the source 5G ProSe U2U UE either during unicast link or via unicast link modification procedure.

The Direct Communication Request message includes User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of Target UE, QoS Info (PFI and PC5 QoS parameters) and RSC.\nWhen the target UE receives the Direct Communication Request, it triggers the security procedure with source UE via the Layer-2 ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay.\nThe target UE sends a Direct Communication Accept message to the source UE via the Layer-2 ProSe 5G UE-to-UE Relay.

For example, if the service requirement needs service continuity, but the application does not support service continuity, the ProSe application server may prioritize Layer-2 UE-to-Network relay or Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF to ensure session continuity. If the service requirement does not need continuity, the ProSe application server can decide the path re-selection rules based on the business consideration, e.g. Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF may be preferred for its simplicity and low-cost.\nThis solution proposes the Prose application server to decide the path re-selection rules for path switching among different indirect network communication paths. The path re-selection rules include the prioritizations of target relay mode. The target relay mode has three modes: Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF access and Layer-2 UE-to-Network relay. The configuration parameters for a 5G ProSe remote UE may consist one or more relay service code(s) for the UE-to-network relay discovery which is an indication of whether the relay service code is offering 5G ProSe layer-2 or layer-3 UE-to-network relay service. There exists the situation the target relay UE with the relay mode which has the highest priority in the path re-selection rules may not be available, e.g. no response received, when the remote UE starts the reselection of relay UE. To quickly find the target relay UE and minimize the service interruption between the path switching, the Remote UE should send multiple 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Solicitation messages simultaneously each of which contains different relay service code supported in the path re-selection rules, and set a timer to wait and receive the response messages from the available target relay UEs. Similarly, in model A the remote UE may set a timer to receive multiple discovery messages of the available relay UEs. Then remote UE can decide to select the target relay UE which has the highest priority of relay mode among the received available target relay UEs.\n",

It applies for scenario when the indirect network communication path is through L-3 U2N relay.\nThis solution assumes the following mechanism to support communication reliability:\n-\tIn the case of L-3 U2N relay without N3IWF, it is assumed that the Remote UE uses its own PDU session as the direct communication path and the PDU session of the relay UE as the indirect network communication path to realize communication reliability. These two redundant PDU sessions use two different UPFs.\n-\tIn the case of L-3 U2N relay with N3IWF, it is assumed that the Remote UE uses its own PDU session as the direct communication path and the Non-3GPP PDU session established through N3IWF as the indirect communication path to realize communication reliability, The Non-3GPP PDU session established through N3IWF is over the PDU session of L-3 U2N relay. These two redundant PDU sessions use two different UPFs.\n-\tIn the case of L-3 U2N relay with N3IWF, it is assumed that the Remote UE can use ATSSS mechanism to setup two redundant User Plane paths in a MA PDU session to realize communication reliability. One path is over 3GPP access as the direct communication path, and the other one is over Non-3GPP access as the indirect communication path which is through N3IWF and the path of PDU session of the L-3 U2N relay. The traffic distributed across the two redundant User Plane paths may apply corresponding Steering Mode, e.g. Active-Standby or Duplication.\n-\tIn the above 3 cases, the two redundant User Plane paths may go through two different NG-RANs or same NG-RAN, depending on the scenarios. In the case of two different NG-RANs, communication reliability at RAN side is naturally supported. In the case of a same NG-RAN, the NG-RAN needs to internally realize the communication reliability, e.g. by allocate different, redundant user plane resources for the each User Plane path.\n-\tIt is assumed NG-RAN is provided with the ID of the communication path in the PDU session of L-3 U2N relay. This ID is generated by L-3 U2N relay. The NG-RAN is also provided with ID of redundant communication path in the PDU session established by Remote UE over 3GPP access. This ID is determined by Remote UE, and the Remote UE get this ID information from L-3 U2N relay. If within a NG-RAN there are two PDU session with the same ID for the communication path and redundant communication path, this NG-RAN should realize communication reliability for these two PDU session.\n-\tThe Remote UE and L-3 U2N relay should support the above redundancy mechanism. The Remote UE and L-3 U2N relay need to be authorized for the additional service of redundancy communication when performing authorization and provision for L-3 U2N Relay. In the discovery procedure, the Remote UE selects a L-3 U2N relay which supports redundancy communication.\n",

The Prose policy for remote UE can include authorization for redundancy communication between multi-path transmission. The Prose policy for L-3 U2N UE can include authorization for redundancy handing on PDU session for L3 relay.\n2.\tThe 5G ProSe L-3 U2N Relay may establish a PDU Session for relay that supports redundancy. The L-3 U2N Relay may generate the ID of the communication path and send to its SMF. The SMF sends the ID of the communication path to NG-RAN in the PDU session establish procedures, e.g. in N2 SM information.\nNOTE:\tUniqueness of the ID is required to be guaranteed to avoid the case that multiple L-3 U2N Relay generate the same ID. The L-3U2N Relay UE may generate the ID of the communication path by some algorithm, e.g. based on random number, to ensure it is unique across all Relay UEs in a RAN node.\n3.\tThe Remote UE performs discovery of a ProSe L-3 U2N Relay with redundancy capability and service. This may be triggered by UE implementation, when some application needs reliable communication.\n4.\tThe Remote UE establishes a connection to L-3 U2N Relay. If there is no PDU Session associated with the Relay Service Code or a new PDU Session for relaying is needed, the 5G ProSe L-3 U2N Relay initiates a new PDU Session establishment procedure for relaying as described in step 2 before completing the PC5 connection establishment. In the procedures for establishment of unicast PC5 link, the L-3 U2N Relay sends the ID of the communication path to Remote UE, e.g. in Direct Communication Accept message, then the Remote UE treats it as ID of the redundancy communication path to the communication path established at 3GPP access side in step 6.\n5.\tSubsequent steps for different L-3 U2N communication mode, after Remote UE connected to L-3 U2N Relay:\n5a.\tIn the case of L-3 U2N relay without N3IWF, for IP PDU Session Type and IP traffic over PC5 reference point, IPv6 prefix or IPv4 address (including NAT case) is allocated for the Remote UE. The UE use the IP address for communication.\n5b.\tIn the case of L-3 U2N relay with N3IWF, the Remote UE registers in 5GC through N3IWF via the communication path of L-3 U2N Relay. The Remote UE establishes PDU session or MA PDU session at Non-3GPP side. If the UE is configured with ATSSS and the network supports MA PDU session, then the UE decides to establish MA PDU session at Non-3GPP side. It is assumed the MA PDU session is prior to two single PDU sessions when redundant communication is required.\n6.\tIf it is following step 5a in which the Remote UE uses the PDU session of L-3 U2N relay for communication, or in step 5b the Remote UE establishes PDU session at Non-3GPP side, the Remote UE establishes a new PDU session at 3GPP access side. These two redundant PDU sessions use two different UPFs which could be achieved by operator configuration.\nIf in step 5b the Remote UE established MA PDU session at Non-3GPP side, the Remote UE establishes another access leg of the MA PDU session at 3GPP access side.\nIn the above PDU session establish procedures, the Remote UE may send the ID of redundant communication path to its SMF. The SMF sends this ID to NG-RAN in the PDU session establish procedures, e.g. in N2 SM information. With ID of redundant communication path, NG-RAN knows the PDU session is from L3 remote UE and needs the redundancy handling with another UE's PDU session.\nAfter step 6, two redundant communication paths are established, then they can be used for redundant traffic delivery end-to-end following the methods defined in URLLC. If it is a MA PDU session, then the traffic distributed across the two redundant paths may apply corresponding Steering Mode for ATSSS, e.g. Active-Standby or Duplication. How to support redundant handling for ATSSS at UE side and 5GC side will be standardized in Rel-18 ATSSS_Ph3.\n7.\tThis step includes the assumed redundant handling at RAN side. If the PDU session of L-3 U2N Relay and PDU session of Remote UE at 3GPP access are in a same NG-RAN node, this NG-RAN should realize communication reliability for these two PDU session, e.g. allocating different, redundant user plane resources for each PDU session. The NG-RAN can identify the two PDU sessions by comparing the ID of the communication path in a PDU session of Relay with the ID of the redundant communication path in a PDU session of Remote UE. If the two PDU sessions are separately at different NG-RAN nodes, then each of the NG-RAN can check out that the two PDU sessions are not paired in the NG-RAN. When multiple Remote UEs share a same Relay in a NG-RAN, the NG-RAN should realize communication reliability for PDU session of Relay and PDU sessions of multiple Remote UEs, e.g. the allocated user plane resources for PDU session of Relay is different from the allocated user plane resources for PDU sessions of multiple Remote UEs. It is assumed that the NG-RAN could identify the two PDU sessions by finding out a PDU session of Remote UE whose ID of redundant communication path has the same value with the ID of communication path of the PDU sessions of Relay, when there is new PDU session of Relay in the NG-RAN, e.g. due to Relay mobility. The NG-RAN could identify the two PDU sessions by finding out a PDU session of Relay whose ID of communication path has the same value with the ID of redundant communication path of the PDU sessions of Remote UE when there is new PDU session of Remote UE in the NG-RAN. If the NG-RAN support Master Node and Secondary Node, the NG-RAN could realize redundant user plane resources for the two PDU Sessions with two NG-RAN nodes, by dividing each of the two PDU sessions on different Node.\nEditor's note:\tConfirmation of feasibility on RAN impacts by RAN WGs is required before concluding this solution.\nEditor's note:\tIt is up to RAN decision on whether and how to identify the paired PDU session for redundancy belonging to different two UEs in a NG-RAN.\n",

The following call flow describes the general steps required for establishing an emergency call over U2N Relay.\nThe figure depicts an overview of emergency call establishment over U2N Relay, illustrating the process of establishing an emergency call between two U2N relay nodes. The diagram shows the network topology, including the relay nodes, the U2N relay, and the emergency call setup. The figure provides a visual representation of the steps involved in establishing an emergency call, including the use of the U2N relay for relaying the call, and the U2N relay node for receiving and forwarding the call.\nFigure 6.43.2-1: Overview of emergency call establishment over U2N Relay\nIdentification of support of emergency services by U2N Relay: Dedicated RSC\nThe Remote UE should be able to identify whether a UE-to-Network Relay UE supports relaying emergency services during Relay Discovery phase. A Relay Service Code is used to differentiate the services offered by Relay UEs. The Relay Service Code for emergency services needs to be defined as a unique value in 3GPP standards.\nRelay Authorization for Emergency Services\nEmergency services over ProSe U2N Relay has a different importance than normal services. The emergency services are a critical connection for the user of the remote UE and Public Safety Access Point that is reached through UE's emergency call. A 5G ProSe UE capable to perform U2N Relaying may not be willing to relay emergency services (for example, due to low battery level and imminent switch-off or a known movement from that location). Hence it is important that UE indicates its capability to function as a U2N Relay capable for emergency services during registration procedure with the network.\nThe network indicates authorization to function as a U2N Relay for emergency services by either explicit indication or by including the Relay Service Codes for emergency services.\nRelay Selection Enhancements\nFor Layer-3 Relay Selection, the existing relay selection procedure (with enhancements to identify emergency services RSC) is sufficient for supporting emergency services.\nFor Layer-2 Relay selection, the Relay UE shall provide emergency service for remote UEs of any PLMN. The Layer-2 Remote UE shall skip the PLMN check if the relay selection is performed for emergency service RSC. This also implies that a Layer-2 Relay UE that is authorized by the network for relaying emergency services broadcasts the emergency related RSCs only if the NG-RAN cell indicates support of emergency services (IMSEmergencySupport).\nPC5 Connection Establishment enhancement\nThis enhancement is needed for Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay. The Remote UE indicates during Layer-2 link establishment phase whether the link establishment is triggered due to an originating emergency service. This maybe either through the use of dedicated emergency services RSC or through the use of Direct Communication Request enhanced with a new cause value indicating \"emergency services over U2N Relay\".\nEnhancements to Location Request procedure\nNetwork may use either of the following to get the UE location during an emergency call.\ni)\tUE Provided Location Information (UPLI).\nii)\tNetwork provided Location Information (NPLI).\nIn the case of emergency services over Layer-2 U2N Relay, if the network is using NPLI, it may ask the Remote UE to report Enhanced Cell ID. The remote UE reports the NCGI obtained from the Relay UE during the Discovery procedure to report Enhanced Cell ID. In addition, the Remote UE also reports a confidence factor which is indicative of its distance from the Relay UE. The higher the distance between the Remote UE and Relay UE, lower the confidence factor.\nEditor's note:\tWhether the distance between the Remote UE and Relay UE needs to be computed is FFS, and if needed, how it is done is to be determined/collaborated with RAN WGs.\n",

The figure illustrates the importance of ensuring emergency service in the 5G ProSe Layer-2 network, with a focus on the connection setup and the role of the network relay.\nFigure 6.45.2.2-1: Connection Establishment for 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay with ensuring emergency service\n0~5.\tSteps 0~5 are basically similar to the steps 0~5 of clause 6.5.2.2 of TS 23.304 [3] for Connection Establishment of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay. Following may be some differences:\nFor steps 2~3, the Relay discovery, selection and PC5 connection establishment are for emergency services which may associated with an Emergency RSC.\nFor step 4, the 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE establishes an RRC Connection with the same NG-RAN serving the selected 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay specified in TS 38.300 [15]. The RRC Connection cause is set to emergency.\nFor step 4, the 5G ProSe layer-2 Relay uses the service request with emergency type to enter to the CM-CONNECTED.\n6.\tNG-RAN informs Remote AMF that the 5G ProSe Remote UE is using the Relay communication and is only allowed to use emergency service.\nIn addition, if the 5G ProSe layer-2 Relay is already in CM-CONNECTED state (i.e. the step 5 will be skipped), after receiving the Remote UE RRC connection setup request with emergency cause, NG-RAN informs Relay AMF that the 5G ProSe Relay UE is performing emergency service for 5G ProSe Remote UE to exempt from e.g. overload control for the 5G ProSe Relay UE.\nEditor's note:\tThe above notification from NG-RAN to AMF needs coordination with RAN groups.\n7~9.\tSteps 7~9 are basically similar to the steps 6~8 of clause 6.5.2.2 of TS 23.304 [3] for Connection Establishment of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay.

This can be in addition to the \"Emergency Request\" as already defined in TS 23.502 [8] enabling the network to differentiate whether the emergency service is required by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay or the Remote UE..\nNOTE 2:\tRegarding \"Service Indication\" associated with emergency request, it is expected that at least one remote UE emergency service to be concurrently supported by the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay in addition to the \"Emergency Request\" from 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay for itself.\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "For Key Issue #1: \"Support of UE-to-UE Relay\", based on Table 6.0-1, the solutions can be summarized and evaluated as the following:\n-\tSol#1 Alternative 1 proposes to an efficient way of UE-to-UE relay discovery and selection which is integrated into the unicast link establishment procedure. The solution proposes to use \"relay_indication\" to extend the reachability of the Direct Communication Request, thus the source UE can discovery the target UE(s) via the relays. The proposed method can be applied in PC5 unicast link establishment procedure. The solution enables target UE to select relays and source UE to select relay path or direct path, furthermore it does not require the UEs and relays to maintain their neighbour lists. Sol#1 Alternative 2 is merged into Sol#10, and is evaluated in Sol#10.\n-\tSol#2 proposes a Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay solution based on IP routing. In the solution, a UE-to-UE relay is responsible for allocating IP addresses to the UEs connected to it. The solution proposes Model A based relay discovery that the relay announces itself to its proximity, the UEs need to setup PC5 links to all relays in proximity order to discovery other UEs or be discovered via DNS queries. The solution proposes hop-by-hop based QoS handling to achieve E2E QoS requirement, as well as IP encapsulation to handle Non-IP traffic. The UEs should keep the PC5 link with the Relay UE in order to discovery other UEs or be discovered. IPSec is used for end-to-end security protection between source UE and target UE, and this shall be co-ordinated with SA WG3.\n-\tSol#3 is merged into Sol#10, and is evaluated in Sol#10.\n-\tSol#4 QoS control for Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay is merged into Sol#11, and is evaluated in Sol#11. For Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay, the E2E QoS parameters are provided by source UE to the Layer-2 UE-to-UE relay via PC5-S, the Layer-2 UE-to-UE relay splits the E2E QoS parameters into two parts.\n-\tSol#5 is merged into Sol#11, and is evaluated in Sol#11.\n-\tSol#6 is merged into Sol#11, and is evaluated in Sol#11.\n-\tSol#7 focus on UE-to-UE relay reselection. It proposes that the Source UE or Target UE can initiate the relay reselection procedure and then the two UEs can negotiate UE-to-UE Relay reselection using the existing relay connection. The other solutions for initial relay selection such as Sol#10 and Sol#34 could also be used for UE-to-UE Relay reselection, by requiring re-running of the Discovery procedure. The radio criteria for Relay reselection is determined by RAN WG2.\n-\tSol#8 proposes PCF based service authorization and policy/parameter provisioning to UE for UE-to-UE Relay operation and Service Authorization information related to UE-to-UE Relay operation sent by AMF to NG-RAN.\n-\tSol#9 proposes a Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay sends out a Relay Announcement message periodically to announce its availability as a UE-to-UE Relay. If the Relay UE can serve the UE and the UE wants to be discovered by other UEs via this Relay UE, the UE will send an Announcement message to the Relay UE so that this UE can be added to the Relay UE's target UE list.\n-\tSol#10 is a consolidated solution common for both Layer-2 and Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay discovery and selection based on Sol#1 alt2 (Model B discovery) and Sol#3 (Model A discovery). RSC is used in the UE-to-UE Relay discovery to indicate the connectivity service. After the Model A or Model B discovery, source UE selects the UE-to-UE Relay and gets the User Info ID and Layer-2 ID of the target UE. This solution doesn't assume the discovery procedure is followed by communication procedure, thus the UE-to-UE Relay doesn't store info for the communication setup in future.\n-\tSol#11 is a consolidated solution to support Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay connection setup based on Sol#1, Sol#4, Sol#5, Sol#6. It assumes source UE has already selected a suitable UE-to-UE Relay and received User Info ID and Layer-2 ID of the target UE before this procedure. This solution is applicable for both IP and non-IP traffic. In this procedure, UE-to-UE Relay receives the target UE's L2 ID from source UE and sets up or reuses the link between UE-to-UE Relay and target UE. The IP addresses of source UE and target UE are exchanged by PC5 signalling. Source UE provides the E2E QoS parameters to the Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay, the Layer-3 UE-to-UE relay splits the E2E QoS parameters into two parts.\n-\tSol#12 proposes a solution for Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay discovery and communication. For Relay discovery, this solution proposes the Relay UE has discovered other UEs in proximity and obtained the User Info ID and Layer-2 ID of Target UE which can be used for subsequent communication procedure. For Relay communication, the Relay UE sends the DCR message to the Target UE using the Target UE Layer-2 ID obtained during discovery procedure, and the Relay UE acts as a DNS server to return IP address of Target UE to the Source UE. Different from Sol#10 and Sol#11, the UE-to-UE Relay needs to buffer some parameters during the discovery procedure for subsequent UE-to-UE Relay communication and discard them if no communication is setup.\n-\tSol#13 proposes a Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay communication solution which enables a source UE and a target UE to establish an end-to-end (E2E) PC5 unicast communication via the Relay UE. It proposes end-to-end security association established between a source UE and a target UE. It works with Model A/B discovery or integrated discovery procedure (UE-to-UE relay discovery and selection which is integrated into the unicast link establishment procedure). It supports source UE's DCR in both user oriented L2 link setup request (w/ target User info) and service oriented L2 link setup request (w/o target User Info). After successful E2E link establishment, it assumed that adaptation layer will be used for routing messages between source UE and target UE via Relay UE. E2E security association and adaptation layer details shall be coordinated with SA3 and RAN WG2, respectively.\nThe key difference between Solutions #13 and #30 is that solution #13 triggers the per-hop connection setup based on the E2E DIRECT COMMUNICATION REQUEST message (steps 2 and 3 of Figure 6.13.2-1), while solution #30 triggers the per-hop connection setup based on the per-hop DIRECT COMMUNICATION REQUEST (steps 3a and 3b of Figure 6.30.2.1.2-1) and after the per-hop link is setup the E2E DIRECT COMMUNICATION REQUEST is sent. In other words, sol#13 proposes the per-hop links are established during the end-to-end PC5 link establishment procedure, sol#30 proposes the per-hop links are established before the end-to-end PC5 link establishment procedure.\n-\tSol#30 proposes a procedure for Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay discovery and connection establishment. For Model A discovery, source UE selects the UE-to-UE Relay, for Model B discovery, target UE selects the UE-to-UE Relay. An E2E PC5 link is establishment by following the per-hop PC5 link establishment or modification procedure. Per-hop PC5 link sharing is supported and RAN coordination on this is needed. How to transfer E2E PC5-S messages and E2E data by the UE-to-UE Relay and E2E QoS handling and splitting the QoS is for RAN WG2 to determine.\nIn solution #30, Announcement message or Solicitation response message include information about the available target UEs.\n-\tSol#31 proposes to add authorization of UE using security credential to share IP address only to authorized UE. Source UE may allow sharing IP address only to the authorized UE by sharing token. The detail procedure needs to be coordinated with SA3.\n-\tSol#32 proposes a solution for Link Identifier Update procedure when using UE-to-UE Relay. The Link Identifier Update procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3.2 of TS 23.304 [3] is re-used when the communication is done via a UE-to-UE Relay, and the procedure is adapted with some changes depending on if the UE-to-UE Relay is Layer-2 based or Layer-3 based. For Layer-2 based LIU, it proposes a way that the LIU procedure between the UE and the Relay does not involving the end-to-end peer UEs for ID privacy. Layer-2 based LIU needs a coordination with RAN WG2.\n-\tSol#33 proposes a solution for Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay discovery and communication. For Relay discovery, this solution proposes the Relay UE has discovered other UEs in proximity and obtained the User Info ID and Layer-2 ID of Target UE and the Source UE can obtain Layer-2 ID of Target UE during discovery procedure. For Relay communication, it is proposed an E2E PC5 unicast link is established between Source UE and Target UE via the Layer-2 Relay, and how the PC5-S messages are forwarded is to be defined by RAN WG2.\n-\tSol#34 proposes a separation of U2U Relay discovery and U2U Route discovery. 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay discovery messages (both Model A and Model B) are reused to include the end-to end direct discovery message information to assist with 5G ProSe U2U UE route discovery. For U2U Relay discovery, it proposes to reuse U2N Relay discovery and for U2U Route discovery Model A and Model B discovery are proposed. For Model A discovery, it proposes that relay UE forwards announcement message from announcing UE with RSC specifying R-UE. For Model B discovery, similar solution to sol#10 is proposed. It proposes that PC5 link between Source UE and Relay UE and Target UE and Relay UE are set up after on U2U Route discovery procedure independent of an E2E connection setup. It only supports user oriented L2 link setup request from source UE i.e. DCR with target User info.\n",

Furthermore, Sol#14 gives out detailed criteria on target relay selection from upper layer perspective based on 5G ProSe Remote UE traffic handling in clause 6.5.4 of TS 23.304 [3] and the provisioned ProSe policy as specified in clause 5.1.4.1 of TS 23.304 [3], e.g. re-evaluate the URSP or the next RSD of the selected URSP for the target relay selection.\nNOTE:\tThe criteria on path switching from RAN perspective needs coordination with RAN groups.\n-\tSolution#35 can be considered as application layer method which relies on the application server provided prioritizations of target relay mode to select the target relay.

Path switching policy is provided from PCF to the UE or (pre-)configured in the UE. The path switching policy indicates which path(s) is allowed for all or specific ProSe services (i.e. direct PC5 allowed, direct Uu allowed or not allowed indicated). Based on the path switching policy, a UE may establish a PDU session or a PC5 connection in the target path and switch the traffic from the source path to the target path.\n-\tSol#17 proposes to use the make-before-break mechanism to reduce interruption when path switch between PC5 and Uu paths. The path switch Policy indicates whether the specific service is allowed to switch from Uu to PC5 or from PC5 to Uu. The two UEs negotiate to determine which ProSe services are switched based on the path switching policy. For path switching from PC5 path to Uu path, the two UEs may negotiate their Uu QoS based on the PC5 QoS in order to ensure consistent service experience, and may share the IP addresses used for the Uu path with each other to achieve the switch of service transmission.\n-\tSol#18 uses the principle of \"make before break\". Before performing a path switch, the two UEs which are connected via PC5 negotiate the triggers for path switching and what service or QoS flows need to be switched. Once the negotiated triggers are satisfied, the two UEs perform the path switching between PC5 to Uu directly.\n-\tSol#19 proposes to use a path permission policy, which can be (pre-)configured in the UE or provided by the PCF. The path permission policy includes the mapping of ProSe Services to the following path permission:PC5 permitted, or Uu permitted, or both PC5 and Uu permitted.\n-\tSol#20 proposes to support the switching back to PC5 path from Uu path by maintaining the unicast PC5 link after switching to the Uu path and reusing the unicast PC5 link when switching back to the PC5 path. After switching from the PC5 path to Uu path it is UE implementation to keep or release the PC5 link.\n-\tSol#21 proposes that the existing path selection policy, a modified path selection policy or a new path switching policy is used to control path switch between Uu and PC5. During the path switch from PC5 to Uu, PC5 signalling includes the suggested QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters for Uu path.\n-\tSol#22 proposes that for path switching from PC5 to Uu, the IP addresses associated with the UE's PDU sessions are exchanged along with the PDU Session status. PDU session status piggybacked at Keep Alive procedure is used so that each UE may decide the proper time to initiate path switch to Uu with peer UE.\n",

In this solution, the source gNB determines whether to switch to a direct cell or a Layer-2 Relay. If the source gNB determines to switch to a Layer-2 Relay, the source gNB selects the target Layer-2 Relay for Layer-2 Remote UE taking the authorized PLMN list for Layer-2 Remote UE into account.

It proposes to enhance the URSP to allow the UE to be able to re-evaluate the URSP rule to determine to use direct Uu path, indirect Uu path via U2N Relay or both paths based on the availability of U2N Relay path.\n-\tSol #29 focuses on the policy and authorization for Multi-path Transmission via Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF. It proposes to use the similar mechanism as Rel-17 ProSe to enhance URSP with the RSD including a new item \"Multi-Path ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication\" alongside the existing \"ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload\" and keeping them separate.\nFor Aspect #1, on policy authorization aspect, Sol #25 can be used for all solutions addressing Layer 3 U2N Relay without N3IWF and Layer 2 U2N Relay. Sol #29 can also be used for Layer 3 U2N Relay without N3IWF case.\nFor Aspect #2, there are following solutions:\n-\tSol #26 addresses Layer 2 U2N Relay aspect and mainly focuses on the high level description of multiple path transmission, which has significant RAN dependency.\n-\tSol #27 addresses Layer 3 U2N Relay without N3IWF aspect and reuses existing ProSe Policy and URSP design. Remote UE determination of the Multipath establishment is based on the ProSe policy. After legacy URSP evaluation, if the first path is Layer-3 relay without N3IWF, when to establish the Uu path, the Remote UE initiates the PDU Session establishment via direct Uu path based on the PDU session parameters associated to the RSC in ProSe Policy. If the first path is direct Uu path and there is corresponding ProSe policy configured for Layer-3 relay without N3IWF, the Remote UE uses the configured ProSe policy for Layer 3 U2N Relay UE discovery, selection and relay connection establishment. It requires the Remote UE to establish PDU Session via direct Uu path by evaluating ProSe Policy. The solution also describes how the PDU sessions over the direct and indirect paths are correlated in the core network so that UPF forwarding tunnels can be established to transfer data to and from the AF/UE using either of the available paths. This solution is transparent to the AF and does not require ATSSS.\n-\tSol #28 addresses both Layer 2 U2N Relay case and Layer 3 U2N Relay with/without N3IWF cases. For Layer 3 U2N Relay with N3WIF case, it relies on MA PDU session support (defined by ATSSS feature) in 5GS. For Layer 3 U2N Relay without N3IWF case, it relies on Application layer's decision on when to set up the multi-path connectivity and how to aggregate/split the traffic on both paths. For layer 2 U2N Relay, it provides some high level description on how to support multi-path transmission, which relies on work in RAN WGs.\n-\tSol #39 and Sol #40 address how to support multi-path transmission for Layer 2 U2N Relay case, they propose to use URLLC like mechanism under a single NG-RAN node for redundant transmission. Sol #40 relies on MR-DC transmission under one single NG-RAN node, while Sol #39 relies on dual PDU Sessions transmission under one single NG-RAN node.\n-\tSolution #41 meets the requirement of end-to-end redundant communication by supporting redundancy handling at a single NG-RAN node when receiving the path identifications from 5GC, in the case of Layer 3 U2N Relay with/without N3IWF. Its method has RAN impact then confirmation and decision from RAN group is needed. AS a comparison Sol #39 and 40 support redundancy handling at a single NG-RAN node using URLLC like mechanism in the case of Layer 2 U2N Relay. For case of Layer 3 U2N Relay with N3IWF case, Sol #41 propose to use ATSSS feature which is similar with what Sol #28 proposed, with the difference that Sol #41 focus on redundancy communication using the feature defined in R18 ATSSS_Ph3.\nFor multi-path transmission via Layer 2 U2N Relay:\n-\tfor MR-DC based mechanism (e.g. Sol#26, Sol #40), it mainly relies on work in RAN WGs to support multi-path transmission via Layer 2 U2N Relay UE, with the difference being that Sol#26 has no normative work is required for SA2, whereas Sol#40 does;\n-\tfor dual PDU Session based mechanism (i.e. Sol #39), from SA2 aspect, the enhancement may be on policy authorization for multi-path transmission (i.e. proposed in Sol#25), it would also require work in RAN WGs.\nFor multi-path transmission via Layer 3 U2N Relay without N3IWF, it can be achieved via application layer as proposed in Sol #28 and Sol #41.\n",

                    "text_content": "There are following solutions addressing KI#7:\n-\tSol#42, Sol#43, Sol#44, Sol#45, Sol#46, Sol#47, Sol#48.\nAccording to the SA WG1 response (S2-2205433/S1-221222), a general requirement is that 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay UE has normal registration and UE in limited-service state shall not act as Relay.\nFor Layer-2 Remote UE, it can be in limited-service state and such Remote UE may initiate emergency service based on the local regulation and operator policy.\nBelow are the other aspects that are required to support 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Remote UE's emergency service.\n-\tAspect#1 Whether the solution addresses Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, or Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, or both?\n-\tAspect#2 How the Relay announces emergency support?\n-\tAspect#3 How the Remote UE becomes aware of Relay's emergency support?\n-\tAspect#4 How the Remote UE initiates emergency request?\n-\tAspect#5 Whether L2/L3 Relay informs NW of emergency or, of no emergency (i.e. emergency completed)\n-\tAspect#6 Emergency call back is addressed?\n-\tAspect#7 How L3 Remote UE obtain P-CSCF address?\n-\tAspect#8 How Remote UE obtains Emergency number?\n-\tAspect#9 How to obtain Remote UE's position?\n-\tAspect#10 How to handle the emergency service conflict between Remote UE and Relay UE for L3 relay?\nTable 7.7-1 below is a comparison of different solutions based on the aspects above.\n\nTable 7.7-1: Summary of Aspect#1~Aspect#9 addressed solutions (RM=Remote UE, RL= Relay UE, EMG=Emergency)\n\n\nAspect#1 Whether the solution addresses Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, or Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, or both?\nSol#42, Sol#43 and Sol#45 address both L2 and L3 UE-to-Network relaying.\nSol#44, Sol#46, Sol#47 and Sol#48 address L3 UE-to-Network relaying.\nAspect#2 How the Relay announces emergency support?\nAll the solutions propose that the Relay UE use dedicated RSC to announce support of emergency service from Remote UE.\nIn Sol#42, the Relay UE's serving PLMN will have some control, i.e. a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay announces emergency support if the dedicated RSC for emergency has been provisioned in the Relay UE and the Emergency Services Support indication from AMF has been received in the Registration Accept message.\nSol#43 highlights that support for relaying emergency services is to be treated differently from a normal U2N Relay. Since the Relay UE is responsible for the Remote UE's emergency session, the authorization for relaying emergency services is granted when the UE indicates its capability to support relayed emergency sessions. Not all UEs authorized to act as a ProSe U2N Relay are authorized for emergency services.\nAspect#3 How the Remote UE becomes aware of Relay's emergency support?\nAll the solutions propose to use RSC dedicated for emergency service.\nAspect#4 How the Remote UE initiates emergency request?\nAll the solutions propose to use RSC dedicated for emergency service.\nSol#43 also propose to use of Direct Communication Request enhanced with a new cause value indicating \"emergency services over U2N Relay\".\nTo simplify the solution, the dedicated RSC approach is recommended.\nAspect#5 Whether L2 or L3 Relay informs NW of emergency or of no emergency?\nFor L3 relaying, the L3 Relay will use emergency PDU Session for the Remote UE's emergency service.\nFor L2 relaying, currently Sol#42 proposes that L2 Relay UE informs its network of emergency service from Remote UE. Sol#45 (updated in S2-2208582 in this meeting) proposes that NG-RAN informs the L2 relay UE's network of emergency service from Remote UE. This is to ensure the prioritized handling of the emergency service from the L2 Remote UE, the L2 Relay UE needs to get prioritized handling in its AMF to avoid being exempted from congestion control.\nFor L3 relaying, Sol#48 proposes that the L3 Relay optionally includes a \"Service Indication\" associated with emergency request from the Remote UE to distinguish between emergency service for Remote UE and Relay UE.\nAspect#6 Emergency call back is addressed?\nEmergency call back is addressed in Sol#42.\nNOTE:\tCall back to Remote UE that does not have SIM/USIM/ISIM is not required.\nAspect#7 How L3 Remote UE obtains P-CSCF address?\nSol#44 proposes that L3 Relay UE provide P-CSCF address to the Remote UE.\nSol#46 proposes that the Remote UE uses DHCP to obtain the P-CSCF address.\nThe DHCP mechanism specified in TS 24.379 [26] L3 for Remote UE can be reused if the L3 Remote UE does not have pre-configured P-CSCF address.\nAspect#8 How Remote UE obtain Emergency number?\nSol#44 propose that L3 Relay UE optionally provide emergency number to the Remote UE.\nSol#46 clarifies that the emergency number may be preconfigured or provided by the network when a UE (currently acting as Remote UE) previously registered in the network.\nEmergency number is local, therefore the preconfigured approach in Sol#46 may not work in all cases. If the pre-configuration does not work, the Relay UE will be required to send local emergency number to the Remote UE.\nAspect#9 How to obtain Remote UE's position?\nSol#43 (for L2 and L3) proposes to use either UE Provided Location Information or Network provided Location Information to get the UE location during an emergency call.\nSol#44 (for L3) proposes that the Remote UE provide physical address information and/or location information according to the request from 5G ProSe layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, however, it is not clear how the Relay UE provides the location information to network.\nSol#47 (for L3) contains description \"The principle of routing the emergency call via the PLMN serving the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay implies that the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay location is used for emergency call location purposes\".\nThe existing positioning function for emergency (e.g. TS 23.167 [23]) is assumed to be reused. If no other Remote UE location estimate is provided, then the default use of the Relay UE location as the Remote UE location estimate applies on all candidate solutions.\nAspect#10 How to handle the emergency service conflict between Remote UE and Relay UE for L3 relay?\nEditor's note:\tThe following content, if agreed during the meeting, will be included.\nSol#45 (updated in S2-2208582 in this meeting) proposes that the L3 relay UE is allowed to establish 2 emergency PDU sessions, among them, one is for relaying Remote UE emergency services, another is for Relay UE its own emergency services.\nSol#42 (updated in S2-2208360 in this meeting) proposes that L3 the relay UE terminate the remote UE's emergency service and establish its own emergency PDU session for its own emergency service or it is allowed that one emergency PDU session can be shared with L3 Remote UE and L3 Relay UE at same time.\n",

Sol#1 Alt1 is used as basis for normative phase.\n-\tThe 5G ProSe UE-to-UE Relay discovery message contains two sets of elements, i.e. direct discovery set(s) and a U2U discovery set.\n-\tThe direct discovery set of elements can be part of the contents of 5G ProSe Direct Discovery message as defined in Rel-17. This includes for example the User Info ID of Source UE and Target UE.\n-\tThe U2U discovery set contains the information to support the discovery of the UE-to-UE relay and extensions of the direct discovery. This includes for example Type of Discovery Message, RSC, User Info ID of the relay, etc.\n-\t5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay only modifies the U2U set of the elements, and forwards the end-to-end elements during the discovery procedures.\nNOTE 1:\tSA WG3 will determine whether there are security requirements and the protection scheme for the direct discovery set of elements between Source UE and Target UE.\n-\tThe following parameters are used for UE-to-UE Relay discovery:\n-\tFor UE-to-UE Relay Model A discovery, the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of the UE-to-UE Relay, RSC, list of User Info ID of Target UE are contained in the Announcement message.\n-\tFor UE-to-UE Relay Model B discovery between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay, the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of Source UE, RSC, and User Info ID of Target UE are contained in the Solicitation message, and the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, RSC, and User Info ID of Target UE are contained in the Response message.\n-\tFor UE-to-UE Relay Model B discovery between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UE, the Type of Discovery Message, User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, RSC, and User Info ID of Target UE are contained in the Solicitation message, and the Type of Discovery Message, RSC, User Info ID of Source UE, and User Info ID and Layer-2 ID of Target UE are contained in the Response message.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether UE-to-UE Relay provides Layer-2 ID of Target UE in the discovery messages to Source UE can align with the decision of RAN WGs during normative work.\nNOTE 3:\tWhether and how a Source UE and a Target UE indicate support of UE-to-UE Relay operation will be determined in normative phase.\n-\tFor UE-to-UE Relay selection, the Source UE performs the UE-to-UE Relay selection for both Model A and Model B discovery. For Model B discovery, a Target UE may choose to respond or not to a UE-to-UE Relay, for example, based on the PC5 signal strength of each message received.\n-\tFor service authorization and policy/parameter provisioning for UE-to-UE Relay operation, the PCF based service authorization and provisioning as defined in TS 23.304 [3] is used as basis for normative work.\n-\tThe policy/parameters per ProSe service includes Relay Service Code(s) and UE-to-UE Relay Layer indicator(s); a UE-to-UE Relay Layer Indicator per RSC that indicates whether the RSC is offering 5G ProSe Layer-2 or Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay service.\n-\tThe Target UE performs the UE-to-UE Relay selection if the UE-to-UE relay discovery is integrated into PC5 unicast link establishment procedure, i.e. upon receiving a Direct Communication Request from the Source UE via one or more UE-to-UE Relay UEs.\n-\tFor UE-to-UE Relay reselection, the negotiated UE-to-UE Relay reselection between Source UE and Target UE in Sol#7 and the UE-to-UE Relay selection procedure in Sol#10 can be used under different conditions.\nNOTE 4:\tUE-to-UE Relay selection/reselection requires cooperation with RAN WGs during normative work.\n-\tIP, Ethernet and Unstructured traffic types are supported.\nNOTE 5:\tEthernet and Unstructured traffic types can be encapsulated in IP traffic type if supported by source and target UE.\n-\tIn the case of one Source UE communicates with multiple Target UEs, the PC5 link between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay can be shared for multiple Target UEs per RSC while the PC5 links may be established individually between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UEs per RSC. For the shared PC5 link, the Layer-2 link modification procedure can be used.\n-\tIn the case of multiple Source UEs communicate with one Target UE, the PC5 link between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UE can be shared per RSC while the PC5 links may be established individually between Source UEs and UE-to-UE Relay per RSC. For the shared PC5 link, the Layer-2 link modification procedure can be used.\nNOTE 6:\tIf source UE or target UE has multiple application layer IDs (user info), it would be treated as different UEs per application layer ID and separate PC5 link between UE (source UE or target UE) and Relay UE shall be setup. This will be confirmed by RAN WGs during normative phase.\n-\tFor UE-to-UE Relay Per-hop links setup (i.e. PC5 link establishment between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay, as well as between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UE), Source UE initiates the PC5 link setup with UE-to-UE Relay (first hop), and UE-to-UE Relay initiates the PC5 link setup with the target UE (second hop). Sol#11 is used as basis for normative work.\n-\tThe Layer-2 link establishment procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3] is reused for per-hop link establishment for UE-to-UE Relay with the following clarifications:\n-\tUE-to-UE Relay initiates the second hop PC5 link establishment after the Security Establishment procedure is completed at the first hop.\n-\tUE-to-UE Relay sends the Direct Communication Accept message to Source UE after the second hop PC5 link establishment is completed (i.e. UE-to-UE Relay has received Direct Communication Accept message from Target UE).\n-\tThe IP address allocation procedure as defined in clause 6.4.3.1 of TS 23.304 [3] is reused on each hop for UE-to-UE Relay.\n-\tThe Source UE and Target UE may obtain the IP address of each other using DNS. The Source UE may obtain the IP address of a Target UE from the UE-to-UE Relay in the Direct Communication Accept message (if included).\n-\tFor the first hop PC5 link establishment:\n-\tThe Source UE sends a Direct Communication Request message including User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID and Layer-2 ID of Target UE, RSC and Security Information to UE-to-UE Relay.\n-\tFor Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relaying after the security protection is enabled the Source UE sends IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address, QoS Info (PFI and PC5 QoS parameters) to UE-to-UE Relay.\n-\tThe UE-to-UE Relay sends a Direct Communication Accept message to the Source UE including User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE and RSC.\n-\tFor Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relaying the Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay also includes the IP address of the Target UE (optional), QoS Info (PFI and split PC5 QoS parameters), and IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address in the Direct Communication Accept.\n-\tFor the second hop PC5 link establishment:\n-\tThe UE-to-UE Relay sends Direct Communication Request message including User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE, RSC and Security Information to the Target UE.\n-\tFor Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relaying after the security protection is enabled, the Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay sends IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address, and QoS Info (PFI and split PC5 QoS parameters) to the Target UE.\n-\tThe Target UE sends Direct Communication Accept message to the UE-to-UE Relay including User Info ID of Source UE, User Info ID of UE-to-UE Relay, User Info ID of Target UE and RSC.\n-\tFor Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relaying the Target UE also includes QoS Info (PFI and split PC5 QoS parameters), and IP Address Configuration or Link-Local IPv6 address in the Direct Communication Accept message.\nThe following conclusions are specific for Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay:\nNOTE 7:\tEvaluation of any solution to authorize the sharing of IP address information of Source UE and Target UE depends on SA WG3.\n-\tThe Link Identifier Update (LIU) procedure, Sol#32 (clause 6.32.3) is used as basis for normative work.\n-\tFor QoS control of Layer-3 UE-to-UE Relay, the UE-to-UE Relay receives E2E QoS from Source UE and determines the per-hop QoS parameters to satisfy the E2E QoS. Sol#4 (clause 6.4.2) is used as basis for normative work.\nThe following conclusions are specific for Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay:\n-\tPer-hop links (i.e. PC5 link between Source UE and UE-to-UE Relay, as well as between UE-to-UE Relay and Target UE) needs to be established before E2E PC5 link establishment is performed. Sol#30 (clause 6.30.2.2) is used as basis for normative work.\nNOTE 8:\tHow the E2E PC5-S messages are forwarded by the UE-to-UE Relay is to be determined by RAN WGs.\nNOTE 9:\tFor Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay, RAN WGs will define how the E2E QoS will be handled and split over the PC5 links.\n",

                    "text_content": "For Key Issue #7: Support of Emergency for UE-to-Network Relaying, the following are concluded.\nThe following conclusions are common to Layer-2 and Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relaying:\n-\tFor emergency service, the UE shall prioritise direct connection to network. If direct connection is not possible (including the case that the RAN broadcast SIB indicates no emergency support), the UE shall attempt to obtain emergency service via UE-to-Network Relay.\n-\tA 5G ProSe enabled UE acting as Relay shall have a normal registration (including also normal registration for a 5G ProSe Relay enabled UE in Non-Allowed Area). A 5G ProSe Relay enabled UE in limited-service state shall not act as Relay. Mobility Restrictions that are overruled for UE requesting direct emergency service are overruled also for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay that is relaying emergency service.\n-\tA 5G ProSe enabled UE without direct connection to the network for emergency service may request emergency service via the 5G ProSe Relay.\n-\tRSC(s) dedicated for emergency service needs to be provisioned in the 5G ProSe enabled UEs with capability of Relay UE and Remote UE using procedure as specified in clause 5.1.4 of TS 23.304 [3]. The dedicated RSC(s) are used by the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay UE and Remote UE during discovery and PC5 link establishment.\n-\tA dedicated PC5 link associated with an emergency RSC is only used for emergency service. A 5G ProSe enabled UE shall not advertise its support for relaying emergency service unless the serving network has provided an indication of support of relaying of emergency service.\nNOTE 1:\tWhether a 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay needs the indication of support of relaying emergency services from its serving PLMN before advertising its support of relaying emergency services is to be determined in normative phase.\n-\tIf the 5G ProSe Relay needs to establish RRC Connection when the 5G ProSe Remote UE has requested emergency service over PC5, the 5G ProSe Relay shall use \"Emergency\" RRC Establishment Cause.\n-\tEmergency call back for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Remote UE regulatory requirements will be supported using existing functionality defined for Emergency Services.\n-\tThe existing positioning function are reused for the 5G ProSe Remote UE. If no other information is available, the location of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay can be used as Remote UE location estimate.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether and how PC5 security is used for emergency services is to be determined in the normative phase as part of SA3 alignment.\nThe following conclusions apply to Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relaying:\n-\tFor a 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay to advertise its support of emergency service, the serving NG-RAN support of emergency services is required as the Layer-2 Remote UE may select a different PLMN from the Layer-2 Relay.\n-\tA 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE will set its RRC establishment cause to \"emergency\" when establishing RRC connection from RRC_IDLE.\n-\tWhen NG-RAN receives an emergency RRC establishment from a 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE it may need to direct the initial UE message towards its PLMN as in legacy.\nThe following conclusions apply to Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relaying:\n-\tA 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay participates the relay discovery procedure for emergency service only when it receives the Emergency Service Support indicator in Registration Accept.\n-\tIf PC5 connection was requested using emergency RSC, then the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Relay sets the RRC Establishment cause to \"emergency\" when establishing an RRC connection from RRC_IDLE.\n-\tThe emergency number(s) may be preconfigured in the 5G ProSe Remote UE\n-\tFor Layer-3 UE to Network Relaying, the Remote UE may obtain P-CSCF address from the Relay UE via DHCP or may be preconfigured with P-CSCF address.\nNOTE 3:\tRemote UE obtaining P-CSCF address via DHCP is specified in clause 14A.2.1 of TS 24.379 [26].\n-\tA Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay sets up or modifies an emergency PDU session to support the Remote UE's emergency service.\n-\tWhen a 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay UE initiates emergency service, the 5G ProSe Relay UE shall not advertise its support of emergency service and reject any Remote UE’s requests for relaying emergency services. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Remote UE can attempt to select other 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.\n-\tIf the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Relay is relaying an emergency service for a 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE, then it shall prioritise its own emergency service establishment and stop relaying the Remote UEs emergency service.\nEditor's note:\tSA WG1 is expected to verify the service requirement for pre-empting relayed emergency service.\n-\tA 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE should attempt to use 5G ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF procedures before attempting to establish an emergency PDU Session via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF support.\n-\tThe 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Remote UE set the access type to NG-RAN via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay to P-CSCF.\nNOTE 4:\tThis access type indication is required for all IMS services and is not specific for emergency service. It will be introduced by CT WG1.\n",

The security is established end-to-end between UE1 and UE2 as shown by the PDCP layer terminating in UE1 and UE2. Therefore, the E2E PC5-S message between UE1 and UE2 is never exposed at the relay node since the relay function does not process/apply any security on the relayed E2E PC5-S messages.\nThe figure depicts a detailed schematic of the end-to-end control plane protocol stacks used in a Layer-2 network, specifically focusing on the role of a UE-to-UE relay. The diagram illustrates the various components involved in the control plane, including the control plane protocol stacks, the control plane protocol, and the control plane protocol stack. The figure also highlights the use of a relay to facilitate communication between the control plane and the network layer, ensuring efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure A.2.2-1: End-to-End Control Plane protocol stacks using a Layer-2 UE-to-UE Relay\nNOTE 1:\tThe definition and functionalities of the Adaptation Layer are defined by RAN WG2.\nNOTE 2:\tOnly the End-to-End control plane protocol stack is shown in Figure A.2.2-1. The control plane protocol stack of the unicast link between UE1/UE2 and UE-to-UE Relay (i.e. PC5 unicast link) can re-use the regular PC5-S protocol stack defined in clause 6.1.2 of TS 23.304 [3].\nNOTE 3:\tPC5-S messages from direct PC5 unicast link with the UE-to-UE Relay and for E2E PC5 unicast link are supported. The E2E PC5-S message is the message transferred between UE1 and UE2, and the direct PC5-S message is the message transferred between UE1 and UE-to-UE Relay or between UE-to-UE Relay and UE2. How to differentiate them depends on RAN solution. Whether the same pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs is used for direct and E2E PC5-S messages is to be determine during SA WG2's normative phase and it's feasibility is to be confirmed by RAN WG2.\n\n",
