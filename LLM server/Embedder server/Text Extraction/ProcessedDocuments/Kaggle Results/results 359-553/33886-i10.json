                            "text_content": "The network slice admission control (NSAC) issues were studied in Rel-17. It has been agreed in Rel-18 to enhance NSAC features with the following features:\n- \timproved network control of the UE behaviour;\n- \tsupport deploying multiple NSACF.\nIn both cases, better UE admission control is aimed to match the allocated quota. However, potential issues of Denial of service (DoS) attacks to legitimate UEs when the additional features are added to the access control mechanism. The information of actual UE/PDU session usage by a slice, or misinformation provided by malicious UEs or mischievous NFs may not be reflected based on current solutions. For example, a NSACF in a VPLMN updating the number of registered UEs or PDU sessions independently may not provide trusted information to the home NSACF. Another example is when a UE not using a network slice is still counted against quota usage of S-NSSAIs where it is registered. It is notable that an attacker can use legitimate UEs to launch such attacks.\nIn the TR 23.700-41 [3], the issue of how to support network slice admission control (NSAC) involving multiple service areas is being studied, together with multiple solutions accepted. The general assumption is that multiple NSACFs are required, either centralized or distributed. In a roaming scenario, it is assumed that the NSAC may be controlled by an NSACF in the VPLMN or an NSACF in the HPLMN.\nHowever, in a roaming scenario, the information reported by the NSACF in the VPLMN is not verified when it is reported to the HPLMN, i.e. there is no proper home control and a misinformation provided by VPLMN may have negative impact to the slices in other service areas, either in HPLMN or other VPLMN.\nThe security control in different serving areas/PLMNs could be different. For example. the security measure in some service areas is not as strict as what in other areas, attack surface in PLMN of one region may be higher than other regions, etc. The compromised/malicious NSACFs (for solution#13 in TR 23.700-41 [3]) in some high risky serving areas/networks may trigger DoS or other attacks on the home network, e.g., the compromised/malicious (local/distributed) NSACFs in a risky service area may fake the case that the number of registration UEs/PDU sessions is reaching the maximum number, and send Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberUpdate_Request to the Primary NSACF for new quota. The Primary NSACF may allocate more quota to the NSACF in compromised serving area/network while decrease the quota of other \"lower load\" area. Finally, the service of other serving areas/networks could be impacted as the global maximum number may be exhausted by the compromised/malicious NSACFs. As the attack complexity is relatively low while the availability impact could be high, the risk on the system could be high.\nIn 5G network, network functions in serving network are not always trusted by HPLMN, and home control was enhanced in 5G security architecture. For example, linking home control to subsequent procedures during/after primary authentication procedures to prevent certain types of fraud from serving network (see clause 6.1.4 of TS 33.501). If AMF/SMF is compromised, only the service of the attacked area would be impacted. In 3GPP protocol point of view, it can hardly damage the HPLMN and impact service of other areas without involving huge number of \"legal\" UEs due to better home network control for UE access. However, home control for NSAC procedure is not defined in existing specification. In addition, there's almost no cost/complexity for the compromised/malicious NSACF to launch (D)DoS attack to HPLMN, while it could cause potential wider service impact.\n",

And the primary NSACF can be deployed in the HPLMN whereas local/distributed NSACFs can be deployed in the VPLMN.\nWith reference to figure 5.1.2-1, the steps of the solution are described as follows:\n1-2) The AMF or SMF triggers the availability check and update (ACU) procedure and sends the update request to vNSACF as described in TS 23.502 [5].\n3) vNSACF performs the ACU procedure against its local quota.\n4) Based on the local configuration, vNSACF may send an update request to the home NSACF (hNSACF) for verification or availability check and update.\n5) The primary NSACF should verify the validity of the information carried in the update request before performing the availability check and update procedure. If the update request carries UE registration information or PDU session information for an S-NSSAI, the Primary NSACF can verify through UDM/UDR whether the UE has registered in the vPLMN or whether the UE is a legitimate subscriber of the S-NSSAI. The ACU procedure will proceed after the verification is successful.\nNOTE:\tThe UDM stores authentication results of UEs after authentication as described in TS 33.501 [4]. The primary NSACF can distinguish a message is from the local/distributed NSACF in visited network based on the serving network name.

The policies may be defined according to threat surface, security control and security posture of the VPLMN or specific serving area the NSACF located, or other criteria.\n-\tAssume S-NSSAI information of registered UEs/PDU sessions is available in UDM.\nProcedure:\n0a. After received UE registration request and completed primary authentication and authorization for the UE, the AMF sends Nudm_UECM_Registration request to UDM. Once Nudm_UECM_Registration is completed and AMF decides on allowed slice, the AMF sends registration update message or Ack message to UDM to inform about the allowed slices list. The S-NSSAI in this list is the HPLMN mapping of the S-NSSAI in allowed NSSAI of the registration.\n0b. After creating PDU session for a UE on a slice, the SMF sends Nudm_UECM_Registration request to UDM to register the PDU session with parameters including a S-NSSAI.\n1. A NSACF in a VPLMN or specific serving area sends Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberOfUEsUpdate_Request or Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberOfPDUsUpdate_Request to the Primary NSACF. That implies the local maximum or upper threshold number of UEs/PDUs is reached.\n2. The primary NSACF check the local policies pre-configured as described in precondition. If cross check with UDM is not needed according to the policies, the primary NSACF go to step 10a directly to perform NSAC for the S-NSSAI and update quota for the NSACF if needed.\n3. If cross check with UDM is needed according to the policies, the primary NSACF either scans all possible UDMs of the HPLMN or probably discover UDMs based on pre-configured rules.\n4. The primary NSACF sends request to each UDM to get number of registered UEs/PDU sessions in specific VPLMNs or AMFs/SMFs for the S-NSSAI.\n5. The UDM generates report for number of registered UEs /number of PDU sessions in a VPLMN/AMF/SMF List for the S-NSSAI.\n6. The UDM returns the report to the primary NSACF.\n7. The primary NSACF consolidates the numbers collected from all impacted UDMs, and gets the total number of registered UEs/PDU sessions in specific VPLMN/serving area for the S-NSSAI.\n8. The primary NSACF compares the total number of registered UEs/PDU sessions based on UDM reports and the maximum number in the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberOfUEsUpdate_Request (or may be stored locally in primary NSACF).\n9a. If the two numbers are matched or deviation is not crossing the configured threshold, the primary NSACF performs NSAC for the S-NSSAI and update quota for the NSACF if needed.\n9b. If the two numbers do not match or deviation is crossing the configured threshold, the primary NSACF stop NSAC procedure with the potential malicious NSACF, and may adjust the quota for the NSACF, and report the anomaly to OAM.\n10. The primary NSACF sends update response to the NSACF, with success or failure.\n",

The primary NSACF validates the number by comparing the number from the (distributed) NSACF and numbers from UDM.\nThis solution does not prevent the AMF/SMF providing incorrect information to both the UDM and vNSCAF to provide incorrect information on slice usage.
