            "title": "4\tGeneral descriptions of expanded NR positioning enhancements",
            "description": "In Release 17, 3GPP RAN conducted studies on \"NR positioning enhancements\" TR 38.857 [2] and \"Scenarios and requirements of in-coverage, partial coverage, and out-of-coverage NR positioning use cases\" TR 38.845 [3].\nThe study on \"Scenarios and requirements of in-coverage, partial coverage, and out-of-coverage NR positioning use cases\" focussed on V2X and public safety use cases with the outcome being captured in TR 38.845 [3]. Additionally, SA1 has developed requirements in TS 22.261 [4] for \"Ranging based services\" TR 22.855 [5] and has developed positioning accuracy requirements in TS 22.104 [6] for IIoT use cases in out-of-coverage scenarios. There is a need for 3GPP to study and develop sidelink positioning solutions that can support the use cases, scenarios and requirements identified during these activities.\nThe study on \"NR positioning enhancements\" TR 38.857 [2] investigated higher accuracy, and lower latency location, high integrity and reliability requirements resulting from new applications and industry verticals for 5G. Some of the enhancements identified during that work have been specified during the Release 17 Work Item on \"NR positioning enhancements\", but there remain a number of opportunities for enhancement that have not yet been incorporated into the specifications.\nRegarding higher accuracy, two promising techniques identified in earlier studies will be considered in Release 18: one is to take the advantage of the rich 5G spectrum to increase the bandwidth for the transmission and reception of the positioning reference signals based on PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for intra-band carriers, and the other is to use the NR carrier phase measurements. GNSS carrier phase positioning has been used very successfully for centimetre-level positioning but is limited to outdoor applications. NR carrier phase positioning has the potential for significant performance improvements for indoor and outdoor deployments in comparison with the existing NR positioning methods, as well as shorter latency and lower UE power consumption in comparison with RTK-GNSS outdoors.\nPositioning integrity is a measure of the trust in the accuracy of the position-related data and the ability to provide timely warnings based on assistance data provided by the network. The focus in Release 17 work was on GNSS integrity, and for Release 18 it is natural to extend this to address other positioning techniques as well as there are relevant integrity aspects of mission critical use cases that rely on positioning estimates and the corresponding uncertainty estimate. Integrity enables applications to make the correct decisions based on the reported position, e.g., when monitoring a robotic arm to decide whether its arm movement are within allowed limits to ensure safety distances to humans and other objects.\nSA1 has introduced requirements for LPHAP (Low Power High Accuracy Positioning) for industrial IoT scenarios including use cases such as massive asset tracking, AGV tracking in industrial factory and person localization in danger zones. The SA1 requirements are for high accuracy and extreme low power consumption with battery life sustainable up to one or more years. A typical scenario of interest is use case 6 as defined TS 22.104 [6], which corresponds to tracking of workpiece (in- and outdoor) in assembly area and warehouse with a target accuracy of <1m, a positioning interval of 15-30 seconds, and a battery life of 6-12 months. While Release 17 NR positioning has introduced support for positioning in RRC_INACTIVE state, there is a need to evaluate whether the current system allows LPHAP requirements to be met.\nRelease 17 has specified support for RedCap UEs with reduced bandwidth support and reduced complexity including reduced number of receive chains. Such UEs could support NR positioning functionality but there is a gap in that the core and performance requirements have not been specified for the positioning related measurements performed by RedCap UEs, and no evaluation was performed to see how the reduced capabilities of RedCap UEs might impact eventual position accuracy. This gap is to be investigated by the present SI.\n",

possible introduction:\n-\tRTT-type solutions using SL\n-\tThis includes single-sided (also known as one-way) RTT and double-sided (also known as two-way) RTT\n-\tMay include RTT with one or multiple devices.\n-\tStrive to minimize the changes needed on top of the specification support for single-sided RTT, if any, for the introduction of double-sided RTT.\n-\tNOTE: a UE should be able to support single-sided RTT without having to support double-sided RTT.\n-\tSL-AoA\n-\tThis includes both Azimuth of Arrival (AoA) and Zenith of Arrival (ZoA) in the study\n-\tSL-TDOA\n-\tFor SL-only positioning, at least for the purpose of absolute positioning estimation of a target UE, SL-TDOA corresponds to a method wherein SL PRS are transmitted from multiple anchor UEs to a target UE (i.e., DL-TDOA-like operation), and/or from a target UE to multiple anchor UEs (i.e., UL-TDOA-like operation).\n-\tBased on the study, it was agreed that both DL-TDOA-like operation and UL-TDOA-like operation should be introduced.\n-\tA UE is not required to support both DL-TDOA-like operation and UL-TDOA-like operation.\n-\tSL-AoD\n-\tSL-AoD is deprioritized against the other methods listed above for possible introduction.\nNote that the above identification of methods does not necessarily imply their specification as separate methods nor specification of a unified positioning method for sidelink.\nFor the study of different positioning methods, the following aspects are considered:\n-\tDefinition(s) of the corresponding SL measurements for each method\n-\tApplicability of different positioning methods to absolute or relative positioning or ranging, including whether such categorization is needed to be discussed\n-\tFor angle-based methods, antenna configuration consideration(s)

Positioning methods supported using SL PRS measurements at least the following measurements are agreed to be introduced:\n-\tSL Rx-Tx time difference measurement\n-\tSL RSTD measurement\n-\tSL RSRP measurement\n-\tSL RSRPP measurement\n-\tSL RTOA measurement\n-\tSL Azimuth angle of Arrival (AoA) and SL Zenith angle of Arrival (ZoA) measurement.\nNew reference signal designs for SL positioning/ranging, referred to as SL PRS, are studied using the existing PRS/SRS design and SL design framework as starting points.\nFor sequence design for the new reference signal for SL PRS, pseudo-random sequence, using existing DL-PRS sequence as a starting point, is identified as the preferred choice.\nWith regards to the numerologies of the SL PRS, the study is limited to those supported for NR Sidelink.\nAs part of the study, at least the following aspects are considered: Sequence design, frequency domain pattern, time domain pattern (e.g., number of symbols, repetitions, etc), time domain behavior, configuration/triggering/activation/de-activation of the SL PRS, AGC time, Rx-Tx turnaround times, supportable bandwidth(s), multiplexing options with other SL channels, and randomization/orthogonalization options.\nOn the physical structure of SL PRS, a frequency domain pattern following a comb-N design is studied, at least including the following:\n-\tN>=1 (where N=1 corresponds to full RE mapping pattern)\n-\tFully staggered SL PRS pattern (e.g., M symbols of SL PRS with comb-N with M=N and, at each symbol a different RE offset is used), Partially staggered SL PRS pattern (e.g., M symbol(s) of SL PRS with comb-N, with M<N, at each symbol a different RE offset is used), Unstaggered SL PRS patterns (e.g., M symbol(s) of SL PRS with comb- N, at each symbol a same RE offset is used, N > 1)\n-\tOf the above, fully and partially staggered patterns are further prioritized.\n-\tThe number of symbols of SL PRS within a slot\n-\tAny relation to the comb-N option\n-\tRE offset pattern repetitions within a slot\nWith regards to the frequency and time domain pattern of a SL PRS resource within a slot, a SL PRS resource has the following

and/or non-consecutive symbols for shared resource pool can be considered further during normative work.\n-\tDetails of RE-Offset sequence within a SL PRS resource, including whether to have in the

are further studied:\n-\tNumber of symbol(s) for AGC and/or Rx-Tx turnaround time.\n-\tConditions under which AGC training and/or Rx-Tx turnaround time are needed.\nOn the configuration/ activation/ deactivation/ triggering/ reservation of SL PRS, the study focused on the following options, with considerations on flexibility, overhead, latency, and reliability:\n-\tOption 1: High-layer-only signaling involvement in the SL PRS configuration.\n-\tNo Lower layer involvement, e.g., SL-MAC-CE or SCI or DCI, for the activation or the triggering of a SL PRS.\n-\tBased on the study, this option may correspond to:\n-\tA SL PRS configuration that is a single-shot or multiple shots.\n-\tA high-layer configuration that may be received from an LMF, a gNB, or a UE.\n-\tOption 2: High-layer and lower-layer signaling involvement in the SL PRS configuration.\n-\tLower-layer may correspond to SL-MAC-CE, or SCI, or DCI.\n-\tFor example, high layer signaling can be used for SL PRS configuration and lower layer signaling can may be used for initiating SL positioning and/or configuration/triggering/activating/deactivating/indicating and potential resource indication/reservation transmission of SL PRS.\nRegarding resource allocation for SL PRS, at least the following schemes are studied:\n-\tScheme 1: Network-centric operation SL PRS resource allocation (e.g., similar to a legacy Mode 1 solution)\n-\tThe network (e.g., gNB, LMF, gNB & LMF) allocates resources for SL PRS\n-\tScheme 2: UE autonomous SL PRS resource allocation (e.g., similar to legacy Mode 2 solution)\n-\tAt least one of the UE(s) participating in the sidelink positioning operation allocates resources for SL PRS\n-\tApplicable regardless of the network coverage\n-\tPotential mechanisms, if needed, for SL PRS resource coordination across a number of transmitting UEs (e.g., Inter-UE Coordination (IUC)-like solutions) can be considered further during normative work.\nRegarding Scheme 1 SL PRS resource allocation, a transmitting UE receives a SL PRS resource allocation signaling from the network. One or both of the following options are considered further for the corresponding signaling:\n-\tOpt. 1: Through higher layers from the LMF\n-\tOpt. 2: Through dynamic grants, or via configurations of configured grant type 1 or type 2 from gNB.\nRegarding Scheme 2 SL PRS resource allocation, at least the following aspects are studied:\n-\tResource selection mechanism for SL PRS\n-\tInter-UE coordination\n-\tAspects for congestion control mechanisms for SL PRS.\nFor Scheme 2 SL PRS resource allocation, one or both of the following options may be supported during normative work:\n-\tOption 1: A sensing-based resource allocation\n-\tOption 2: A random resource selection\n-\tFor either Option 1 or 2, the legacy designs for UE autonomous resource allocation should be used as a starting point and potential enhancements that may be needed may be considered during the normative work.\n\nAdditionally, on SL positioning resource allocation, the following alternatives are studied:\n-\tAlt. 1: Only dedicated resource pool(s) can be (pre-)configured for SL PRS\n-\tFor dedicated resource pool(s) for SL positioning, at least the following details are agreed to be considered:\n-\twhich slots can be used, SL frame structure, SL positioning slot structure, multiplexing of SL PRS with control information (if included in the same slot),\n-\tpositioning measurement report,\n-\twhether a dedicated frequency allocation (e.g., layer/BWP) is needed for SL PRS,\n-\tresource allocation procedure(s) of SL PRS,\n-\tNOTE: This option may or may not include control information (i.e., configuration/ activation/ deactivation/ triggering of SL PRS) for the purpose of SL positioning operation.\n-\tAlt. 2: Either dedicated resource pool(s) and/or a shared resource pool(s) with sidelink communication can be (pre-)configured for SL PRS\n-\tFor shared resource pool(s) for SL positioning, at least the following details are considered:\n-\tCo-existence between SL communication and SL positioning, backward compatibility\n-\tMultiplexing considerations of SL PRS with other PHY channels (PSCCH, PSSCH, PSFCH) and any modifications in the SL-slot structure.\n-\tNOTE: whether other signals/channels can be present in the dedicated resource pool can be considered further during the normative work.\nWith regards to the SL Positioning resource allocation, it was agreed that either dedicated resource pool(s) and/or a shared resource pool(s) with sidelink communication can be (pre-)configured for SL PRS.\n-\tNOTE: this does not imply that the design is the same for both types of resources pools.\n-\tNOTE: shared resources pool(s) should be supported with backward compatibility.\n\nA dedicated SL PRS resource pool is (pre-)configured in the only SL BWP of a carrier.\n\nThe following options are considered for multiplexing of other channels in a dedicated resource pool for SL positioning in addition to SL PRS:\n-\tOpt. 1: No other channel can be included beyond SL PRS\n-\tOpt. 2: PSCCH which carries SCI associated with SL PRS transmission(s) is included\n-\tOpt. 3: PSCCH which carries SCI associated with SL PRS transmission(s) and PSSCH associated with SL PRS transmission(s) are included\n-\tDefinition of \"PSSCH associated with SL PRS transmission(s)\" can be considered further during normative work.\n\nAt least for a dedicated resource pool for SL positioning, the following alternatives are studied for subsequent down-selection:\n-\tAlt. 1: The bandwidth of SL PRS can be same or smaller than that of the resource pool.\n-\tAlt. 2: The bandwidth of SL PRS is the same as that of the resource pool.\n-\tBandwidth of SL PRS transmission for a shared resource pool can be considered further during normative work.\nFor SL Positioning resource (pre-)configuration in a shared resource pool with Rel-16/17/18 sidelink communication, backward compatibility with legacy Rel-16/17 UEs should be ensured.\n\nWith regards to SL signaling of the reservation/indication of SL PRS resource(s) for dedicated resource pool and shared resource pool for positioning:\n-\tSCI can be used for reserving/indicating one or more SL PRS resource(s)\n-\tNOTE: This does not imply that only SCI is being used. Higher layer signaling may be used for the purpose of indicating a part of the SL PRS configuration.\n-\tWhether SCI is single stage SCI or two stage SCI can be considered further during normative work.\n-\tUse of SL-MAC-CE or other higher-layer signaling for SL PRS resource reservation/indication can be considered further during normative work.\n\nThe granularity of time-domain resource allocation for SL PRS transmission is studied.\nThe following options for time-domain resource assignments and associated Tx UE behavior for SL PRS transmissions are studied:\n-\tPeriodic SL PRS\n-\tSL PRS is transmitted periodically with a transmission periodicity.\n-\tAny additional details, including whether or not higher layers can start/stop transmission, can be considered further during normative work.\n-\tSemi-persistent SL PRS\n-\tSL PRS is transmitted periodically with a transmission periodicity after activation and until deactivation.\n-\tAperiodic SL PRS\n-\tSL PRS is transmitted at least once after either triggering or request.\n-\tApplicability of the above options to SL PRS resource allocation schemes 1 and 2 respectively can be considered further during normative work.\n-\tDetails of Rx UE behavior can be separately discussed during normative work.\n-\tMechanism(s) to be used for activation/deactivation/triggering can be considered further during normative work.\n\nResource allocation for SL-Positioning measurement reports is also included in the study.\nPower control mechanisms for SL PRS transmission, including their necessity, are considered in the study.
