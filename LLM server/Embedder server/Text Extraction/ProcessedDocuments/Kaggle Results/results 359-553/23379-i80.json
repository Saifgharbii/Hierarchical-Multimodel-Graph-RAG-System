            "description": "This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and information flows needed to support the mission critical push to talk (MCPTT) service. The MCPTT service utilizes the common functional architecture to support MC services over LTE including the common services core defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].Support for both MCPTT group calls and MCPTT private calls operating in on-network and off-network modes of operation is specified.\nThe corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] and 3GPP TS 22.280 [17].\nThe present document is applicable primarily to MCPTT voice service using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8]. Certain application functions of the MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.\nThe MCPTT service requires preferential handling compared to normal telecommunication services e.g. in support of police or fire brigade including the handling of prioritised MCPTT calls for emergency and imminent threats.\nThe MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.\nIn the present document, MCPTT calls between MCPTT users on different MCPTT systems are considered.\n",

The MCPTT service also supports private calls between two users.\nThe MCPTT architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support mission critical services over LTE defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] and aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5], the Proximity-based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [6] to enable support of the MCPTT service.\nThe MCPTT UE primarily obtains access to the MCPTT service via E-UTRAN, using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8]. Certain application functions of MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using either MCPTT UEs in E-UTRAN or using MCPTT UEs via non-3GPP access networks.\nNOTE:\tDispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.\nMCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the non-3GPP access network.\nThe MCPTT system provides the function to support interworking with LMR systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].\n",

The EPS bearer for MCPTT imminent peril call shall have higher priority level than one for MCPTT call.\nTo ensure that the MCPTT service always has access to a dedicated bearer for MCPTT media, a pre-established session may be setup that includes a request for resources at the first MCPTT group affiliation.\nThis means that the PCC may multiplex MCPTT media streams from multiple concurrent MCPTT calls into one EPS bearer on one shared network priority regardless of MCPTT call priority.\nNOTE 2:\tA single UM bearer is used to multiplex the media streams from multiple concurrent MCPTT calls.\nNOTE 3:\tThe sharing of a single GBR bearer for voice means that different QCI and/or ARP values are not possible for different voice media streams.\nNOTE 4:\tMulti-talker control may require additional bearer resources if multiple audio streams are sent to the UE when the floor is granted to additional participants during an established MCPTT group session.\n",

The client reports the information of where the client is currently located.\nThe MCPTT server functional entity provides centralised support for MCPTT services.\nAll the MCPTT clients supporting users belonging to a single group are required to use the same MCPTT server for that group. An MCPTT client supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with multiple MCPTT servers.\nNOTE 1:\tPossible requirements for handling multiple distinct media on different MCPTT servers are not covered in this version of the document.\nThe MCPTT server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] to control multicast and unicast operations for group communications.\nThe MCPTT server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.\nBy assuming the role of a GCS AS, the MCPTT server functional entity is responsible for:\n-\trequesting the allocation of multicast resources utilizing the media distribution function;\n-\tannouncing the association of multicast resources to calls to MCPTT UEs;\n-\tdetermining for each MCPTT UE involved in a given call whether to use unicast or multicast transport;\n-\tannouncing the assignment of multicast transport for specific calls to MCPTT UEs; and\n-\tinforming the media distribution function of the media streams requiring support for a given call.\nThe MCPTT server shall support the controlling role and the participating role. The MCPTT server may perform the controlling role for private calls and group calls. The MCPTT server performing the controlling role for a private call or group call may also perform a participating role for the same private call or group call. For each private call and group call, there shall be only one MCPTT server assuming the controlling role, while one or more MCPTT servers in participating role may be involved.\nThe MCPTT server performing the controlling roles is responsible for:\n-\tcall control (e.g. policy enforcement for participation in the MCPTT group calls) towards all the MCPTT users of the group call and private call;\n-\tinterfacing with the group management server for group policy and affiliation status information of this MCPTT server's served affiliated users;\n-\tenforcing functional alias priority handling;\n-\tmanaging floor control entity in a group call and private call; and\n-\tmanaging media handling entity in call i.e. conferencing, transcoding.\nThe MCPTT server performing the functional alias controlling role is responsible for:\n-\tinterfacing with the functional alias management server for functional alias policy from the functional alias configuration;\n-\tfunctional alias activation, deactivation, take over and interrogation support for MCPTT user.\nThe controlling roles for group call, private call and functional alias are independent with each other.\nThe MCPTT server performing the participating roles is responsible for:\n-\tcall control (e.g. authorization for participation in the MCPTT group calls) to its MCPTT users for group call and private call;\n-\tgroup affiliation support for MCPTT user, including enforcement of maximum N2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;\n-\tenforcing functional alias priority handling;\n-\trelaying the call control and floor control messages between the MCPTT client and the MCPTT server performing the controlling role; and\n-\tmedia handling in call for its MCPTT users, i.e. transcoding, recording, lawful interception for both unicast and multicast media.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MCPTT server in the controlling role and the MCPTT server in the participating role can belong to the same MCPTT system or to different MCPTT systems.\nFor group regrouping involving multiple groups from primary and partner MCPTT systems,\n-\tthe group host MCPTT server of the temporary group performs the controlling role and is responsible for the centralized floor control, and for arbitration according to the temporary group or user policies (e.g., priority);\n-\tthe group host MCPTT server of the constituent MCPTT group is responsible for providing call invitations to their group members, and for filtering between constituent group members' floor control requests according to the constituent group or user policies (e.g., priority); and\n-\tthe MCPTT server responsible for the constituent MCPTT group members performs the participating role.\nThe floor participant functional entity is responsible for floor requests. This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-network operations.\nThis functional entity provides support for centralised floor control for on-network and distributed floor control for off-network operation. It may provide arbitration between floor control requests between different users, grant the floor in response to successful requests, and provide queuing in cases of contention. For on-network operation, this functional entity is located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.\nThe media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server (e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following functionality:\n-\tprovide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\n-\treplicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using unicast transport;\n-\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\n-\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and\n-\tprovide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined (e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the MCPTT UE.\nNOTE 1:\tIf media mixing function occurs within the media distribution function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tA media mixing function within the media distribution function is not possible where the media is end to end encrypted.\nGroup configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 3:\tIf media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to minimize the feedback of the user's own voice from the mixed audio in order to avoid echoes.\nThis functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream through the enforcement of media policy information. Group configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the media mixing function in the UE.\nThis functional entity contains information of the MCPTT user profile associated with an MCPTT ID that is held by the MCPTT service provider at the application plane. The MCPTT user profile is determined by the mission critical organization, the MCPTT service provider, and potentially the MCPTT user.\nThe MC gateway server provides support for MCPTT interconnection services with a partner MCPTT system in a different trust domain whilst providing topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCPTT servers in the partner MCPTT system without needing to expose the MCPTT servers in the primary MCPTT system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCPTT system. It may be a role of the MCPTT server described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 of the present document.\nThe MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor control signalling messages, and media between MCPTT servers within the MCPTT system and the interconnected MCPTT system.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].\n\n",

The MCPTT-1 reference point shall use the SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points for transport and routing of SIP signalling. The MCPTT-1 reference point may use the HTTP-1 and HTTP-2 reference points.\nThe TMGI is communicated between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT client using the MCPTT-1 reference point.\nInformation that is reported to the MCPTT server from the MCPTT client shall be configurable at the application layer. This interface may include the area where a UE is currently located, described as ECGI of the serving and neighbouring cell(s), MBMS SAIs, MBSFN Area ID. This information comes from the broadcast by the local cell, e.g. from SIB1 and SIB15 (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [12]) as decoded by the UE.\nNOTE:\tThis reference point includes the GC1 reference point as described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9]. It is assumed that the MCPTT server is performing the function of GCS AS. While 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] does not specify GC1 it does include high level descriptions of certain interactions on GC1, including those relating to the availability of multicast delivery for the application client. The MCPTT-1 reference point fulfils the requirements of the GC1 reference point for MCPTT.\nMessages supported on this interface may also include the MCPTT server providing the MCPTT client with information describing the mapping of transport resources to specific group calls.\nThe MCPTT-2 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT user database, is used by the MCPTT server to obtain information about a specific user. The MCPTT-2 reference point utilises a diameter management application protocol as defined in 3GPP TS 29.283 [18] and shall be intra-network.\nThe MCPTT-3 reference point exists between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT server and between the MCPTT server and the MC gateway server for MCPTT application signalling for establishing MCPTT sessions. The MCPTT-3 reference point shall use the SIP-2 reference point for transport and routing of signalling. If a pair of MCPTT servers, or an MCPTT server and an MC gateway server, are served by different SIP cores then the MCPTT-3 reference point shall also use the SIP-3 reference point for transport and routing of signalling. Floor control signalling and media are also transferred using the MCPTT-3 reference point.\nThe MCPTT-4 reference point, which exists between the floor control server in the MCPTT server and the floor participant in the MCPTT client, provides floor control signalling between the floor control server in the MCPTT server and the floor participant over a unicast bearer. The MCPTT-4 reference point uses the SGi reference point defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].\nThe MCPTT-5 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the EPS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the MCPTT server to obtain unicast bearers with appropriate QoS from the EPS. It utilises the Rx interface of the EPS according to 3GPP TS 23.203 [4].\nMCPTT-5 is not used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator do not have an operational agreement for QoS control to be provided directly from the MCPTT service provider domain.\nMCPTT-5 may be used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator have an operational agreement where QoS control is provided directly from the MCPTT service provider domain.\nNOTE:\tAny coordination between the P-CSCF use of Rx and the MCPTT server use of Rx (via MCPTT-5) from the MCPTT service provider domain is not specified in this release of this specification.\nThe MCPTT-6 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the EPS, is used to request the allocation and activation of multicast transport resources for MCPTT application usage. The MCPTT-6 reference point uses the MB2-C interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468 [10].\nThe MCPTT-7 reference point, which exists between the media distribution function and the media mixer, is used to exchange unicast media between the media distribution function of the MCPTT server and the media mixer of the MCPTT client. The MCPTT-7 reference point uses the SGi reference point defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].\nThe MCPTT-8 reference point, which exists between the media distribution function and the media mixer, is used by the media distribution function of the MCPTT server to send multicast media to the media mixer of the MCPTT client. The MCPTT-8 reference point uses the MB2-U interface defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9].\nThe MCPTT-9 reference point, which exists between the floor control server and the floor participant, provides floor control signalling between the floor control server and the floor participant over a multicast bearer. The MCPTT-9 reference point uses the MB2-U interface defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9].\nThe IWF-1 reference point is specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].\nThe descriptions for reference points of the common services core are contained in the common functional architecture to support MC services specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].\nThe MCPTT-10 reference point, which exists between the MC gateway server and the MC gateway server in an interconnected MCPTT system for MCPTT application signalling for establishing MCPTT sessions, shall use the SIP-3 reference point for transport and routing of signalling.

The figure includes various components such as base stations (BSs), user equipment (UE), and scatterers, which are essential for signal transmission and reception.

The diagram shows the network's topology, including the network interface controller (NIC), switch, and network interface module (NIM). The disconnect procedure involves initiating a disconnect command, which is then propagated to the switch and NIM. The switch then initiates a disconnect command to the NIC, initiating the disconnect process. The output of the disconnect procedure is the network interface module (NIM), which is disconnected from the network.\nFigure 10.5.3.2.2-1: Disconnect procedure\n1.\tFloor control is ongoing within a private or group call established using pre-established session.\n2.\tMCPTT server has determined to release MCPTT client A from the call e.g., due to call release.\n3.\tPre-established session call disconnect request message is sent by the MCPTT server to indicate to MCPTT client A that the MCPTT private call or group call using a pre-established session has been released.

Preconfigured user regroup remove response information elements\n\n10.6.2.3.1.1.1\tGeneral\nA pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the affiliated group members. The initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group members being invited. Media plane resources are reserved (on-demand) or a pre-established session is associated during the group call setup procedure and released (if on-demand session) or de-associated (if pre-established session) when the call is released. SIP signalling is used to setup and release pre-arranged group calls.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.2\tPre-arranged group call setup\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT members of that group.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT group call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCPTT users on client 1, client 2 and client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the MCPTT group management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA pre-arranged group is an MCPTT group that is pre-defined with MCPTT group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are already registered for receiving MCPTT service and affiliated. Optionally, they may have an activated functional alias to be used during the group communication.\n3.\tOptionally the MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n4.\tOptionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nThe figure depicts a pre-arranged group call setup, with participants arranged in a specific order to facilitate a smooth conversation. The visual elements include the participants' names, the order in which they are seated, and the arrangement of the room's furniture. This setup is essential for maintaining a professional and efficient conversation, as it ensures that each participant has a clear view of the other and can easily communicate with them.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT group call with a selected group (identified by MCPTT group ID). The MC service user may select a functional alias.\nNOTE 1:\tMCPTT client 1 need not be aware of the affiliation status of other MCPTT clients to the group while initiating the group call.\nNOTE 2:\tThe selected functional alias is not changed during the group call, i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias until the group call is released or the MCPTT client has left the group call.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCPTT server via the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCPTT group ID. The group call request also contains the MCPTT group ID and an SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the group call request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional alias. If the group call request contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized and the group call is ongoing for that MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT server adds the requesting MCPTT client 1 to the existing MCPTT group call and notifies the MCPTT client 1 that the MCPTT group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server. The MCPTT server evaluates the applicable group call start criteria defined for this group (e.g. minimum number of affiliated members, specific members affiliated) and determines whether the group call setup can proceed.\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the group call request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\nNOTE 3:\tMCPTT server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally cached on the MCPTT server then MCPTT server requests the user/group configuration data from the MCPTT user database/group management server.\n4.\tMCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group call request via the SIP core towards the MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated group members. MCPTT users are notified about the incoming group call and the functional alias of the group call initiating user is displayed if present. The MCPTT server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the call and the functional alias of the group call initiating MC service user may be displayed.\n5.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients accept the group call request, and a group call response is sent to the group host MCPTT server. This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be based on configuration. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.\n6.\tMCPTT server sends the group call response including the selected media parameters to the MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment. The response may contain the functional alias, which may be displayed.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n7.\tIf the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated MCPTT group members, and the required MCPTT group members do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to group policy from the group configuration. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all MCPTT group members who did not acknowledge the group call request within the configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT group call.\n8.\tMCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g., MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established media plane assuming implicit floor control request from MCPTT client 1 while at the same time floor participants at other MCPTT client's receive floor taken information. MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send media, while the other MCPTT clients in the group call will be receiving that media. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT group, floor arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.\nNOTE 5:\tThe clients use the same functional alias within floor control procedures as used during group call setup.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.3\tRelease pre-arranged group call\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call.\nThe figure depicts a release pre-arranged group call, with participants arranged in a specific order. The visual elements include the participants' names, the time of the call, and the duration of the call. The figure is labeled with the figure number and the section number, indicating its location within the document.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged group call setup).\n2.\tMCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\n3.\tMCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and generates group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tMCPTT server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call.\n5.\tMCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.\n6.\tMCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards the MCPTT server by sending a group call release response.\n7. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is terminated.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.4\tLate entry pre-arranged group call\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT server requesting a newly affiliated member or a member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCPTT group call.\nNOTE:\tThis procedure applies to all types of group call, including, for example, emergency call, imminent peril call and broadcast call.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional aliases.\nThe figure depicts a late entry pre-arranged group call, which is a type of call where participants are arranged in a specific order to ensure a smooth and efficient call. The call is scheduled to take place at 10:62:23:14. The participants are arranged in a line, with the first participant being the caller and the last participant being the receiver. The call is scheduled to last for 14 minutes and 23 seconds.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call\n1.\tMCPTT server determines that MCPTT client 1 which is newly affiliated or coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group call (late entry).\n2.\tMCPTT server generates group call request including the information such as MCPTT service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT server), MCPTT group ID of the group invited to join, offer one or more media types and sends towards the MCPTT client 1 via SIP core.\n3.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is notified about the incoming group call.\n4.\tUpon MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 accepting the incoming group call request, MCPTT client 1 sends the group call response including the selected media types to the MCPTT server through the signalling path. If the incoming group call request is rejected by the MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT server should not resend the group call request. The group call response may also contain a functional alias of MCPTT client 1.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may be displayed.\n6.\tThe floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to MCPTT client1.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.5\tRejoining call\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client to rejoin an ongoing MCPTT group call (e.g. coming back from out of coverage).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional aliases.\nThe figure depicts a call rejoin scenario in a telecommunications network, showing the steps taken to rejoin a call after a failed connection. The diagram illustrates the process of rerouting the call to a different network or device, and the steps involved in ensuring a successful rejoin.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group call, then the MCPTT client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including the ongoing group call information. The group call rejoin request may contain a functional alias of MCPTT client 1 as selected by the MC service user.\n2.\tMCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT client 1 can rejoin the ongoing call (e.g. based upon affiliation status) and checks the functional alias, if present.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by sending a group call rejoin response. If the ongoing group call is emergency or imminent peril group call, the response shall contain emergency or imminent peril indicator.\n4.\tMCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may be displayed.\n5.\tThe floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to MCPTT client 1.\n10.6.2.3.1.2.1\tGeneral\nIn a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCPTT user individually joins a group call without being invited. The establishment of a chat group (restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call model. Restricted means that only users that have been configured as members of the given group are allowed to join the group communications for the given group.\nChat group join mechanism:\n-\tEach MCPTT client sends a group join request when the MCPTT user wants to participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not impact the MCPTT user's membership in the group; the MCPTT server will verify that the MCPTT user is an authorized member of the group.)\n-\tThe group join request may include a request to transmit. If the group join request includes a request to transmit it may also include location information. It is assumed that the group join request will be delivered from MCPTT client to MCPTT server using SIP.\n-\tIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\n-\tThe group join request is used to indicate to the MCPTT server that the MCPTT user associated with the given MCPTT client wishes to participate i.e. begin to receive media from or send media to the group.\n-\tThe group join request shall cause the MCPTT server to generate an implicit affiliation for the MCPTT user to the group, if the user is not already affiliated to the group.\n-\tThe group join request contains the information needed to negotiate media parameters (on demand) or to associate a pre-established session between MCPTT server and MCPTT client for the group call. The group join request can take the form of a SIP invite.\n-\tA selected functional alias is not changed by a MCPTT client during the whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat group call is released or the MCPTT client leaves the chat group call.\nSubsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat model:\n-\tOnce an MCPTT client successfully joins a group call which is using the chat model, the MCPTT client connects to the media plane for the call if the call is currently ongoing.\n-\tIf the MCPTT group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCPTT clients on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between floor control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCPTT client will only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.\n-\tIf the newly joined MCPTT user wishes to transmit media (start or re-start the call) to the other joined users of the group using the chat model, then the MCPTT client shall use a normal floor control procedure for requesting the floor.\n-\tSince subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using floor control signalling, additional SIP signalling messages may not be required for subsequent call stop and start.\n-\tEach request to transmit from an MCPTT user could be viewed as a new instance of a group call for the given group when the floor idle timer expires and no media is present for an extended time.\n-\tThe MCPTT server may tear down the media plane between successive group calls using the chat model, or the MCPTT server may allow the media plane to remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on resources.\nLeaving and releasing a chat group:\n-\tWhen a user wants to leave a chat group call, the client shall send a group call leave request to the server and release the media plane.\n-\tThe server can release a chat group call by sending a group call release to all joined clients. A server initiated release also releases the media plane for all joined clients.\n10.6.2.3.1.2.2\tChat group call setup\nMCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCPTT service provider in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users (MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call communication. No call is currently in progress for the group.\n3.\tOptionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nThe figure depicts a chat group call in a Microsoft Teams application, with participants represented by different colored avatars. The call is taking place in a private channel, and the participants are engaged in a discussion. The call is being monitored by a moderator, who can see the participants' messages and the overall conversation. The figure provides a visual representation of the chat group call's structure and the interactions between the participants.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCPTT chat group call\n1.\tMCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group. This may include a request to transmit.\n1a.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the desired group. It contains the MCPTT user's MCPTT ID, the MCPTT client media parameters and optionally a functional alias. If there is a request to transmit, then the group joint request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the group join request includes an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\n1b.\tThe MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.8.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\n1c.\tThe MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCPTT server selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.\n2.\tIf MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the media plane (if not already established) for the call. The associated floor participants for MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 use the floor control procedure to initiate the call. E.g., the floor participant for MCPTT client 1 receives the MCPTT floor grant. The corresponding floor participants for MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 receive the MCPTT floor taken. If present, the functional alias of MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are displayed where appropriate.\n3.\tFloor control will continue to be used by the floor participants associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are affiliated. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT group, floor arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.\n10.6.2.3.1.2.3\tRelease chat group call\nThe procedure describes the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or the number of affiliated MCPTT group members is below the minimum number permitted.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure for an MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different procedure.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT server initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT group call.\nThe following precondition applies:\n- A group call is ongoing between MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3\nThe figure depicts a release chat group call, showing a group of individuals engaged in a conversation. The call is taking place in a release channel, which is a designated space for releasing new features or updates to the product. The participants are shown in a separate window, indicating that they are not part of the main conversation. The call is being monitored by a moderator, who is visible in the upper right corner of the figure. The release channel is a crucial aspect of the product's release process, ensuring that the product is released in a controlled and efficient manner.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1: Release chat group call\n1.\tMCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\n2.\tMCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and generates group call release request to release the ongoing session.\n3.\tMCPTT server sends a group call release request towards each participant of the ongoing group call.\nNOTE 2:\tThe group call release request can also be sent over SIP signalling on the signalling plane.\n4.\tMCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.\n5.\tOptionally the MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, may send a group call release response to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MCPTT client can send group call release response when the group call release request is sent using a unicast bearer.\n6.\tMCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 release the floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is released. Successful release of the group call does not affect the status of affiliation of any of the clients.\n10.6.2.3.1.2.4\tLate entry chat group call, newly joined group member\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.4-1 are those for a group member entering an ongoing MCPTT group call, i.e. performing a late entry.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined to the group.

Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional aliases.\n3.\tMCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group.\n4.\tOptionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nThe figure depicts a late entry of a newly joined group member, with a focus on the group's structure and the individual's position within the group.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.4-1: Late entry of a newly joined group member\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the desired group. It contains the MCPTT user's MCPTT ID, the MCPTT client media parameters and optionally a functional alias. If there is a request to transmit, then the group joint request contains an indication of an implicit floor request.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group.\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the acceptance of the group join request.\n4.\tMedia plane between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT server is established using media plane control signalling.\n5.\tMCPTT users at MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may be notified about the MCPTT client 1 joining the group call.

A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the group and is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group. If the group call is for a temporary group formed by the group regroup procedure, the MCPTT group ID will be a temporary MCPTT group ID.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information (either from group management server or itself) including the constituent MCPTT groups' identities, accessible group members list of the constituent groups, and other related data.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates directly a call request to the accessible group members using the detailed user information and/or location information. The group members upon receipt of the call request may accept or reject the call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group members' information of the constituent group belonging to the partner MCPTT system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call request message to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system with the target group's MCPTT group ID information.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system further initiates a call request to the constituent group's members as described in step 3.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call response message to the MCPTT client of the affiliated MCPTT user upon receiving responses to the call requests sent to members of primary and partner MCPTT systems.

The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group members' information of the constituent group belonging to a partner MCPTT system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call release request message (3b) to the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system(s) with the target group's MCPTT group ID information. The MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system(s) further initiate group call release request messages (3c-1, 3c-2) to its group's users.\n4.\tThe MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.\n5.\tThe MCPTT client(s) receiving the group call release request messages provide group call release response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.

A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the temporary group formed by group regroup procedure, and is also where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher has created the temporary group. The MCPTT group ID will be a temporary MCPTT group ID.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information (either from group management server or itself) including the constituent MCPTT groups' identities, and other related data.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may interrogate the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system for the affiliated group 2 members.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system responds with a list of the affiliated group members of group 2.\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 3 and 4 do not occur if the constituent groups' information is available and up to date at primary MCPTT system due to the procedure for temporary group formation as defined in subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].\n5.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system verifies the commencement policies of the temporary group, and initiates a call invitation or call notification to the affiliated members of groups 1 and 2.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides group call response message to the MCPTT UE of authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher upon receiving responses to the call invitations sent to members of primary and partner MCPTT systems. The group call response will consist of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.\n7.\tUpon successful call setup completion, a group call is established for the group members belonging to constituent groups of multiple MCPTT systems.\nNOTE 2:\tMCPTT clients are generally aware that their (constituent) groups have been regrouped (e.g., see subclause 10.1.5.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]); however, if not, the partner MCPTT server of the constituent group can also respond to a group call request with a redirection response, such as \"moved temporarily\" that includes the group URI of the temporary group formed by group regroup procedure.\nFigure 10.6.2.4.3.1-1 illustrates the pre-arranged group call setup procedure for an MCPTT group defined in the partner MCPTT system.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT group is defined on the group management server which is located in the partner MCPTT system with MCPTT users affiliated to that group.\n2.\tThe members of the MCPTT group defined in partner MCPTT system belong to different MCPTT systems.\nThe figure depicts a pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in a partner MCPTT system, with the initiating party. The setup includes the initiator's call setup, the responder's call setup, and the group's call setup. The figure also includes the call setup for the group's call, which is a pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in a partner MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.6.2.4.3.1-1: Pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in partner MCPTT system (initiating)\n1.\tThe affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an MCPTT group ID.

If authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group management server.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system initiates a call request to the group's affiliated members.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system of the MCPTT client. The group call response message will consist of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group call response message to the MCPTT client.\n8\tUpon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the group members.\nThe procedure described in figure 10.6.2.4.3.2-1 is used for pre-arranged group call setup when acknowledgement is required from at least some of the call recipients.\nThe figure depicts a pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in a partner MCPTT system, with the terminating partner MCPTT system. The setup includes the necessary components such as the group call setup, the terminating partner, and the partner MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.6.2.4.3.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in partner MCPTT system (terminating)\n1.\tMCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system sends the group call request message towards the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system of the MCPTT client.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system determines whether to forward the group call request message to the MCPTT client based on the user profile.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group call request message to MCPTT client. The MCPTT server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the call.\n4.\tMCPTT user is notified about the incoming group call.\n5.\tThe receiving MCPTT client accepts the group call and a response message is sent to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system. This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be based on configuration.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the response message to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system (i.e. group hosting MCPTT server).\nFigure 10.6.2.4.3.3-1 illustrates the group call setup procedure for an MCPTT chat group defined in the partner MCPTT system.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT users of MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3 are members of a chat group that is defined in the partner MCPTT system.\n2.\tMCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users (MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call communication.\n4.\tNo call is currently in progress for the group.\n5.\tOptionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nThe figure depicts a setup for a chat group call for an MCPTT group defined in a partner MCPTT system. It includes a call setup for the group, a call control point (CCP), and a call termination point (CTP). The figure also shows the call control point (CCP) and call termination point (CTP) for the group.\nFigure 10.6.2.4.3.3-1: Chat group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in partner MCPTT system\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the desired group. If there is a request to transmit, then the group join request contains an indication of an implicit floor request.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.8.3.2 / 10.8.3.2a in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system determines the group home MCPTT server where the MCPTT group is defined.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group join request to the partner MCPTT server i.e. to the the group home MCPTT server.\n4.\tThe partner MCPTT server receives the group join request. The partner MCPTT server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user 1 is not already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.8.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system replies with a group join response indicating the acceptance of the group join request and also including the MCPTT server selected media parameters for the group call.\n6.\tThe primary MCPTT server stores the affiliation status of the user for the requested MCPTT group.\n7.\tThe primary MCPTT server forwards the group join response to the MCPTT client.\n8.\tThe MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, causing the media plane to be established (if not already established) for the call.\n9.\tFloor control will continue to be used by the floor participants associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are affiliated.\nFigure 10.6.2.4.4-1 below illustrates the merging of MCPTT clients in a newly formed temporary group with active group calls.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe temporary group consists of group 1, which is hosted by the primary MCPTT system, and group 2, which is hosted by the partner MCPTT system.\n2.\tBoth group 1 and group 2 have active calls.\n3.\tThe group management client of the authorized MCPTT user belongs to the primary MCPTT system.\nThe figure depicts a merging of groups involving multiple MCPTT systems, illustrating the process of combining data from multiple sources to improve network performance.\nFigure 10.6.2.4.4-1: Merging of groups involving multiple MCPTT systems\n1.\tThe temporary group formation - group regrouping involving multiple MCPTT systems, according to subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], takes place.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client of the authorized MCPTT user requests group call merge operation to MCPTT server hosting group 1. The identities of the groups being combined are included in this message.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server (primary) responds with an OK response.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server (primary) sends a group combine request to the MCPTT server (partner) that is hosting group 2.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server (partner) responds with a list members of group 2 and an indication of which members are affiliated and which are active in the call.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server (primary) contacts the active members of group 2 inviting them to join the temporary group call.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server (partner) transfers group 2's floor status data (including pending requests and queue positions) to the primary MCPTT server and combines this with the group 1's floor status data in order to create the temporary group's floor status data.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server (primary) performs floor control for the temporary group.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server (primary) notifies the MCPTT client of the authorised MCPTT user that the active calls have been merged.\nNOTE:\tThe MCPTT server in primary system revokes and queues floor given to one of the two talkers based on the arbitration result for the temporary group.\nA broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCPTT user expects no response from the other MCPTT users, so that when his transmission is complete, so is the call.\nThe group-broadcast group and the broadcast regrouped group are similar in structure (a collection of groups). Similarly the user-broadcast group and the pre-arranged group (a collection of users) are similar in structure. Only the call originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call and the broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete, unless the call originator is overridden.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2-1 illustrates the common procedure for group-broadcast group call, user-broadcast group call, and broadcast regrouped group call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members of a group-broadcast group/user-broadcast group/broadcast regroup group.\n2.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 1 may have an activated functional alias for the group communication.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a group call scenario on B road, with participants on the left and right sides of the call. The call is being broadcast to the entire group, and the participants are able to hear each other clearly.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2-1: Broadcast group call\n1.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause 10.6.2 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call indicator. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used for the broadcast group call and the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user.\n\nNOTE 1:\tBroadcast group call applies to both pre-arranged and chat group call model. In the chat group call model case, the broadcast group call setup procedure is done by floor control signalling.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 starts to transmit media.\nNOTE 2:\tOnly the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on broadcast group call, unless overridden.\nNOTE 3:\tA broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over group calls on its subordinate groups.\n3.\tIf the media transmission from call originating MCPTT user is complete, the broadcast group call is released.\nThe group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not a set of MCPTT users. The group-broadcast group is also defined with a hierarchy. It is expected that the MCPTT user that originates the group-broadcast group call is the only one transmitting media during the group-broadcast group call and that the group-broadcast group call is terminated when the transmission is complete. However, if the override feature is enabled, then the call originator may be overridden.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call establishment.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members is a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).\n2.\tThe group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT group call that is not an MCPTT emergency group call.\n3.\tThe call initiator of the group-broadcast group is a member of another group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group X as a subordinate group).\n4.\tThe group-broadcast group and its subordinated groups are defined in the same group management server and served by the same MCPTT server.\n5.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 3 may have an activated functional alias for the group communication.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a group-b roadcast group call, where the group is represented by a group of 100 participants, each with a unique group ID. The call is being broadcast over a group-b network, which is a type of wireless communication network that uses the group-b radio frequency (GHz) spectrum. The call is being transmitted over a group-b network, which is a type of wireless communication network that uses the group-b radio frequency (GHz) spectrum.

The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used for the broadcast group call.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user. The MCPTT server needs to resolve the group-broadcast group ID into its subordinate groups in order to contact the affiliated MCPTT users of those subordinate groups.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server then needs to consider any on-going group calls on those subordinate groups because this may affect the behaviour for what happens next. In this case a group call exists on a subordinate group. Thus, the MCPTT users involved in the group call on this subordinate group.\n5.\tOptionally the on-going group call on a subordinate group may be terminated in which case the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 need to be sent a Group call release request.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 then notify their users of the group call release request.\n7.\tThe MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group call release request by sending a group call release response.\n8.\tA group-broadcast group call request is sent to both the MCPTT client 1 and the MCPTT client 2. The request may contain the functional alias of the calling party.\n9.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users of the incoming group-broadcast group call. The functional alias of the calling party, if available, is presented to the users.\n10.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group-broadcast group call request by sending a group-broadcast group call response.\n11.\tThe MCPTT server responds to MCPTT client 3 (the call initiator) that the group-broadcast group call has been established by sending a group-broadcast group call response.\n12.\tThe MCPTT client 3 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting using the group-broadcast group call resources.\nResources are now available for the transmission from MCPTT client 3 to MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2. Once the user of MCPTT cleint 3 completes transmitting, the group-broadcast group call is releases as are the resources.\nThe group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not MCPTT users. The affiliated MCPTT group members of a subordinate group with an on-going MCPTT emergency group call are not interrupted by a group-broadcast group call.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call when a subordinate group has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members is a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).\n2.\tThe group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call.\n3.\tThe call initiator (user of MCPTT client 3) of the group-broadcast group is a member of another group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group X as a subordinate group).\nThe figure depicts a group-b roadcast group call, where an emergency group call is ongoing in one of the subordinate groups. The call is being transmitted over a group-b radio link, which is a type of radio communication technology. The figure shows the group-b radio link, the group-b radio link's signal strength, and the group-b radio link's signal attenuation. The figure also includes the group-b radio link's signal path, which includes the group-b radio link's antenna, the group-b radio link's cable, and the group-b radio link's connector. The figure is important for understanding the group-b radio link's performance and for designing and implementing group-b radio link systems.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.2-1: Group-broadcast group call when an emergency group call is on-going in one of the subordinate groups\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 initiates the group-broadcast group call setup procedure.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client 3 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT server.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server needs to resolve the group-broadcast group ID into its subordinate groups in order to contact the affiliated MCPTT group members of those subordinate groups.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server then considers any on-going group calls on those subordinate groups (e.g. A) because this may effect the behaviour for what happens next. In this case an emergency group call exists on a subordinate group.\nNOTE: Not shown - The group-broadcast group call request is sent to the MCPTT clients of the MCPTT users who are affiliated members of any other subordinate groups of the group-broadcast group being set up\n5.\tThe MCPTT server responds to the call initiator that the group-broadcast group call has been established.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client 3 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting using the group-broadcast group call resources.\nResources are now available for the transmission from MCPTT client 3 to the MCPTT clients (not shown) of other subordinate groups (i.e., not A). Once the user of MCPTT cleint 3 completes transmitting, the group-broadcast group call is releases as are the resources.\nWhen the call originator has completed transmitting, the group-broadcast group call is terminated and resources released.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call release.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn on-going group-broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and MCPTT client 3 exists.\nThe figure depicts a group-b roadcast group call transmission ending, with the call ending at the 10.6.2.5.2 location. The transmission was terminated due to a lack of available bandwidth or a failure in the group call setup.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.3-1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended\n1.\tMCPTT user on MCPTT client 3 finished transmitting.\n2.\tA group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the MCPTT server of the group-broadcast group.\n3.\tThe MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 of the group-broadcast group's subordinate groups are sent a group-broadcast group call release request\n4.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users that the group-broadcast group call has ended.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to confirm the release of the group-broadcast group call by sending a group-broadcast group call release response.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response indicating to the initiator that the call is now terminated.\nIn a broadcast group call, when the call originator has completed transmitting, the MCPTT client releases the floor. Upon receiving the floor release message the MCPTT server then determines if the broadcast call should be released.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for server-initiated broadcast group call release.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn on-going broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and MCPTT client 3 exists.\n2.\tMCPTT client 3 is transmitting.\n\nThe figure depicts a server-initiated b roadcast group call release, which is a crucial aspect of the network's signaling and communication process. The diagram illustrates the steps involved in initiating a group call, including the server initiating the call, the call being released, and the subsequent call being received by the destination. This process is crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the network's signaling and communication.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.2.4-1: Server-initiated broadcast group call release\n1.\tMCPTT user on MCPTT client 3 finished transmitting.\n2.\tMCPTT client 3 sends a Floor release message to the MCPTT server of the group.\n3.\tThe MCPTT Server determines that the group is a broadcast group and decides that the call should be released.\nNOTE 1:\tWhether the MCPTT server uses the Broadcast indicator in the originating group call request message or uses the configured Group call hang timer to determine whether the call should be released is left to implementation.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends a Group call release request to MCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users that the group call has ended.\n6.\tMCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3 respond to confirm the release of the group call by sending a group call release response.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the group call release request is sent from the MCPTT server via MBMS, no response is expected from the MCPTT clients.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.4-1 illustrates the procedure for broadcast temporary group calls across multiple MCPTT systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not share their users' information to the primary MCPTT system.\n2.\tA broadcast temporary group is formed on the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system by an authorized MCPTT user (e.g. dispatcher) by the group regroup procedure (subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]) and identified via a temporary MCPTT group ID.\n3.\tThe affiliated MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups have been implicitly affiliated to the temporary group.\n4.\tThe MCPTT user of the MCPTT client is authorized to transmit on a broadcast temporary group.\n5.\tOne or more of the constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers of partner MCPTT systems.\nThe figure depicts a group call scenario involving a broadcast temporary group across multiple MCPTT systems. The diagram illustrates the communication flow, with the temporary group being broadcast to all participating systems. The figure is labeled with the figure number \"10.6.2.5.4-1,\" which indicates its specific reference number within the larger series.\nFigure 10.6.2.5.4-1: Group call involving a broadcast temporary group across multiple MCPTT systems\n1.\tThe MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call for a broadcast temporary group with an MCPTT group ID, temporary group indicator, and the broadcast indicator. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the group and is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the broadcast temporary group. The MCPTT group ID is a temporary MCPTT group ID.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system obtains the temporary group information (either from group management server or itself) including the constituent MCPTT groups' identities, accessible group members list of the constituent groups, the broadcast group type, and other related data.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates directly a call request to the accessible group members using the detailed user information and/or location information. The group members upon receipt of the call request may accept or reject the call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group members' information of the constituent group belonging to the partner MCPTT system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call request message to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system with the target group's MCPTT group ID information.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system further initiates a call request to the clients of the constituent group's members as described in step 3.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call response message to the MCPTT client of the affiliated MCPTT user upon receiving responses to the call requests sent to members of primary and partner MCPTT systems. The group call response message will consist of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.\nNOTE 1:\tThe group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n8.\tUpon successful call setup completion a broadcast group call is established for the group members from constituent groups of multiple MCPTT servers. The call originating MCPTT user starts transmitting media to other group call participants. The media is also distributed to the partner MCPTT system.\nNOTE 2:\tOnly the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on a broadcast temporary group call.\n9.\tAt the completion of the media transmission, the broadcast temporary group call is released.\nThe procedure describes the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT emergency group call with the affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user's mission critical applications. Initiating an MCPTT emergency group call puts the MCPTT group into the in-progress emergency state. While in the in-progress emergency state, all MCPTT group calls in the MCPTT group are processed as MCPTT emergency group calls by the MCPTT server until the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT group is cancelled.\nFigure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1 shows the procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group management server.\nNOTE 1:\tFor simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n3.\tThe initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group that has been designated via provisioning as the MCPTT emergency group.\n4.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the group communication.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nNOTE 2:\tAlternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency behaviour on the selected group.\nThe figure depicts an emergency group call in a telecommunications network, specifically a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. The call is initiated by a call-to-action (CTA) message, which is a key component of the call structure. The figure shows the various components involved in the call, including the call-to-action message, the emergency group, and the emergency group members. The figure also includes the call duration, the call status, and the call-to-action message.\nFigure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1: MCPTT emergency group call\n1.\tThe user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency group call. MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may select a functional alias used for the call. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.\nNOTE 3:\tWhile MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency calls.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency group call request towards the MCPTT server. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT emergency group call until the MCPTT emergency state of the group is cancelled. Once an MCPTT emergency call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until the emergency state of the group is cancelled. If configured to send an MCPTT emergency alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.\nNOTE 4:\tWhile the MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state, all MCPTT group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by the MCPTT server. MCPTT group members that are not in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group call requests but set the requested priority of all group call requests to high priority.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency group if the client is not already affiliated.\n4.\tMCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and if authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group management server. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all participants in the MCPTT group.\nNOTE 5:\tSuccessive calls during the MCPTT group's in-progress emergency state will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.\n6.\tMCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.\n7.\tMCPTT users are notified of the incoming MCPTT emergency group call. The functional alias of the group call initiating MCPTT user may be displayed.\n8.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency group call request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent. The receiving MCPTT client check whether it is already involved in an MCPTT emergency group call when using this functional alias and whether the maximum number of parallel MCPTT emergency group calls when using this functional alias has been reached.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.\nNOTE 6:\tStep 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\nMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g., MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established media plane, while the other MCPTT client's receive floor taken information. MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send media, while the other MCPTT clients in the MCPTT emergency group call will be receiving that media. MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are also in the MCPTT emergency state.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading an MCPTT group call to an MCPTT emergency group call while the MCPTT group call is already in progress.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT group to an MCPTT emergency group call.\nNOTE 1:\tFor simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n3.\tAn MCPTT group call is already in progress.\n4.\tThe initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT emergency alert when upgrading an MCPTT emergency group call.\nThe figure depicts a group call upgrade from a regular group call to an emergency group call in a telecommunications network. The upgrade is facilitated by the use of a new protocol, MCPTT, which allows for more efficient and secure communication in emergency situations.\nFigure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1: MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group call\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.\nNOTE 2:\tWhile MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency calls.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the MCPTT group to an in-progress emergency state by sending an MCPTT emergency group call request. If configured to send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.\nNOTE 3:\tWhile the MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state, all MCPTT group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by the MCPTT server. MCPTT group members that are not in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group call requests but set the requested priority of all group call requests to high priority.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all or selected participants in the MCPTT group call that receive the communication over unicast.\nNOTE 4:\tThe determination of the selected participants whose bearers have to be upgraded is left to implementation.\n4.\tMCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.\n5.\tMCPTT users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT group.\n6.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT group emergency request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.\nNOTE 5:\tStep 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\nMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT group call, which has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency group call. MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are also in the MCPTT emergency state.\nNOTE 1:\tIn Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this subclause is \"MCPTT emergency group call cancel\".\nThe procedure describes the case where an MCPTT client cancels an MCPTT group's in-progress emergency state. The emergency state of the group may alternatively be cancelled by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a group.\nNOTE 2:\tFor simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.\nNOTE 3:\tThe end of the MCPTT emergency group call does not cancel the MCPTT group's in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized user using this procedure, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n3.\tMCPTT group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.\n4.\tThe MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized bearer support when a call is in progress.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel an in-progress emergency for the group.\nThe figure depicts a state-of-the-art emergency group in progress, with the MCPTT (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) protocol in use. The state-of-the-art emergency group is in progress, with the MCPTT protocol in use. The state-of-the-art emergency group is in progress, with the MCPTT protocol in use.\nFigure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1: MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel\n1.\tThe user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel.\nNOTE 4:\tAn authorized user (e.g. dispatcher, supervisor) can cancel either or both the in-progress emergency state of the group and the MC service emergency alert of another user. However, only the initiator of an MCPTT emergency alert can cancel the initiator's local MCPTT emergency state. Determination of authorized users is implementation dependent.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 5:\tIf an MCPTT emergency alert relating to MCPTT client 1 is in effect together with an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state on the MCPTT group, the MCPTT emergency alert of MCPTT client 1 can be cancelled at the same time. In that case, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCPTT client 1 is also being cancelled.\nNOTE 6:\tIf an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request is received by the MCPTT server while a group member that is in the emergency state is transmitting, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request is rejected by the MCPTT server.\n3.\tMCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from group management server.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server verifies that the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel the emergency state of this MCPTT group. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT group.\n5.\tIf a call is currently in progress, the MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority treatment is no longer required.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request to the MCPTT group members.\n7.\tMCPTT group members are notified of the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel.\n8.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel response to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel. If the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCPTT client 1 resets its local emergency status.\nNOTE 7:\tStep 9 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is initiating an imminent peril group call for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. This procedure will gain elevated access privilege for the MCPTT client if it is not already in that state. The access privilege for other applications will not necessarily be affected.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an imminent peril group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n3.\tThe initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril communications.\nNOTE 1:\tAlternatively, the client could have been provisioned for imminent peril behaviour on the selected group.\n4.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the group communication.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a call between two users in a Microsoft Teams meeting, with the user on the left appearing to be in imminent peril. The user on the right is responding to the user on the left, indicating a critical situation. The call is being held in a group meeting, with the user on the left having a microphone and the user on the right having a camera.

MCPTT server acquires the location of the current talker from the location management server as described in subclause 10.9.3.6 in 3GPP TS 23.280[16]. Optionally, the MCPTT server acquires the location of the current talker directly from the floor request received from MCPTT client 1 in step 1.\n3.\tMCPTT server provides the location information of MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client 2. Optionally, the location information may be provided in the floor taken message sent to MCPTT client 2 according to subclause 10.9.1.3.1.\nA group regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT groups into a new MCPTT regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group. The MCPTT regroup group configuration needs to be provided to the relevant MCPTT group members of the MCPTT groups that will be regrouped in advance of the regrouping operation.\nNOTE 1:\tA preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration for the preconfigured regroup process is identified by a parameter in the group configuration described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].\nNOTE 2:\tThe configuration may alternatively be taken from any MCPTT group that has been configured in the user profile of all the relevant MCPTT users who will be regrouped.\nNOTE 3:\tRegroup groups may be defined according to the organizational structure of a mission critical organization, or by some other means which allows the MCPTT client of an authorized user to be aware of an appropriate regroup group for sets of MCPTT groups that will be regrouped together.\nThe preconfigured MCPTT group that provides the configuration is not used as the MCPTT regroup group itself, it only provides configuration for one or more MCPTT regroup groups. The MCPTT group ID of the regroup group is provided by the authorized user when the preconfigured regrouping is carried out.\nThe MCPTT regroup group can be specified to be a broadcast or non-broadcast type according to the configuration of the MCPTT group whose configuration is specified by the regroup request. The broadcast type of regroup is used for one-way communication where only an authorized MCX user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup members are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members). The non-broadcast type is used for two-way communication where all regroup members can transmit and receive (i.e, the regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group call).\nThese procedures provide a regrouping service for MCPTT only and are independent of group regrouping procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. If the MCPTT server has been notified by the group management server that one of the MCPTT groups that has been requested for regrouping by means of this procedure has already been regrouped by the group regrouping procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], the MCPTT server shall reject the request for regrouping described in the following procedure.\nEditor's note:\tThese procedures provide a regrouping service for MCPTT only; any issues arising from conflicts with similar regrouping operations for MCVideo and MCData are FFS.\nFigure 10.6.2.9.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a group regroup procedure using a preconfigured MCPTT group.

The MCPTT client sends a group call request message to the MCPTT server containing MCPTT group D as the target group.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks to see whether MCPTT group D is currently being used as part of a preconfigured group regroup. In this case the preconfigured group regroup is no longer active.\nNOTE 1: The regroup group D can be a group in the MCPTT client's profile, and the MCPTT client can be a member of group D.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server sends a group call response to the MCPTT client indicating that the call setup is denied because the group regroup is no longer active.\nNOTE 2: In the following, steps 4 and 6 are optional.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the MCPTT client.\nNOTE 3: This message should be sent over unicast.\n5.\tThe MCPTT client notifies the user of the group call setup failure and of the regrouping cancellation.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client sends the preconfigured regroup cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping cancellation.\nNOTE 4:\tIf there is a call currently in progress on MCPTT group A that was previously part of the group regroup then this MCPTT client can be added to the call using the late entry procedure. If there is no call currently in progress then the MCPTT user can retry the group call setup on MCPTT group A.\n\nUser regroup using the group creation procedure can be initiated by an authorized user creating a temporary group with a list of MCPTT users. The group ID for this temporary group can be provided at the time of group creation. The temporary group can be used by all MCPTT users in the list for two-way (non-broadcast) communication until deleted by an authorized user. Optionally, the group can be used for one-way (broadcast ) communication where the creator of the temporary group can make a broadcast group call, but the other MCPTT users can only listen to the group call and cannot respond.\nFigure 10.6.2.10.2-1 below illustrates the temporary group creation, and optional broadcast call setup procedure and temporary group deletion initiated by an authorized user.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe authorized user is aware of the MCPTT users who will be included in the temporary group.\nThe figure depicts a user regrouping process, where users are grouped together based on their proximity to the group leader. This is a crucial step in the group creation procedure, ensuring that users are grouped together in a way that minimizes communication overhead and maximizes efficiency.\nFigure 10.6.2.10.2-1: User regroup using group creation procedure\n1.\tThe authorized user of MCPTT UE 1 makes use of the group management client of MCPTT UE 1 to create the temporary group according to the group creation procedure in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] subclause 10.2.3. The configuration identifies the group as a temporary group. As part of this procedure, the MCPTT users are notified of their membership to the temporary group, and the MCPTT server is notified about the creation of the group and the list of group members. Alternatively, the MCPTT client 1 (not shown in the figure) on MCPTT UE 1 can provide the criteria which allows the MCPTT server to determine the list of MCPTT users to be regrouped.\nThe authorized user can create the group as a broadcast group by configuring it as a broadcast group.\nNOTE 1: After step 1 the temporary group can be used by all members of the group for two-way (non-broadcast) communication until deleted by an authorized user.\nNOTE 2:\tThe following two steps are optional and can be used for broadcast communication where only the creator of the temporary group is allowed to transmit media on this temporary group.\n2.\tThe creator of the temporary group, the authorized user of MCPTT UE 1, initiates a broadcast group call according to the procedure described in subclause 10.6.2.5.2 of the present document. The authorized user of MCPTT UE 1 is implicitly affiliated to the temporary group. The receiving MCPTT clients of MCPTT UEs 2 and 3 are implicitly affiliated to the group and are notified of this affiliation during the call setup.\n3.\tThe authorized user of MCPTT UE 1 ends the use of the temporary group according to the procedure for group deletion described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].\nIf the authorized user wishes to end the use of the temporary group, the procedure for group deletion described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] is followed.\nThe temporary group created using a preconfigured group can be a broadcast group or a non-broadcast group. The broadcast regroup is used for one-way communication where only an authorized MCPTT user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup members are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members). The non-broadcast regroup is used for two-way communication where all regroup members can transmit and receive (i.e. the regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group call). The broadcast regroup satisfies the temporary group-broadcast group requirements defined in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2].\nA broadcast group regroup call using preconfigured groups can be achieved by first regrouping MCPTT groups into an MCPTT regroup group, making the broadcast group call on the regroup group, and then cancelling the preconfigured group regroup.\nThe broadcast group regroup call procedure using preconfigured group allows an authorized MCPTT user to initiate a broadcast call to a set of MCPTT groups, which are regrouped only for the duration of the broadcast call. The regroup is cancelled at the end of the broadcast call to prevent users from talking back on the regroup group. This procedure requires that the authorized MCPTT user is a group member of at least one of the MCPTT groups included in the regroup operation.\nFigure 10.6.2.11.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a broadcast group regroup call using a preconfigured MCPTT group.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3 are registered with the MCPTT service.\n-\tThe group configuration for the MCPTT regroup group have been preconfigured in MCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3, and MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in the regroup MCPTT group.\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a group regroup using the preconfigured regroup procedure.\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs of the MCPTT users who will be regrouped.\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is affiliated to group 1, MCPTT client 2 is affiliated to group 2, and MCPTT client 3 is affiliated to group 3. Group 4 is used as the regroup group.\nThe figure depicts a broadcast group regroup call using preconfigured group in a single MCPTT system. The system includes a broadcast group, a preconfigured group, and a single MCPTT. The broadcast group is used to send a message to all members of the group, while the preconfigured group is used to send a message to a specific group of members. The single MCPTT is used to send the message to all members of the broadcast group.\nFigure 10.6.2.11.2-1: Broadcast group regroup call using preconfigured group in a single MCPTT system\n1.\tThe authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the group regroup formation procedure using preconfigured groups as specified in 10.6.2.9.2.1. MCPTT groups 1, 2, and 3 are regrouped into group 4.\n2.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 performs the broadcast group call procedure as specified in 10.6.2.5.2.\n3.\tIf the broadcast group call is made on the regroup group 4, the MCPTT client 1 initiates the preconfigured group regroup cancellation procedure as specified in 10.6.2.9.2.2.\nA user regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT users into a new regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group. The MCPTT regroup group configuration needs to be provided to the relevant MCPTT users who will be regrouped in advance of the regrouping operation. User regroup with preconfigured group satisfies user regroup requirements in 3GPP TS 22.180 [17], particularly [R-6.6.4.2-003].\nNOTE 1:\tA preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration for the preconfigured regroup process is identified by a parameter in the group configuration described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].\nNOTE 2:\tThe configuration may alternatively be taken from any MCPTT group that has been configured in the user profile of all of the relevant MCPTT users who will be regrouped.\nEditor's note:\tThese procedures provide a regrouping service for MCPTT only; any issues arising from conflicts with similar regrouping operations for MCVideo and MCData are FFS.\nThe preconfigured MCPTT group that provides the configuration is not used as the MCPTT regroup group itself, it only provides configuration for one or more MCPTT regroup groups. The MCPTT group ID of the regroup group is provided by the authorized user when the preconfigured regrouping is carried out.\nFigure 10.6.2.12.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a user regroup procedure using a preconfigured MCPTT group. The procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the MCPTT regroup group.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMCPTT clients 2 and 3 are registered with the MCPTT service.\n-\tAn MCPTT group that will be used for configuration of the temporary user regroup group has been preconfigured in MCPTT clients 2 and 3, and MCPTT clients 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in the temporary user regroup group.\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiated a user regroup using the preconfigured regroup procedure.\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MCPTT UEs of the MCPTT users who will be regrouped.\nThe figure depicts a user regroup procedure in a single MCPTT system, where a preconfigured group is used to group users. The procedure involves the use of a preconfigured group, which is a group of users that are pre-configured and ready to be used in the system. This group can be used to group users together for various purposes, such as routing, authentication, or other network operations. The figure shows the steps involved in using the preconfigured group, including setting up the group, configuring the group, and using the group for network operations.\nFigure 10.6.2.12.2.1-1: User regroup procedure using preconfigured group in single MCPTT system\n1.\tThe authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the user regroup procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT users to be regrouped (MCPTT clients 2 and 3), the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group (if available), and the MCPTT group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken. Alternatively, the MCPTT client 1 can provide the criteria which allows the MCPTT server to determine the list of MCPTT users to be regrouped.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT server. The request indicates the list of users to be included in the regroup operation.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured regroup procedure. If the preconfigured regroup request is authorized, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for this regroup group call if:\ni. one is not provided in the request or\nii. the one provided in the request is not accepted.\nNOTE 1:\tMCPTT clients can be involved in multiple user and group regroups simultaneously.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server shall send the preconfigured regroup request return message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tthe MCPTT group ID is generated by the MCPTT server; and\nii.\tresult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not\nIf the preconfigured regroup request is not authorized, MCPTT client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MCPTT clients 2 and 3 in steps 4a and 4b respectively.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen using multicast, the MCPTT server can periodically rebroadcast the preconfigured regroup request.\n6.\tMCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.\n7.\tMCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup request.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT clients to the regroup group.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MCPTT client 1.\nNOTE 3:\tAfter the user regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.6.2.12.2.2.\nFigure 10.6.2.12.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure to cancel a user regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMCPTT clients 2 and 3 have been regrouped into an MCPTT regroup group.\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a user regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.\nThe figure depicts a user regroup procedure in a single MCPTT system, which is a method used to cancel preconfigured user regroup procedures. The figure shows a user regroup procedure with a user group, a group leader, and a group member. The user group is shown with a user group ID, a group leader ID, and a group member ID. The figure also includes a cancel preconfigured user regroup procedure, which is a procedure used to cancel a preconfigured user regroup procedure. The cancel preconfigured user regroup procedure is shown with a cancel ID, a cancel ID, and a cancel ID. The figure provides a visual representation of the user regroup procedure and its cancelation process, which is important for understanding the system's functionality and for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.\nFigure 10.6.2.12.2.2-1: Cancel preconfigured user regroup procedure in single MCPTT system\n1.\tThe authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the cancellation of the user regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the MCPTT server, specifying the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a regrouping that uses a preconfigured user regroup procedure.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel requests to MCPTT clients 2 and 3 (steps 4a and 4b respectively).\n5.\tMCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the cancellation of the user regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.\n6.\tMCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the cancellation of the regrouping function. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup cancel request.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server de-affiliates MCPTT clients 2 and 3 from the MCPTT regroup group.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup cancel response to MCPTT client 1.\nFigure 10.6.2.12.3-1 illustrates the procedure to add or remove an MCPTT user based on the MCPTT user criteria known at the MC service server.\nNOTE 1: \tThis procedure applies to MCPTT users that have been added and are to be added to the preconfigured regroup group based on MCPTT user criteria known at the MCPTT server. If only the criteria are to be applied, then only the criteria are included in the request and both the group and user lists are not included\nPreconditions:\n-\tA preconfigured regroup group has been established.\n-\tThe MCPTT server has selected MCPTT user 2 to participate in the preconfigured regroup group based on MCPTT user criteria known at the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 2:\tOther participants of the preconfigured regroup group are not shown in figure 10.6.2.12.x-1 for simplicity.\n\nThe figure depicts a procedure to update the MC PTT ID list, which is an essential component of a telecommunication system. The MC PTT ID list is used to identify and manage the communication channels between different devices, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure includes a step-by-step guide on how to perform the update, including the necessary steps, tools, and precautions to ensure a smooth and secure process.\nFigure 10.6.2.12.3-1: Procedure to update the MCPTT ID list\n1.\tThe MCPTT server detects that MCPTT client 2, which has been earlier included in the preconfigured regroup group, no longer meets the MCPTT user criteria known at the MCPTT server.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server sends MCPTT client 2 a preconfigured user regroup remove request.\n3.\tThe MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user of the preconfigured user regroup removal.\n4.\tThe MCPTT client 2 may send the MCPTT server a preconfigured user regroup remove response to acknowledge the preconfigured user regroup removal.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server updates the preconfigured regroup group (including the MCPTT user ID list) and potential group communication.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server detects that the MCPTT client 3 meets the MCPTT user criteria.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT client 3 a preconfigured regroup request.\n8.\tThe MCPTT client 3 notifies the MCPTT user of the preconfigured regroup request.\n9.\tThe MCPTT client 3 may send the MCPTT server a preconfigured regroup response.\n10.\tThe MCPTT server updates the preconfigured regroup group (including the MCPTT ID list), and potential group communication.\n",

The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the target MCPTT group may be used by the ProSe layer as the target group info and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nPrior to the establishment of an off-network group call, a group member discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the target MCPTT group are in the proximity of the calling MCPTT user, as described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The establishment of an off-network group call using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication procedure for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nOff-network group calls can use pre-defined configuration information provided to MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call or configuration information that is transmitted to MCPTT clients during group call setup or late entry procedures.\nIf off-network group configuration information is pre-defined (e.g. codec to be used) and provided to the MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call (e.g. as part of group metadata), the MCPTT client will be able to participate in the off-network group call without needing to follow the group call setup or late joining procedures as they will be able to receive the media and signalling without the need for the announcement or invitation.\nIf off-network group configuration information is not pre-defined or provided, call parameters need to be transmitted to MCPTT clients via group call announcement or invitation.\nNOTE:\tWhen the MCPTT client receives a message that is not addressed to either its MCPTT ID or to any MCPTT group of which the MCPTT client is an affiliated group member, the MCPTT client ignores the message.\nTable 10.6.3.2.1-1 describes the information flow for the group call announcement from the MCPTT client to other MCPTT clients.\nTable 10.6.3.2.1-1: Group call announcement\n\nTable 10.6.3.2.2-1 describes the information flow for the MCPTT upgrade to emergency call from the MCPTT client to other MCPTT clients.\nTable 10.6.3.2.2-1: MCPTT upgrade to emergency call\n\nTable 10.6.3.2.3-1 describes the information flow for the MCPTT emergency group state cancel from the MCPTT client to other MCPTT clients.\nNOTE:\tIn Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the name of this information flow is \"MCPTT emergency group cancel\".\nTable 10.6.3.2.3-1: MCPTT emergency group state cancel\n\nTable 10.6.3.2.4-1 describes the information flow for the response.\nTable 10.6.3.2.4-1: Response\n\nTable 10.6.3.2.7-1 describes the information flow for the MCPTT upgrade to imminent peril call from the MCPTT client to other MCPTT clients.\nTable 10.6.3.2.7-1: MCPTT upgrade to imminent peril call\n\nTable 10.6.3.2.8-1 describes the information flow MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel from the MCPTT client to other MCPTT clients.\nTable 10.6.3.2.8-1: MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel\n\nThe flow in figure 10 6.3.3-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for MCPTT group call establishment for off-network. The procedure describes how an MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT group call with other MCPTT client within the off-network radio coverage and how the group call is established.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the mappings of MCPTT group ID and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID (see subclause 8.1.3.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]) are pre-configured;\n-\tIt is assumed that a multicast IP address and port for the call setup signalling are pre-configured;\n-\tAll messages exchanged between the MCPTT clients for the MCPTT group follows ProSe direct communications as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]; and\n-\tThe MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1, 2 and 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.\nThe figure depicts a group call setup in an off-network environment, with participants connected to a base station (BS) and a group call group (GCG). The setup includes a group call group (GCG), a group call group (GCG), and a group call group (GCG). The GCG is connected to the BS, and the GCG is connected to the BS.

This message contains the following parameters such as MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity, media type, media codec, multicast port number for media, port number for floor control protocol, period of group call announcement, and any encryption key for the media encryption if needed, and optionally confirm mode indication.\nNOTE 1:\tThe group call announcement includes at least one common set of parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will not be prohibited for the better user experience.\nNOTE 2:\tBy using the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID mapping with the MCPTT group ID, ProSe layer ensures that the messages sent for the corresponding MCPTT group are only received by its group's members.\n2.\tMCPTT client 2, 3 join the group call. The MCPTT clients configure the parameters for media delivery by making use of the received parameters in group call announcement.\n3.\tMCPTT client 2, 3 may send the response message to the group when the group call announcement from originator includes confirm mode indication. This message contains MCPTT ID.\n4.\tMCPTT client 2, 3 recognize the group call originator through the group call announcement and MCPTT client 1 checks the participants of the group call through the received response message.\nNOTE 3:\tDue to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.\nNOTE 4:\tThe participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic group call announcement.\nFigure 10 6.3.4-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for the passive MCPTT client to join the on-going MCPTT group call. The passive MCPTT client does not initiate to establish an MCPTT group call, but receives the group call announcement to be transferred periodically. When receiving the announcement message with parameters for media transfer, the passive MCPTT client configures the parameter to receive the voice and joins the announced MCPTT group call.\nThis procedure happens after the MCPTT group call is established. The group call announcement including the parameters for the media transfer has been performed periodically, in order for the MCPTT client later to join the MCPTT group call.\nThe MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the MCPTT group call lately.\nThe figure depicts a passive join to group call in a network, illustrating the steps involved in initiating a group call. The figure shows the connection between two devices, with one device initiating the call and the other device joining in. The figure is labeled with the figure number \"10.6.3.4-1,\" which likely refers to a specific section or topic within the network diagram.\nFigure 10.6.3.4-1: Passive join to group call\n1.\tMCPTT client 2 sends the group call announcement message. This message contains parameters such as MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity, media type, media codec, multicast port number for media, port number for floor control protocol, any encryption key for the media encryption if needed, and optionally confirm mode indication.\nNOTE 1:\tThe group call announcement includes at least one common set of parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will not be prohibited for the better user experience.\n2.\tMCPTT client 4 configures the parameters for media transfer by making use of the received parameters in group call announcement.\n3.\tMCPTT client 4 may send the response message to the group when the periodic group call announcement includes confirm mode indication. This message contains the MCPTT ID.\n4.\tMCPTT client 1, 2, 3 check through the received response message that the MCPTT client 4 joins the group call. The MCPTT client 2, as the floor control arbitrator, may send a floor taken message.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.\nNOTE 3:\tThe participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic group call announcement.\nFigure 10 6.3.5-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client to join an on-going MCPTT group call. When entering the coverage of on-going group call, new MCPTT client may send group call setup announcement message with on-going group call id. Upon receiving the group call setup announcement, the MCPTT client as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call sends parameters for media transfer to the newly entered MCPTT client (entrant) to join the on-going MCPTT group call. When receiving the parameters for media transfer of on-going MCPTT group call, the MCPTT client configures the parameters to receive the voice and becomes the participant of the on-going MCPTT group call.\nThe figure depicts a late entry point in a call when receiving a group call announcement with ongoing group ID. The visual representation shows the call announcement, the call ID, and the late entry point.\nFigure 10.6.3.5-1: Late entry join when receiving MCPTT group call announcement with on-going MCPTT group ID\n1.\tMCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.\n2.\tThe new entry of MCPTT client 4 sends group call setup announcement with MCPTT group call id.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call acknowledges that on-going MCPTT group call exists with MCPTT group call id sent by MCPTT client 4 and sends parameters for media transfer to MCPTT client 4.\n4.\tMCPTT client 4 may send a response message.\n5.\tMCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for media delivery in the on-going MCPTT group call.\nMCPTT client 4 joins and becomes participants of the on-going MCPTT group call.\nFigure 10.6.3.6-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client to immediately join an on-going MCPTT group call. Upon the detection of a new entrant, the MCPTT client that is the current talker (floor arbitrator) immediately sends the group call announcement. When receiving the group call announcement message with parameters for media transfer, that MCPTT client configures the parameters to receive the voice and joins the on-going MCPTT group call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThere is on-going group call. MCPTT client 1 is the current talker and therefore the floor arbitrator.\n\nThe figure depicts an immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group call, with the call participants highlighted in red. The call is initiated by the caller, who initiates the call by pressing the call button. The call is then passed to the group call participant, who initiates the call by pressing the call button. The call is then passed to the group call participant, who initiates the call by pressing the call button. The call is then passed to the group call participant, who initiates the call by pressing the call button.

The diagram includes the broadcast group, the call group, and the off-network call setup, with the call group being the primary focus. The figure also highlights the use of the broadcast group call in off-network scenarios, which is crucial for ensuring reliable communication in areas with poor network coverage.\nFigure 10.6.3.8.1-1: Broadcast group call in off-network\n1.\tAn authorized MCPTT client 1 initiates broadcast group call setup as described in subclause 10.6.3.3. The group call announcement message includes the indication of broadcast group call.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client 1 initiating broadcast group call starts to transmit media.\nNOTE:\tOther clients of group member are not allowed to transmit media in broadcast group call.\n3.\tThe broadcast group call is released as described in subclause 10.6.3.7.\nThe off-network emergency group call is a special case of off-network (non-emergency) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3, 10.6.3.4, 10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT emergency group calls:\n-\tAs a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency call has previously been provisioned with an MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency group. The MCPTT client initiates MCPTT emergency group calls on this group. Alternatively, the MCPTT client could have been provisioned for emergency behaviour on the selected MCPTT group.\n-\tThe group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group call is to be an MCPTT emergency call regardless of whether or not the MCPTT client is in call. Group call participants learn of the MCPTT group's in-progress emergency state from the indication.\n-\tEvery call initiated by the MCPTT client will be an emergency call while the MCPTT client is in MCPTT emergency state.\n-\tThe MCPTT client enters the MCPTT emergency state when initiating an MCPTT emergency call or MCPTT emergency alert. Only the MCPTT user of the MCPTT client can clear the client's local MCPTT emergency state.\n-\tThe MCPTT group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the call ends.\n-\tThe MCPTT user who initiated an emergency call, or upgraded a group call to an emergency call, or an authorized user, may cancel the in-progress emergency state with an MCPTT emergency group state cancel message. The message is sent to the call participants.\n-\tWhen the MCPTT group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state, every client returns its default value of ProSe Per Packet Priority.\n-\tAn MCPTT group call in-progress is upgraded to an emergency group call when the periodic group call announcement contains the emergency indicator.\n-\tThe value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency state of MCPTT group call.\n-\tAn MCPTT group call becoming an emergency group call does not affect the state of other MCPTT call(s) in the client.\n-\tThe MCPTT group remains in the in-progress emergency state until the emergency group call ends or the in-progress emergency state is cancelled.\nThe off-network imminent peril group call is a special case of off-network (non-imminent peril) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3, 10.6.3.4, 10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT imminent peril calls:\n-\tAs a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril call has previously an MCPTT group to be used as the MCPTT imminent peril group. The MCPTT client initiates MCPTT imminent peril group calls on this group.\n-\tThe group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group call is to be an MCPTT imminent peril call. Group call participants learn of the MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril condition from the indication.\n-\tThe MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled when the call ends.\n-\tThe originating MCPTT user of the in-progress imminent peril or an authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an MCPTT imminent peril group cancel. The message is sent to the call participants.\n-\tWhen the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril is no longer in the in-progress imminent peril state, every MCPTT client returns its bearer to the priority it had prior to the in-progress imminent peril state.\n-\tAn MCPTT upgrade to imminent peril call is used to upgrade an MCPTT group call already in progress. The message is sent to all call participants so that they are aware of the in-progress imminent peril.\n-\tThe bearer is upgraded by all participants for the MCPTT group call already in progress when the MCPTT group call is upgraded to in-progress imminent peril state.\n-\tAn MCPTT imminent peril call puts the MCPTT group into the in-progress imminent peril state.\nThe MCPTT service shall support the procedures and related information flows as specified in subclauses 10.10.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following clarifications:\n-\tThe MC service client is the MCPTT client;\n-\tThe MC service server is the MCPTT server;\n-\tThe MC service group ID is the MCPTT Group ID; and\n-\tThe MC service user profile index is the MCPTT user profile index.\n",

The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCPTT private call. For a private call with floor control, floor control is to be established.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT server (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] for MCPTT, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCPTT user. The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or the functional alias of the invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media types. For a private call with floor control, the MCPTT private call request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a Requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.\nNOTE 1:\tAs part of this step, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n4.\tIf the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID as called party, the MCPTT server shall resolve the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID(s) for which the functional alias is active. The MCPTT server shall also check whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 to setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 is allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using the functional alias. If authorized, proceed with step 5. Otherwise, the MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate the private call, and that MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is authorized to receive the private call. If the MCPTT private call request requested automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server also checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a private call in automatic commencement mode and proceed with step 6.\nNOTE 2:\tDepending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the private call request is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to implementation. This selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.\n5a.\tThe MCPTT server responds with a functional alias resolution response message that contains the resolved MCPTT ID back to MCPTT client 1.\n5b.\tIf the MCPTT server replies with a MCPTT functional alias resolution response message, the MCPTT client 1 abandons the first MCPTT private call request in step 3 and sends a new MCPTT private call request towards the resolved MCPTT ID.\nNOTE 3:\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n6.\tMCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to indicate progress in the call setup process.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 6 can occur at any time following step 5b, and prior to step 10.\n7.\tIf authorized, MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested automatic commencement mode by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called MCPTT client and sends the corresponding MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID and, if available, the functional alias of the calling MCPTT user 1. If the called MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.\n8.\tThe receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private call and displays the functional alias of calling MCPTT user 1.\n9. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and an MCPTT private call response is sent to the MCPTT server (via SIP core).\n10.\tUpon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2 accepting the private call request, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful call establishment.\n11.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call establishment for private call with floor control request from MCPTT client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor control server, giving it permission to transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by the floor control server that floor is taken.\nFigure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT private call that uses manual commencement mode. The flow may use a floor request in the MCPTT private call request indicating that the originator will be given the floor when the call starts and eliminates the need for a separate initial floor request message during media plane establishment. Alternatively the call initiation may be sent without the floor request, which allows the called party to request the floor first.\nBoth clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not specified a commencement mode for the call; and\n2.\tThe called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.\n3.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a manual commencement mode of a private call in the MCPTT system, showing the user interface and the call setup.\nFigure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1: MCPTT private call in manual commencement mode– MCPTT users in the same MCPTT system\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are both registered and their respective users, MCPTT user 1 and MCPTT user 2, are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.\n2.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call for the selected MCPTT user. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCPTT private call. For a private call with floor control, floor control is to be established. For private call without floor control, both users will have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request addressed to the MCPTT ID of MCPTT user 2 using an MCPTT service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT server). The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or the functional alias of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT private call request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor, for a private call with floor control. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in manual commencement mode if manual commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.\nNOTE 1:\tAs part of this step, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server confirms that both MCPTT users are authorized for the private call. MCPTT server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user. The MCPTT server shall resolve the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID(s) for which the functional alias is active. The MCPTT server shall also check whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 to setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 is allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using the functional alias. The MCPTT server checks the commencement mode setting of the called MCPTT client and also checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in manual commencement mode.\nNOTE 2:\tDepending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the private call request is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to implementation. This selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.\n5a.\tIf the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID as called party, the MCPTT server responds with a functional alias resolution response message that contains the resolved MCPTT ID back to MCPTT client 1.\n5b.\tIf the MCPTT server replies with a MCPTT functional alias resolution response message, the MCPTT client 1 abandons the first MCPTT private call request in step 3 and sends a new MCPTT private call request towards the resolved MCPTT ID.\nNOTE 3:\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private call request for the call to MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID and, if available, the functional alias of the calling MCPTT user 1. If the called MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.\n7.\tMCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to indicate progress in the call setup process.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 7 can occur at any time following step 5b, and prior to step 8b.\n8a.\tThe MCPTT user is alerted and may display the functional alias of calling MCPTT user 1. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT server.\n8b.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating that MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.\n9.\tMCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e., has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. If MCPTT user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCPTT client 2 sends a call failure response to the MCPTT server without adding reason for call failure.\n10.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1 indicating that MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted media parameters.\n11.\tThe media plane for communication is established. Either user can transmit media individually when using floor control. For successful call establishment for private call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 2 is informed that the floor is taken. The meaning of the floor request (give floor initially to originator [client 1], or give floor initially to target [client 2]) may be configurable. For a private call without floor control both users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is requesting to release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic).\nProcedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT private call.\nThe figure depicts a private call release scenario where a client initiates the call. The call is initiated by the client, and the call is released by the server. The call is initiated by the client, and the call is released by the server.

Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests for floor control or send media.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server is terminating an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic), upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured maximum duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT private call without transmission/reception.\nProcedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT private call.\nThe figure depicts a private call termination scenario, where the server initiates the end of the call.

At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.\nThe procedure in this subclause is for the case where an MCPTT client is requesting to release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic), and the MCPTT users are in multiple MCPTT systems.\nProcedures are similar to those described for private call release when MCPTT users are in single MCPTT system as in subclause 10.7.2.2.3.1, with the addition that the MCPTT call end request and the corresponding acknowledgement are routed through the MCPTT server in partner MCPTT system.\nThis procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT emergency private call with unicast signalling for communicating with another MCPTT user. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user's mission critical applications.\nProcedures in figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency private call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tBoth members of the MCPTT private call belong to the same MCPTT system.\n2.\tThe initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT emergency alert prior to initiating an MCPTT emergency private call.\n3.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts an emergency private call scenario in a multi-path telecommunication network. The call is initiated by a user on the left side of the network, which is marked as a \"MCPTT\" (Multi-path Communication Termination Point) in the figure. The call is routed through a series of paths, including the \"MCPTT\" and the \"MCPTT\" itself, before reaching the \"MCPTT\" on the right side of the network. The figure illustrates the importance of proper network design and routing to ensure reliable and efficient communication in emergency situations.\nFigure 10.7.2.4.1-1 MCPTT emergency private call\n1.\tThe user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency private call. MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. MCPTT client 1 retains the MCPTT emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency calls.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency private call request towards the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may select a functional alias as calling party address and the MCPTT server verifies whether the provided functional alias can be used. Instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may also select a functional alias as called party address, which the MCPTT server replaces by an appropriate MCPTT ID. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT emergency private call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. If the MCPTT client is configured to send an MCPTT emergency alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency private call, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be initiated.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the private call request is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria. This selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to implementation.\n3.\tMCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency private call request towards the target MCPTT client. The request contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.\n4.\tThe MCPTT user on MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming MCPTT emergency private call and may display the functional alias of MCPTT client 1.\nNOTE 3:\tMCPTT client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of receiving the MCPTT emergency private call.\n5.\tThe receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency private call request to the MCPTT server.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server informs MCPTT client 1 about the successful MCPTT emergency private call establishment.\n8.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 establish the media plane for communication. The MCPTT client 1 can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT client 2 is also in the MCPTT emergency state.\nNOTE 4:\tThe priority for the MCPTT emergency private call is retained until cancelled according to system policy (e.g. timeout or call end) or cancelled by an authorized MCPTT user.\nNOTE 5:\tThe initiating MCPTT user's MCPTT emergency state is retained by the system until cancelled as in subclause 10.6.2.6.1.3, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2. The initiating MCPTT user's MCPTT emergency state is also retained locally by the MCPTT client until explicitly cancelled by the MCPTT user.\nThis procedure describes the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call while the private call is already in progress.\nProcedures in figure 10.7.2.4.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tBoth members of the private call belong to the same MCPTT system.\n2.\tA private call is already in progress.\nThe figure depicts a private call upgrade in the MCPTT (Multiprotocol Control and Trunking Transport) protocol, which is used for voice and multimedia services in the 5G network. The upgrade involves the use of a new signaling protocol, which allows for more efficient and reliable communication between the network and the user equipment (UE). The figure shows the network architecture, including the core switches, optical line terminals (OLTs), and distributed nodes, which are essential components of the 5G network. The layered design of the network aligns with SDN principles, allowing for better network management and control.\nFigure 10.7.2.4.2-1: MCPTT private call upgrade\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an emergency. MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. MCPTT client 1 retains the MCPTT emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency calls.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the private call to in-progress emergency by sending an MCPTT emergency request. If configured to send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request. If the emergency private call request includes an implicit floor reques it may also include location information.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency request towards MCPTT client 2, the MCPTT client of the other participant. If location information was included in the emergency private call request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to the other user on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\n4.\tThe MCPTT user of MCPTT client 2 is notified of the in-progress emergency of the MCPTT emergency private call.\nNOTE 2:\tMCPTT client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of receiving the MCPTT emergency private call upgrade.\n5.\tThe receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency request to the MCPTT server.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call ends.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server confirms the upgrade request to MCPTT client 1.\n8.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 continue with the private call, which has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency private call. MCPTT client 1 can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT client 2 is also in the MCPTT emergency state.\n",

This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure, described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], to identify whether the target MCPTT user is in the proximity of the calling MCPTT user. The user info ID of the target MCPTT user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nThe ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCPTT user's MCPTT ID to the MCPTT client. The establishment of the off-network private call using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-one ProSe direct communication procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nNOTE:\tThe ProSe procedures for one-to-one direct communications specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7] retrieves a layer-2 ID associated with the user info ID of the target MCPTT user by the discovery procedure to establish direct communications between ProSe users.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT private call for communicating with another MCPTT user when off-network using an automatic commencement mode.\nProcedures in figure 10.7.3.3-1 are the basic signalling procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an off-network MCPTT private call with the chosen MCPTT user.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCPTT user profile used for off-network operation mode is pre-provisioned in the MCPTT UEs.\nThe figure depicts a private call setup in automatic commencement mode, showing the user interface and the call setup process.\nFigure 10.7.3.3-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate a private call to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client 1 sends a call setup request towards the MCPTT client 2.

If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the related geographic area).

However, to avoid excessive numbers of forwardings and in particular to avoid indefinite loops in the forwarding a limit for immediate forwardings is defined in the service configuration. The MCPTT server keeps track of the number of forwardings, if the limit is exceeded, the call will be released. For forwarding no answer or for forwarding based on manual user input, only one forwarding is allowed, and in case of no answer on the first forwarding the MCPTT server will release the call.\nThe procedure describes the case for MCPTT for private call forwarding that an MCPTT user in a partner MCPTT system is the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure shows manual commencement mode, but the changes are also applicable when using automatic commencement mode.\nNOTE 2:\tThe procedure focusses on the interaction between the MCPTT servers, which is independent of the condition of the call forwarding.

Three UEs involved in the session are shown for simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control and audio mixing by the network is applied.\n2.\tMCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B and client C) and MCPTT server.\n3.\tParticipants and A and B have the permission to talk to all other participants and the floor is granted to floor participant B.\nThe figure depicts a floor request, floor granted, and multi-talker floor taken during an MCPTT session, illustrating the process of managing floor requests in a multi-talker environment.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.1a-1: Floor request, floor granted and multi-talker floor taken during an MCPTT session\n1.\tFloor participant B is talking and is sending the voice media.\n2.\tFloor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server which includes the necessary information, e.g. floor priority.\n4.\tBased on applicable criteria (e.g. floor priority, participant type, allowance to transmit, maximum number of simultaneous talkers) floor control server determines what action (grant, deny, or queue) shall be applied to the request. In this case, the floor request from floor participant A will be accepted. Simultaneous floor requests to transmit are handled in a sequential order. Based on the group configuration repository data, the floor control server may limit the time a floor participant is allowed to talk.\n5a.\tFloor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor participant A.\n5b.\tFloor control server sends a multi-talker floor taken message to floor participant B.\n5c.\tFloor control server sends a multi-talker floor taken message to floor participant C.\n5d.

Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nThe figure depicts a floor override scenario in a network, where a floor is revoked during an MCPTT session. This is a crucial aspect of network management and ensures that the network remains functional even in the event of a floor being removed. The figure illustrates the process of revoking a floor, which is a critical step in network management, and the use of the floor revoke command during an MCPTT session.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.1-1: Floor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected) during an MCPTT session\n1.\tIt is assumed that floor participant B has been given floor and is transmitting voice media.\n2.\tFloor participant A having a priority which is relatively higher than that of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tThe floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the priority information that is received in the floor request message.

The user of floor participant A may be notified that he is granted the floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant B may be notified who is granted the floor.\n8.\tFloor participant A starts sending voice media over the session established beforehand.\n9.\tNow floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.\n10.\tFloor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control server which may include priority information.\n11.\tFloor control server determines whether to accept the floor request from floor participant B based on arbitration result e.g., according to the priority information that is received in the floor request message.\n12.\tThe floor control server responds with a floor rejected message to floor participant B.\n13.\tFloor participant B may be notified that he is rejected.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor participants (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control server (with an override based on priority and configured to permit the transmission of the overridden floor participant B to continue). Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-conditions\n-\tThe floor control server has been configured to support override.\n-\tThe override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.\nThe figure depicts a floor override (overridden continues to transmit) during an MCPTT session, illustrating the process of overriding a floor in a building's communication system. The figure shows the various components involved, such as the floor, override, and the communication system, highlighting the importance of this process in ensuring the smooth operation of the building's communication infrastructure.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.2-1: Floor override (overridden continues to transmit) during an MCPTT session\n1.\tIt is assumed that floor participant B has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.\n2.\tFloor participant A having a floor priority which is relatively higher than that of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tThe floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor priority information that is received in the floor request message.\n5a.\tFloor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor participant A.\n5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor participants (including floor participant B). Floor participant B continues transmitting the (overridden) voice media transmission.\nNOTE 1:\tAll other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.\n6a.\tThe floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.\n6b.\tThe user of floor participant B is notified of the status that the floor is now taken by floor participant A.\n7.\tFloor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the session established beforehand.\nNOTE 2:\tFloor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both transmissions is based on configuration.\n10.9.1.3.2.3\tFloor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected) during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-talker control\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.3-1 shows the high-level procedure that the floor control allows several participants to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already established between the floor participant (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control.\n2.\tMCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B and client C) and MCPTT server.\n3.\tThe maximum number of simultaneous talkers is set to 2.\n4.\tThe floor priority of floor participant A is higher than of floor participant B.\n5.\tThe floor is granted to floor participant B and floor participant C.\nThe figure depicts a floor override scenario in a multi-point telecommunication system, where a floor is revoked during an MCPTT session. This scenario is crucial for ensuring the proper functioning of the system, as it allows for the rerouting of traffic to another floor in case of a malfunction or failure. The figure illustrates the process of revoking a floor and the subsequent rerouting of traffic, highlighting the importance of this step in maintaining the integrity of the system.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.3-1: Floor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected) during an MCPTT session\n1.\tFloor participant B and floor participant C are sending voice media over the session established.\n2.\tFloor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A wants to talk (i.e. send voice media) over the session. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tBased on an arbitration result (e.g. per the priority information that is received in the floor request message), the floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor participant A. The maximum number of simultaneous talkers in the MCPTT group has been reached, the floor control server decides to apply the override mechanism.\n5.\tThe floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor participant B stopping the voice media transmission of floor participant B.\n6.\tThe user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.\n7.\tThe Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor participant A, while sending a multi-talker floor taken message to floor participant B and floor participant C including the information to whom the floor has been granted.\n8.\tThe user of floor participant A may be notified that the floor has been granted to him. Similarly, the user of floor participant B and floor participant C may be notified to whom the floor has been granted.\n9.\tFloor participant A starts sending voice media over the session established beforehand.\n10.\tNow floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.\n11.\tFloor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control server that may include participant priority information.\n12.\tBased on arbitration result, e.g. per the priority information that is received in the floor request message, and if the number of MCPTT Users has already reached the maximum number of simultaneous talkers in the group, the floor control server determines whether to accept or reject the floor request from floor participant B. Due to lower priority of participant B and the applicable limitation of simultaneous talkers, the floor control server rejects the floor request.\n13.\tThe floor control server responds with a floor rejected message to floor participant B.\n14.\tFloor participant B may be notified about the floor rejection.\nNOTE:\tFloor control procedure is independent from whether audio mixing is performed by the MCPTT server or by the UE.\n10.9.1.3.2.4\tFloor release during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-talker control\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.4-1 shows the high-level procedure where the floor controller allows a participant to release the floor while other participants continue to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already established between the floor participants and the floor control server. Only three UEs involved in the session are shown for simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control and audio mixing by the network is applied.\n2.\tMCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B, and client C) and the MCPTT server.\n3.\tParticipants A, B, and C have the permission to talk to all other participants, and the floor is granted to floor participants A, B, and C.\n\nThe figure depicts a floor release during an MCPTT session, showing the release sequence and the corresponding floor number.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.2.4-1: Floor release during an MCPTT session\n1.\tFloor participants A, B and C are sending voice media over the established session.\n2.\tUser A stops talking and wants to stop sending voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor release message to the floor control server.\n4.\tThe floor control server accepts the floor release from floor participant A and sends a multi-talker floor release message to floor participant B and floor participant C.\n4a.\tThe users of floor participant B and floor participant C may be notified that floor participant A has released the floor.\n5.\tFloor participants B and C continue sending voice media over the established session.\nNOTE:\tFloor control procedures are independent from whether audio mixing is performed by the MCPTT server or by the UE.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.3-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is conducted for the MCPTT session already established between MCPTT clients (with floor granted to floor participant B) and server (with an override based on priority at floor control server). Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nThe figure depicts a queue status during an MCPTT session, showing the number of active queues, the number of pending messages, and the number of messages waiting to be processed. The status is updated in real-time, providing a dynamic view of the system's performance.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.3-1: Queue status during an MCPTT session\n1.\tIt is assumed that floor participant B has been given a floor granted and is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants (including floor participating A) requesting floor which get queued at the floor control server.\n2.\tFloor participant A would like to know its current position in the floor request queue.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a queue position request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tFloor control server determines the current queue position of floor participant A from the floor request queue.\n5.\tFloor control server responds with the current position in queue position info message.\n6.\tUser at floor participant A is informed about the current queue position.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation from the floor queue initiated by the MCPTT user. The MCPTT user may be an authorized user who has rights to cancel the floor requests of other MCPTT users, whose floor requests are in floor control queue.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that floor participant B has been granted the floor and is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants (including floor participant A and floor participant C) requesting the floor which have been queued at the floor control server.\nThe figure depicts a floor request cancellation from a queue initiated by a user in the MCPTT system. The request is initiated by the user, and the system responds with a cancellation message.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by MCPTT user\n1.\tThe floor participant A wants to remove the floor request from the floor request queue. If floor participant A is an authorized MCPTT user with the rights to cancel another MCPTT user's floor request, the authorized MCPTT user may request floor request cancellation for one or more floor participants, whose floor request needs to be removed from the floor queue.\n2.\tThe floor participant A sends a floor request cancel (initiating MCPTT ID) message to the floor control server. If the floor participant A wants to remove the floor request(s) of other participant(s), the target participant(s)' MCPTT ID should be included in this message.\n3.\tThe floor control server shall check whether the requesting floor participant has authorization to cancel the floor request(s). If authorized, the floor request(s) will be removed from the floor request queue. When current transmission is completed, floor control server will process the floor request from the updated floor request queue.\n4.\tIf the floor request cancel in step 2 is sent by an authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) to cancel the floor request(s) of other participant(s) from the floor request queue, the floor request cancel notify message is sent to the floor participant whose floor request was cancelled from the floor queue. The floor request cancel notify message is also sent to the authorized user (not shown in figure) if the floor request cancel in step 2 is sent by the floor participant A is an initiating MCPTT user.\n5.\tThe floor control server provides a floor request cancel response to the floor participant A when the floor cancellation is completed. Optionally, the new queue position information may be notified to the floor participants whose floor requests are in the floor request queue (not shown in the figure).\nFigure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation from the queue initiated by the floor control server. Only three UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B, client C and client D) and MCPTT server.\n-\tIt is assumed that floor participant B (not shown in figure) has been granted the floor and is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants (including floor participant A and participant C) requesting the floor which have been queued at the floor control server.\n-\tThe user at MCPTT client D is an authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) allowed to remove a floor request of other MCPTT users from the floor queue and can receive notifications about another user when their floor request is queued, when their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued floor request is removed from the queue.\nThe figure depicts a floor request cancellation process initiated by a floor control server, with the request being initiated by a floor request controller. The process involves the initiation of a floor request, which is then sent to the floor control server for processing. The floor request controller then initiates the floor request cancellation process, which involves the cancellation of the floor request. The figure provides a visual representation of the floor request cancellation process, allowing for a clear understanding of the steps involved.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by floor control server\n1.\tThe floor control server removes the floor request from the floor request queue based on policy. e.g., expiration of a timer. In the case when floor control server receives repeated floor requests from a floor participant while the floor is occupied, the new floor request is accepted and added into the floor queue and the existing/former floor request is removed from the floor queue or the new floor request is rejected and the existing/former floor request of this floor participant is retained in the floor request queue.\n2.\tThe floor control server sends a floor request cancel notify to the floor participant(s) whose floor request is removed from the floor request queue.\n3.\tOptionally, the newly queue position information is notified to the other floor participants whose floor requests are queued.\n4.\tIf the floor request cancel in step 2 is sent by floor control server for the user whose floor request is in the floor request queue, the floor control server may send the floor cancel notify to the floor participant D who is an authorized user.\nDuring silence (when no talk burst is ongoing), the floor control server may send floor idle message to all floor participants from time to time.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.5-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor idle is conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor participant and the floor control server. Only three MCPTT UEs involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe floor control is established between the floor participants and floor control server.\n2.\tThe floor participant A is granted the floor.\nThe figure depicts an idle floor during an MCPTT session, showing the floor's status and the number of idle floors.\nFigure 10.9.1.3.5.1-1: Floor idle during an MCPTT session\n1.\tUser A stops talking and wants to stop sending voice media over the session. The floor participants A sends the floor release message to the floor control server.\n2.\tThe floor control server determines the floor is idle, e.g., all the floor requests are processed and no new floor request is received. For multi-talker control case, the floor control server determines that the floor participant A was the last talker.\n3.\tThe floor control server sends the floor idle message to all the participants.\n4.\tFloor participants may notify the MCPTT user that the floor is idle.\nNOTE:\tFloor idle may be sent multiple times during the MCPTT session.\nThe MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.) in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In this scenario, the partner MCPTT systems request the floor control for its MCPTT user(s) from the floor control server of the primary MCPTT system. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.\nFigure 10.9.1.4.1-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not share all information of their users' to the primary MCPTT system (public information would still need to be shared).\n2.\tThe group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted by the partner MCPTT system.\n3.\tThe floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs to partner MCPTT system.\n4.\tThe floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group call. The floor control server 2 routes all floor control messages to and from the floor participants 2 and 3 and then floor control server 1.\nThe figure depicts a floor control system in a multi-partner MCPTT system, illustrating the process of group forwarding involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.\nFigure 10.9.1.4.1-1: Floor control (partner MCPTT system forwarding) involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems\n1.\tAn MCPTT group call involving group1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and active.\n2.\tThe MCPTT users want to talk.\n3.\tThe floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not occur at the same time).\n4.\tIf only one floor request is received, or floor control server 2 handles the floor request sequentially, there is no arbitration performed and the corresponding floor request is forwarded to the floor control server 1. If the floor control server 2 receives multiple floor requests at the same time or during an interval, then it forwards the floor requests to the floor control server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the floor participant information shall not be exposed, the floor priority related information or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1 should be included in the forwarded request.\n5.\tThe floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group call and determines the floor request to be accepted.\n6.\tIf the floor request from floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT system is accepted, a floor granted is sent with permission to talk. The floor control messages from floor control server 1 are routed to floor participant 2 via the floor control server 2.\n7.\tWhen the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted, the floor control server 2 sends a floor granted message on to floor participant 2.\n8.\tThe floor granted shall cause the user of the UE where the floor participant 2 is located to be notified.\n9.\tThe primary floor control server 1 may (9a.1) send a floor rejected message, or (9b.1) send a queue position info message for each non-granted received floor requests forwarded from the floor control server 2 (partner). When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor rejected message, then the floor control server 2 (partner) (9a.2) sends a floor rejected message to the appropriate floor participant. When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the queue position info, then the floor control server 2 (partner) (9b.2) sends a queue position info message to the appropriate floor participant.\n10a.1\tIf floor control server 1 rejects the floor request from floor participant 1, then a floor reject message is sent.\n10a.2\tUpon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is located may be notified.\n10b.1\tIf floor control server 1 supports floor queue, queue position info message is sent to the floor participant 1.\n10b.2\tUpon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is located may be notified.\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box enclosing them. However, if this box is implemented then either information flow 10a or 10b would occur.\nNOTE 2:\tOptionally, the authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) receiving notifications about another user when their floor request is queued, when their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued floor request is removed from the queue is not shown here for the sake of brevity.\n11.\tSince the floor is granted to floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT system, then a floor taken is sent to all other floor participants ((11a) floor participant 1 and (11b.1) to floor control server 2 (partner) for forwarding to (11b.2) floor participant 3.\n12.\tThe receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the users of the UEs where the floor participant entity 1 and floor participant 3 are located to be notified.\n13.\tUpon successful floor granted, the group call media transmission occurs.\nNOTE 3:\tThe media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.\nThe MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.) in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In this scenario, the partner MCPTT system filters its MCPTT users' floor requests before communicating with the floor control server of the primary MCPTT system. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.\nFigure 10.9.1.4.2-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not share all information of their users to the primary MCPTT system (public information would still need to be shared).\n2.\tThe group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted by the partner MCPTT system.\n3.\tThe floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs to partner MCPTT system.\n4.\tThe floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group call. The floor control server 2 does floor control filtering with its floor participants 2 and 3 before communicating with the floor control server 1.\nThe figure depicts a floor control system in a multi-partner network, where filtering is performed by a partner MCPTT system. The system involves groups from multiple MCPTT systems, ensuring efficient and reliable filtering.\nFigure 10.9.1.4.2-1: Floor control (filtering by partner MCPTT system) involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems\n1.\tAn MCPTT group call involving group 1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and active.\n2.\tThe MCPTT users want to talk\n3. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not occur at the same time).\n4.\tFloor control server 2 receives a floor request from floor participant 2 and from participant 3 at the same time or during an interval, then the floor control server 2 (partner) performs filtering of the floor requests received according to its local policy such as priority or order based on its own users, and forwards the selected floor request (floor participant 2) to the floor control server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the floor participant information shall not be exposed, the priority related information or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1 should be included in the forwarded request.\n5.\tThe floor control server 2 (partner) may send a floor rejected towards the floor participant 3, since its floor request was not chosen to be forwarded on to the floor control server 1.\n6.\tThe user on the UE where the floor participant 3 is located may be notified of the rejection.\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 5 and 6 can occur any time between step 4 and step 16.\n7.\tThe floor control server 2 (partner) forwards the floor request of floor participant 2 to the floor server 1.\n8.\tThe floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group call and determines the floor request to be accepted. The floor request message from floor participant 2 of the partner system is accepted by the floor control server 1 (arbitrator) and is determined that a floor granted is sent with permission to talk.\n9.\tThe floor granted message from floor control server 1 is routed to floor participant 2 via the floor control server 2 (partner).\n10.\tSince floor participant 1 sent a floor request but was not granted,\n10a.1\tthe primary floor control server may send a floor rejected message to floor participant 1.\n10a.2\tThe user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be notified of the rejection.\n10b.1\tif floor control server supports floor queuing, send a queue position info message to floor participant 1.\n10b.2\tThe user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be notified of the queue position.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box enclosing them. However, if this box is implemented then either information flow 10a or 10b would occur.\nNOTE 3:\tOptionally, the authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) receiving notifications about another user when their floor request is queued, when their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued floor request is removed from the queue is not shown here for the sake of brevity.\n11.\tA floor taken message is sent to floor participant 1.\n12.\tThe user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be notified.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 10 through Step 12 can occur any time between step 8 and step 18.\n13.\tSince the floor control server 2 (partner) filters floor requests, when the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted for floor participant 2 from floor control server 1, the floor control server 2 (partner) needs to use the information received to generate the floor taken which will be sent to all other floor participants (floor control participant 3).\n14. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor granted message to floor participant 2.\n15.\tThe user of the UE where the floor participant 2 is located is notified.\n16.\tThe floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor taken message to all other floor participants (floor participant 3).\n17.\tThe user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be notified.\n18.\tUpon successful floor grant, the group call media transmission occurs.\nNOTE 5:\tThe media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.\nFigure 10.9.1.5-1 shows the procedure for audio cut-in for the session already established between the floor participants from same MCPTT service provider. Floor participants may request the floor while Floor Participant B is transmitting voice media. Floor control server grants floor immediately to the floor request received.\nEditor's note: Configuration parameter for queue depth is FFS.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe floor control server has been configured to support audio cut-in.\n-\tIt is assumed that the floor has been granted to floor participant B and floor participant B is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants (including floor participant A).\nThe figure depicts a floor control system for audio control in a single Multi-Point Transmitter (MPTT) system. It shows the various components and their connections, including the audio input, audio output, and the control signal. The system is designed to ensure that audio control is enabled in a group of audio channels, and the floor control is managed by a single control point.\nFigure 10.9.1.5-1: Floor control for audio cut-in enabled group in single MCPTT system\n1.\tFloor participant B has been given floor and is transmitting voice media.\n2.\tFloor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tThe floor control server applies the audio cut-in policy with floor queue disabled i.e., floor is immediately granted to the floor participant A, and revoked from floor participant B.\n5.\tThe floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor participant B stopping the voice media transmission from floor participant B.\n6.\tThe user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.\n7.\tThe Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor participant A, and sends a floor taken message to floor participant B with information of who is granted the floor. The floor control server may limit the time a user talks (holds the floor).\n8.\tThe user of floor participant A may be notified that he is granted the floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant B may be notified who is granted the floor.\n9.\tFloor participant A starts sending voice media over the session established.\n10.\tNow floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.\n11.\tFloor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control server.\n12.\tThe floor control server applies the audio cut-in policy with floor queue disabled.\n13.\tThe floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor participant A stopping the voice media transmission from floor participant A.\n14.\tThe user of floor participant A may be notified that the floor is revoked.\n15.\tThe Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor participant B, and sends a floor taken message to floor participant A with information of who is granted the floor. The floor control server may limit the time a user talks (holds the floor).\n16. The user of floor participant B may be notified that he is granted the floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant A may be notified who is granted the floor.\n17.\tFloor participant B starts sending voice media over the session established.\nFigure 10.9.1.6-1 shows the procedure for a floor participant to indicate to the floor control server that the unicast media flow of an active MCPTT group call can be stopped.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tAn MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server for an MCPTT group call. Other participants to the call are not shown in the figure for simplicity.\n2.\tThe floor control is established between the floor participant and the floor control server.\nThe figure depicts a media stop request during an MCPTT session, illustrating the process of unicast media stop requests in a network. The figure shows a media stop request message (MTR) being sent from the source to the destination, with the destination acknowledging the request. The figure also includes a media stop request response (MTRR) message from the destination, indicating that the media has been stopped. The figure is a visual representation of the communication process in a network, highlighting the importance of unicast media stop requests in ensuring network reliability and efficiency.\nFigure 10.9.1.6-1: Unicast media stop request during an MCPTT session\n1.\tAnother floor participant has requested and has been granted the floor. The floor control server sends a floor taken message to floor participant A. The floor taken message may include an identifier of the associated media flow.\n2.\tFloor control server sends the voice media flow to floor participant A over unicast.\n3.\tFloor participant A gets the information, e.g. from the user, that media for the call is not needed.\n4.\tFloor participant A sends a unicast media stop request to floor control server, identifying the media flow to be stopped.\n5.\tFloor control server stops sending that unicast media flow to floor participant A. Associated bearer resources may be de-allocated by the MCPTT server.\n\nFigure 10.9.1.6-2 shows the procedure for a floor participant to request from the floor control server that the unicast media flow of an active MCPTT group call be restarted.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tAn MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server for an MCPTT group call. Other participants to the call are not shown in the figure for simplicity\n2.\tThe floor control is established between the floor participant and the floor control server.\n3.\tFloor participant A has previously indicated to the floor control server that unicast media flow for that call should be stopped, using the procedure described in Figure 10.9.1.6-1.\nThe figure depicts a media resume request during an MCPTT session, illustrating the process of re-establishing a connection after a media pause. The figure shows the sender's request to the receiver, which is then processed by the network to determine the best path for the media to resume. The figure is a visual representation of the complex network protocols used in modern communication systems.\nFigure 10.9.1.6-2: Unicast media resume request during an MCPTT session\n1.\tAnother floor participant has requested and has been granted the floor. The floor control server sends a floor taken message to floor participant A. The floor taken message may include an identifier of the associated media flow.\n2.\tFloor participant A gets the information, e.g. from the user, that media for the call is needed again.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a unicast media resume request to floor control server, identifying the media flow to be re-started.\n4.\tFloor control server starts sending that unicast media flow to floor participant A. This may need new bearer resources to be allocated.\n\nNOTE 1:\tThe identifier of the flow to be stopped or resumed is known by the floor participant from the floor control information flows associated with that MCPTT session.\nNOTE 2:\tStopping a media flow is not leaving the session and subsequent floor control messages will still be sent by the floor control server to the floor participant which has requested a unicast media stop.\nNOTE 3:\tBoth requests have no effect on a possible ongoing transmission of the media flow over MBMS. In particular, they are not interpreted by the MCPTT server as MBMS listening status reports.\n\n",

The procedures apply to both private calls and group calls.\nIn off-network, floor control is performed by using floor control messages among the MCPTT clients without centralized MCPTT server. The MCPTT client can transmit voice packets once it is granted the right to speak, either locally in the UE or by reception of a floor granted message from another MCPTT client.\nIn off-network, the MCPTT client currently speaking performs the temporary floor arbitrator during speaking since there is no centralized MCPTT floor control server. The floor arbitrator controls the floor whether or not queue is supported, and when floor is requested with override. If queue is supported, the MCPTT client performing floor arbitrator grants the right to speak to the next speaker and transfers the floor arbitrator role after completing the voice transfer and releasing the floor. For group calls, the floor arbitrator also transfers the floor control queue when granting the floor. The next MCPTT client receiving the right to speak becomes the new floor arbitrator and, for group calls, has the floor control queue.\nFor group calls, the floor control message is delivered in multicast based communication and can be monitored by all the members within the MCPTT group.\nThe following information flows apply among MCPTT clients.\n-\tFloor request (from the floor participants to the floor arbitrator): used to request a floor for voice transfer.\n-\tFloor release (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participants): used to inform that the voice transfer is completed and the floor is released.\n-\tFloor granted (from the floor arbitrator to a floor participant): used to indicate that the request for floor is granted, that voice transfer is possible and the current queue list.\n-\tQueue position request (from the floor participant to the floor arbitrator): used to request the position in the floor request queue.\n-\tQueue position info (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to indicate the floor request is queued and the current queue status.\n-\tFloor rejected (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to indicate that a request for the floor is rejected.\n-\tFloor taken (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to indicate the floor is granted to another MCPTT user.\nFor floor control for off-network, the information flows defined under subclause 10.9.1.2 apply unless it is explicitly defined under this subclause.\nTable 10.9.2.2.2-1 describes the information flow floor granted, from the floor participant to the floor participant, which is used to indicate that a request for floor is granted and media transfer is possible.\nTable 10.9.2.2.2-1: Floor granted\n\nIf a floor arbitrator still exists, the expected behaviour for floor requests during periods of silence is described in subclauses 10.9.2.5 and 10.9.2.6 (with the exception that no media was being generated prior to the floor request).\nIf a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.3.1-1 shows the successful high level floor control procedure during periods when there is no detectable talker.\nNOTE 1:\tThe description also applies to private calls.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group call had been established and all MCPTT clients have the call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor arbitrator is identified.\nThe figure depicts a successful floor taken flow in a 9-2-3-1 network, illustrating the flow's progression from the source to the destination. The figure shows the flow's path through the network, with the source (S) and destination (D) marked clearly. The flow is taken from the source to the destination, indicating that no floor contention has occurred.\nFigure 10.9.2.3.1-1: Successful floor taken flow (No floor contention)\n1.\tThe MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client 1 does not detect any floor contention. Floor contention occurs when multiple floor requests may exist simultaneously.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mechanism for detecting floor contention is out of scope of the present document.\n3.\tThe MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.\n4.\tThe user gets a notification that the floor request was successful (the floor has been granted).\n5.\tThe MCPTT client 1 begins voice transmission.\nIf a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.4.1-1 shows the expected behaviour in case of simultaneous floor requests are generated when there is no detectable talker.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn off-network group call is established and all MCPTT clients have the call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor arbitrator is identified.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 has higher priority than MCPTT client 2.\nThe figure depicts a complex network of simultaneous floor requests, illustrating the intricate interactions between different floors and the various entities involved in managing these requests. The figure includes floor requests from different floors, represented by different colors and shapes, as well as the corresponding floor numbers and the entities responsible for managing these requests. The figure also shows the flow of requests from the floor to the floor below, illustrating the sequential nature of floor requests in a multi-floor building.\nFigure 10.9.2.4.1-1: Simultaneous floor requests\n1a.\tThe MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.\n1b.\tThe MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.\nNOTE 1:\tStep 1a and 1b happen in parallel\n2.\tOn receiving a floor request message, while waiting for a response to the sent floor request message, the MCPTT client compares its floor priority with the floor priority indicated in the received floor request message.\n3.\tOn determining that it has higher floor priority than the received floor request message(s), and no response to the sent floor request message is received, the MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.\n4.\tThe user at MCPTT client 1 gets notification that the floor request was successful (the floor has been granted).\nNOTE 2:\tIf the floor priority in the received floor request message is same as its own floor priority, the MCPTT client can use another scheme to decide who gets the floor.\nFigure 10.9.2.5-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. In the case, MCPTT clients should support queue function. The current speaking MCPTT client acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request into the queue list when receiving the floor request from other MCPTT clients. This procedure happens while voice media is transmitting. In the flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as the floor arbitrator.\nNOTE:\tThe description only applies to group calls.\nThe figure depicts a floor request during a conversation with a queue, illustrating the interaction between the user and the system. The user's request is highlighted, and the system's response is shown in the form of a floor request. The figure provides a visual representation of the user's request and the system's response, highlighting the flow of communication and the interaction between the user and the system.\nFigure 10.9.2.5-1: Floor request during speaking with queue\n1.\tMCPTT client 1 is transmitting voice media to the MCPTT group.\n2.\tMCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request of MCPTT client 2 into the queue list.\n4.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the queue position info message with the queuing status regarding the floor request of MCPTT client 2 in order to inform the floor request is queued.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group when releasing the floor. The message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted to send the voice media, and queue list, if any. MCPTT client 1 may include the maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 transmits in the floor granted message.\n6.\tMCPTT client 2 sends the voice media when receiving the floor granted message and being granted as next speaker in the floor granted message. In addition, MCPTT client 2 becomes the floor arbitrator.\nFigure 10.9.2.6-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among MCPTT floor participants. In the case, MCPTT clients do not support queue function. The current speaking MCPTT client acting as the floor arbitrator controls the floor request when receiving the floor request from other MCPTT clients. This procedure happens while voice media is transmitting. In the flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as the floor arbitrator.\nNOTE:\tThe description also applies to private calls.\nThe figure depicts a floor request during speaking without a queue, illustrating the process of a person requesting assistance from a service desk. The figure shows a person standing in front of a service desk, with a microphone in hand, indicating that they are speaking. The service desk is equipped with a computer monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and there are multiple buttons and a mouse pad visible. The person is wearing a headset, which is connected to the microphone, and there is a visible line on the floor, indicating the floor request. The figure also includes a small sign with the text \"Floor request during speaking without queue,\" providing context to the scene.\nFigure 10.9.2.6-1: Floor request during speaking without queue\n1.\tMCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator rejects the floor request from MCPTT client 2 if no queue function is supported and sends the floor rejected message to the MCPTT group.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the floor release message to the MCPTT group when releasing the floor, in order to indicate that MCPTT client 1 finishes to send the voice media and releases the floor.\nWhen the floor release message is transmitted, there are no voice media in the MCPTT group until an MCPTT client requests the floor as described in subclause 10.9.2.3.\nFigure 10.9.2.7-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. When the currently speaking MCPTT floor participant receives the floor request message from another floor participant who is authorized to revoke the active transmission (e.g. higher hierarchy), the current speaking MCPTT floor participant immediately stops sending the audio media and then grants the permission to that authorized floor participant.\nNOTE:\tThe description also applies to private calls.\nPre-condition:\n-\tMCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.\nThe figure depicts a floor request with override authorization, showing a user's request to override a floor plan. The request is submitted through a floor request form, which includes a floor plan, override authorization, and a user's name. The request is then sent to the floor plan manager for approval.\nFigure 10.9.2.7-1: Floor request with override authorization\n1.\tMCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message with override criteria (e.g., priority level) to the MCPTT group.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator determines if the floor is to be revoked based on override criteria. If this is the case, MCPTT client 1 revokes its right of the floor and stops sending the voice media immediately.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group. The floor granted message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted, the floor and the floor control queue (if supported). MCPTT client 1 may also include the maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 can transmit voice in the floor granted message.\nMCPTT client2 who has revoked the floor is the new floor arbitrator and transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.\nFigure 10.9.2.8-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. If the floor control queueing is supported by the floor control mechanism, the current speaking MCPTT group member who is acting as the floor arbitrator collects the information about the queue status based on the received request(s) from the MCPTT group participant(s). The current speaker can then share information about the queue status of the MCPTT floor participant upon request.\nNOTE:\tThe description only applies to group calls.\nPre-condition:\n-\tMCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.\nThe figure depicts a queue status request in a network, showing the current status of the queue and the number of requests waiting to be processed. The request is represented by a red dot, and the status of the queue is indicated by the color of the dot. The figure provides a visual representation of the queue management process in a network, allowing network administrators to monitor and manage the queue status of their network.\nFigure 10.9.2.8-1: Queue status request\n1.\tMCPTT client 2 sends the queue position request message targeted to MCPTT client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator by broadcasting the message to the MCPTT group to get its queue status.\n2.\tSince the queue function is assumed to be supported in this call flow, MCPTT client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator processes the queue position request to find out the status of MCPTT client 1 in the queue.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 constructs the queue position info message containing the MCPTT client 2's queue status and sends it toward MCPTT client 2 by broadcasting the message to the MCPTT group.\nMCPTT client1 continues being the floor arbitrator and transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.\n",

When the group call over the MBMS bearer is finished, this temporary association information of an MCPTT group call to specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The procedure in figure 10.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the call start. This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to continuously use a unicast bearer.

A similar decision may also be made for other types of media communication e.g. MCVideo. To decide to use broadcast or unicast involves a number of aspects. The figure 10.10.6.1-1 specifies a procedural flow to perform such decision.\nThe flow described evaluates which bearer type to use for a new MCPTT group call. It is assumed that if an MBMS bearer is active it is also announced to the MCPTT client.\nWhen using an MBMS bearer for application level control signalling, the announcement of an already active MBMS bearer could be part of the MCPTT group call setup, however that will have an impact on the call setup time.\nThe figure depicts the decision flow of a MBMS bearer, illustrating the steps taken by the MBMS bearer to select the best path for data transmission. The flow starts with the MBMS bearer receiving a data frame from the sender, then it proceeds to analyze the frame for any errors or anomalies. If the frame is deemed acceptable, the MBMS bearer proceeds to the next step, which is the decision to use the MBMS bearer or the MBMS bearer's own network. If the frame is not acceptable, the MBMS bearer will discard the frame and move on to the next step. The figure also includes a flowchart to illustrate the decision flow, making it easier to understand the process.\nFigure 10.10.6.1-1: MBMS bearer decision flow\nOn a high level the procedure outcome is to use unicast or broadcast bearers for the new MCPTT group call.

The MBMS bearer is a technology that allows for efficient data transmission over mobile networks, and the figure provides a visual representation of how the application works.\nFigure 10.10.6.2-1: Application paging over an MBMS bearer\n1.\tThe MCPTT server initiates a new MCPTT group call on unicast or decides to transfer an ongoing call to unicast, or may initiate an MCPTT private call.\n2.\tThe MCPTT sends an application paging message on the MBMS bearer to inform the MCPTT client that the MCPTT server will initiate media transmission over a unicast bearer.\nNOTE:\tThe application paging message is sent with the assumption that there are UEs in idle mode. Furthermore, this message is an application level paging message and does not replace the normal paging procedure executed by EPC and RAN.\n3.\tIn the case that the UE is in idle mode the UE will initiate a service request to transfer the UE to connected mode.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server stops sending the media over an MBMS bearer. This step is only performed if transferring an ongoing call.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server initiates the media transmission over the unicast bearer.\nStep 4-5 may be performed in parallel with step 2-3. Step 5 will trigger a normal paging in EPC and RAN if the client is still in idle mode.\n",

The flow may use a floor request in the MCPTT call request indicating that the originator will be given the floor when the call starts and eliminates the need for a separate initial floor request message during media plane establishment. Alternatively, the call initiation may be sent without the floor request, which allows the called party to request the floor first. For a MCPTT first-to-answer call without floor control, floor control is not established.\nFigure 10.15.3-1 also describes the handling of private calls when a functional alias replaces the MCPTT ID as target address.

                            "text_content": "All clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure 10.15.3-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe calling MCPTT user has selected first-to-answer call.\n2.\tMCPTT clients 1 to n are registered and their respective users, MCPTT user 1 to MCPTT user n, are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.\n3.\tMCPTT clients 2 to n have activated the same functional alias.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nThe figure depicts a call setup in a multi-access edge computing (MEC) system, where users in the same MEC system are first-to-answer (F2A) calls. The figure shows the call setup with multiple users, each having a unique call identifier (CID). The call setup includes a call control point (CCP), a call manager (CM), and a call server (CS). The figure also includes a call termination point (CTP), which is the point where the call is terminated. The figure is labeled with the call setup's unique identifiers, such as CCP, CM, and CS.\nFigure 10.15.3-1: MCPTT first-to-answer call – MCPTT users in the same MCPTT system\n1.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to establish a MCPTT first-to-answer call indicating a set of potential target recipients or by calling a functional alias. For a MCPTT first-to-answer call with floor control, floor control is to be established. For first-to-answer call without floor control, both users will have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request including a set of potential target recipients to the MCPTT server (via the SIP core as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5]), using either a list of MCPTT IDs or a functional alias. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request contains the MCPTT ID and may contain the functional alias of originating user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor, for a first-to-answer call with floor control. The MCPTT client 1 includes a first-to-answer call indication that the call is to be established only to the first answering user.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server confirms that MCPTT users are authorized for the call and whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a first-to-answer call. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias of the calling user, if present, can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user. If a functional alias is present, the MCPTT server shall also check whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 (to MCPTT client n) to setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 (to MCPTT client n) is (are) allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using a functional alias.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server determines the list of MCPTT users to send MCPTT first-to-answer call request, based on a set of potential target recipients obtained from the request from MCPTT client 1. Alternatively, when a functional alias is used as target address, the MCPTT server resolves the functional alias to a corresponding list of related MCPTT IDs of MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n who have activated the functional alias. The functional alias must have been activated to identify the MCPTT IDs of the called users.\nNOTE 1:\tBased on some selection criteria (e.g. using the current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatchers that are responsible for the related geographic areas), the MCPTT server can send MCPTT first-to-answer call requests only to a sub-set of the MCPTT users that have activated the functional alias. The selection of the appropriate sub-set of MCPTT IDs is left to implementation.\nEditor's note:\tWhether the MCPTT server shall proceed only with those MCPTT IDs which are allowed to be called by MCPTT client 1 is FFS.\n5a, 5b, 5c.\tThe MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request and sends similar MCPTT first-to-answer call request to each potential target recipient, including the MCPTT ID and, if present, the functional alias of the calling MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1. If one or more called MCPTT users have registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the calls, then the incoming MCPTT first-to-answer call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE. Otherwise MCPTT first-to-answer call request may be delivered to all the registered MCPTT UEs. If a functional alias is present and more than one MCPTT client has activated that functional alias, then the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request to each MCPTT client.\n6a, 6b, 6c.\tThe MCPTT users are alerted, regardless of the commencement mode.\n7.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 accepted the call which causes MCPTT client 2 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 2:\tMCPTT server does not divert MCPTT first-to-answer call to voicemail if MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 has not accepted the incoming call.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to MCPTT client 1 indicating that MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted media parameters.\n9a.\tThe MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to MCPTT client 3.\n9b.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 3 notifies the user.\n10a.\tThe MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to MCPTT client n.\n10b.\tOptionally, MCPTT client n notifies the user.\n11.\tThe media plane for communication is established. Either user can transmit media individually when using floor control. For successful call establishment for first-to-answer call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 2 is informed that the floor is taken. For a first-to-answer call without floor control both users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.\nNOTE 3:\tPrior to media plane establishment, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\nEditor's note:\tIt is assumed that MCPTT client 1 initiates the set up as is done for private calls, but the details for the media security establishment are FFS and are in the scope of SA3. Results provided by SA3 may require changes in the procedure.\nNOTE 4:\tThe steps 9a ,10a and 11 can occur in any order and can also be performed in parallel.\n12.\tMCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer cancel call response.\n13.\tMCPTT client n sends an MCPTT first-to-answer cancel call response.\n",

The figure illustrates the process of initiating a call from a remote location, using the Remote Management Protocol (RMP) to establish a connection with the network.

This is left for the implementation.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call, showing the necessary components and their arrangement.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call. The MCPTT client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call request containing the list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert to the MCPTT server. Encryption supported information element shall be set to true since end-to-end encryption is supported. An SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters is included. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the ad hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\nIf the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency ad hoc group call or the MCPTT emergency state is already set for the MCPTT client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCPTT emergency alert):\ni.\tthe MCPTT ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;\nii.\tif the MCPTT emergency state is not set already, MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.\n2.\tIf the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCPTT server verifies whether the user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group call. If not authorized, the MCPTT server rejects the ad hoc group call request as specified in the step 3. The MCPTT server accepts the ad hoc group call request if the ad hoc group call is supported and authorized. If authorised, it validates whether the number of invited participants is within the configured limit before proceeding with the call setup.\nIf functional alias is present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\nIf an emergency indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and\nIf an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.\nIf the MC service users' information received in step 1 does not contain an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCPTT server forms the ad hoc group by using MCPTT users' information received in step 1, determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group and assigns a MC service group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. If no MC service ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MC service ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MC service server, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.\nThe MCPTT server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tThe MCPTT ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCPTT server or provided by the MCPTT client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);\nii.\tThe group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and\niii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.\nIf the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCPTT server and MCPTT client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4a-4c.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT clients of the invited users based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the MCPTT server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients (e.g. MCPTT ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge)\n5a-5c.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT user about the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group ID for the ad hoc group.\n6a-6c.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients may accept or reject the ad hoc group call requests and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCPTT server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCPTT user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed since the MCPTT server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc group call request to complete before sending the ad hoc group request to another participant.\n8.\tIf the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from the invited MCPTT users, and the required MCPTT users do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to ad hoc group call policy from the user profile configuration. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all MCPTT users who did not acknowledge the ad hoc group call request within the configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT ad hoc group call.\n9.\tMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4 establish media plane and floor control resources.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 9 can occur any time following step 7 if the conditions to proceed with the call are met.\nThe procedure focuses on the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing MCPTT ad hoc group call for all the participants of that ad hoc group call, since at least one of the release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure for the MCPTT server initiating termination an ongoing ad hoc group call.\nThe figure depicts a release 1 ad hoc group call, with the call being initiated by the user.

The MCPTT server cancels the in-progress emergency state or in-progress imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the ad hoc group call is an emergency or imminent peril call respectively.\n4.\tMCPTT server sends ad hoc group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group call.\n5.\tMCPTT users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.\n6.\tMCPTT client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, acknowledge towards the MCPTT server by sending an ad hoc group call release response.\nNOTE:\tIf the initiator of the ad hoc group call does not supply the participants list, the MCPTT client(s) may choose to store the list of participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group call with the same participants.\n7.\tMCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group call that is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e., further call is not possible over the same ad hoc group, otherwise if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the ad hoc group continues to exist (i.e., further calls over the same ad hoc group are possible).\nFigure 10.19.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure initiated by the MCPTT user and MCPTT client 1 wherein the list of participants is determined by the MCPTT server based on the citeria received from the MCPTT client.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 wants to invite MCPTT users who are satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group call.\nThe figure depicts a group call scenario where participants are determined by the Mobile Computing Platform (MCPTT) server. The participants are identified by their unique MAC addresses, which are then sent to the server for authentication. The figure illustrates the process of determining the participants in an ad hoc group call, ensuring a secure and efficient communication network.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group call participants determined by MCPTT server\n1.\tUser at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call in-order to invite the participants satisfying specific criteria. The MCPTT client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call request containing the details of the criteria to be applied by the MCPTT server for determining the participant list. If end-to-end encryption is supported, the Encryption supported information element shall be set to true and pre-configured MCPTT group whose configuration is to be applied is included. An SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters is included. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the ad hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\nIf the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency ad hoc group call or the MCPTT emergency state is already set for the MCPTT client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCPTT emergency alert):\ni.\tthe MCPTT ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;\nii.\tif the MCPTT emergency state is not set already, MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.\n2.\tIf the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCPTT server verifies whether the user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group call. If not authorized, the MCPTT server rejects the ad hoc group call request as specified in the step 3. The MCPTT server accepts the ad hoc group call request if the ad hoc group call is supported and authorized.\nIf functional alias is present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\nIf an emergency indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and\nIf an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.\nIf the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCPTT server forms the ad hoc group by using received information, and determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group. The MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. Further, the ad hoc group participants are included to ad hoc group once determined as specified in the step 4.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tThe MCPTT ad hoc group ID, either generated by the MCPTT server, if not included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MCPTT ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCPTT server, or provided by the MCVideo client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency alert;\nii.\tThe group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session is authorized); and\niii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not\nIf the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCPTT server and MCPTT client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server determines the list of participants to be invited for the ad hoc group call based on the information present in the information element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying pre-defined criteria or a combination of both.\nNOTE:\tThe content of the Criteria information element, the details of the pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCPTT server determines the list of participants are left to implementation.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT clients 2 and 3. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the MCPTT server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients. This request carries the pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCPTT server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n6.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT user about the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group ID for the ad hoc group.\n7.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients may accept or reject the ad hoc group call requests and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCPTT server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCPTT user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all MCPTT users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT ad hoc group call. The authorized users (not shown in figure), who are configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc group call, are notified to receive the MCPTT IDs of the MCPTT users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call, when the MCPTT users joins late or leave the MCPTT ad hoc group call.\n10.\tMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 establish media plane and floor control resources.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.4-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group call participants procedure by an authorized user.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn ad hoc group call is already in progress and the participants list is provided by the originating MCPTT user while initiating the MCPTT ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe participants of the MCPTT ad hoc group call belong to the single MCPTT system.\n3.\tThe MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 3 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing ad hoc group call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 determines to remove the user of MCPTT client 3 from the ad hoc group call and add user of MCPTT client 2 into the on-going ad hoc group call.\n\nThe figure depicts a modification of an ad hoc group call, where participants are modified by an authorized user.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.4-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by an authorized user\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at the MCPTT client 1 is authorized and requests to modify ad hoc group call participants. The MCPTT client 1 sends the modify ad hoc group call participants request to the MCPTT server in order to remove MCPTT client 3 from the ongoing ad hoc group call and add MCPTT client 2 into it.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server verifies whether the MCPTT client 1 is authorized to add or remove (modify) the participants of the on-going ad hoc group call.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server sends modify ad hoc group call participants response to the MCPTT client 1.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call leave request to the MCPTT client 3 in order to remove it from the on-going ad hoc group call.\n5.\tThe MCPTT client 3 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave request.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client 3 sends the ad hoc group call leave response to the MCPTT server.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call request towards MCPTT client 2.\nNOTE:\tSteps 7 to 9 can occur at any time following step 3.\n8.\tThe receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc group call.\n9.\tThe MCPTT client 2 accepts the ad hoc group call request and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCPTT server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCPTT user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server. The MCPTT server considers the MCPTT user as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n10.\tThe MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all the users who are added to the on-going ad hoc group call. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave the ad hoc group call.\n11.\tThe MCPTT server may notify the participants about the change in the participants of on-going ad hoc group call.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.5-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group call participants procedure by the MCPTT server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT client 1 is the initiator of the ad hoc group call.\n2.\tMCPTT server determined the participants for the ad hoc group call based on the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1 while initiating the ad hoc group call.\n3.\tMCPTT server continuously evaluates the criteria to monitor the list of users who meets or not meets the criteria for participating in the on-going ad hoc group call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server detects that the MCPTT client 5 satisfies the criteria and MCPTT client 4 stops to meet the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1.\n\nThe figure depicts a modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCPTT server, illustrating the process of adding or removing participants from a group call. The figure shows the steps taken by the server to modify the call, including the addition or removal of participants, and the resulting call structure.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.5-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCPTT server\n1.\tThe ad hoc group call is established and on-going with the participants MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4. The participants list is determined by the MCPTT server based on the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1 while initiating the call\n2.\tThe MCPTT server detects that the MCPTT client 5 satisfies the criteria specified by the MCPTT client.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call request to the MCPTT client 5.\n4.\tThe MCPTT client 5 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc group call.\n5.\tThe MCPTT client 5 accepts the ad hoc group call request and sends the ad hoc group call response to the MCPTT server.\n6.\tThe on-going ad hoc group call is updated by adding MCPTT client 5 which satisfies the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server detects that the MCPTT client 4 is no more satisfying the criteria to be the participant of the ad hoc group call.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call leave request to the MCPTT client 4 and removes it from the on-going ad hoc group call.\n9.\tThe MCPTT client 4 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave request.\n10.\tThe MCPTT client 4 sends the ad hoc group call leave response to the MCPTT server.\n11.\tThe on-going ad hoc group call is updated by removing MCPTT client 4, which no more satisfies the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1.\nFigure 10.19.3.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for ad hoc group call setup procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein either a list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is provided by the authorised user and the determined MCPTT users are from multiple MCPTT systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system shares their users' information to the primary MC system.\n2.\tThe authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher controls the ad hoc group.\n4.\tSome users of the ad hoc group belong to partner MC systems.\n5.\tThe preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in the MCPTT client and other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group communication.\n6.\tIf an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is used to invite the ad hoc group members, MCPTT client is aware of the ad hoc group ID.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call, showing the necessary components and their arrangement.\nFigure 10.19.3.2.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tThe MCPTT client of the authorized user initiates an ad hoc group call with multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. An ad hoc group call request message with the information of the MCPTT IDs or an ad hoc group ID if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MC system.\n2.\tIf the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCPTT server of the primary MC system verifies whether the user at of MCPTT client is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group call. If not authorized, the MCPTT server of the primary MC system rejects the ad hoc group call request as specified in the step 3. If the the MC service users' information received in step 1 does not contain an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCPTT server of the primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using MCPTT users' information received in step 1, determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration and assigns an MCPTT group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. If no MC service ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MC service ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MC service server, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.\nThe MCPTT server identifies the appropriate MCPTT server responsible for the MCPTT users of the ad hoc group. The MCPTT server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\nNOTE 1:\tThe ad hoc group information including the MCPTT group ID and the list of users is held in dynamic data in the MCPTT server.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message to the MCPTT client containing the below:\ni.\tThe MCPTT ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCPTT server or provided by the MCPTT client if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);\nii.\tThe group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and\niii.\tResult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.\nIf the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCPTT server and MCPTT client shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MC system sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT clients of the invited users belonging to the primary MC system based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the MCPTT server of the primary MC system shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients (e.g. MCPTT ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge).\n5.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT users about the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group ID for the ad hoc group, and may accept or reject the call and respond with an adhoc group call response.\n6.\tThe primary MCPTT server further initiates an ad hoc group call request message to the MCPTT users of the partner MC system. The ad hoc group call request message is routed to the MCPTT users via the MCPTT server of the partner MC system.\n7.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT users about the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group ID for the ad hoc group. The MCPTT users upon receipt of the invitation may accept or reject the call, and respond with the ad hoc group call response. The ad hoc group call response message is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MC system via the MCPTT server of the partner MC system.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server of the primary MC system provides an ad hoc group call response message to the MCPTT client of the authorized MCPTT user upon receiving response to the corresponding ad hoc group call request in step 1. The ad hoc group call response will consist of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe ad hoc group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n9.\tUpon successful ad hoc group call setup, a group call is established amongst the multiple group members from primary and partner MC systems. The media plane and floor control resources are established.\nThis procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the termination of an ongoing MCPTT ad hoc group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 10.19.3.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT ad hoc group call.\nPre-condition:\n-\tThe MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 belong to primary MC system. The MCPTT client 3 belongs to partner MC system.\nThe figure depicts a group call release event in an Ad Hoc network, showing the release of a group call to a specific group. The release is marked by a specific time stamp and a unique identifier. The figure provides a visual representation of the event, allowing network administrators to track and manage group calls in real-time.\nFigure 10.19.3.2.2-1: Ad hoc group call release\n1.\tThe MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call (e.g. as a result of ad hoc group call setup as specified in clause 10.19.3.2.x).\n2.\tThe MCPTT server would like to release the ad hoc group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group call and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends a ad hoc group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call. If the participants belong to partner MC system, then ad hoc group call release request is routed to the MCPTT clients of the partner MC system via the partner MCPTT server.\n5.\tThe MCPTT users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, send acknowledgement towards the MCPTT server by sending a ad hoc group call release response.\n7.\tThe MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group call that is terminated. The MCPTT servers remove the ad hoc group information from the dynamic data held in the MCPTT servers and the ad hoc group ceases to exist, otherwise if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the MCPTT servers keep the dynamic data and the ad hoc group continues to exist.\nFigure 10.19.3.2.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein the list of participants is determined by the MCPTT server based on the criteria received from the MCPTT client and determined MCPTT users are from multiple MCPTT systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system share their users' information to the primary MC system.\n2.\tThe authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server 1 of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.\n4.\tSome users of the ad hoc group belong to MCPTT server 2 of the partner MC systems.\n5.\tThe pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCPTT client and other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group communication.\nThe figure depicts a setup for an ad hoc group call involving multiple MCPTT systems. The setup includes a base station (BTS), a mobile communication terminal (MCT), and a public telephone terminal (PSTN). The BTS and PSTN are connected to the MCT, forming a network. The figure shows the various components and their connections, including the BTS, PSTN, and MCT, as well as the network topology. The setup is designed to provide a reliable and efficient communication solution for ad hoc groups.\nFigure 10.19.3.2.3-1: Ad hoc group call setup involving multiple MCPTT systems\n1-3.\tSame as described in subclause 10.19.3.1.3.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server 1 determines the list of participants from the primary MC system and determines the partner MC system to be involved in the ad hoc group call based on the information present in the information element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element carries the criteria, indicator identifying pre-defined criteria, or a combination of both.\nNOTE 1:\tThe content of the Criteria information element, the details of the pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCPTT server determines the list of participants are left to implementation.\n5.\tIf the MCPTT server 1 needs to involve the partner system based on the agreement and based on the criteria for determining the participant list, it sends the ad hoc group call get userlist request to the MCPTT server 2. This request carries the criteria specified in the step 1.\n6.\tMCPTT server 2 evaluates the criteria and determines the participants satisfying the criteria (i.e., MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4) and sends the response containing the list of MCPTT users satisfying the criteria. The partner MCPTT server may apply local policies if any while determining the participants satisfying the criteria.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server 1 compiles the list of participants to be invited for the ad hoc group call including the participants from both primary and partner MC system.\n8a-8b.\tThe MCPTT server 1 sends the ad hoc group call request towards the MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4. While sending the ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients. This request carries the pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCPTT server 1 considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server 1 sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT client 2. While sending the ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients.

The MCPTT server 1 more than once during the call may send this notification to the initiating MCPTT user whenever an MCPTT user joins or leaves the MCPTT ad hoc group call. The authorized users (not shown in figure), who are configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc group call, are notified to receive the MCPTT IDs of the MCPTT users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call, when the MCPTT users joins late or leave the MCPTT ad hoc group call.\n16.\tThe MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4 establish media plane and floor control resources.\nNOTE 2:\tThe ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCPTT server 1 of primary MC system and MCPTT client 3/MCPTT client 4 will always traversal through the MCPTT server 2.\nFigure 10.19.3.2.4-1 below illustrates the MCPTT server modifying the ad hoc group call participants procedure involving multiple MCPTT systems.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group call.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server 1 of the primary and MCPTT server 2 of the partner MCPTT systems determined the participants for the ad hoc group call based on the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1 while initiating the ad hoc group call.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server 1 of the primary and MCPTT server 2 of the partner MCPTT systems continuously evaluates the criteria to monitor the list of users who meets or not meets the criteria for participating in the on-going ad hoc group call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server 1 of the primary MCPTT system detects that the MCPTT client 3 meets the criteria and MCPTT client 2 stops to meet the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server 2 of the partner MCPTT system detects that the MCPTT client 5 meets the criteria and MCPTT client 4 stops to meet the criteria specified by the MCPTT client 1.\n\n\nFigure 10.19.3.2.4-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCPTT server\n1.\tThe ad hoc group call is established and on-going with the participants MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, and MCPTT client 4.

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCPTT UE, MCPTT group, MCPTT user and MCPTT service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MCPTT UE, MCPTT group, MCPTT user and MCPTT service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] or 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] or the corresponding subclause from the present document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MCPTT UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\n",
