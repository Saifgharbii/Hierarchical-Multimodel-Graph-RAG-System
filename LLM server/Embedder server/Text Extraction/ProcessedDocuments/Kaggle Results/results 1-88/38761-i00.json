                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "This clause includes analysis and experimental measurement results of the impact of noise in MPAC on FR1 MIMO OTA performance.\nDuring Rel-18, several companies studied the impact of noise in MPAC on FR1 MIMO OTA performance, conducted experiments, and obtained similar observations. It was found that by adding suitable attenuators after the amplifiers in MPAC system, the impact of noise can be eliminated and the MIMO OTA measurement results can be corrected, as shown in Figure 7.2-1.\nFigure 7.2-1 illustrates the measurement setup for correcting FR1 MIMO OTA test results with MPAC. The setup includes a transmitter (TX) and a receiver (RX) with multiple antennas, as well as a measurement antenna (MPAC) for accurate signal reception. The FR1 stands for Frequency Division Duplexing, a technique used in 4G and 5G networks for efficient data transmission. The MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology enhances signal quality by transmitting and receiving data through multiple antennas at the same time. The MPAC is crucial for precise signal reception, ensuring that the test results are accurate and reliable. The setup demonstrates the importance of proper measurement techniques in evaluating the performance of FR1 MIMO systems.\nFigure 7.2-1: Measurement setup for correcting FR1 MIMO OTA test results with MPAC\nThe measurement results (12 orientations average in FS DMP mode) at bands n28 (780.5MHz) and n41 (2593MHz) obtained by Lab 1 are show in Figure 7.2-2. The same DUT were measured with different attenuation values. It can be observed that, as the attenuation value increases, the measurement results first get better and then become stable. At the lower frequency, the effect of the attenuation value is more obvious, and it requires a lager attenuation to make the measurement results stable. The reason is that at lower frequency, the path loss from the amplifier output to the chamber centre is smaller, and when the amplifier noise arrives at the chamber centre, it has higher power than that at higher frequency.\nAdding attenuators after the amplifiers can reduce the noise and make it neglectable for FR1 MIMO OTA testing. A suitable attenuation value can be selected, e.g., for band n28, the measurement results with 20dB-attenuation and 30dB-attenuation are almost the same, but the measurement result with 10dB-attenuation is worse, which means 20dB-attenuation is enough for band n28 in Lab 1’s MPAC system.\nThe given telecommunication figure illustrates two distinct frequency bands, n28 and n41, which are part of the 5G spectrum. Band n28 operates at a frequency of 780.5MHz, while band n41 operates at a higher frequency of 2593MHz. The figure provides a visual representation of how these bands are utilized in 5G networks, highlighting their unique characteristics and how they contribute to the overall performance and efficiency of the system. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the complex interplay between different frequency bands in 5G technology.

The graph displays the relationship between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of antennas (M) used in the MIMO system. The results show that as the number of antennas increases, the SNR also increases, indicating improved performance. The figure also highlights the impact of different attenuation values on the system's ability to maintain a high SNR, with lower attenuation values generally resulting in better performance. The data presented in the figure is crucial for optimizing MIMO systems and understanding the trade-offs between system complexity and performance.\nFigure 7.2-3: Measured MIMO OTA performance at band n28 (780.5MHz)  with different attenuation values (in Lab 2)\nFigure 7.2-4 illustrates the measured performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) over-the-air (OTA) testing at band n28 (780.5MHz) with varying attenuation values in a laboratory setting.

Considering the test burden and urgent timeline, RAN4 decided to select three smartphones (named as PADs, Performance Alignment Devices) as reference DUTs, and select two bands, n41 and n78, to perform FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment activity for frequencies bands > 1GHz.\nThere are 6 test labs participated in the lab alignment campaign, the reference value of each PAD at each band is derived based on linear average (with dBm) of PAD measurement results submitted by all labs. The summary of the lab alignment results is shown in Table 7.3.2-1 and Figure 7.3.2-1. The TRMS offset between each measurement result and reference value of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment is shown in Table 7.3.2-2 and Figure 7.3.2-1.\nTable 7.3.2-1: Summary of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment results for bands > 1GHz\n\nTable 7.3.2-2: FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment outcome - TRMS offset (for bands > 1GHz)\n\nFigure 7.3.2-1 presents the measurement results of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment for bands greater than 1GHz. The graph displays the performance of various antenna configurations, with the x-axis representing frequency bands and the y-axis indicating the gain in decibels (dB). The results show that the 8x8 MIMO configuration achieves the highest gain across all tested bands, followed by the 4x4 and 2x2 configurations. The data points are plotted with error bars, indicating the variability in the measurements. The figure highlights the importance of proper antenna alignment and configuration for maximizing signal strength and reducing interference in millimeter-wave communications.\nFigure 7.3.2-1: Measurement results of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment for bands > 1GHz\nFigure 7.3.2-2 illustrates the deviation between each measurement result and the reference value of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment for bands greater than 1GHz. The figure shows the alignment of the antenna elements in a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) over-the-air (OTA) laboratory setup. The deviation is measured in decibels (dB) and represents the difference between the actual and expected performance of the system. The figure highlights the importance of precise alignment in achieving optimal performance in the FR1 band, which is crucial for 5G technology.\nFigure 7.3.2-2: Deviation between each measurement result and reference value of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment for bands > 1GHz\n",
