                            "text_content": "This clause describes, in general terms, how to utilize an irregular Channel Bandwidth by deploying the “larger channel Bandwidth” method.\nThe premise idea is that the system is configured with the larger channel bandwidth, as indicated in the broadcast System Information (SIB1) as described in 6.1.2.1, or UE is reconfigured to the larger channel bandwidth in connected mode than SIB1 as described in 6.1.2.2, but the actual number of scheduled RBs is restricted so that it matches actual spectrum allocation ensuring sufficiently large guard bands.\n\nFigure 6.1.1 -1 illustrates the utilization of the next larger channel bandwidth, specifically for an example of 7 MHz. The figure demonstrates the increased capacity and efficiency that can be achieved by utilizing a wider channel width. The visual representation shows how the signal strength and coverage are positively impacted by the larger bandwidth, allowing for better connectivity and reduced interference. The figure highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate channel width to optimize network performance.\nFigure 6.1.1-1: Using the next larger channel bandwidth (example for 7MHz).\nNOTE:\tIt should be checked further whether it is possible to configure the next larger channel so that it goes over the band edge and which implications it has.\nNOTE:\tThe UE UL channel bandwidth is assumed to be the next-smaller regular channel bandwidth (in MHz) in this study.\nOne of the first aspects for this approach is the size of guard bands and the anticipated number of schedulable RBs. For the standard channel bandwidths, both values are captured in the corresponding specification to avoid any misinterpretation on how many RBs can be configured and scheduled. Following the same principle for every irregular channel bandwidth would be feasible, but would create the same amount of technical specification work as if the corresponding irregular channel bandwidth were explicitly added to the specifications. Thus, the number of \"available\" RBs can be calculated based on certain assumptions.\nThe maximum number of \"available\" or \"schedulable\" RBs for a particular irregular channel bandwidth can be calculated based on the assumption of using larger guard bands from a larger channel bandwidth. As an example, while considering the 7MHz channel bandwidth, the assumption is to consider next larger 10MHz channel guard bands at both ends, from which number of available RBs can be calculated.\nNOTE:\tSince a UE will be configured with the channel bandwidth, which is larger than the actual allocation, and it is not expected to provide the usual stop-band attenuation at the edges of the irregular channel bandwidth, it is necessary to verify the level of potential degradation of ACS/blocking. Sub-clause 6.1.3 provides further information on UE filters and potential performance.\nNOTE:\tSimilarly, the gNB operating with wider channel filters cannot be expected to provide stop-band attenuation at the edges of the irregular channel bandwidth to guarantee the co-existence. It is assumed that the gNB channel filters are implemented such that regulatory unwanted emissions requirements are met outside any operator spectrum block of irregular bandwidth (this is a common case also in existing deployments).\nTable 6.1.1-1 below presents example maximum number of available RBs for different irregular channel bandwidths considered in this study item.\nNOTE:\tNumber of available RBs and spectral utilisation are taken from R4-2112365. The gNB transmitter filter assumption used to derive the RB numbers is FFS.\nTable 6.1.1-1: Exemplary number of RBs based on the next larger channel guard bands (15kHz SCS).\n\nTable 6.1.1-2 below presents similar calculations for 30kHz SCS, from which one can see that combination of 30kHz SCS and the next larger channel is not generally a good approach for small channel bandwidths. The main reason is that 30kHz SCS has much larger guard bands, which immediately impacts number of available RBs. As a small summary, assuming using guard band from the next larger channel the resulting spectrum Utilization would range from 87 to 92.8% for an SCS of 15kHz and 72 to 88.6% for an SCS of 30kHz.\nNOTE:\tNumber of available RBs and spectral utilisation are taken from R4-2112365. The gNB transmitter filter assumption used to derive the RB numbers is FFS.\nTable 6.1.1-2: Exemplary number of RBs based on the next larger channel guard bands (30kHz SCS).\n\n",

                            "text_content": "In this section we provide further signaling details on how to support irregular channels in the DL.  Two signaling methods are described.  In 6.1.2.1 the next larger or next-after-next CBW is used for an FDD case with a 7 MHz allocation as an example.  The use of the method for a TDD case with a larger irregular block size is also illustrated.  In 6.1.2.2, the next smaller CBW is used during initial access, and then once RRC connection is established, the next larger CBW is used.\nThe gNB broadcasts the DL carrier bandwidth and the bandwidth of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in SIB1. For the 7MHz allocation, SIB1 can indicate DL next larger standard channel bandwidth, i.e. 10 MHz, and that the initial DL BWP can be set to 5 MHz:\n-\tSIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL-> scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 52 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n-\tSIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs\nOnce the UE established the RRC connection, the gNB can account for the UE capabilities and configure the UE accordingly. At this point the gNB can configure the UE with the larger channel bandwidth (that used by the UE for initial access is not known to the gNB) and with an additional BWP with a bandwidth that differs from the bandwidth of BWP#0. gNB may configure a larger bandwidth part that will cover the whole 7MHz allocation.\n-\tServingCellConfig-> downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List-> carrierBandwidth = 52 PRBs, subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n-\tServingCellConfig-> downlinkBWP-ToAddModList-> bwp-Common-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 35 PRBs\nwith the BWP size taken from Table 6.1.1-1. The PRBs within this BWP can be scheduled. the remaining PRBs in the downlink channel bandwidth are blanked. Alternatively, the BWP size is set to 52 PRB with 35 PRBs scheduled.\nNOTE:\tBWPs of sizes different from the already defined channel bandwidths are not currently tested within the RAN4 defined requirements. As such, UE behaviour under such configuration is not verified by RAN4 requirements. Furthermore, the above configuration does not consider the PRB grid alignment between SIB1 channel bandwidth and UE configured channel bandwidth based on the 100 kHz channel raster.\nFor the UL the UE is configured with a UE channel bandwidth smaller than the irregular block or equal to the UL BWP#0 size such that this is the only possible channel bandwidth and location during initial access. For uplinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List and scs-SpecificCarrierList symmetric operation bands with fixed duplex distance and asymmetric UL/DL channel bandwidth is band specific aspect which is defined in TS 38.101-1 and TS 38.101-2. Bands which utilize the wider channel bandwidth approach for the irregular bandwidths may need to be adopted for this aspect.\nAnother example of interest to some operators is 5 MHz at the bottom of  n12 being shared with 6 MHz at the bottom of n85. The details can be found in Annex A.\nWe begin by listing the prerequisites and assumptions for the method of using a larger channel bandwidth as described in this subclause to verify that these are consistent with existing specifications and features.\nThere is one carrier of carrier bandwidth  for subcarrier spacing configuration m per serving cell and transmission direction (UL or DL), with  as defined in [38.211]. The carrier bandwidth  is indicated in SIB1 by the carrierBandwidth for subcarrier spacing configuration m in the scs-SpecificCarrierList and is thus cell specific. Furthermore\n-\tthe carrier bandwidth  is the BS transmission bandwidth configuration for subcarrier spacing configuration m (not necessarily the same as a BS maximum transmission configuration for a channel bandwidth specified in 38.104)\n-\tthe gNB configures all UEs in a cell with an initial BWP (denoted BWP#0) and additional BWPs contained within the said carrier bandwidth indicated in SIB1 for the DL and UL\n-\tthe fields downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List and uplinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List in dedicated signalling are only used for the purpose of configuring the UE with a size and location of a UE regular channel bandwidth in MHz to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements consistent with the clarification of the use of UE dedicated channel bandwidths (MHz) agreed in [5].\nThe UE channel bandwidth must be located within the BS channel bandwidth as per the existing clause 5.3.1 or 38.104,\n-\tThe BS channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or downlink at the Base Station. Different UE channel bandwidths may be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from UEs connected to the BS. The placement of the UE channel bandwidth is flexible but can only be completely within the BS channel bandwidth.\nand its corresponding maximum bandwidth configuration must fall within the within the BS transmission bandwidth configuration of the BS channel bandwidth as per clause 5.3.4 of 38.104\n-\tFor each numerology, all UE transmission bandwidth configurations indicated to UEs served by the BS by higher layer parameter carrierBandwidth defined in TS 38.331 [11] shall fall within the BS transmission bandwidth configuration.\nFor irregular bandwidths implemented with larger bandwidths we assume that similar rules apply:\n-\tthe transmission bandwidth configuration (PRB) corresponding to the irregular bandwidth is within the carrier bandwidths  of the DL and UL carriers indicated to the UE by SIB1, that is, the BS transmission bandwidth configuration of the BS DL that also contain blanked PRBs if larger than the irregular block size\n-\tthe BS does not configure a UE with any dedicated channel bandwidth (MHz) outside the carrier resource grid indicated in SIB1.\n-\tthe BS channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or downlink as specified in 38.104.\nThe UE need not be aware of the actual BS channel bandwidth, the carrier location and bandwidth are indicated to the UE in SIB1:\n-\tFrom a UE perspective, the UE is configured with one or more BWP / carriers, each with its own UE channel bandwidth. The UE does not need to be aware of the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS allocates bandwidth to different UEs.\nThe channel raster defines a subset of RF reference frequencies that can be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and downlink. The mapping between the channel raster and the corresponding resource element within a resource grid of a carrier within the RF channel is specified in the same way in 38.104 and 38.101-1:\n-\tThe mapping between the RF reference frequency on the channel raster and the corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and can be used to identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on the total number of RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to both UL and DL. The mapping must apply to at least one numerology supported by the BS.\nTable 5.4.2.2-1: Channel Raster to Resource Element Mapping\n\nk,  and   NRB are as defined in TS 38.211 […]\nWe assume that the corresponding notions in 38.211 are NRB =  and that is relative to a BWP starting at the start of the carrier resource grid indicated by the common resource block,  =, is thus the index of the centre PRB within the resource grid of a numerology.\nFor the configuration examples below, we make the assumption that the NRB can only take values corresponding to the maximum transmission bandwidth configurations corresponding to channel bandwidths in the respective conformance specifications for the BS and the UE. For an operating band with a 100kHz channel raster this implies that any regular BS and UE channel bandwidth are always mapped to the channel raster. For operations in the field this also means that a configured UE-specific bandwidth within a larger BS channel bandwidth must be on the channel raster just like the BS channel bandwidth.\nThe assumption that UE performance can only be ensured for RRC configurations according to the conformance test specification implies restrictions on the location and bandwidth of UE specific CHBW in operating bands with a 100 kHz channel raster. If the carrierBandwith of the carrier resource grid is an odd/even number of PRBs and the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration for the UE CHBW is even/odd for SCS = 15k, then the corresponding UE-specific CHBW cannot be located anywhere within a wider BS carrier resource grid: the said transmission bandwidth configuration cannot both be PRB aligned and separated by a multiple of 100 kHz to the center SC of the resource grid on the channel raster for m*180 + 90 = n*100 has no solution for any integers. If, on the other hand, the carrierBandwidth of the carrier resource grid is an odd/even number and the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration for the UE CHBW is odd/even for SCS = 15k, then the UE-specific CHBW can only be located with 5 PRB granularity, solutions to m*180 = n*100.\nNotwithstanding the above  we assume that symmetric UE-specific channel bandwidths (MHz) can be set at the default duplex spacing: the centre frequencies of the UL and DL channel bandwidths as set by the parameters of the downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List and uplinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List should be at default duplex spacing that is, the default TX-RX carrier centre frequency separation as specified in clause 5.4.4 of 38.101-1. We also assume that the BWP#0 are configured such that the UE can locate symmetric CHBW at default duplex spacing during initial access.\nNext, we illustrate the method for a 7 MHz block within an operating band with a 100k channel raster and assuming the restrictions that\n-\tthe SIB1 carrierBandwidth and any UE specific channel bandwidth on the 100k channel raster, carrier bandwidths and maximum transmission bandwidth configurations for UL and DL either all odd or all even, otherwise impossible to put a narrower channel inside a wider BS/cell bandwidth\n-\tthe BS channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or downlink as specified in 38.104. UL/DL carrierBandwidth in SIB1 only to a UE channel bandwidth (Rel-15)\nWe also note that these restrictions may impact the number of PRB that can be scheduled within the irregular spectrum block (the number of blanked PRB within the carrier resource grid) or the actual irregular spectrum block size that can be supported.\nFigure 6.1.2.1.2-1 shows the configuration, the next-after-next larger bandwidth is used in this case such that the resource grid size of this and the smaller bandwidth used for the UL are both an odd number of PRBs. The size of the BWP#0 is 25 PRB in both the UL and DL, located at duplex spacing such that a UE only capable at locating its CHBW at the 100k channel raster can attach. UEs supporting the asymmetric channel bandwidth combination 5 MHz and 15 MHz can utilize the irregular block (the cell bandwidth) and legacy UEs not supporting this bandwidth combination can also be supported in the cell. UEs not supporting the 5 MHz channel bandwidth will not attach to the cell thus ensuring that unwanted emissions requirements in the UL are met by all capable UEs.\nFigure 6.1.2.1.2-1 illustrates a 7 MHz irregular block within an FDD band, showcasing the frequency division duplex (FDD) spectrum allocation for telecommunication services. The figure displays the two distinct frequency bands used in FDD systems, where the uplink and downlink transmissions occur simultaneously but on different frequencies. The irregular block represents the non-uniform allocation of spectrum, which can impact the efficiency of data transmission and reception. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient spectrum management in FDD systems to ensure optimal performance and coverage.\nFigure 6.1.2.1.2-1: a 7 MHz irregular block within an FDD band.\nThe SIB1 procedure for initial attach is separate for the UL and DL. In case some UE implementations do not allow different carrier grid for the UL and DL (while still corresponding to UE CHBWs) then the next-after-next larger BW and PRB blanking can be used both in the UL and DL. The downside of this arrangement is that unwanted emissions are not ensure in case the UE uses a bandwidth wider than the BWP#0 (25 PRB) during initial access. The Point A of the UL and DL can be located with 5 kHz granularity.\nThe arrangement in Figure 6.1.2.1.2-1 would not support the case of an irregular block 817-824/862-869 MHz at the lower part of n26. However, the DL carrier grid corresponding to the 15 MHz CHBW can be shifted upwards by n*900 MHz (5 PRB) such that the 15 MHz CHBW is within the band range (above 814 MHz) thus increasing the BS duplex spacing between the UL and DL carriers while maintaining PRB alignment and the default duplex spacing for the 2 x 5 MHz UE-specific bandwidths and the BWP#0. The default duplex spacing is not specified for the BS (cell) bandwidth and the SIB1 procedure for initial attach is separate for the UL and DL.\nThe methods only require one specification change: the UE must support the asymmetric channel bandwidth pair 5/10 MHz or 5/15 MHz for Band n26. Regular CHBW bandwidths are used for UE conformance tests, while the BS must meet the unwanted emissions limits and other regulatory requirements also for the irregular spectrum block.\nThe method can readily be applied to the TDD case. Most TDD bands have an SCS-based raster rather than a 100k raster for alignment with LTE and therefore not subject to any potential restrictions that UE-specific CHBW cannot be configured with PRB granularity within a carrier resource grid. However, TDD is subject to restrictions on the center frequency of BWPs and the location of the Point A. Asymmetric bandwidths are also supported for TDD in existing specification with restrictions.\nFor the TDD case and bands we make the following additional assumptions:\n-\tthe carrier resource grids indicated in SIB1 for the UL and DL, the BWPs configured and UE-specific CHBW are all PRB aligned and use the same center frequency\n-\tthe carrier bandwidths for UL and DL (PRB) advertised in SIB1 are either both even or odd, the same applies for the transmission bandwidth configuration of the UE-specific CHBW are both either even or oddfor PRB alignment\n-\tthe UE dedicated regular channel bandwidths (MHz) with their corresponding maximum transmission bandwidth configurations (including the larger) are located within the DL and UL carrier bandwidths that may also include blanked PRBs\nThis would also ensure that the UE-specific CHBW meet the existing conditions for asymmetric bandwidths (Rel-16):\n-\tboth center frequency and BWP-ID shall match between DL and UL carriers as defined in 38.331\n-\tin a case a UE is configured with a full width of BWP within both UL/ DL channels, the center frequency of UL/ DL channels shall be same\n-\ta position of Point A is common between UL and DL carriers as defined in 38.331\nFigure 6.1.2.1.3-1 shows an example of a 55 MHz spectrum block with DL and UL carrier grids of different sizes for SCS = 30k, about 145 PRBs used (not blanked) in the DL. The DL carrier resource grid size of mPRB = 189 PRB corresponds to the next-after-next larger DL bandwidth of 70 MHz, while the UL carrier bandwidth indicated in SIB1 is mPRB - 2u = 133 PRB corresponds to the next smaller bandwidth of 50 MHz with 2u the symmetric DL extension (both the UL and DL carrier grids are thus either odd or even sized) also covering blanked PRB. The bandwidth of BWP#0 is equal for the DL and UL and sized 133 PRBs or smaller. Thus legacy UEs only supporting symmetric CHBW can also attach to the cell.\n\nFigure 6.1.2.1.3-1: support of a 55 MHz irregular channel block for TDD.\nIt is recognised that the restrictions above can imply limitations on the transmission bandwidth configuration of an irregular block (PRBs not blanked) or the irregular spectrum block size supported. However, it suffices that UEs support asymmetric bandwidths for the TDD band, a 50/70 MHz combination for the case above.\nThe method above also works for TDD bands with a 100k channel raster. The case of an irregular spectrum block at the band edge is described in section 6.1.2.4.\nThe gNB broadcasts the DL carrier bandwidth and the bandwidth of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in SIB1. For the 7MHz allocation, SIB1 can indicate DL next smaller standard channel bandwidth, i.e., 5 MHz, and that the initial DL BWP can be set to 25PRBs:\n-\tSIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL-> scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 25 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n-\tSIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs\nOnce the UE established the RRC connection, the gNB can account for the UE capabilities and re-configure the UE accordingly. At this point the gNB will override the carrier bandwidth value that the UE obtained from SIB1 and configure a dedicated BWP with a bandwidth that differs from the bandwidth of BWP#0. For the 7MHz allocation, gNB will override the SIB1 channel bandwidth by 10MHz and configure a larger BWP that will cover the whole 7MHz irregular channel.\n-\tServingCellConfig-> downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List-> carrierBandwidth = 52 PRBs, subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n-\tServingCellConfig-> downlinkBWP-ToAddModList-> bwp-Common-> genericParameters->locationAndBandwidth = 35 PRBs\nWhile not ruled out by the RRC specification, configuration of a UE-specific CHBW wider than the carrier bandwidth indicated by SIB1 and BWPs wider than this resource grid require further consideration and may be subject to UE capability.\nIt should be noted that BWPs of sizes different from the already defined channel bandwidths are not currently tested within the RAN4 defined requirements. As such, UE behaviour under such configuration is not verified by RAN4 requirements.\nThe above configuration doesn’t consider the PRB grid alignment between SIB1 channel bandwidth and UE configured channel bandwidth based on the 100 kHz channel raster.\nThe network only configures channel bandwidth according to UE capabilities. RAN4 requirements do not cover the case when a UE is configured with a channel that is not contained within a specified band.  Thus, if the network were to configure the UE channel bandwidth beyond the band edge, then the UE behavior would be unknown.\nHowever, one approach to avoid the unexpected UE behavior is for the NW to ensure that the UE CBW filter will not exceed the NR band edges.  This can be achieved as long as the wider CBW is not wider than the NR band. The NW can control the UE CBW filter location near band edges by setting the CRB0 location (within RIV locationAndBandwidth) and carrierBandwidth.  Then the NW can set BWP to utilize the RBs aligned to the left or right edge of the UE carrier bandwidth using , etc.  In this manner there is no need or the NW to schedule the UE CBW filter outside the NR band edge, potentially leading to unknown UE behaviour.  Further channel filter configuration examples can be seen in Section 6.1.3 which show how the NW can avoid setting the UE CBW filter outside the band edge.\nFor the FDD case with a 7 MHz irregular block at the band edge, the arrangement in Figure 6.1.2.1.2-1 can be modified by shifting the DL carrier grid corresponding to the 15 MHz CHBW upwards by n*900 MHz (5 PRB) as shown in Figure 6.1.2.3-1 such that the 15 MHz CHBW is within the band range thus increasing the BS duplex spacing between the UL and DL carriers while maintaining PRB alignment and the default duplex spacing for the 2 x 5 MHz UE-specific bandwidths and the BWP#0. The default duplex spacing is not specified for the BS (cell) bandwidth and the SIB1 procedure for initial attach is separate for the UL and DL.\n\nFigure 6.1.2.3-1 illustrates the frequency division duplex (FDD) case with an irregular spectrum block positioned at the band edge. The figure showcases the spectrum allocation, with the lower frequency band used for uplink transmissions and the higher frequency band for downlink transmissions. The irregular spectrum block is depicted as a shaded area, indicating a non-standard allocation that may affect the efficiency of the network. The figure also highlights the coexistence of different frequency bands, which requires careful management to prevent interference and ensure optimal performance.\nFigure 6.1.2.3-1: the FDD case with the irregular spectrum block at the band edge.\nFor the TDD case illustrated in Figure 6.1.2.1.3-2 with a 55 MHz irregular block at the band edge, a common center frequency for all CHBW and BWP can be maintained but with the bandwidths adjusted to optimize the transmission bandwidth configuration of the irregular block (PRBs not blanked) as shown in Figure 6.1.2.3-2. The additional BWP#1 configured for UEs supporting asymmetric bandwidth and the irregular channel bandwidth is also centred with the PRBs at the upper edge blanked. Legacy UEs are configured with the BWP#0 or any other BWP within the 40 MHz block, each additional BWP with common center frequency.\nFigure 6.1.2.3-2 illustrates a TDD (Time Division Duplex) scenario with an irregular spectrum block situated at the band edge. The figure showcases the allocation of frequency resources, with the irregular block interrupting the otherwise uniform spectrum distribution. This configuration is crucial for managing spectrum efficiency and accommodating varying traffic demands. The figure also highlights the potential challenges in coordinating between the control and data channels, as well as the need for adaptive modulation and coding schemes to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 6.1.2.3-2: the TDD case with the irregular spectrum block at the band edge.\n\nThe possibility of configuring a UE with a channel that is not fully contained within the operating band supported by the UE was investigated in the context of using some spectrum allocation in n12 and n85(See Annex <A>, the case of n12 and n85).\nRAN1 and RAN2 specifications are written agnostic to the operating bands and channel placements, hence, the current signaling supports configuring a channel that is not fully contained within the operating band. However, RAN1 and RAN2 clarified during the study that such a configuration was never discussed or analyzed, hence, the UE behavior under such a configuration is unknown.\nCurrent RAN4 requirements are defined under the assumption that the BS and UE channel bandwidths are fully contained within one of the operating bands defined in the specifications. For example, Table 5.4.2.3-1 which defines the channel raster for each band contains NOTE 1 which states that “The channel numbers that designate carrier frequencies so close to the operating band edges that the carrier extends beyond the operating band edge shall not be used.”\nIn order to support such a configuration, at least a new UE capability would be needed. Also, in order to ensure that the UEs still meet the necessary requirements (including regulatory) the network would have to limit the RBs used by the UE to those that are confined within the operating band supported by the UE(see also Section 6.1.2.3). The note pointed out in the paragraph above would also have to be updated and any impact to legacy UEs should be avoided.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "A typical UE architecture utilises a number of filters of two major types – analogue and digital – and it is generally up to the UE implementation how they are combined. Nevertheless, it is often the case that a UE uses first the wideband analogue filter which typically covers a whole band. In addition to that, a UE may use another NR channel bandwidth specific analogue filter, premise function on which is to filter our non-adjacent blockers. However, since even the NR channel bandwidth specific analogue filter cannot ensure \"brick-wall\" like filtering, a UE also applies digital filter after ADC to eliminate adjacent interferer. Depending on the UE implementation, the digital filter is a combination of the hardware and software components that allow the UE to apply the corresponding filter coefficients to support a wide range of standard channels, e.g. from 5MHz to 100MHz in case of FR1.\nAs an example, consider Figure 6.1.3-1. In this example, RBs are scheduled close to the NR band edge.  The potential adjacent interferer below the band edge will be removed by the CBW filter with no degradation of ACS at the lower side of the irregular BW since the filters have the same capability as the regular CBW operation.\nFigure 6.1.3-1 illustrates an example of a network utilizing the lower Radio Frequency Bands (RBs) near the Non-Regulated Band (NR) band edge with Bandwidth Partitions (BWP). The figure depicts the allocation of RBs in the NR band, highlighting the efficient use of spectrum resources. The diagram showcases the division of RBs into smaller units, allowing for better management and utilization of the available spectrum. This approach enables the network to provide enhanced services while maintaining a balance between capacity and efficiency.\nFigure 6.1.3-1: Example of the NW utilizing the lower RBs near the NR band edge with BWP\nHowever, for the scenario in the Figure 6.1.3-2 the wider channel filter cannot protect against adjacent interferer(s) when the irregular spectrum block is narrower than the channel filter and/or there are adjacent interferers on both sides.\nNOTE: for the text above multi-operator scenario can be considered further in this example.\nCurrent specifications do not define how a UE configures its digital filter within the configured channel bandwidth. So, in the provided example below, a UE implementation may configure the digital filter in accordance with the carrier bandwidth \"ignoring\" the actual smaller bandwidth part size. This is illustrated further in Figure 6.1.3-2. The wanted signal is smaller than 10MHz, but the UE filter is always set to 10MHz as signalled by the network. As can be seen, if there is an adjacent interferer, then it can \"leak\" into the wanted signal region.\nFigure 6.1.3-2 illustrates the potential scenarios for a 10MHz channel filter, showcasing various configurations that can be applied to optimize signal reception. The figure presents three distinct cases, each with a unique arrangement of filter elements, which can impact the overall performance of the communication system. The visual representation allows for a clear understanding of how different filter setups can affect signal quality, interference management, and overall system efficiency.   \t\t Figure 6.1.3-2 presents three potential scenarios for a 10MHz channel filter, illustrating various configurations that can be applied to optimize signal reception.

The figure showcases three distinct cases, each with a unique arrangement of filter elements, which can impact the overall performance of the communication system. The visual representation allows for a clear understanding of how different filter setups can affect signal quality, interference management, and overall system efficiency.\nFigure 6.1.3-2: Possible scenarios for the 10MHz channel filter.\nTo estimate anticipated performance described in Figure 6.1.3-2 when a UE configures its digital filter according to the channel bandwidth potentially allowing the adjacent interferer to \"leak\" into the wanted signal area, a series of measurements were conducted using the same testbed and setup as used for the commercial device conformance testing. The adjacent interfering signal is always set in such a way that it is right next to the wanted irregular channel bandwidth signal. Table 6.1.3-1 below summarises adjacent interfering channel parameters used in measurements, where adjacent interferer offset is the offset from the wanted signal center to the adjacent interfering signal center.\nTable 6.1.3-1: Summary of adjacent interfering signal parameters.\n\nThe following common parameters were applied:\n-\tCenter frequency: 1850MHz\n-\tUE channel: 10MHz\n-\tWanted signal level at UE antenna: -82dBm\n-\tAdjacent interferer level at UE antenna: from -120dBm to -50dBm in step of 1dB\n-\tAdjacent interferer: 5MHz, 16QAM, SCS 15kHz (3GPP standard ACS test)\nIntermediate irregular channel bandwidths are considered – from 9MHz to 6MHz – and the adjacent interferer offset is set accordingly. As the main performance indicator, the resulting SNR is estimated over the whole 10MHz region irrespective of the actual irregular channel size. This approach provides the worst-case estimation of the resulting SNR because in the real life a UE will most likely estimate SNR over the configured bandwidth part corresponding to the irregular channel size or its sub-part.\nAs can be seen from Figure 6.1.3-3 below, when the adjacent interferer level is low then the estimated SNR is around 39dB for all irregular channels (if the wanted signal is -82dBm and the adjacent interferer is -120dBm, then the theoretical SNR would be around 38dB, but in our case the adjacent interferer is not even fully inside the wanted signal bandwidth). The 9MHz irregular channel bandwidth has same SNR of 39dB even when the adjacent interferer level is same as the wanted signal. SNR degradation starts at the adjacent interferer level of approximately -72dBm, i.e. 10dB higher than the wanted signal. When the adjacent interferer level is 32dB higher than the wanted signal, i.e. -50dBm, the estimated SNR is around 27dB for the 9MHz irregular channel.\nAs for the opposite extreme case of the 6MHz irregular channel, SNR degradation can be already observed at the adjacent interferer level of around -100dBm, i.e. 18dB lower than the wanted signal. When the adjacent interferer level becomes as high as the wanted signal, the estimated SNR drops down to 27dB. Finally, when the adjacent interferer is 32dB higher than the wanted signal, the SNR becomes -5dB.\nThese results show the relative degradation in SNR that can occur due to adjacent channel interferers leaking through the next larger BW filter, and the actual performance degradation will depend on a particular scenario, especially ACI strength and the UE channel filter overlap with the interfering signal. Typical 3GPP ACS requirements are conducted so that a UE should be able to meet 95% of the target throughput of the reference QPSK level when the adjacent interferer is 32dB higher than the wanted signal (and which corresponds to approximately -1.5dB SNR). Referring to the right-most point on the X-axis of Figure 6.1.3-3, it can be seen that 9MHz and 8MHz irregular channel SNR is above -1.5dB, while the 6MHz channel SNR is clearly below -1.5dB.\nNOTE: \tThe corresponding throughput measurements should be also provided to assess throughput degradation, if any, in the QPSK reference channel.\nFigure 6.1.3-3 illustrates the estimated Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) depending on the adjacent interferer level, which is a crucial factor in determining the quality of communication in telecommunication systems. The graph shows that as the adjacent interferer level increases, the SNR decreases, which can lead to a degradation in the quality of communication. The figure also shows that the SNR is higher when the adjacent interferer level is lower, indicating that it is important to minimize interference in order to maintain high communication quality. The figure provides valuable insights for designing and optimizing telecommunication systems to ensure reliable and high-quality communication.\nFigure 6.1.3-3: Estimated SNR depending on the adjacent interferer level.\nTo further reduce the risk of ACS reduction, as shown in this second example in Figure 6.1.3-2 and Figure 6.1.3-3, it is possible for new UEs to align their digital filter to the actual smaller bandwidth part within the wider analogue CBW filter bandwidth.\nNOTE:\tIt is FFS whether it will require new UE capability and/or configuration signalling for the NW to indicate the adjacent interferer location, left, right of the BWP.\n",

                            "text_content": "One way to utilise the whole chunk of irregular spectrum of a particular size is to combine several overlapping channels of next lower standard channel bandwidth. As an example, Figure 6.2.1.1-1 shows a case when two overlapping 10MHz carriers cover 13MHz channel bandwidth. From an individual UE perspective, each UE is configured with existing immediately lower channel bandwidth following legacy procedures and signalling: one UE can use the first 10MHz carrier, while another UE can use another carrier. In fact, both UEs can use overlapping part of the spectrum provided that the BS takes care that the overlapping region is allocated to one particular carrier at a time. It should be also noted that from the UE perspective, an existing immediately lower channel bandwidth will be always used, either for initial access (as the channel bandwidth advertised by the network) or as a dedicated channel bandwidth configured by RRC. From the network perspective, the BS will/can use the whole irregular channel bandwidth.\nFigure 6.2.1.1 - 1 illustrates the utilization of overlapping carriers in a telecommunication system, specifically focusing on an example with 13MHz. The figure showcases the distribution of carriers in a frequency range, highlighting how they overlap and interact. Key visual elements include the various carriers, their frequencies, and the manner in which they are assigned and utilized. This overlapping of carriers is crucial for efficient spectrum management and maximizing network capacity.\nFigure 6.2.1.1-1: Using overlapping carriers (example for 13MHz).\nIt is worth noting that overall capacity of the cell will be according to the irregular channel bandwidth because the BS can use the full bandwidth. However, since a particular UE will use only one carrier of a smaller bandwidth within the irregular channel bandwidth, the maximum throughput for a single UE will be less than the theoretically possible within the spectrum in case there is only a single UE in the cell. Nevertheless, since there will be multiple UEs in the cell the overall system throughput will not decrease.\nOne of the challenges associated with configuring overlapping carriers for the same frequency allocation is that both carriers should have aligned grid so that the BS can perform same FFT and schedule resources in the overlapping region.\nWhile aligning RB grids is not an issue for bands above 3GHz that have the SCS based raster, it becomes more challenging for the sub-3GHz band that have 100kHz raster. As a result, carriers can be configured on raster points that correspond to the least common multiple of the channel raster and the RB size. As an example, the least common multiple will be 900kHz in case of the 15kHz SCS, which corresponds to 5RBs. It effectively means that overlapping carriers will not be able to address efficiently any irregular spectrum size and in some case maybe will not be applicable at all. Of course one way to improve spectrum utilisation is to allow shifting carriers in multiples of 1RB, but that will require introduction of new raster points, which will not be supported by legacy UEs.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-1 presents an example for the 6MHz channel comprising two 5MHz channels. As can be seen from the figure, centre frequency distance between carriers is 900kHz, which is a multiple of 100kHz channel raster and 180kHz RB size. From an individual UE perspective, it is just a normal 5MHz carrier comprising 25RBs and having the 5MHz channel guard bands. From the BS perspective, it is a 6MHz channel with 30RBs. Figure 6.2.1.2-2 exemplifies how this approach can be used to support the 7MHz irregular channel bandwidth, in which the distance between the carriers is 1800kHz. Finally, Figure 6.2.1.2-3 shows the 11MHz channel that is supported with two 10MHz channels. Referring to Figure 6.2.1.2-1, 6.2.1.2-2 and 6.2.1.2-3, it should be noted that guard bands will not necessarily be symmetrical and the exact guard band size will depend on a particular spectrum allocation, its size, and how the overlapping channels are placed.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-1 provides a detailed overview of overlapping carriers within a 6MHz channel, which includes 5MHz carriers. The figure illustrates the arrangement of these carriers, highlighting the specific frequencies and their interrelation. This information is crucial for understanding the spectrum management and efficient utilization of radio resources in telecommunication systems.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-1: Detailed overview of overlapping carriers (6MHz channel with 5MHz carriers).\nFigure 6.2.1.2-2 provides a detailed overview of overlapping carriers within a 7MHz channel, which includes 5MHz carriers. The figure illustrates the arrangement of these carriers, highlighting the specific frequencies and their interrelation. This information is crucial for understanding the spectrum management and efficient utilization of the available radio frequency resources in telecommunication systems.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-2: Detailed overview of overlapping carriers (7MHz channel with 5MHz carriers).\n\nFigure 6.2.1.2-3: Detailed overview of overlapping carriers (11MHz channel with 10MHz carriers).\nTable 6.2.1.2-1 below summarises potential number of schedulable RBs for a scenario when the next smaller overlapping channels are used. To calculate them, it is assumed that distance between individual carriers is a multiple of 900kHz and that the resulting guard bands must meet at least next smaller channel requirements. So, \"Channel Nrb\", and \"Utilisation\" represent the network view, while from the UE perspective all the parameters are the same as for the next smaller channel.\nTable 6.2.1.2-1: Exemplary number of RBs based on the next smaller overlapping channel (15kHz SCS).\n\nTable 6.2.1.2-2 presents similar calculations for the number of available RBs with overlapping carriers, but for the 30kHz SCS. As can be seen from the table, a solution based on the 30kHz SCS overlapping carriers does not provide a good spectral utilisation for certain non-standard channel bandwidths due to the reason that the \"distance\" between carriers raster points must be a multiple of 1800kHz. Because of that, channel bandwidths such as 7 and 12MHz have more or less good utilisation, whereas 6 and 11MHz do not provide any benefit at all.\nTable 6.2.1.2-2: Exemplary number of RBs based on the next smaller overlapping channel (30kHz SCS).\n\nTo suppport two overlapping carriers, the network can consider using one or two SSBs. To be more precise, since the the SSB bandwidth is 3.6MHz and the CORESET#0 bandwidth is 4.32MHz, a single SSB/CORESET#0 can be placed into a common part between two overlapping channels. However, this approach works only if the overlapping part is at least 4.32MHz, e.g. it is not applicable to irregular channels smaller than 10MHz. So, some irregular channel bandwidth will need two SSB/CORESET#0. In this case, at least for irregular channel bandwidths smaller than 10MHz the network broadcasts two separate SSBs, one for each overlapping regular carrier. If a particular irregular channel bandwidth does not allow for placing two SSBs in the same time slots, then the network will have to ensure that they are \"multiplexed\" accordingly in the time domain.\nNOTE:\tIt may create the challenge of aligning SSBs in the time and frequency domain so that they do not overlap thus complicating the gNB scheduling, i.e. for this approach complexity increases to coordinate the overlapping SSBs for different UEs.\nFrom the RAN2 specifications perspective, a single cell has a single cell-defining SSB, the channel bandwidth configuration broadcast in SIB1, CORESET#0, and the initial BWP. Thus, a single \"common\" SSB for two overlapping channels will effectively define only one of the overlapping channels as perceived by the UE (refer to sub-clause 6.2.1.3 for more information on configuration and signalling aspects with one and two SSBs).\nNOTE:\tIt is up to the network implementation whether to configure two SSBs for overlapping channels or one \"common\" SSB if the overlapping part is large enough (refer to Table 6.2.1.2-3).\n\nTable 6.2.1.2-3: Summary of how many SSB/CORESET#0 needed for different channel bandwidths.\n\nFigure 6.2.1.2-5 shows an example for the 13MHz irregular channel with a single/common SSB configured in the overlapping part of two 10MHz carriers.\n\nFigure 6.2.1.2-4 illustrates the utilization of overlapping carriers with a single overlapping Single Sideband (SSB) (example for 13MHz) in a telecommunication system. The figure showcases the transmission of signals across multiple carriers, with the SSB technique employed to enhance signal quality and reduce interference. The diagram highlights the arrangement of carriers and the SSB process, emphasizing its role in improving communication efficiency and capacity.\nFigure 6.2.1.2-4: Using overlapping carriers with single overlapping SSB (example for 13MHz).\nSince from an individual UE perspective each overlapping carrier is just a legacy channel bandwidth, the existing signalling applies. As an example, for the 7MHz allocation the UE can be configured with the 5MHz channel bandwidth, and the initial bandwidth part can be also 5MHz.\n-\tSIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL-> scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 25 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n-\tSIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs\nIf the network configures two SSBs for an overlapping channel, then from the UE perspective each overlapping channel is perceived as an independent cell and a UE can camp on each cell following the existing cell (re-)selection procedures. If the network configures one \"common\" SSB, then from the UE perspective only one of the overlapping channels is perceived as a cell and some UEs will be re-configured with a dedicated channel bandwidth to another overlapping channel.\nNOTE:\tFrom the signalling perspective, it is possible to override the SIB1 channel bandwidth by the dedicated channel bandwidth signalling in the RRC_CONNECTED state.\nThe UE channel BWs have to be backwards compatible such that this scheme works for existing UEs, hence, they would have to be deployed on the 100kHz raster used in the low FR1 bands. As such, the UE channels have to be deployed at a distance which is a multiple of 900kHz (common denominator between the RB size of 180kHz and 100kHz channel raster granularity).\nThe base station channel encompasses the overlapping UE channels. In the case that the distance between the UE channel centers is an even multiple of 900kHz, the center of the base station channel will also fall on a 100kHz multiple. In the case of an odd 900kHz multiple, the center of the base station transmission bandwidth configuration would fall in the middle of the 900kHz interval between the overlapping UE channel centers. This might require some additional specification work for BS.\n\n",

For the 7MHz allocation, SIB1 would indicate DL standard channel bandwidth (i.e. 5 MHz), the initial DL BWP would be set to 5 MHz to accommodate legacy and new UEs:\n\n- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL-> scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 25 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs\n\nOnce the UE established the RRC connection, the gNB can account for the UE capabilities and re-configure the UE accordingly. At this point the gNB may override the carrier bandwidth value that the UE obtained from SIB1 and configure a dedicated BWP with a bandwidth that differs from the bandwidth of BWP#0. gNB may configure a larger bandwidth part that will cover the whole 7MHz allocation.\n\n- ServingCellConfig-> downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List-> carrierBandwidth = 36 PRBs, subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz\n- ServingCellConfig-> downlinkBWP-ToAddModList-> bwp-Common-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 36 PRBs\nIt should be noted that 36 PRBs do not correspond to any channel bandwidth currently defined in TS 38.101-1.\nIt is possible from signalling point of view to override the SIB1 channel bandwidth by the dedicated channel bandwidth signalling in RRC_CONNECTED if the UE is capable of the dedicated channel bandwidth, and if the network ensures the SIB1 channel bandwidth and dedicated channel bandwidth use the same PRB grid. New capability might be needed to support such configuration [3].\nWith respect to the UE architecture, the following assumptions are made (according to SID objectives):\n-\tNew (dedicated) channel filters (e.g. non-integer-multiples of 5 MHz) are not considered\n-\tUEs not supporting this solution (both legacy and new UEs) should be able to use the next lower supported channel bandwidth in the UL and DL without implications\nTwo different UE architecture scenarios are explained (legacy UEs using next smaller bandwidth in section 6.6.2 and UEs supporting two receive chains for reception described below):\nThis option is for new UEs that contain transceiver architectures and configurations that have flexibility in local oscillator and receive chain assignments. The flexibility in the configuration allows the UEs to configure their receive paths (Antenna to FFT) similarly to non-contiguous carrier aggregation, allowing the two LO and receive chains to down-convert the spectrum of the irregular bandwidth as if it consisted of two separate carriers on the UE side. Based on the channel center of the main RF carrier and the configured irregular bandwidth, the UE would know where to place the center frequency of the additional RF carrier that follows the PRB grid (which overlaps with the main RF carrier and includes the remaining agreed PRBs for the irregular BW). The UE down-converts two different sets of PRBs, with an overlapping segment and may use for irregular bandwidth below 15MHz the next smaller bandwidth channel filtering on both of the receive chains as shown in Figure 6.2.2.3-1 (“DigRF” serves as an example only and corresponds to the interface between RF and baseband chipset). This allows the UE to benefit from channel filtering designed for the specific bandwidth. Using the next smaller bandwidth channel filtering on both of the two carrier parts, the baseband signal processing following the FFTs must be modified such that the signals from these two carrier parts are combined and processed as a single codeword instead of being process separately. Since the LOs on the UE will operate at different frequencies, there will be a phase difference of the two signals contained in the two receive chains for the separate carriers.\nIn order to prevent problems in the channel estimation if there is an averaging or interpolation across reference signals at different subcarriers, the phases of the symbols in the frequency domain from both RF receive chains caused by the UE’s use of separate LOs should be aligned. This can be achieved by a new function comparing the overlapping symbols from both FFT outputs and phase shifting one FFT output accordingly before the FFT outputs are merged.\nFigure 6.2.2.3-1 illustrates the UE architecture for full bandwidth support, highlighting the split by the use of two Local Oscillators (LOs). The figure depicts the various components involved, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), Evolved Packet Core (EPC), and User Equipment (UE). The split by two LOs is crucial for supporting high-frequency bands and ensuring efficient signal processing. The diagram emphasizes the importance of proper synchronization and signal processing techniques to maintain seamless communication and optimal performance.\nFigure 6.2.2.3-1: UE architecture for full BW support showing split by the use of two LOs\nDepending on the receiver architecture and the distribution of the channel filtering between the analogue and the digital domain, it is also possible to A/D convert a frequency range that accommodates the entire irregular BW and to split the signal afterwards by means of NCOs (instead of LOs) into the 2 RF carriers with their individual channel filter positions as shown in Figure 6.2.2.3-2.\nFigure 6.2.2.3-2 illustrates the user equipment (UE) architecture for full bandwidth support, highlighting the split by the use of network coding units (NCOs). The figure depicts the UE as the central node, with multiple input and output interfaces connected to various network elements. These elements include the radio access network (RAN), core network (CN), and transport network. The NCOs are strategically placed to efficiently manage the data flow and ensure seamless communication across the network. The figure emphasizes the importance of NCOs in optimizing network performance and supporting high-speed data transmission.\nFigure 6.2.2.3-2: UE architecture for full BW support showing split by the use of NCOs\n\n",

Such a UE will apply the next smaller bandwidth referring to the channel filtering. It will never receive more than the PRBs defined for the next smaller bandwidth and it follows the conventional way of aligning the center frequency of the channel in both DL and UL. These UEs will camp on the same frequency part of the channel since the SIB1 only has one allocation. In CONNECTED mode, the network can configure UE with the UE specific ServingCellConfig IE which configures the point A reference that may shift the UE to operate either at the lower side or the upper side of the irregular bandwidth.

                            "text_content": "All FR1 low-frequency bands have channel raster in steps of 100kHz defined by RAN WG4 as the global raster (5kHz) x 20. RAN WG2 signalling also uses the global raster of 5kHz in principle not preventing a channel of being on any 5kHz channel raster point. While configuring the NR channel on the 100kHz raster is not a big limitation for standard spectrum blocks, such as 5 or 10MHz, it may result in less efficient spectrum utilisation in certain irregular channels. Furthermore, it might be difficult (and sometimes even impossible) to configure the dedicated UE channel bandwidth so that it is aligned on the 100kHz raster and at the same time is the RB aligned with the SIB1 channel bandwidth if the latter is also on the 100kHz raster.\nOne exemplary benefit of allowing carriers on the non-100kHz raster is presented in Figure x-1 below for the 7MHz irregular channel. If, for the sake of example, we assume overlapping carriers from the network perspective as potential solution, then the first and the second carrier must have offsets in multiple of 900kHz, whereupon 900kHz is the common multiplier between the 100kHz raster and 180kHz RB size. So, for the 7MHz channel we can shift the second carrier by 1800kHz, i.e., 10RBs; but the resulting guard bands will be noticeably larger than the minimum requirements for the 5MHz carrier. If there is a way to put the carrier on the non-100kHz raster, then the overall system capacity can be increased to 36 RBs still ensuring the minimum guard-band requirements of the 5MHz carrier.\n\nFigure 6.7.6.1 illustrates the utilization of overlapping carriers with 100 kHz and non-100 kHz alignment, specifically within a 7 MHz irregular channel. The figure showcases the arrangement of carriers, their respective frequencies, and the non-100 kHz alignment, which is crucial for efficient spectrum management and communication. The overlapping carriers are depicted as horizontal lines, while the non-100 kHz alignment is represented by vertical lines. This visual representation provides a clear understanding of how carriers can be utilized in a spectrum, ensuring optimal communication without interference.\nFigure 6.7.6.1-1: Exemplary usage of overlapping carriers with 100kHz and non-100kHz alignment (7MHz irregular channel).\n\nThus, a potential enhancement is to extend available channel raster points so that the 100kHz raster alignment is not mandated at least for the dedicated UE channel bandwidth. It can be implemented as a common feature of the whole release or as a UE capability. Nevertheless, irrespective how it is introduced, once the network knows the UE capabilities, it can decide whether the dedicated UE channel bandwidth should stay on the 100kHz raster (for legacy devices) or can be re-configured to a non-100kHz raster channel.\nIn the example of Figure x-1, the network can configure two carriers (each with its own SSB, shown at the top and in the middle of Figure x-1) in accordance with the 100kHz requirement and these carriers will serve legacy devices. And since the network is aware of the UE capabilities, it can always consider configuring another overlapping carrier on the non-100kHz raster after the UE completed the attachment procedure through the legacy carrier shown in the middle row of Figure x-1. This way the network can handle both legacy and new devices and it will be the network scheduler responsibility to decide how to schedule resources over three overlapping carriers.\n\nWhen a UE camps on the cell, it reads the corresponding system information to understand the position of the channel, its size, the initial bandwidth part configuration, etc. Once a UE enters the cell, the network has an ability to re-configure the UE whereupon the network can also provide a new channel configuration that will be specific to that UE. While the most common re-configuration case is to configure a UE with the dedicated channel and/or bandwidth part that is within the SIB1 channel bandwidth, there are also use cases when a UE might be configured with the channel size or position of which is outside the SIB1 configuration.  Thus, to enable better utilisation of irregular channels it would be preferrable that UEs can support a re-configuration scenario when the dedicated UE channel is outside the SIB1 boundaries.\n\n",

                    "text_content": "The method of using a larger Channel BW than the licensed BW is based on blanking (not scheduling) PRBs within the larger BW but outside the irregular BW. If applied for the DL only, this method can be supported by specifying an asymmetric UE CHBW bandwidth configuration for band such that its UL CHBW is contained within the irregular UL block and the DL CHBW is larger than the irregular DL block. In this way UE unwanted emission requirement in the UL can be met by means of the regular UE CHBW. The larger DL UE CHBW implies a degraded UE adjacent channel selectivity and blocking performance when the interferer is close to the irregular DL block. However, the method can be supported by using existing UE architectures (since asymmetric bandwidths are supported by the current standard) in combination with new asymmetric CHBW combinations. The method works for both FDD and TDD.\nOverlapping channels from the network perspective can be used to support irregular spectrum allocations. This method can provide the full network capacity improvement in DL and UL to a spectrum utilization ≥90 % of the irregular BW (at 15 kHz SCS). This method can be used with legacy UE, even Rel-15, not requiring any changes at the UE side. Since a UE is configured with standard channel bandwidth, there are no issues with UE performance degradation relative to minimum requirements and all the regulatory requirements can be met as per legacy operation. The ACS and the blocking performance are not affected, hence there will be no impact on the network planning. The gNB has to support the irregular channel BW because from the network perspective RBs are scheduled across the whole spectrum block. That might also require new BS requirements for new irregular channels.  This method provides a fast, generic, safe, and efficient solution for FDD and TDD bands.\n\n",

                    "text_content": "In the USA the lower 700 MHz band is licensed in 6 MHz blocks. The lower 700 MHz A block covers 698-704 MHz UL and 728-734 MHz in the downlink. NR band n12 covered all but the lowest 1 MHz of the A block. NR band n85 covers the entire A Block. Hence, NR band n85 extends 1 MHz lower than NR band n12. Because some devices will support n12 while others will support n85, it would be beneficial if n12 capable UEs could use the 5 MHz at the bottom of n12 downlink while n85 capable UEs are able to use the 6 MHz at the bottom of the n85 downlink.\nFigure 6.1.4-1 illustrates the overlap at the bottom of n12 and n85, depicting how these two network elements intersect and share a common area. This visual representation is essential for network administrators to understand the spatial arrangement of network infrastructure and identify potential issues or areas for optimization. The figure highlights the importance of accurate mapping and planning in network design to ensure efficient resource allocation and minimize potential conflicts or interference between different network components.\nFigure 6.1.4-1: Overlap at the bottom of n12 and n85\n",

The network could configure an n85 cell with a downlink of 729-234 MHz and include n12 in the MultiFrequencyBandListNR in the SIB. Then both n12 capable and n85 capable UEs could access the cell. After the gNB processes the UE capabilities, the network could assign n85 capable UEs a UE-Specific downlink channel bandwidth covering 728-738 MHz. Based on feedback from RAN2 in R4-2200031 signalling supports the configuration of a channel that is larger than the channel bandwidth in the SIB and/or extends beyond the edge of the channel in the SIB as long as it is within the band. However, since this behavior might not be supported by all UEs, new capability signalling may be required to enable the n85 capable UE to indicate that it supports such a configuration. Also, because the uplink configuration would be 5 MHz, the n85 UEs would also need to indicate support to an asymmetric channel bandwidth.\n\n",
