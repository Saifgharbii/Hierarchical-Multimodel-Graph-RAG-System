The figure emphasizes the importance of clear and efficient communication between control elements in ensuring the smooth operation of the system. Key components include the control elements, communication modes, and the notification process itself. The figure serves as a valuable reference for understanding and implementing the selected C2 communication mode notification procedure.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.3-1: Selected C2 Communication Mode Notification procedure\n1.\tThe UAE Server shall send for this purpose an HTTP POST request to the UASS with the request URI set to \"{notificationUri}/inform-selec-c2mode\", where the \"notificationUri\" is set to the value received from the UASS during the C2 Operation Mode Initiation procedure defined in clause 5.2.2.2, and the request body including the SelectedC2CommModeNotif data structure that shall contain:\n-\tthe identifier of the UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) to which the notification is related, within the \"uasId\" attribute; and\n-\tthe primary C2 communication mode selected by the UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) identified by the \"uasId\" attribute, within the \"selPrimaryC2CommMode\" attribute;\nand may also contain:\n-\tthe secondary C2 communication mode selected by the UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) identified by the \"uasId\" attribute, within the \"selSecondaryC2CommMode\" attribute.\n2a.\tUpon success, the UASS shall respond to the UAE Server with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code to acknowledge the reception of the notification.\nIf the UASS is not able to handle the notification request, it may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP \"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point of an alternative UASS where the notification should be sent, as defined in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2].\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP POST response body.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.4-1 depicts a scenario where the UAE Server sends a request to notify a previously subscribed UASS on the targeted C2 communication mode switching for a UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) and may request confirmation from the UASS. See also clause 7.4 of 3GPP°TS°23.255°[6].\nFigure 5.2.2.3.4-1 illustrates the C2 Communication Mode Switching Notification procedure, which involves the transmission of a notification message between the C2 server and the target device. The figure depicts the process in three distinct steps: initiation, execution, and completion. The initiation step shows the C2 server sending a notification request to the target device, while the execution step illustrates the target device acknowledging the request and initiating the mode switching process. Finally, the completion step demonstrates the successful completion of the mode switching, with both the C2 server and target device confirming the change. This figure is crucial for understanding the complex communication protocols involved in controlling and managing communication modes in a network.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.4-1: C2 Communication Mode Switching Notification procedure\n1.\tThe UAE Server shall send for this purpose an HTTP POST request to the UASS with the request URI set to \"{notificationUri}/inform-c2mode-switch\", where the \"notificationUri\" is set to the value received from the UASS during the C2 Operation Mode Initiation procedure defined in clause 5.2.2.2, and the request body including the C2CommModeSwitchNotif data structure that shall contain:\n-\tthe identifier of the UAE Server that is sending the notification and possibly requesting C2 Communication Mode switching confirmation for a UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) from the UASS, within the \"uaeServerId\" attribute;\n-\tthe identifier of the UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) to which the provided C2 Communication Mode switching information is related, within the \"uasId\" attribute; and\n-\tthe targeted C2 Communication Mode switching for the UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C) identified by the \"uasId\" attribute, within the \"c2CommModeSwitchType\" attribute;\nAnd may contain:\n-\tthe C2 Communication Mode switching cause, within the \"switchingCause\" attribute.\n2a.\tUpon success, if the UASS has to confirm (i.e. approve) the C2 Communication Mode switching operation to the UAE Server, the UASS shall respond with an HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the response body including the C2Result data structure which shall contain a feedback from the UASS on whether this C2 Communication Mode switching is confirmed (i.e. approved) or not.\n2b.\tOtherwise, upon success, if the UASS does not have to confirm (i.e. approve) the C2 Communication Mode switching operation to the UAE Server, the UASS shall respond to the UAE Server with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code to acknowledge the reception of the notification.\nIf the UASS is not able to handle the notification request, it may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP \"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point of an alternative UASS where the notification should be sent, as defined in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2].\n2c.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP POST response body.\n",

The figure outlines the process, starting with the network operator defining the policy requirements, followed by the network management system (NMS) generating the policy. The policy is then sent to the network element, which verifies and enforces the policy. The figure emphasizes the importance of real-time policy enforcement to ensure network efficiency and security.\nFigure 5.5.2.2.2-1: Procedure for DAA Policy Creation\n1.\tIn order to request the creation of a DAA Policy, the UASS shall send an HTTP POST request to the UAE Server targeting the \"DAA Policies\" resource, with the request body including the DAAPolReq data structure.\n2a.\tUpon success, the UAE Server shall respond with an HTTP \"201 Created\" status code with the response body containing a representation of the created \"Individual DAA Policy\" resource and potentially additional information within the DAAPolResp data structure.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP POST response body, as specified in clause 6.4.7.\nFigure 5.5.2.2.2-1 depicts a scenario where a UASS sends a request to the UAE Server to update an existing DAA Policy (see also clause 7.7 of 3GPP°TS°23.255°[6]).\nFigure 5.5.2.2.3-1 illustrates the step-by-step procedure for updating the Dynamic Admission Policy (DAA) in a telecommunication network. The figure outlines the process, which begins with the network operator initiating the update request. The request is then forwarded to the Policy Control Function (PCF), which verifies the update's validity. Once approved, the PCF sends the updated policy to the Policy Management Function (PMF). The PMF then disseminates the updated policy to all relevant network elements, ensuring seamless network operation. The figure emphasizes the importance of a well-structured and efficient policy update process in maintaining network performance and security.\nFigure 5.5.2.2.3-1: Procedure for DAA Policy Update\n1.\tIn order to request the update/modification of an existing DAA Policy, the UASS shall send an HTTP PUT/PATCH request to the UAE Server targeting the corresponding \"Individual DAA Policy\" resource, with the request body including the DAAPolicy data structure (in case the HTTP PUT method is used) or the DAAPolicyPatch data structure (in case the HTTP PATCH method is used).\nNOTE:\tAn alternative UASS (i.e. other than the one that requested the creation of the targeted resource) can initiate this request.\nIf the UAE Server is not able to handle the request, it may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP \"Location\" header containing an alternative URI of the resource located in an alternative UAE Server, as defined in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2].\n2a.\tUpon success, the UAE Server shall respond with either:\n-\tan HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the response body containing a representation of the updated/modified \"Individual DAA Policy\" resource and potentially additional information within the DAAPolicy data structure; or\n-\tan HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP PUT/PATCH response body, as specified in clause 6.4.7.\nFigure 5.5.2.2.2-1 depicts a scenario where a UASS sends a request to the UAE Server to delete an existing DAA Policy (see also clause 7.7 of 3GPP°TS°23.255°[6]).\nFigure 5.5.2.2.3-1 illustrates the step-by-step procedure for deleting a DAA policy in a network. The figure outlines the necessary steps, including the involvement of various network entities such as the Policy Manager, Policy Server, and DAA Agent. The process begins with the Policy Manager deleting the policy, which is then propagated to the Policy Server. The Policy Server then updates its database, and finally, the DAA Agent receives the updated information, ensuring a smooth and efficient deletion process. This figure is crucial for network administrators to understand the procedure and maintain the integrity of their policies.\nFigure 5.5.2.2.3-1: Procedure for DAA Policy Deletion\n1.\tIn order to request the deletion of an existing DAA Policy, the UASS shall send an HTTP DELETE request to the UAE Server targeting the corresponding \"Individual DAA Policy\" resource.\nNOTE:\tAn alternative UASS (i.e. other than the one that requested the creation of the targeted resource) can initiate this request.\n2a.\tUpon success, the UAE Server shall respond with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP DELETE response body, as specified in clause 6.4.7.\nThis service operation is used by a UASS to inform about and request the management of the detected DAA related event(s).\nThe following procedures are supported by the \"UAE_DAASupport_InformDAAEvent\" service operation:\n-\tDAA Events Information Request.\nFigure 5.5.2.3.2-1 depicts a scenario where a UASS sends a request to the UAE Server to inform about and request the management of the detected DAA related event(s) (see also clause 7.7 of 3GPP°TS°23.255°[6]).\nFigure 5.5.2.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for requesting information on Device-to-Device (D2D) and Device-to-Network (D2N) events in a network. The figure outlines the steps involved in initiating an event information request, including the use of the Network Information Sub-system (NIS) and the Exchange of Event Information (EXI) protocol. The process is depicted through a series of interactions between the network elements, such as the Network Management Entity (NME), Network Element Manager (NEM), and the Network Element Information Repository (NEIR). The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient event information exchange for network management and troubleshooting, ensuring the smooth operation of D2D and D2N communication.\nFigure 5.5.2.3.2-1: Procedure for DAA Events Information Request\n1.\tIn order to send DAA related event(s) information, the UASS shall send an HTTP POST request (custom operation: \"InformDAAEvents\") to the UAE Server, with the request URI set to \"{apiRoot}/uae-daa/<apiVersion>/inform-events\" and the request body including the InformDAAEventsReq data structure.\nIf the UAE Server is not able to handle the request, it may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP \"Location\" header containing an alternative URI of the resource located in an alternative UAE Server, as defined in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2].\n2a.\tUpon success, the UAE Server shall respond with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP POST response body, as specified in clause 6.4.7.\nThis service operation is used by a UAE Server to notify a previously subscribed UASS either:\n-\ton DAA Policy Configuration Completion Status; or\n-\ton DAA related event(s).\nThe following procedures are supported by the \"UAE_DAASupport_Notify\" service operation:\n-\tDAA Policy Configuration Completion Status Notification.\n-\tDAA Event Notification.\nFigure 5.5.2.4.2-1 depicts a scenario where the UAE Server sends a request to notify a previously subscribed UASS on the status of DAA Policy Configuration (see also clause 7.7 of 3GPP°TS°23.255°[6]).\nFigure 5.5.2.4.2-1 illustrates the completion status notification procedure for Dynamic Admission Control (DAA) policy configuration. The figure depicts the various stages of the process, including policy configuration, request submission, and status update. Key elements include the network element, policy server, and client devices, which interact through the DAA framework. The visual representation emphasizes the efficiency and real-time nature of the DAA policy configuration process.\nFigure 5.5.2.4.2-1: DAA Policy Configuration Completion Status Notification procedure\n1.\tIn order to notify a UASS on the status of DAA Policy Configuration, the UAE Server shall send an HTTP POST request to the UASS with the request URI set to \"{notifUri}/daa-policy\", where the \"notifUri\" is set to the value received from the UASS during the DAA Policy Creation/Update procedure defined in clause 5.5.2.2, and the request body including the DAAPolConfigNotif data structure.\nIf the UASS is not able to handle the notification request, it may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP \"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point of an alternative UASS where the notification should be sent, as defined in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2].\n2a.\tUpon success, the UASS shall respond to the UAE Server with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code to acknowledge the reception of the notification.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP POST response body, as specified in clause 6.4.7.\nFigure 5.5.2.4.3-1 depicts a scenario where the UAE Server sends a request to notify a previously subscribed UASS on DAA related event(s) (see also clause 7.7 of 3GPP°TS°23.255°[6]).\nFigure 5.5.2.4.3-1 illustrates the DAA event notification procedure, which involves the use of a Distributed Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (DAA) to manage access to network resources. The figure outlines the steps for a network element to send an event notification to the DAA, including the event type, the network element identifier, and the event details. The DAA then processes the notification and sends an acknowledgment back to the network element. This procedure ensures that network access events are properly logged and managed, contributing to the overall security and accountability of the network.\nFigure 5.5.2.4.3-1: DAA Event Notification procedure\n1.\tIn order to notify a UASS on the detected DAA event(s), the UAE Server shall send an HTTP POST request to the UASS with the request URI set to \"{notifUri}/daa-events\", where the \"notifUri\" is set to the value received from the UASS during the DAA Policy Creation/Update procedure defined in clause 5.5.2.2, and the request body including the DAAEventsInfo data structure.\nIf the UASS is not able to handle the notification request, it may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP \"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point of an alternative UASS where the notification should be sent, as defined in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2].\n2a.\tUpon success, the UASS shall respond to the UAE Server with either:\n-\tan HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the response body containing updated/additional DAA event(s) related information within the DAAEventsInfo data structure, if the UASS needs to provide information about additional DAA event(s) or updated DAA event(s) related information; or\n-\tan HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, if the UASS does not need to provide any updated/additional DAA event(s) related information.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the HTTP POST response body, as specified in clause 6.4.7.\n",

It is the UAE Server responsibility to check whether the service API consumer (e.g. UASS) is authorized to use an API based on the provided \"token\". Once the UAE Server verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether the UAE Server identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If those checks are passed, the service API consumer (e.g. UASS) has full authority to access any resource or operation provided by the invoked API.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the aforementioned security methods, the UAE Server needs to apply admission control according to access control policies after performing the authorization checks.\n",
