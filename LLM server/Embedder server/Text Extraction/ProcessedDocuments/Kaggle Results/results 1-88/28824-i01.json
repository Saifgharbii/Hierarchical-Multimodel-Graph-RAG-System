                            "text_content": "Exposed MnS represents the MnS that can be exposed by MnS producer to the external MnS consumer. Exposed MnS may rely on a dedicated MnF (e.g. EGMF defined in 3GPP or function defined in other standard like TMF) that manages the exposure aspects.\nNOTE: \tWhether MnS is exposed to external MnS consumer via BSS or via an exposure platform depends on requirements from third parties' applications and/or NSP's policy.\nExposure of management services supports the case that an external MnS consumer which is outside 3GPP management system can indirectly consume management capability offered by MnS producer within 3GPP management system. Even though the exposed MnS complies with the same Technical Specification as an MnS, the actual operational behaviour and managed data may be constrained by the network slice provider.\nNOTE: \tThe exposure of MnS data and MnSs to the external MnS consumer may incur additional charging which needs to studied further by 3GPP SA5 charging group.\nPerform access control including Filtering when external MnS consumer consume MnS from 3GPP management system.\nTo avoid unauthorised management capability consumption, management services should be subject to exposure governance before being exposed to different types of MnS consumers. As introduced in TS 28.533 [11], management capability exposure governance provides exposure governance (i.e. filtering) on basic elements of management function service based interface:\n1)\tManagement service component type A\n2)\tManagement service component type B\n3)\tManagement service component type C\nDefinitions and typical cases of filtering are given in the following subclauses.\nDefinition: The exposure access control on certain information elements (i.e. granular access) of MnS component type A, type B and/or type C according to the consumer's authorization level. For example, the permission of Read, write, the acquisition of notification for certain MnSs.\nTypical case 1: Assuming the management service X is a provisioning MnS with operations createMOI, getMOIAttributes, modifyMOIAttributes and deleteMOI as MnS component type A, the filtering on management service X could be that only a subset of original MnS is exposed to MnS consumer, e.g. only operation getMOIAttributes, is exposed to management service consumer.\nTypical case 2: Assuming the management service Y is a provisioning MnS with NRM MOIs as the component type B, the filtering on management service Y could be that only a subset of original MnS is exposed to MnS consumer, e.g. only part of the attributes of the NRM MOI, is exposed to management service consumer.\nTo implement the filtering on MnS, attribute mnsScope of IOC MnsInfo, see further details in TS 28.622 [17], may be used to provide information about the management scope of a Management Service. The management scope is defined as the set of managed object instances that can be accessed (as filtering) using the Management Service.\nExposure of service data to companies that are external to the operator are regulated by contracts. Different customers may have access to different management capabilities. It may differ on what attributes/policies/intents are allowed to be changed, which value ranges changes are allowed, and which performance metrics are allowed to be exposed.\nThe network slice data with the ServiceProfile is located in the Network Management Layer.\nEven if the external interface always goes via BSS, there are different scenarios for how a customer, e.g. vertical, can influence the ServiceProfile.\nThe capabilities required by a Vertical have to be the same on the interface between NOP Network Management Layer and CSP Service manager. The external interface is external to the administrative domain of the operator, while the internal interface is inside the administrative domain of the operator.\nSee clause 5.4.1 for detailed description of exposure scenarios/use cases via BSS.\nExposure of service data to companies that are external to the operator are regulated by contracts. The exposure usually goes through BSS, as explained in clause 4.1.1.3. However, based on specific contract, the customer may interact with the Operator via OSS. There are different scenarios for how a customer having such contract interacts with Operator for the network slice management capability exposure.\nSee clause 5.5.1 for detailed description of exposure scenarios/use cases via OSS.\n",

The figure depicts the network management entity, which is responsible for managing the network's resources and capabilities. This entity communicates with the network management station, which is the central point of control and coordination. The network management station then interacts with the network management system, which is responsible for managing the network's resources and capabilities.

An exposed MnS consumer is equivalent to an MnS consumer with the difference that it is outside the trust domain of the CSP or NOP. An exposed MnS consumer is owned by an external customer (e.g. vertical such as Industry, Internet Company, etc.) which may take the role of a CSC or NSC. The external customer usually has specific service requirements on a 5G network.\nThe logical entity offering management capability that can be consumed by an Exposed MnS consumer is called Exposed MnS producer. An exposed MnS producer is owned by a service provider which may take the role of a CSP or NSP.\n",

The figure showcases a network with multiple nodes, each represented by a circle, connected by lines that symbolize the transmission of data. The nodes are interconnected, forming a complex network structure. The figure also includes labels for different types of nodes, such as the central node, which is likely the core of the network, and the peripheral nodes, which are responsible for transmitting and receiving data. The lines connecting the nodes represent the data transmission paths, and the thickness of the lines may indicate the bandwidth or capacity of the connection. The figure provides a visual representation of how data flows through the network, highlighting the interconnectedness and complexity of modern telecommunication networks.\nFigure 4.1.3.2-1: Use case No.1: simple case\nIn this use case, Company-V (as the NSC) chooses a product from Company-A product offerings and sends a request to Company-A to order the product which is a network slice via Interface Type-A.\nAs Company-A cannot satisfy Company-V's requirements by itself, it has to count on partners (Company-X and Company-Y), e.g. to provide RAN coverage in their respective countries.\nIn this use case, Interface Type-A, Type-1, Type-2 and Type-X are involved.\nFigure 4.1.3.3 - 1 presents a network diagram illustrating a use case involving partners. The figure shows multiple entities, including a central organization, two partners, and a service provider. The partners are connected through a secure communication channel, facilitated by the service provider.

Depending on whether the NSP employs services from 3rd party CSP's different procedures may apply for the same order. The different procedures applicable to the same order may be invoked asynchronously and treated as independent procedures, however it may not result in loss of traceability between the original order and the orders that are created as result of decomposition. The following procedures have been identified:\n- Procedure invoking internal service order after receiving product order from NSC\n- Procedure invoking external product order after receiving product order from NSC\n- Procedure invoking external service order after receiving product order from NSC\n- Procedure for create product\n- Procedure for consumption of exposed MnS after service order is completed\nThe procedure for invoking a service order internal to the NSP after receiving a product order from an NSC is shown in Figure 4.1.4.2-1. The interface through which the NSC can order a product from the NSP is on BSS level. The steps as shown in Figure 4.1.4.2-1 are described in the subsequent paragraphs.\nFigure 4.1.4.2 - 1: Procedure invoking internal service order after receiving product order from NSC illustrates the internal process of a telecommunication system, specifically the steps taken after receiving a product order from the Network Service Center (NSC). The figure shows a series of interconnected components and their interactions, including the NSC, the Service Order Management System (SOMS), and the Service Activation System (SAS). The figure emphasizes the importance of accurate and efficient communication between these systems to ensure the successful processing of product orders and the activation of services. The visual representation of the process highlights the complexity and coordination required in modern telecommunication networks to deliver seamless service activation and management.\nFigure 4.1.4.2-1: Procedure invoking internal service order after receiving product order from NSC\n1) The NSP receives a product order from the NSC through the interface to BSS. The interface between the NSC and BSS of the NSP is used.\n2) The BSS processes the product order and when applicable converts it to appropriate service order(s) for the OSS Service Management Layer. This is internal to BSS and there are no interface requirements.\n3) The OSS Service Management Layer receives a service order from the BSS. The interface between the BSS of the NSP and the OSS_SML of the NSP is used.\n4) The OSS Service Management Layer processes the service order and when applicable converts it to appropriate request(s) for the OSS Network Management Layer as requests for management and orchestration of resources. This is internal to the OSS Service Management Layer and there are no interface requirements.\n5) The OSS Network Management Layer receives a request from the OSS Service Management Layer. An interface between the OSS Service Management Layer and OSS Network Management Layer may be used.\n6) The OSS Network Management Layer processes the request and when applicable converts it to appropriate request(s) for the network. An interface between the OSS Network Management Layer and Network Layer (not shown) may be used.\n7) The OSS Network Management Layer notifies the OSS Service Management Layer that the resource order(s) have been completed. An interface between the OSS Service Management Layer and the Network Layer may be used.\n8) The OSS Service Management Layer notifies the BSS that the service order has been completed. The interface between the OSS Service Management Layer and the BSS is used.\n9) The BSS notifies the NSC that the product order has been completed. The NSC may start using the services included in the product order. The interface between the NSC and the BSS is used.\nThe procedure for invoking a product order external to the NSP after receiving a product order from an NSC is shown in Figure 4.1.4.3-1. The interface through which the NSC can order a product from the NSP is on BSS level. The steps as shown in Figure 4.1.4.3-1 are described in the subsequent paragraphs.\nFigure 4.1.4.3 - 1: Procedure invoking external product order after receiving product order from NSC illustrates the process of a system initiating an external product order request in response to receiving a product order from the National Single Customer View (NSC). This figure is part of a larger system that involves multiple components and procedures, as depicted in Figure 4.1.4.3 - 2: Procedure invoking external product order after receiving product order from NSC. The figure shows the flow of information and actions taken within the system to fulfill a customer's order, highlighting the importance of coordination and communication between different entities involved in the process.\nFigure 4.1.4.3-1: Procedure invoking external product order after receiving product order from NSC\n1) The NSP receives a product order from the NSC through the interface to BSS. The interface between the NSC and BSS of the NSP is used.\n2) The NSP BSS processes the product order and when applicable converts it to appropriate product order(s) towards a 3rd party CSP BSS. This is internal to BSS and there are no interface requirements.\nNOTE:\t When the BSS_NSP receives a product order, the BSS_NSP splits the product order into service orders. A service order that can be fulfilled by the NSP will be processed by the NSP_OSS_SML (see also Figure 4.1.4.2.1) while a service order that cannot be fulfilled by NSP will be ordered from the CSP through a product order.\n3) The CSP BSS receives a product order from the NSP BSS. The interface between the BSS of the CSP and the BSS of the NSP is used.\n4) The CSP BSS processes the product order and when applicable converts it to appropriate service order(s) for the CSP OSS. This is internal to the BSS and there are no interface requirements.\n5) The CSP OSS receives a service order from the CSP BSS. The interface between the BSS and the OSS both belonging to the CSP is used.\n6) The CSP OSS processes the service order until the service order is completed.\n7) The CSP OSS notifies the CSP BSS that the service order has been completed. The interface between the OSS and the BSS both belonging to the CSP is used.\n8) The CSP BSS notifies the NSP BSS that the product order has been completed. The interface between the BSS of the CSP and the BSS of the NSP is used.\n9) The BSS notifies the NSC that the product order has been completed. The NSC may start using the services included in the product order.\nThe procedure for invoking a service order external to the NSP after receiving a product order from an NSC is shown in Figure 4.1.4.4-1. The interface through which the NSC can order a product from the NSP is on BSS level. The steps as shown in Figure 4.1.4.4-1 are described in the subsequent paragraphs.\nFigure 4.1.4 - 1: Procedure invoking external service order after receiving product order from NSC illustrates the process of invoking an external service order after receiving a product order from the Network Service Center (NSC). The figure shows the interaction between the NSC, the Service Order Management System (SOMS), and the External Service Ordering System (ESOS). The NSC sends a product order to the ESOS, which then triggers a procedure to invoke an external service order. This process ensures that the necessary services are ordered and executed to fulfill the product order, maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of the overall order management system.\nFigure 4.1.4.4-1: Procedure invoking external service order after receiving product order from NSC\n1) The NSP receives a product order from the NSC through the interface to BSS. The interface between the NSC and BSS of the NSP is used.\n2) The NSP BSS processes the product order and when applicable converts it to appropriate service order(s) for the OSS producer. This is internal to BSS producer and there are no interface requirements.\n3) The NSP OSS receives a service order from the NSP BSS. The interface between the OSS and the BSS, both belonging to the same NSP, is used.\n4) The OSS processes the service order and when applicable converts it to appropriate service order(s) for a 3rd party CSP OSS. This is internal to the OSS producer and there are no interface requirements.\n5) The CSP OSS receives a service order from the NSP OSS producer. The interface between the OSS of the CSP and the OSS of the NSP is used.\n6) The CSP OSS processes the service order until the service order is completed. This is internal to the OSS producer and there are no interface requirements.\n7) The CSP OSS notifies the CSP BSS that the service order has been completed. The interface between the OSS and the BSS, both belonging to the same CSP, is used.\n8) The CSP OSS notifies the NSP OSS producer (may occur at the same time as or before step 7) that the service order has been completed. The interface between the OSS of the CSP and the OSS of the NSP is used.\n9) The NSP BSS notifies the NSC that the product order has been completed. The NSC may start using the services included in the product order.\nFigure 4.1.4.5 - 1 presents a procedural flowchart detailing the steps involved in product onboarding. The figure illustrates the process from initial customer inquiry to final product delivery, highlighting key stages such as customer identification, product selection, order processing, and quality assurance. The flowchart emphasizes the importance of clear communication and coordination among different departments to ensure a smooth and efficient onboarding process.\nFigure 4.1.4.5-1: Procedure related to product onboarding\n1)\tOSS_SML obtains 3GPP management services in the network through management service discovery;\n2)\tOSS_SML governs the rules and policies of MnS and configures the available MnS (e.g. exposed MnS) to BSS_NSP. For example, if the RAN NE is dedicated to external customers, the performance monitoring service of a RAN NE should be exposed. Otherwise, it should not be exposed;\n3)\tOptionally, the BSS_NSP may send information to request the list of available services from OSS_SML;\n4)\tOSS_SML provides the list of available services to BSS_NSP;\n5)\tBSS_NSP configures (groups or package the services into a product) the services from OSS_SML such that they can be exposed to NSC;\n6)\tNSC should request the product catalogue from BSS_NSP.\n7)\tBSS_NSP provides product catalogue to NSC.\nThe procedure for consumption of an exposed MnS after the product and service orders are completed is shown in figure 4.1.4.6-1. The MnS is produced by the MnS producer located in the OSS of the NSP.\nAn MnS may already be produced before CAPIF 1 service is requested. The CAPIF 2/2e service is a filtered, enriched and/or converted version of the MnS. The transformation, filtering, enrichment, or conversion of MnS APIs into service APIs is optional. The details of how this transformation, filtering and/or enrichment are to be done are out of scope of SA5.\nNote: There exist initiatives such as CAMARA [21] which are working in this translation.\nFiltering is removing of information elements (attributes and classes), enrichment is adding information elements from other MnSs or other sources outside OAM, and converting is changing information elements through for example combining or mapping information elements. The CAPIF 2/2e service is provided by the API_Provider_domain_function and consumed by the NSC_Application. The API_Provider_domain_function uses the MnS(s) produced to provide the CAPIF 2/2e service.\nFigure 4.1.4.6 illustrates the procedural steps for the consumption of exposed MnS (Manganese Sulfide) after the completion of a service order. The figure outlines the various stages, including the initial exposure of MnS, its subsequent processing, and the final consumption. Key visual elements include the service order, MnS exposure, and consumption stages, emphasizing the importance of proper handling and utilization of MnS in the telecommunication industry.\nFigure 4.1.4.6-1: Procedure for consumption of exposed MnS after service order is completed\nNOTE 1: For simplicity reasons the CAPIF Core function and API Provider domain function defined in TS 23.222 [14] are combined and any communication between them is also not included.\nNOTE 2: The procedure is only applicable to \"Exposure via CAPIF alternative 1\" described in clause 7.9.1.\n1) The CAPIF_Core_function receives an authenticating and authorization request from the NSC_Application based on the identity and other information required for authentication and authorization of the NSC_Application.\n2) The CAPIF_Core_function processes the authentication and authorization request.\n3) The CAPIF_Core_function provides the response with the result of the authentication and authorization to the NSC_Application.\n4) The CAPIF_Core_function receives a request for the discovery of service APIs information.\n5) The CAPIF_Core_function processes the discovery request.\n6) The CAPIF_Core_function provides the appropriate response to the NSC_Application.\n7) The API_Provider_domain_function receives an authentication and authorization request from the NSC_Application based on the identity and other information required for authorization of the NSC_Application.\n8) The API_Provider_domain_function processes the authorization request.\n9) The API_Provider_domain_function provides the response with the result of the authentication and authorization to the NSC_Application.\n10) The API_Provider_domain_function receives a request for the invocation of the service API(s) from the NSC_Application.\n11) The API_Provider_domain_function processes (and optionally may enrich and/or convert) the invocation request.\n12) The MnS_Producers receive requests from the API_Provider_domain_function for MnS.\n13) The MnS_Producers provide the appropriate responses to the API_Provider_domain_function.\n14) The API_Provider_domain_function processes (and optionally may filter, enrich and/or convert) the response from the MnS_Producers.\n15) The API_Provider_domain_function provides the appropriate response to the NSC_Application.\nNOTE 3: \tEach response in the steps does not always need to trigger the next request.\n",

In this regard, different types of NSCs can be found.\n-\tBaseline vertical customer: it corresponds to a NSC which is only interested in monitoring the network slice, to verify it behaves as expected, according to the SLA. This NSC does typically have no telco experience, and is associated to a network slice that is entirely deployed on a PLMN. The capabilities offered to a baseline vertical customer includes the ability for this NSC to receive information on subscribed items, including network slice status (e.g. active, inactive) and subscribed management data (e.g. KPIs, events/logs, trace data, etc.). The profile of this NSC type is a 'passive NSC'.\n-\tAdvanced vertical customer: it corresponds to an NSC which requests (to the NSP) a dedicated network slice for the provision of PNI-NPN services. In this scenario, a portion of the network slice is deployed within the NSC premises (e.g. RAN, UPF) and the other portion (e.g. 5GC control plane functions) is hosted by one or more PLMN nodes. Unlike the baseline vertical customer, this new NSC does typically have (yet limited) telco knowledge, and wants to retain certain control over the allocated network slice. The capabilities offered to an advanced vertical customer might include (i) monitoring capabilities, i.e. the same capabilities offered to a baseline vertical customer and (ii) device configuration capabilities, i.e. provision of parameters for battery, mobility and communication patterns associated to the device, (iii) edge discovery/selection, e.g. in case the vertical wants to deploy workloads on the telco edge cloud.\n-\tHyperscaler: it corresponds to a NSC which requests (to the NSP) a dedicated network slice to provide a service-tailored connectivity pipe to a NSC's customer. With some enterprises (i.e. NSC's customer) starting to migrate workloads towards hyperscaler nodes, it is necessary for the hyperscaler (i.e. NSC) to provide SLA guarantees to these enterprises, especially for critical processes/services. However, the hyperscaler does not have network resources between its cloud nodes and customer premises, and therefore has to ask the mobile network operator (i.e. NSP) to set up a network slice between these endpoints. The capabilities offered to a hyperscaler might include (i) monitoring capabilities, i.e. the same capabilities offered to a baseline vertical customer; (ii) quality on demand, i.e. dynamic QoS and bandwidth management; (iii) policy control.\n-\tMobile (Virtual) Network Operator.\nNOTE 1: \tIn all the above cases, the NSP role is assumed to be played by an MNO.\nNOTE 2: \tThe capabilities mentioned above are neither exhaustive nor accurate, but examples to motivate the need for considering different NSC types.\nThe NSC types within the scope of FS_NSCE should be use case driven.\n",

This new paradigm, referred to Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), enables these 3rd parties (and their applications) to consume exposed telco capabilities, tapping into them to provide enhanced user experiences and contribute to service innovation with new use cases.\nThe development of NaaS requires a collaborative workspace that bring together incumbent telco standards bodies with IT and cloud communities, industry associations and open-source projects. An effective collaboration among organizations needs to be based on a clear demarcation on their scope of work, avoiding that participating organizations run overlapping activities or duplicate efforts; otherwise, NaaS may risk ending up with a fragmented ecosystem. With this goal in mind, GSMA Open Gateway initiative [22] has defined a reference NaaS framework built on three main organizations:\n-\tLinux Foundation's CAMARA: it represents the \"exposure\" doctrine, i.e. how capabilities are exposed for external consumption via 3rd party facing APIs. CAMARA defines these APIs, and is responsible for their hosting and release management. Third-party facing APIs are user-friendly (semantics tailored to the service needs of 3rd parties) and open (following Apache2.0 license).\n-\tGSMA Open Gateway: it represents both the \"technical\" doctrine, i.e. how third-party facing APIs are to be supported by underlying telco capabilities, and \"business\" doctrine, i.e. definition of templates for agreements between operators and 3rd parties, ensuring a consistent commercial framework for exposing services. GSMA conducts the technical work through OPG/OPAG (Operator Platform Group / Operator Platform API Group), and the commercial work through WAS (Wholesale Agreement Services).\n-\tTM Forum: it represents the \"operational\" doctrine, i.e. how to manage capabilities throughout the entire NaaS lifecycle. This includes the registration/onboarding of 3rd parties, service fulfilment (e.g. provisioning, activation and modification), service assurance (e.g. incident management, service status, service performance) and billing.\n",

Service provider A and the provider of PLMN (i.e. associate to exposed MnS provider) are two different parties.\n2. The service provider A of the local hosting network can have an offer from the Operator of PLMN before identifying the correct MnS for exposure through BSS (e.g. by using Product Catalog). The BSS may obtain the information of MnS that is allowed to be exposed using a MnS service for exposure provided by OSS. The contract may contain the agreement on the exposure of MnSs for consuming certain management MnS related to QoS. According to the contract, the service provider A can have the permission to use the MnS for consuming certain performance MnS related to QoS for the PLMN. The performance MnS can be related to NR and 5GC, e.g. Average DL UE throughput in gNB. For the hosting network, the service provider may have contract with the Network Operator which can offer network management service for the hosting network. The network management service may be offered by a management system that belongs to a service platform of the Network Operator. Due to the contract, the service provider can access the management system directly without going through BSS.\n3. Once the offer has been accepted, the corresponding exposure governance management service within the 3GPP management system (of the Operator of PLMN) is configured with permission rule through the interface between BSS and OSS. The permission rule defines that the provider of the local hosting network can have the right to access certain management MnS regarding QoS.\n4. Through obtaining the measurement MnS using exposure capability, the provider of the local hosting network can determine the situation when PLMN cannot support the high-resolution video service with satisfied QoS. In this case, the service provider A can notify its customers about the local hosting network that may improve the QoS of the high-resolution video application.\n",

MNO A provides exposed MnSs from 3GPP management system for external customers and these exposed MnSs go through BSS/OSS for exposure.\n2. In order to provide such discovery service to external customer, MNO A registers its exposed MnS to a trusted discovery service entity. MNO A configures the exposed MnS with the discovery entity's address and the exposed MnS is registered at the discovery service entity with the appropriate level of exposure.\n3. MNO A performs changes in its management system that impacts the information exposed by the exposed MnS. The changed information is automatically updated in the discovery service entity.\n4. In case the relationship between MNO A and a discovery service entity (especially for the discovery system) ends, which implies the discovery service entity is no longer trusted, MNO A deregisters its exposed MnS to the discovery service entity. MNO A removes the configuration of the discovery entity's address for exposed MnS and the exposed MnS is deregistered at the discovery service entity before the trusted discovery service entity becomes a no longer trusted entity.\n",

However, there may be an issue with managing which consumers have access to the discovery system and could theoretically consume the management service when authorization rules are not respected.\nThere is an issue with authentication and authorization between the three parties i.e. MnS producer/operator, MnS consumer/customer and discovery system owner.\nTo limit issues the exposure from a discovery system of the operator may only provide \"read\" permissions (w.r.t the exposed MnS) without authentication and authorization. To execute the discovered exposed MnS the consumer still needs to be authenticated and authorized by the management system. Therefore, there is a gap in the difference in exposure for consumption, and exposure for discovery which needs to be solved.\nEditor's Note: Whether or not the issue with a third-party discovery system should be solved only for MnSs or for any 3GPP exposed service is FFS.\n",

An example of an external application could be a V2X application server may use the management system to provision V2X slices in a certain geography (AS2 or AS3 in Figure 5.6.1-1). An example for an internal application could be the operators eMBB application server discovering a newly supported coverage area and provisioning the operator eMBB network slice instance in that area (AS1 in Figure). AS1 and AS2 access the 3GPP management system from an operator internal enabler server (see TR 23.700-99), another enabler server could be located in the vertical premises and therefore external to the operator. In TR 23.700-99 both such options are considered. In this scenario the operator MnSs are directly access by internal or external entities (subject to prior agreements) without going through the BSS. In addition to application servers and application enabler server, any internal of external authorized application function may also access exposed MnS.\nIn Figure 4.1.1.3.2-1 AS1 and AS2 may or may not be aware that they use exposed MnSs from the operator. The respective enabler servers could hide this internal implementation. Bother enabler servers may access exposed MnS subject to respective authorization.

                    "text_content": "The steps of the solution are as follows:\n1.\tA MnS consumer configures using the appropriate MnS (for example the generic provisioning service) the details of the external discovery service location and other supporting details (for e.g. authentication and authorization). Further, the detail on which parts of which MnS (component A) IOCs and which instances of the corresponding MOI (component B) and corresponding data (component C) can be registered with the discovery service/system. As an example, the operator may want to register her the ability to provision (Management object A) a particular slice type (NSSAI-ID) at a certain coverage area (coverageArea item 6.3.3 TS28.541) with some additional details (example: supported latency or maxNumberofUEs or delayTolerance) to an external discovery service or system.\n2.\tIn addition to the information of what is externally registered, information relating to the address of the exposed MnS needs to be provided. This could be default information based on the operator in the external discovery system or in case of a trusted discovery the address of the actual exposed management service.\n3.\tThe 3GPP Management System registers the exposed management component A, B and C as configured in step 1 to the appropriate external discovery service/system.\n4.\tEventually, if any of the exposure details change – for example the same slice type can now be supported in a new coverageArea – the registration to the external discovery system may now need to be updated.\nThe solution for the trust issue between the three MnS discovery system owner, MnS consumer and the MnS producer is scenario dependent. For example in a multi-operator network scenario. In this scenario operator A is an MnS producer, a joint venture of multiple operators as a MnS discovery system owner and operator B as an MnS consumer. Both Operator A and Operator B have business relations with the joint venture thereby creating a trust relationship between Operator A and the joint venture (JV) AND operator B and the joint venture. The JV provides the authorization and authentication details for each of the operator to use the discovery service. Operator A may then expose aspects of its MnS that it considers ok to expose with the JV. Operator B can then discover the MnS offered by operator A and contact operator A to access them. If operator B requires a higher level of access than operator A provides in the JV by default, then they need to form a new business relationship.\n",

To execute the discovered exposed MnS the consumer still needs to be authenticated and authorized by the management system.

The solution requires extending the existing CAPIF mechanism to support MnS exposure and authorization. This includes extending the ServiceAPIDescription (see clause 8.2.4.2.2 of [19]) to support the description of the 3GPP management services required for exposure. This also includes defining mechanism to build exposure governance rules for allowing granular access to MnS from external entities.\nIn addition to external entities, the same solution can be used to provide access to entities inside PLMN trust domain (see clause 3.1 of [14]). Three types of consumer are considered here;\n-\tNOP-External: the consumer is external to PLMN trust domain,\n-\tOAM-External: the consumers is external to 3GPP management domain e.g. (5GC NFs, trusted AF and application layer entities e.g. SEAL)\n-\tOAM-Internal: consumer is internal to 3GPP management domain.\nFigure 7.10-1 illustrates the block diagram of a typical telecommunication system, showcasing various components and their interconnections.

The figure showcases the various components involved, including the network slicing orchestrator, service function chain (SFC), and network functions virtualization (NFV) infrastructure. The orchestrator manages the lifecycle of network slices, while the SFC provides the necessary functions for service delivery. The NFV infrastructure supports the deployment of virtual network functions. The figure also highlights the interconnection of these components, emphasizing the need for efficient communication and coordination to ensure smooth network operations and service provisioning.\nFigure 8.1.1-1: Reference architecture for network slice ordering, provisioning and assurance\nThe interfaces present in this reference architecture are:\n- Inter-organization interfaces (represented East-West):\n- Between the Customer and the Service Provider:\n- Interface ITF-1 to:\n- create a product (e.g. network slice) order,\n- retrieve information concerning a product (e.g. network slice) order,\n- update a product (e.g. network slice) order,\n- delete a product (e.g. network slice) order;\nCandidate APIs for Interface ITF-1 include, but are not limited to, TMF API 622 (Product ordering), in which case entities managed via this interface include ProductOrder, ProductOrderItem, etc. defined in TMF 622 [2].- Interface ITF-2 to:\n- \tenable the Service Provider to expose, from its Service Management Layer, network slice management capabilities to the Customer;\n-\tCandidate APIs for Interface ITF-2 include TS 28.531 [a], TS 28.532 [b], TS 28.545 [c], TS 28.550 [d].\n-\tEntities managed via the Interface ITF-2 include NetworkSlice (cf.

TS 28.541 [9]).\nNOTE:\tIn order not to create confusion, especially for external readers, it has been proposed in Figure 8.1.1-1 to rename interfaces, since interfaces Type-A and Type-B, used elsewhere in the present document, could be mixed up with MnS Component Type-A, Type B, Type C, defined in TS 28.533; similarly, interfaces Type-1 and Type-2, used elsewhere in the present document, could be mixed up with interfaces type 1, 2, etc. defined in TS 32.101 [e].\n",

Based on the evaluation, all analysed gaps can be resolved by alternative 2 and alternative 3 since all the related interfaces are within the scope of alternative 2 and alternative 3.\nMeanwhile, alternative 2 and alternative 3 are also supported in solution for network slice management capability exposure depicted in clause 7.9.10.\nClause B.3.2 Deployment model of TS 23.222 [14] illustrates the integrated deployment of the 3GPP network exposure systems (SCEF and NEF) with the CAPIF. The SCEF and the NEF may be integrated with a single CAPIF core function, where the CAPIF core function takes the role of a unified gateway, to offer their respective service APIs to the API invokers.\nTo make CSPs have a single gateway to expose whatever capability they want, SA5 is advised to follow the same deployment approach as SA2 regarding SCEF/NEF integration into CAPIF framework. This approach would mean the following :\n-\tThe CAPIF core function, the SCEF, the NEF and the logical MnF providing management capability exposure governance are all deployed in the PLMN trust domain\n-\tThe CAPIF core function, providing API registration and discovery capabilities, takes the role of a unified gateway and provides the entry point of exposure services provided by multiple 3GPP capabilities to different API invokers.\n-\tThe API invokers obtains the T8, N33 and MnS service API information and the corresponding entry point details from the CAPIF core function via CAPIF-1 or CAPIF-1e reference points.\nSA5 alternative 2 fits this deployment approach well. Therefore, it is suggested to recommend alternative 2 as baseline for the normative work.\n",
