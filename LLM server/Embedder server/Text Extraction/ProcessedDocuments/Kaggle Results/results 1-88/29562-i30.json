The state of the IMS Public Identities in the same Implicit Registration Set is also updated.\nThe following procedures using the Registration service operation are supported:\n-\tS-CSCF registration\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the S-CSCF sends a request to register at the HSS (see also 3GPP TS 23.228 [6] clause 5.2). The request contains the IMS UE's identity (/{imsUeId}) which shall be an IMPU, the S-CSCF Registration Information and the Registration Type.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1 illustrates the process of S-CSCF registration in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the interaction between the S-CSCF (Serving CSCF) and the P-CSCF (Per Serving CSCF) in the context of a mobile network. The S-CSCF is responsible for registering new subscribers and managing their sessions, while the P-CSCF handles call setup and control functions. The figure shows the flow of messages between these entities, highlighting the role of the Home Location Register (HLR) and the Visitor Location Register (VLR) in managing subscriber data and call sessions. The diagram emphasizes the importance of accurate registration and session management for seamless communication and service delivery in a mobile network.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1: S-CSCF registration\n1.\tThe S-CSCF sends a PUT request to the resource representing the UE's S-CSCF registration to update or create S-CSCF registration information. The S-CSCF shall check whether there is a reg-id parameter in the Contact header in the SIP REGISTER message. If a reg-id parameter exists, the S-CSCF shall indicate to the HSS that the registration is related to a multiple registration as specified in clause 4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.380 [37]. If the S-CSCF received a S-CSCF reselection indicator from the I-CSCF, the S-CSCF shall include that indicator to the HSS.\n2a.\tIf the resource already exists, and if the S-CSCF registered is the same or if another S-CSCF is registered and S-CSCF reselection indication is received, the HSS updates the scscfRegistration resource by replacing it with the received resource information (e.g. S-CSCF name, state of the related IMS public identity based on the imsRegistrationType received) and responds with \"204 No Content\" or \"200 OK\" with the updated resource information and HSS supported features.\nAdditionally, if the S-CSCF is reselected, the HSS shall invoke the Deregistration Notification service operation towards the old S-CSCF using the callback URI provided by the old S-CSCF with deregistration reason set to \"NEW SERVER ASSIGNED\".\nWhen receiving the \"200 OK\" response and if a multiple registration indicator has indicated to the HSS, the S-CSCF shall retrieve and update the restoration information as specified in clause 5.2.2.6 and clause 5.2.2.7.\n2b.\tIf the resource does not exist (there is no previous S-CSCF information stored in HSS), HSS stores the received S-CSCF registration data and responds with HTTP Status Code \"201 created\".

The figure shows the interaction between the mobile device, the mobile network operator's (MNO) network, and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network. The IMEI is a unique identifier for each mobile device and is used for various purposes, including tracking, security, and network authentication. The figure highlights the importance of accurate and timely IMEI retrieval for network operators to maintain efficient and secure communication services.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.2.4-1: IMEI(SV) Retrieval\n1.\tThe NF service consumer (e.g. IMS AS) sends a GET request to the resource representing the UE's IMEI(SV) information with query parameters indicating the supported-features.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing the last known IMEI(SV) associated to the UE.\n2b.\tIf there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" shall be returned and it should include additional error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the GET response body.\nIn the case of redirection, the HSS shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint of another HSS (service) instance.\n5.3.2.2.3.1\tS-CSCF Capabilities Retrieval\nFigure 5.3.2.2.3.1-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (I-CSCF), after authorization information has been performed without obtaining an S-CSCF name, sends a request to the HSS to receive the UE's S-CSCF capabilities (mandatory and/or optional). The request contains the UE's identity (/{imsUeId}), the type of the requested information (/ims-data/location-data/scscf-capabilities) and query parameters (e.g. supported-features).\nFigure 5.3.2.2. 3.1 -1: S-CSCF Capabilities Retrieval illustrates the process of an S-CSCF (Serving CSCF) in a telecommunications network, specifically focusing on the retrieval of capabilities from the S-CSCF. The figure depicts the interaction between the S-CSCF and the S-GW (Serving Gateway), where the S-CSCF requests capabilities from the S-GW. This process is crucial for the S-CSCF to perform its functions, such as call setup and management, in a secure and efficient manner. The figure highlights the importance of accurate and timely capability retrieval for maintaining the smooth operation of the network.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.3.1-1: S-CSCF Capabilities Retrieval\n1.\tThe NF service consumer (I-CSCF) sends a GET request to the resource representing the UE's S-CSCF capabilities with query parameters indicating the supported-features.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing the UE's S-CSCF capabilities relevant for the requesting NF service consumer.

The request contains the UE's identity (/{imsUeId}), the type of the requested information (ims-data/location-data/server-name) and query parameters (e.g. supported-features).\nFigure 5.3.2.2. 3.2 -1: Server Name Retrieval illustrates the process of DNS (Domain Name System) server name resolution. The figure depicts the interaction between a client and a DNS server, where the client sends a query for a domain name to the server. The server then searches its cache and the root DNS servers for the requested domain name.

The request contains a callback URI and the URI of the monitored resource.\nFigure 5 illustrates the process of a network function service consumer subscribing to notifications. The figure depicts the interaction between the service consumer and the network function as a series of steps, starting with the consumer initiating the subscription process. The network function then processes the request, authenticating the consumer and ensuring proper authorization. Once the subscription is confirmed, the network function sends a notification to the service consumer, which is then received and acknowledged by the consumer. The figure emphasizes the importance of secure and efficient communication between the service consumer and the network function, highlighting the role of authentication and authorization in maintaining the integrity of the communication process.\nFigure 5.3.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications\n1.\tThe NF service consumer sends a POST request to the parent resource (collection of subscriptions) (.../{imsUeId}/sdm-subscriptions), to create a subscription as present in message body.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription.

The NF service provider, in turn, communicates with the shared data source to enable notifications. These notifications are sent to the NF service consumer whenever there is a change in the shared data. The figure highlights the importance of real-time communication and data synchronization in modern network services.\nFigure 5.3.2.3.3-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications of shared data change\n1.\tThe NF service consumer sends a POST request to the parent resource (collection of subscriptions) (.../shared-data-subscriptions), to create a subscription as present in message body.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS responds with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription.

The request contains the UE's identity (/{imsUeId}), the resource to be monitored (/access-data/ps-domain/ue-reach-subscriptions), an expiry time, a callback URI and query parameters (e.g. supported-features).\nSubscriptions to notification on UE Reachability for IP are requests for a one-time notification, i.e. after notification the subscription becomes invalid.\nFigure 5.3.2.3.4 -1 illustrates the process of a user equipment (UE) subscribing to a notification of its reachability for IP connectivity. The figure depicts the interaction between the UE, the network elements, and the service provider. It shows the UE initiating a subscription to a notification service, which then communicates with the network elements to ensure the UE's reachability for IP services. The figure highlights the importance of real-time communication between the UE and the network to maintain seamless connectivity and service availability.\nFigure 5.3.2.3.4-1: Subscription to notification of UE reachability for IP\n1.\tThe NF service consumer (e.g. IP-SM-GW) sends a POST request to the parent resource (collection of UE reachability subscriptions) (.../{ueIdentity}/ue-reach-subscriptions), to create a subscription to UE reachability for IP. The request contains an expiry time, suggested by the NF Service Consumer, representing the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept active and the time after which the UE reachability event shall not generate a notification.\n2a.\tOn success, the HSS sets the URRP flag for the relevant serving nodes and may contact UDM (see 3GPP TS 23.632, clause 5.4.5). The HSS responds with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription. The Location HTTP header shall contain the URI of the created subscription.\nThe response contains the expiry time, as determined by the HSS (possible based on operator policy) after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the HSS. The NF Service Producer shall not provide the same expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating the subscription at the same time.\n2b.\tIf the user does not exist, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the POST response body.\nIn the case of redirection, the HSS shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint of another HSS (service) instance.\nThe following procedures using the Unsubscribe service operation are supported:\n-\tUnsubscribe to notification of data change\n-\tUnsubscribe to notification of UE reachability for IP\nFigure 5.3.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. S-CSCF) sends a request to the HSS to unsubscribe from notifications of data changes. The request contains the URI previously received in the Location HTTP header of the response to the subscription.\nFigure 5 illustrates the process of a network function service consumer unsubscribing from notifications.

The figure showcases the hierarchical organization of URIs, starting from the top-level domain (TLD) and extending down to the specific resource identifiers. This structure is essential for efficient communication between the various components of the network, such as the gNodeB, eNodeB, and UE. The figure highlights the importance of well-defined URIs in ensuring smooth and reliable communication in the 5G network.\nFigure 6.3.3.1-1: Resource URI structure of the Nhss_imsUEAU API\nTable 6.3.3.1-1 provides an overview of the resources and applicable HTTP methods.\nTable 6.3.3.1-1: Resources and methods overview\n\nThis resource represents the information that is needed together with the SIP authenticacion scheme to calculate a fresh authentication vector.\nResource URI: {apiRoot}/nhss-ims-ueau/v1/{impi}/security-information\nThis resource shall support the resource URI variables defined in table 6.3.3.2.2-1.\nTable 6.3.3.2.2-1: Resource URI variables for this resource\n\nNo Standard Methods are supported for this resource.\n6.3.3.2.4.1\tOverview\nTable 6.3.3.2.4.1-1: Custom operations\n\n6.3.3.2.4.2\tOperation: generate-sip-auth-data\n6.3.3.2.4.2.1\tDescription\nThis custom operation is used by the NF service consumer (S-CSCF) to request authentication information data for the IMPI from the HSS.
