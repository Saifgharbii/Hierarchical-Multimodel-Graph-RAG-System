                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply. For terms and definitions not found here, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [14].\nAssociation: In general, it is used to model relationships between Managed Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:\n1)\tname bindings,\n2)\treference attributes, and\n3)\tassociation objects.\nThis IRP stipulates that name containment associations shall be expressed through name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in the object models (UML diagrams). Currently however, all (non-containment) associations are modelled by means of reference attributes of the participating MOs.\nInformation Object Class (IOC): An IOC represents the management aspect of a network resource. It describes the information that can be passed/used in management interfaces. Their representations are technology agnostic software objects. IOC has attributes that represents the various properties of the class of objects. See the term \"attribute\" defined in [10]. Furthermore, IOC can support operations providing network management services invocable on demand for that class of objects. An IOC may support notifications that report event occurrences relevant for that class of objects. It is modelled using the stereotype \"Class\" in the UML meta-model. See TS 32.156 [10] for additional information on IOC.\nManaged Object (MO): A MO is an instance of a Managed Object Class (MOC) representing the management aspects of a network resource. Its representation is a technology specific software object. It is sometimes called MO instance (MOI). The MOC is a class of such technology specific software objects. An MOC is the same as an IOC except that the former is defined in technology specific terms and the latter is defined in technology agnostic terms. MOCs are used/defined in SS level specifications. IOCs are used/defined in IS level specifications.\nManagement Information Base (MIB): A MIB is an instance of an NRM and has some values on the defined attributes and associations specific for that instance. In the context of the present document, an MIB consists of:\n1)\ta Name space (describing the MO containment hierarchy in the MIB through Distinguished Names),\n2)\ta number of Managed Objects with their attributes and\n3)\ta number of Associations between these MOs. Also note that TMN (ITU-T Recommendation X.710 [7]) defines a concept of a Management Information Tree (also known as a Naming Tree) that corresponds to the name space (containment hierarchy) portion of this MIB definition. Figure 3.1 depicts the relationships between a Name space and a number of participating MOs (the shown association is of a non-containment type)\nFigure 3.1 illustrates the relationships between a Name space and a number of participating MOs (Managed Organizations) in a telecommunication network. The diagram showcases the hierarchical structure of the network, with Name spaces acting as containers for multiple MOs. The relationships between Name spaces and MOs are depicted through various lines, indicating the flow of authority and responsibility. The figure emphasizes the importance of clear demarcation and delegation within the network, ensuring efficient management and control of resources.\nFigure 3.1: Relationships between a Name space and a number of participating MOs\nName space: A name space is a collection of names. The IRP name convention (see 3GPP TS 32.300 [13]) restricts the name space to a hierarchical containment structure, including its simplest form - the one-level, flat name space. \nAll Managed Objects in a MIB are included in the corresponding name space and the MIB/name space shall only support a strict hierarchical containment structure (with one root object). A Managed Object that contains another is said to be the superior (parent); the contained Managed Object is referred to as the subordinate (child). The parent of all MOs in a single name space is called a Local Root. The ultimate parent of all MOs of all managed systems is called the Global Root.\nNetwork resource:  discrete entity represented by an Information Object Class (IOC) for the purpose of network and service management.\nNOTE:\tA network resource may represent intelligence, information, hardware and software of a telecommunication network.\nNetwork Resource Model (NRM): A collection of IOCs, inclusive of their associations, attributes and operations, representing a set of network resources under management.\n",

A threshold monitor checks for threshold crossings of performance metric values related to specified managed objects and generates a notification when that happens.\nThe ThresholdMonitor is used only when NRM based threshold monitoring is supported.\nTo activate threshold monitoring, a MnS consumer needs to create a ThresholdMonitor instance on the MnS producer. For ultimate deactivation of threshold monitoring, the MnS consumer should delete the monitor to free up resources on the MnS producer.\nFor temporary suspension of threshold monitoring, the MnS consumer can manipulate the value of the administrative state attribute. The MnS producer may disable threshold monitoring as well, for example in overload situations. This situation is indicated by the MnS producer with setting the operational state attribute to disabled. When monitoring is resumed the operational state is set again to enabled.\nAll object instances below and including the instance name-containing the ThresholdMonitor (base object instance) are scoped for performance metricthreshold monitoring. Performance metrics are monitored only on those object instances whose object class matches the object class associated to the performance metrics to be monitored.\nThe optional attributes objectInstances and rootObjectInstances allow to restrict the scope. When the attribute objectInstances is present, only the object instances identified by this attribute are scoped. When the attribute rootObjectInstances is present, then the subtrees whose root objects are identified by this attribute are scoped. Both attributes may be present at the same time meaning the total scope is equal to the sum of both scopes. Object instances may be scoped by both the objectInstances and rootObjectInstances attributes. This shall not be considered as an error by the MnS producer.\nMultiple thresholds can be defined for multiple performance metric sets in a single monitor using thresholdInfoList. The attribute monitorGranularityPeriod defines the granularity period to be applied. The value is a multiple of a supported granularity period for the measurements being monitored.\nA threshold is defined using the attributes thresholdValue, thresholdDirection and hysteresis.\nWhen hysteresis is absent or carries no information, a threshold is triggered when the thresholdValue is reached or crossed. When hysteresis is present, two threshold values are specified for the threshold as follows: A high threshold value equal to the threshold value plus the hysteresis value, and a low threshold value equal to the threshold value minus the hysteresis value. When the monitored performance metric increases, the threshold is triggered when the high threshold value is reached or crossed. When the monitored performance metric decreases, the threshold is triggered when the low threshold value is reached or crossed. The hysteresis ensures that the performance metric value can oscillate around a comparison value without triggering each time the threshold when the threshold value is crossed.Using the thresholdDirection attribute a threshold can be configured in such a manner that it is triggered only when the monitored performance metric is going up or down upon reaching or crossing the threshold.\nA ThresholdMonitor creation request shall be rejected, if the performance metrics requested to be monitored, the requested granularity period, or the requested combination thereof is not supported by the MnS producer. A creation request may fail, when the performance metrics requested to be monitored are not produced by a PerfMetricJob.\nCreation and deletion of ThresholdMonitor instances by MnS consumers is optional; when not supported, ThresholdMonitor instances may be created and deleted by the system or be pre-installed.\nA threshold crossing event detected by a \"ThresholdMonitor\" shall trigger a \"notifyThresholdCrossing\" notification. To subscribe to \"notifyThresholdCrossing\" notifications the MnS consumer shall specify one or more \"ThresholdMonitor\" instances in the subscription. All threshold crossings detected by the specified \"ThresholdMonitor\" instances are sent as \"notifyThresholdCrossing\" to subscribed MnS consumers (unless filtered out by the \"notificationFilter\" attribute of \"NtfSubscriptionControl).\nThe \"ThresholdMonitor\" IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.29) and the following attributes:\n\nNone.\nThe common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC.\n",

Creation of an instance with an initial non-zero value of the heartbeatNtfPeriod attribute triggers an immediate heartbeat notification emission. Creation of an instance with an initial zero value of the heartbeatPeriod attribute does not trigger an emission of a heartbeat notification. Deletion of an instance does not trigger an emission of a heartbeat notification.\nOnce the instance is created, heartbeat notifications are emitted with a periodicity defined by the value of the heartbeatNtfPeriod attribute. No heartbeat notifications are emitted if the value is equal to zero. Setting a zero value to a non zero value, or a non zero value to a different non zero value, triggers an immediate heartbeat notification, that is the base for the new heartbeat period. Setting a non zero value to a zero value stops emitting heartbeats immediately; no final heartbeat notification is sent.\nThe attribute triggerHeartbeatNtf allows MnS consumers to trigger the emission of an immediate additional heartbeat notification. The emission of heartbeat notifications according to the heartbeat period is not impacted by this additional notification.\nCreation and deletion of HeartbeatControl instances by MnS Consumers is optional; when not supported, the HeartbeatControl instances may be created and deleted by the system or be pre-installed.\nThe emission of heartbeat notifications is fully controlled by HeartbeatControl instances. Subscription for heartbeat notifications is not supported by NtfSubscriptionControl.\n\nThe HeartbeatControl IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.29) and the following attributes:\n\nNone.\nThe common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC.

                            "text_content": "This IOC represents a performance metric production job. It can be name-contained by SubNetwork, ManagedElement, or ManagedFunction.\nTo activate the production of the specified performance metrics, a MnS consumer needs to create a PerfMetricJob instance on the MnS producer. For ultimate deactivation of metric production, the MnS consumer should delete the job to free up resources on the MnS producer.\nFor temporary suspension of metric production, the MnS consumer can manipulate the value of the administrative state attribute. The MnS producer may disable metric production as well, for example in overload situations. This situation is indicated by the MnS producer with setting the operational state attribute to disabled. When production is resumed the operational state is set back to enabled.\nThe jobId attribute can be used to associate metrics from multiple PerfMetricJob instances. The jobId can be included when reporting performance metrics to allow a MnS consumer to associate received metrics for the same purpose.  For example, it is possible to configure the same jobId value for multiple PerfMetricJob instances required to produce the measurements for a specific KPI.\nThe attribute performanceMetrics defines the performance metrics to be produced and the attribute granularityPeriod defines the granularity period to be applied.\nAll object instances below and including the instance name-containing the PerfMetricJob (base object instance) are scoped for performance metric production. Performance metrics are produced only on those object instances whose object class matches the object class associated to the performance metrics to be produced.\nThe optional attributes objectInstances and rootObjectInstances allow to restrict the scope. When the attribute objectInstances is present, only the object instances identified by this attribute are scoped. When the attribute rootObjectInstances is present, then the subtrees whose root objects are identified by this attribute are scoped. Both attributes may be present at the same time meaning the total scope is equal to the sum of both scopes. Object instances may be scoped by both the objectInstances and rootObjectInstances attributes. This shall not be considered as an error by the MnS producer.\nWhen the performance metric requires performance metric production on multiple managed objects, which is for example the case for KPIs, the MnS consumer needs to ensure all required objects are scoped. Otherwise a PerfMetricJob creation request shall fail.\nThe production of the configured performance metrics can be constrained by conditions such that metric production shall be active only if the corresponding conditions are satisfied. These conditions are not configured directly in the PerfMetricJob. Instead, the attributes schedulerRef and conditionMonitorRef are provided allowing a PerfMetricJob to refer to a Scheduler or ConditionMonitor object. Only when the conditions in the referenced object are satisfied shall metric production be enabled.\nMultiple PerfMetricJob objects can be linked to the same Scheduler or ConditionMonitor object. This may be necessary, when PerfMetricJob objects need to be switched on and off synchronously.\nThe attribute reportingCtrl specifies the method and associated control parameters for reporting the produced measurements to MnS consumers. Three methods are available: file-based reporting with selection of the file location by the MnS producer, file-based reporting with selection of the file location by the MnS consumer, and stream-based reporting.\nFor file-based reporting, all performance metrics that are produced related to a \"PerfMetricJob\" instance for a reporting period shall be stored in a single reporting file.\nWhen the administrative state is set to \"UNLOCKED\" after the creation of a \"PerfMetricJob\" the first granularity period shall start. When the administrative state is set to \"LOCKED\" or the operational state to \"DISABLED\", the ongoing reporting period shall be aborted, for streaming the ongoing granularity period. When the administrative state is set back to \"UNLOCKED\" or the operational state to \"ENABLED\" a new reporting period shall start, in case of streaming a new granularity period.\nChanges of all other configurable attributes shall take effect only at the beginning of the next reporting period, for streaming at the beginning of the next granularity period.\nWhen the \"PerfMetricJob\" is deleted, the ongoing reporting period shall be aborted, for streaming the ongoing granularity period.\nA PerfMetricJob creation request shall be rejected, if the requested performance metrics, the requested granularity period, the requested reporting method, or the requested combination thereof is not supported by the MnS producer.\nCreation and deletion of PerfMetricJob instances by MnS consumers is optional; when not supported, PerfMetricJob instances may be created and deleted by the system or be pre-installed.\nWhen the file retrieval NRM fragment is supported by the MnS producer, the \"_linkToFiles\" attribute shall be supported, for details on the usage of this attribute see the definition of the file retrieval NRM fragment.\nThe PerfMetricJob IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.29) and the following attributes:\n\n\nThe common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC. In addition, the following set of notifications is also valid.\n\n",

It is a choice between the control parameter required for the reporting methods, whose presence selects the reporting method as follows:\nWhen only the fileReportingPeriod attribute is present (CHOICE_1), the MnS producer shall store files on the MnS producer at a location selected by the MnS producer and, on condition that an appropriate subscription is in place, inform the MnS consumer about the availability of new files and the file location using the notifyFileReady notification. In case the preparation of a file fails, \"notifyFilePreparationError\" shall be sent instead.\nWhen the \"fileReportingPeriod\" and \"notificationRecipientAddress\" attributes are present (CHOICE_2), then the MnS producer shall behave like described for the case that only the \"fileReportingPeriod\" is present. In addition, the MnS producer shall create on behalf of the MnS consumer a subscription, using \"NtfSubscriptionControl\", for the notification types \"notifyMOICreation\" and \"notifyMOIDeletion\" related to the \"File\" instances that will be produced later.In case an existing subscription does already include the \"File\" instances to be produced, no new subscription shall be created. The \"notificationRecipientAddress\" attribute in the created \"NtfSubscriptionControl\" instance shall be set to the value of the \"notificationRecipientAddress\" in the related \"PerfMetricJob\". This feature is called implicit notification subscription, as opposed to the case where the MnS consumer creates the subscription (explicit notification subscription). When the related \"PerfMetricJob\" is deleted, the \"NtfSubscriptionControl\" instance created due to the request for implicit subscription shall be deleted as well.\nWhen only the fileReportingPeriod and fileLocation attributes are present (CHOICE_3), the MnS producer shall store the files on a MnS consumer, that can be any entity such as a file server, at the location specified by fileLocation. No notification is emitted by the MnS producer.\nWhen only the streamTarget attribute is present (CHOICE_4), the MnS producer shall stream the data to the location specified by streamTarget.\nFor the file-based reporting methods the fileReportingPeriod attribute specifies the time window during which collected measurements are stored into the same file before the file is closed and a new file is opened.\n\n\nThe subclause 4.5 of the <<IOC>> using this <<dataType>> as one of its attributes, shall be applicable.\n",

It may be used as data type for dedicated progress monitor attributes when specifying the management representation of these processes. The attributes in this clause are defined in a generic way. For some attributes specialisations may be provided when specifying a concrete process representation.\nIf a management operation on some IOCs triggers an associated asynchronous process (whose progress shall be monitored), this should also result in creating an attribute named \"processMonitor\" (of type \"ProcessMonitor\") in these IOC(s). The processMonitor attribute may be accompanied by use-case specific additional data items.\nThe progress of the process is described by the \"status\" and \"progressPercentage\" attributes. Additional textual qualifications for the \"status\" attribute may be provided by the \"progessStateInfo\" and \"resultStateInfo\" attributes.\nWhen the process is instantiated, the \"status\" is set to \"NOT_RUNNING\" and the \"progressPercentage\" to \"0\". The MnS producer decides when to start executing the process and to transition into the \"RUNNING\" state. This time is captured in the \"startTime\" attribute. Alternatively, the process may start to execute directly upon its instantiation. One alternative must be selected when using this data type.\nDuring the \"RUNNING\" state the \"progressPercentage\" attribute may be repeatedly updated. The exact semantic of this attribute is subject to further specialisation. The \"progessInfo\" attribute may be used to provide additional textual information in the \"NOT_RUNNING\", “CANCELLING” and \"RUNNING\" states. Further specialisation of \"progressStateInfo\" may be provided where this data type is used.\nUpon successful completion of the process, the \"status\" attribute is set to \"FINISHED\", the \"progressPercentage\" to 100%. The time is captured in the \"endTime\" attribute. Additional textual information may be provided in the \"resultStateInfo\" attribute. The type of \"resultStateInfo\" in this data type definition is \"String\". Further specialisation of \"resultStateInfo\" may be provided where this data type is used.\nIn case the process fails to complete successfully, the \"status\" attribute is set to \"FAILED\" or \"PARTIALLY_FAILED\", the current value of \"progressPercentage\" is frozen, and the time captured in \"endTime\". The \"resultStateInfo\" specifies the reason for the failure. Specific failure reasons may be specified where the data type defined in this clause is used. The exact semantic of failure may be subject for further specialisation as well.\nIn case the process is cancelled, the \"status\" attribute is first set to \"CANCELLING\" and when the process is really cancelled then to \"CANCELLED\". The transition to \"CANCELLED\" is captured in the \"endTime\" attribute. The value of \"progressPercentage\" is frozen. Additional textual information may be provided in the \"resultStateInfo\" attribute.\nThe \"resultStateInfo\" attribute is provided only for additional textual qualification of the states \"FINISHED\", \"FAILED\", \"PARTIALLY_FAILED\" or \"CANCELLED\". It shall not be used for making the outcome, that the process may produce in case of success, available.\nThe process may have to be completed within a certain time after its creation, for example because required data may not be available any more after a certain time, or the process outcome is needed until a certain time and when not provided by this time is not needed any more. The time until the MnS producer automatically cancels the process is indicated by the \"timer\" attribute.\n\nNone.\nThe clause 4.5 of the <<IOC>> using this <<dataType>> as one of its attributes, shall be applicable.\n",

It is name-contained by \"Files\".\nWhen a file becomes available on a MnS producer for retrieval by a MnS consumer, the MnS producer shall create a \"File\" instance representing that file.\nThe time of creation shall be captured by the MnS producer in the \"fileReadyTime\" attribute. The MnS producer shall keep the file at least until the time specified by \"fileExpirationTime\". After that time the MnS producer may delete the \"File\" instance. The \"fileExpirationTime\" is determined by the MnS producer based on considerations such as available storage space or file retention policies.\nThe attributes \"fileSize\", \"fileCompression\", \"fileDataType\" and \"fileFormat\" describe the file properties.\nThe \"fileLocation\" attribute indicates the address where the file can be retrieved. The address includes the file transfer protocol (schema). Allowed file transfer protocols are \"sftp\", \"ftpes\" and \"https\".\nThe value of \"fileLocation\" can be identical to or different from the address of the \"File\" instance. The attribute \"fileContent\" is provided for retrieving the actual file content. When identifying in the Read request a \"File\" instance and specifying only the \"fileContent\" attribute be returned, then only the file content shall be returned in the response. Note, as usual, multiple attributes can be specified to be returned, so that the file content together with some or all file meta data attributes can be returned in response to a single request.\nIn case the \"fileLocation\" specifies a location different than the \"File\" object location, then the attribute \"fileContent\" cannot be used for retrieving the file content. For example, the \"File\" object location may be given by\n\"https://companyA.com/ManagedElement=1/Files=1/File=1\nand the value of the \"fileLocation\" attribute by\n\"sftp://companyA.com/datastore/fileName.xml\"\nIn this case the file needs to be retrieved using \"sftp\" from \"sftp://companyA.com/datastore/fileName.xml\". Attempts to read the \"fileContent\" attribute shall return an error.\nWhen the file retrieval NRM fragment is used together with a data collection job (\"PerfMetricJob\" or \"TraceJob\") the following provisions shall apply:\n-\tThe attributes \"jobRef\" and \"jobId\" shall be supported and present. They shall identify the job that the file is related to.\nThe attributes \"jobRef\" and \"jobId\" allow to set notification filters in the subscription in such a way that only \"notifyMOICreation\", \"notifyMOIDeletion\" and \"notifyMOIChanges\" notifications are sent to subscribed MnS consumers if the created or deleted \"File\" instance represents data related to jobs the subscribed MnS consumer created or is interested in.\nUpon creation of a \"File\" instance, a notification of type \"notifyMOICreation\" or\"notifyMOIChanges\" shall be emitted to subscribed MnS consumers as usual. For the case that the file contains performance metric data (\"fileDataType\" is \"PERFORMANCE\") the MnS producer shall emit either a notification of type \"notifyMOICreation\" or\"notifyMOIChanges\" or of type \"notifyFileReady\". The MnS consumer selects the notification type he wishes to receive with the subscription created on the MnS producer.\nThe \"objectClass\" and \"objectInstance\" parameters in the notification header of \"notifyFileReady\" shall identify the new \"File\" instance, instead of the related \"PerfMetricJob\", \"TraceJob\", \"ManagedElement\" or \"ManagementNode\"as described in  TS 28.532 [27], clause 11.6.1.1.1 for the case that \"notifyFileReady\" is used as part of the file data reporting MnS.\nThe notification \"notifyFilePreparationError\" shall be supported as well by the \"File\" object. It shall be sent when an error occurs during the preparation of the file. No \"notifyFileReady\" or \"notifyMOICreation\" or \"notifyMOIChanges\" shall be sent in that case. The \"objectClass\" and \"objectInstance\" parameters of the notification header shall identify the new \"File\" instance representing the corrupted file, instead of the related \"PerfMetricJob\", \"TraceJob\", \"ManagedElement\" or \"ManagementNode\"as described in 3GPP TS 28.532 [27], clause 11.6.1.1.1 for the case that \"notifyFilePreparationError\" is used as part of the file data reporting MnS. When the file is not created at all or deleted, the \"objectClass\" and \"objectInstance\" parameters of the notification header are populated as described in 3GPP TS 28.532 [27], clause 11.6.1.1.1.

For M1 and M2 measurement in UMTS, it is possible to select between periodical, event triggered reporting or reporting according to all configured RRM event triggers. Parameter reportingTrigger determines which of the reporting methods is selected and in case of event triggered or event-triggered periodic, which is the decisive event type. For periodical reporting, parameters reportInterval and reportAmount determine the interval between two successive reports and the number of reports. This means the periodical reporting terminates after reportAmount reports have been sent as long as reportAmount is configured with a value different from infinity. For event-triggered periodic reporting, these two parameters apply in addition to parameter eventThreshold which determines the threshold of the event. In this case up to reportAmount reports are sent with a periodicity of reportInterval after the entering condition is fulfilled. The reporting is stopped, if the leaving condition is fulfulled and is restarted if the configured event reoccurs. For event based reporting, there is only one report sent after the event occurs. The parameters to configure are reportingTrigger and eventThreshold. In case of UMTS  and 1f event reporting, additionally parameter measurementQuantity is necessary in order to determine for which measurement(s) the event threshold is applicable. Parameter beamLevelMeasurement determines whether beam level measurements shall be included in case of NR.\n-\tFor measurement M2 in LTE or NR, reporting is according to RRM configuration, see TS 38.321 [36], TS 36.321 [37] and TS 38.331 [38], TS 36.331 [39]. For measurement M4 in UMTS, reporting is either according to RRM configuration, see TS 25.321 [40] and TS 25.331 [41] or periodic or event triggered periodic using parameter collectionPeriodRrmUmts and eventThresholdUphUmts.\n-\tFor measurement M3 in UMTS, the reporting is done upon availability, see TS 37.320 [43].\n-\tFor measurements M4, M5, M6 and M7 in NR, for measurements M3, M4, M5, M6 and M7 in LTE and for measurements M5, M6 and M7 in UMTS periodical reporting is applied. The configurable parameter is the interval between two measurements (collectionPeriodRrmNr, collectionPeriodM6NR, collectionPeriodM7Nr, collectionPeriodRrmLte, measurementPeriodLte, collectionPeriodM6Lte, collectionPeriodM7Lte, collectionPeriodRrmUmts, measurementPeriodUmts). If no collection period is configured for M5 in UMTS, all available measurements are logged according to RRM configuration.\n\n\nThe common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without exceptions.\n",

Parameter loggingInterval determines the interval between the reports and parameter loggingDuration determines how long the configuration is valid meaning after this duration has passed no further reports are sent. In NR, the reporting can be periodical or event based, determined by parameter reportType. For periodical reporting the same parameters as in LTE and UMTS apply. For event based reporting, parameter eventListForEventTriggeredMeasurement configures the event type, namely ‘out of coverage’ or ‘L1 event’. In case ‘L1 event’ is selected as event type, the logging is performed according to parameter loggingInterval at regular intervals only when the conditions indicated by eventThresholdL1, hysteresisL1, timeToTriggerL1 (defining the thresholds, hysteresis and time to trigger) are met and if UE is ‘camped normally’ state (TS 38.331 [38], TS 38.304 [42]). In case ‘out of coverage’ is selected as event type, the logging is performed according to parameter loggingInterval at regular intervals only when the UE is in ‘any cell selection’ state. Furthermore, logging is performed immediately upon transition from the ‘any cell selection’ state to the ‘camped normally’  state ( TS 38.331 [38], TS 38.304 [42]).\n\n\nThe common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without exceptions.\n",
