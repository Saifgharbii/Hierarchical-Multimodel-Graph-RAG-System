This requires that satellite coverage availability information in the affected area to be made aware of by 5GC/EPC. According to the conclusions in TR 23.700-28 [2] and normative work in 23.501 [4], such satellite coverage availability information could be received by 5GC/EPC from different potential sources, e.g. the OAM, the AF/external server (e.g. Coverage Map Server). While the sources like the OAM could be trusted, the sources like the AF/external server may not always be trusted.\n",

Both cases are a type of DoS attack on the UE.\nIf an AF is not authorized to provide satellite coverage availability information in the affected area, the 5GC/EPC may also suffer from the above threat.\n",
