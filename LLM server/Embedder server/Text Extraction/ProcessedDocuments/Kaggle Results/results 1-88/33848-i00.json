            "description": "Virtualisation is a fundamental building block of 5G and while not the only way of implementing a 5G network, it is nevertheless the primary implementation method being pursued to some degree (great or small) by all operators and manufacturers. Furthermore, virtualisation is being applied to earlier 3GPP architectures (e.g. LTE) and part virtualised networks containing a mixture of physical, containerised and virtualised network functions will be common place for most operators for the foreseeable future.\n",

            "description": "The present document considers the consequences of virtualisation on 3GPP architectures, in order to identify threats and subsequent security requirements. 3GPP function security relies on the underlying implementation technology and physical environment being secure. In legacy deployments, physical rack security and separation implicitly provides underlying security. Many legacy physical security requirements are not formally documented in 3GPP standards and rely on proprietary domain knowledge by 3GPP operators and manufacturers. Legacy core network security models also assume that threats primarily apply at the edge of the function or network only, where the network or physical network functions are exposed by external interfaces.\nTo provide equivalent security in virtualised deployments, the underlying infrastructure needs to provide minimum security capabilities, in a standardized form, which can be requested and or consumed at the 3GPP layer. This is necessary since virtual functions need to co-exist in shared virtualisation environments and the legacy physical security models do not address the new threat vectors introduced by virtualisation.\nWhile a number of the key issues identified in the present document may not necessarily fully be within the scope of 3GPP to resolve, in order to implement 3GPP functions securely, it is necessary for 3GPP to set requirements that may be addressed outside 3GPP.\nThe present document identifies security requirements which need to be addressed outside of 3GPP in order for 3GPP to specify fully secure virtualised 3GPP functions. The present document identifies extensions to 3GPP security capabilities which are required to provide direct, explicit, security visibility of the underlying virtualised infrastructure platform to the 3GPP layer. It also identifies extensions to 3GPP functions to make use of such capabilities.\nThe wider requirements captured within the present document are intended to allow external groups such as ETSI or open-source groups to develop any necessary capabilities and fill identified standardization gaps.\nIdentification of requirements for the standardization of the overall security framework (e.g. top to bottom, 3GPP, NFVI, hardware, SDN) and minimum-security capabilities which should be used by a virtualised implementation to meet Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) or other regulatory requirements are outside the scope of the present document.\nSince there is no single approach to virtualisation, the security threats and risks will vary depending on the deployment use case and virtualisation technology choices. The present document considers both virtualisation threats and risks, that apply to specific implementations (e.g. Virtual Machine or Container based) and more generic threat and risks that apply in all use cases.\n",

Examples of devices and systems which may be virtualised include hardware platforms, memory, storage or a network. The present document primarily addresses the security of Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) as defined by ETSI. However, the security threat, risks and mitigations are applicable to any other similar virtualisation approach. In the context of a 3GPP network, NFV refers to the deployment of Network Functions (NFs) as software modules which run on 'off the shelf' computing hardware. This contrasts with the traditional deployment of 3GPP network components as specialized hardware devices. Implementation of the 5G Service Based Architecture (SBA) relies on the use of NFV, among other technologies.\n",

The NFVI includes:\n-\tHardware resources, which are assumed to be 'Commercial Off The Shelf' COTS.\n-\tVirtualisation Layer, for example a hypervisor or container engine, which separates the VNF software from underlying hardware.\nNOTE:\tThe choice to use a hypervisor or container engine as the virtualisation layer has security implications.

The figure depicts the various components and their interactions within the network function virtualization (NFV) environment. The central part of the figure shows the network functions, which are the core of NFV, running on virtualized infrastructure. These functions are interconnected through a service orchestration layer, which is responsible for managing and coordinating the network resources. The figure also highlights the role of the management and orchestration (MANO) layer, which is crucial for managing the lifecycle of network functions and ensuring their proper functioning.

Sharing hardware resources between VNFs allows networks to scale services up and down as required and to centralize the management and orchestration. However, the adoption of shared resources raises security questions which do not apply when using discrete physical infrastructure. In particular, virtualisation technology needs to ensure that VNFs can be isolated from one another, particularly in the case where they have specific security requirements. There are various approaches to isolating VNFs, ranging from using physically separate hardware to using separate containers. Where VNFs do share resources, these might be managed in different ways, as discussed in clause 6.5 of ETSI GS NFV 002 [2]. Sharing memory and specialized hardware could require special considerations.\nA number of security threats exist if VNFs are not appropriately isolated and resources are not shared effectively. These include the noisy neighbour problem and potential side-channel attacks.\n",

Plug and play interfaces (e.g. USB and removal RAID discs) unless disabled or tightly controlled represent a risk to 3GPP NF security. However, more difficult to control attack vectors such as PCI Express bus Direct Memory Access (DMA) or use of OS swap/page files represent risks if physical access to the server(s) hosting a 3GPP NF is possible. Similarly, whilst most server firmware would detect hardware changes (e.g. adding an extra copy physical network port which is visible to the host firmware), detection is more difficult where the replacement hardware uses the same IDs and declared interfaces.\nIn legacy 'Physical Network Function' (PNF) implementations, the physical security risks are better understood and are mitigated by physical constraints including secured racks, physical testing of interfaces to confirm they are disabled and careful placement of more sensitive functions (e.g. AUC) within CSP data centres. However, for virtualised implementations ,using large common hosts pools and physically securing all hosts (rather than those dedicated ones for a specific function) so that any 3GPP function can run on any host, controlling physical access attacks is difficult to achieve. This threat potentially increases with 'Infrastructure as a Service' (IAAS) and 'Network as a Service' (NAAS) deployments.\nFurthermore, many data centre hosts are equipped with Baseband Management Controllers and Intelligent Management Interface Protocol. If an attacker is able to access these controllers, they effectively have direct control over all hosts and all VMs running on them. Over recent years, a number of vulnerabilities have occurred. For sensitive functions, such as the AUC or LI functions, the risks would obviously be increased.\n",

A number of vendors have been offering \"virtualised\" implementations for 15+ years using common hardware platforms running VM implementation architectures. However, these limited virtualisation implementations use dedicated hardware instances for each network function.\nWhile these limited implementations have some of the same risks as a fully virtualised implementations (e.g. common software environment), they are essentially identical to non-virtualised legacy PNF implementations, as they have physical testable and securable boundaries. On the other hand, these limited implementations do not offer many of the benefits, including security benefits, of fully virtualised deployments. Many limited virtualised implementations can be readily migrated into fully virtualised environments and will be migrated as networks become increasingly virtualised during the VNF's operational lifetime.\n",

For example, trust in functions which contain long term cryptographic keys might require different levels of trust to functions which only hold session keys or those which do not contain cryptographic values at all. However, this classification is too simplistic. Nearly all 3GPP NFs will contain some privacy sensitive information for billing purposes or cryptographic material. Applying the same security policies to NFs in different trust domains could lead to reduced security and/or to reduced functionality.\nSecurity domains based on grouping whole NFs may not be sufficient. In some scenarios (e.g. Lawful Interception (LI)), sub-functions of NFs (e.g. LI POIs) may need to belong to different trust domains to the rest of the NF functionality.\nDefinition of appropriate segregation and security policies for NFs in different trust domains requires establishment of trust domains for 3GPP NFs. It is up to 3GPP to define what a sensitive function or sub-function is and how they must be handled to protect privacy or security sensitive data, within a virtualised environment.\nWhile 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] provides some consideration for 5G functions, CSPs are also in the process of virtualizing IMS or 3G/LTE networks, for which similar consideration has not yet been given.\n",

Their proprietary implementations, non-IP protocols (e.g. X25) and lack of flexible deployment options provided a high degree of security by obscurity. By comparison virtualised release 15 onwards implementations will provide a much higher level of basic security but the common software platform on which functions are implemented will introduce new risks.\nIn legacy PNF implementations each vendor typically used a proprietary platform and software with a few common web server or OS elements. This meant that if a vulnerability or zero day exploit was found and utilized by an attacker, this generally only compromised one NF. This would give the attacker access to data on that NF and the communication links into and out of that NF but the attacker would not have an advantage in attacking the next NF in the chain. Except in really poor implementations relying on network edge security only, the risk of a cascade failure is minimal with PNFs.\nIn virtualised implementations all NFs are implemented using a common software platform such as OpenStack [8]. While vendors may produce tweaked variants, the code core will be largely identical. Similarly, OS, Hypervisor and VM software will be identical or from a limited set of variants. What this means is that if an attacker is able to identify a software vulnerability in one VNF, that vulnerability will likely exist in many other VNFs making the attackers job much easier and increases the risk of a cascade security failure of the network. If network security functions (e.g. SEPP) use the same software core or are in the same virtualisation layer trust domain as the functions they are protecting the risk further increases if a software vulnerability occurs.\n",

These functions such as the kernel in desktop OSs control access to memory and are responsible for preventing applications from accessing each other's memory spaces. In VM based NFV environments, the hypervisor is responsible for administering each VM's resources and isolating the VMs from each other.\nIn legacy hardware networks, manufacturers apply physical separation within the physical hardware to keep sensitive control plane sub-components within a 3GPP function (e.g. key material or billing data) away from lower security sub functions or other general user plane traffic handling sub functions. This may include having different administration domains (e.g. LI sub-functions are managed via different interfaces and have separated administration).\nIn a virtual environment while the hypervisor plays a role in preventing one VM from accessing the memory of another (except through declared VM shared memory locations), the hypervisor is also able to inspect any memory which is directly under hypervisor control. Such access to memory or other VM resources cannot be detected by VM or 3GPP security mechanisms. Encrypting memory provides some resistance but if the keys used to encrypt the memory are also under hypervisor control (including hypervisor resource controlled Hardware Based Root of Trust (HBRT)) then this does not prevent introspection.\nIn addition to reading memory, the hypervisor is also in many cases able to write directly to memory, bypassing normal memory access controls and security within the VNF VM. This allows an attacker with access to the hypervisor to change data within a 3GPP function at run-time or indeed change the operation of the function itself.\nContainer based NFV environments are subject to similar memory introspection risks, with the container (or cluster) management engine providing similar functionality to the hypervisor in VM based implementations. KI#25 (see clause 5.26) addresses the issues and additional threats introduced by containers.\n",

Unlike slices built using PNFs, the slice isolation would only be virtual in nature and subject to the threats of other key issues described in the present document.\nA similar isolation challenges and risks occur for different trust domains within a 3GPP operator network. IMS security was standardized by SA3 in release 5 to exist in a separate security / trust domain from the 3GPP or non-3GPP access networks used to connect to IMS.

ETSI GR NFV-SEC 016 [9] discusses some of these issues, but the additional 3GPP specific constraints required are within the scope of 3GPP and not ETSI ISG NFV.\nFurthermore, if functions such as SEPP are supposed to be the physical boundary of the network then it may be necessary to be able to constrain them and the SDN routing to them, to specific physical locations.\n",

Attestation can be of multiple types (e.g. Boot-time and run-time). However, since security cannot exist in isolation at hardware layer, NFV layer and 3GPP NF layer (VNF functionality layer), it is necessary for the 3GPP to set explicit requirements on attestation. Similarly, ETSI ISG NFV or any open source group working on NFV software platform cannot specify the functionality of 3GPP NF or requirement with respect to their attestation.\n3GPP NFs, especially in multiple vendor and IAAS scenarios, need assurance that hardware or other critical security functions have not been modified and can be trusted. For example, the NRF in SBA needs to attest that a discovered NF is what it claims to be and has the capabilities it claims to have. While the 'Operations Support System' (OSS) / 'Business Support System' (BSS) allow an NRF to become aware of a new VNF instance (e.g. AMF) it is the underlying attestation chain, from a security perspective, that verifies the NF is secure.\nPossession of a 3GPP level identity / certificate is not in itself a means to prove authenticity of a VNF, unless there is a full attestation chain back to hardware.

Following the necessary processing, the data will be encrypted again.\nWithin existing SA3 specifications, while some specialist operations are performed in tamper resistant hardware (e.g. UICC), the bulk of cryptographic processing (e.g. user plane protection) will be performed using general X86 (or similar) servers within the core network.\nIn a virtualised environment there are various ways in which unencrypted data can be captured; through the hypervisor; server management hardware; modification of VNF images; instantiating a parallel VM on the same physical CPU; or any number of other options. The risks of being able to capture encrypted data in an unencrypted form due to processing of that data, increases significantly. If that processing is highly sensitive (e.g. AUC or LI functions) then the risk may not be acceptable. Placing entire VMs in fully hardened HMEEs may reduce the risk in the longer term, but not all cryptographic functions can be placed in a HMEE (this will not scale) and currently no suitable X86 (or similar architecture) HMEEs exist in commercial data centre servers capable of the scale required to support 5G deployments.\n",

Similarly, 3GPP specifies application layer functionality of core NFs but does not (with the exception of RAN groups) specify physical implementation aspects.\nWith the exception of green field 5G only operators, most virtualised deployments will commence with adding VNFs to an insisting PNF based networks. Overtime the number of VNFs will increase but mixed network deployments are expected to be the default for the next 10+ years. Similarly, mixed SDN and non- SDN linked NFs are likely also co-exist. By default, PNFs and VNFs have to be able to implicitly trust each other in mixed deployments, given that 3GPP SA3 currently does not specify different handling or trust relationships based on PNF or VNF implementation.\nAs discussed in other key issues, PNFs and VNFs are susceptible to different types of attack and in turn different have different security capabilities. Furthermore, it is likely that PNFs will be less easily patched for security vulnerabilities compared with VNFs over time.\nIn mixed deployments, especially where older 3G CS NFs share common NFs (e.g. virtualised HSS, UDM) with 4G or 5G higher security level VNFs, additional 3GPP security mechanisms may be required to prevent attackers using insecure interfaces as the injection points against the otherwise secure VNFs (i.e. VNF implicitly accepts messages from legacy PNF with lower security). However, the reverse attack also exists were an attacker uses the much larger attack surface offered by VNFs to attack PNFs. VNFs would ignore the messages but may well forward them to the less secure PNFs. Attacks are also possible depending on the chain of VNF and PNFs, were an attacker injects messages towards a VNF, which is forwarded to a PNF and finally to another VNF. While the first VNF and PNF are unharmed by the attack, the second VNF falls foul of the implicit trust of PNF and VNF communications.

There has been significant resistance in ETSI ISG NFV and open source communities to mandate full mandatory integrity checking of software images at both the overall package and sub-component (artefact) level. Current implementations offer minimal, if any, mandatory signing and where they do, this is based purely on vendor signatures. Therefore, in theory at least, any image from the same vendor would past verification checks if loaded into the wrong CSP software catalogue.\nFurthermore, the software catalogues, with or without integrity protection, provide a standardized description of the VNFs, their resource requirements, their configuration and ultimately the compiled executables that makeup the VNF. If an attacker is able to access the catalogue then they will be able directly gain a lot of information which can then be used to attack the running instances of the VNF. Where those VNFs contain cryptographic functions or sensitive information, this increases the risk even further.\nBased on current virtualisation standards in ETSI and Open Source, confidentiality protection of whole image or artefacts during; run-time, on-boarding, storage and instantiation is not supported, although for LI purposes this was recommended in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 011 [11].\n",

TLS is considered to terminate closer to the point where a function processes or manages data, whereas IPSec may terminate at a PNF closer to the edge of the network.\nIn flat virtualised deployments with common hypervisor and resources, there is very little difference between IPSec and TLS, with neither by default offering protection from virtualization layer (e.g. hypervisor) attacks. In this scenario, both an IPSec and TLS tunnels terminate in arbitrary memory locations which will be in the same accessible range as the plain text data they are intended to protect. Unless the IPSec or TLS tunnels transverse a physical network link external to the data centres, the threats they mitigate can largely become irrelevant. Using HMEEs massively improves security (see ETSI TS NFVSEC 012 [10].

For example, during the authentication procedure, a known series of messages will pass between the SEAF and AUSF and the AUSF and the UDM. In a virtualised environment, flexible and low cost (both in money and resource terms) security monitoring agents (see ETSI GS NFVSEC 013 [12]) can be easily inserted around multiple VNFs across the network, which could allow an attacker to identify the different messages making up a single procedure. Therefore, it may be possible to identify the same data in different signalling messages and to take action based on this information, potentially elsewhere in the network. This is in contrast to legacy PNF networks where it is typically very difficult to monitor many points in the network in parallel or to take a snap shot of the memory state of a large number of PNFs.\n",

While VM architectures contain a number of points of weakness including Hypervisor breakout (see key issue#21), VMs provide relatively strong memory isolation and containment of virtual NF components running in those VMs.\nCurrent generation NFV implementations are migrating to use a Container based implementation architecture as either full replacement to VMs, or through groups of containers running with VMs.\nIn comparison to VM only deployments, containers have much faster instantiation times but also much shorter life times. For example, containers may be created in real time on the fly for a specific service event and then released leaving the resources free for re-use for other purposes.\nFrom a security and isolation perspective, the VM Hypervisor is replaced by a Container Engine which manages the life-cycle of a container within a given group of containers (e.g. pod or cluster). However, the Container Engine does not provide equivalent VM security memory isolation or breakout protection. The container application usually runs on \"bare metal\" with no OS equivalent to the OS used in VM based implementations.\nContainer acceleration capabilities such as container caching also present security challenges as otherwise encrypted VM equivalent image artefacts may be available in unencrypted form in the cache to allow for fast container re-instantiation. This is similar to risks associated with key issue 5, although the impact is more localized.\nThe fast cycle times of containers also make traditional security monitoring and policy enforcement more challenging as network security enforcement decision engines cannot so easily make real-time access permission decisions as is possible for longer lifetime VMs.\nTechniques, using both containers and VMs provide some mitigation (e.g. running all containers for a specific VNF with a large VM, or using VMs for VNF security sensitive components such as TLS end points). However, using this approach restricts the flexibility of containers and introduces additional complexity / cost.\n",

This allows for a potential risk of a rogue container escaping the container confinement and impacting other co-hosted containers. The key issue is about container breakouts and its impact on other containers.\nThere are multiple ways for attackers to escape container isolation. There have been reported a number of CVEs that document known vulnerabilities that have been identified in the past. One way to escape containers is to exploit vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel enforces container isolation by employing namespaces and cgroups. However, if attackers gain kernel level privileges through privilege escalation, they can circumvent isolation as reported in CVEs (e.g. CVE20144699 and CVE20163134).

These management APIs allow access to privacy and security sensitive information. APIs exist at all layers of network including the 3GPP application layer (e.g. those with SBA), MANO systems and underlying NFV infrastructure (e.g. server management APIs supported by the server hardware). Management APIs provide a range of security critical NF management capabilities including basic configuration of NFs, policy management, audit and license management.\nSpecific to this key issue, MANO systems provide a set of APIs (e.g. those standardized by ETSI ISG NFV SOL) which allow standardized subscription to a range of information, metrics and points of control for NFs or MANO itself. Many of these APIs and access credentials can be shared across multiple NFs, and as MANO is not specifically aware of the VNF purpose at the 3GPP layer, can span slice or other 3GPP security domain boundaries.\nFurthermore, many APIs currently allow different security access control mechanisms to those specified by 3GPP. Therefore, any difference in API security strength between those specified by 3GPP and those supported by the underlying MANO / NFV infrastructure risk impacting 3GPP security minima. Until late 2020, common MANO API standards in industry use still mandated support for TLS 1.0 or allowed use of weaker username and password authentication mechanisms. Such mechanisms have been prohibited by 3GPP for a number of years. Approaches using self-signed certificates are also common.\nManagement APIs can have subscribers that are both internal and external to the 3GPP network. In the case of external APIs these provide standardized access to all NFs or MANO functions shared by all NFs, which do not pass through the 3GPP defined security interfaces (e.g. via SEPP) and do not fall into the scope of 3GPP Security Assurance Standards.\n",

Functions identified as security critical do not share trust domains with workloads that are not security critical functions.\nAll physical hosts are categorized into security pools based upon risk. The risk is based upon the host type, the security features of the host, and the environment within which that host resides. Hosts can be pooled for resilience purposes to ensure that parallel workloads are in physically separate locations. Host pools are tagged with trust domains they can execute. This will be based on risk and ensure that sensitive functions are not executed alongside vulnerable functions, or in high-risk locations.\nWhen determining whether a virtual workload is permitted to run on a host, the following aspects are considered:\n-\tthe trust domain of the workload being deployed;\n-\tthe host's security pool;\n-\tthe existing workloads running on the host, and their trust domains.\nUsing these criteria, the system enforces rules, as appropriate, to ensure that critical and sensitive workloads and highly exposed workloads do not run on the same host pool. Further segregation is available, for example if the workload vendor is viewed as high risk.\nGiven that the orchestration tooling requires high levels of access and privilege it is be counted as a security critical network function and protected as such. If it were compromised, the entire NFVI would be at risk.\nVirtualisation provides a well understood, software defined, mechanism to separate network functions. Software defined traffic rules applied directly to each virtual function are used to limit both incoming and outgoing traffic in an efficient and scalable way.\nTo reduce the risk due to compromise of a single host, virtualisation infrastructure is segregated, and workloads are deployed appropriately. Hosts are physically separated such that compromise of one physical host does not allow an attacker to impact an unmanageable amount of the virtualised network. A physical host's risk profile is used to determine which workloads can be deployed to it.\nA physical host is not able to impact hosts in other host pools. For example, among other controls, spoofing VLAN/VXLANs of virtual networks is not allowed.\nWhere the virtualisation platform is used to enforce separation between trust domains (i.e. where discrete physical hardware is not used), type-1 hypervisors are used. Virtual workloads do not have direct access to the physical hardware.\nContainers are not used to enforce separation between trust domains. Correspondingly, containerised hosts only support a single trust domain. This is because containers only provide process-level separation between workloads, meaning a single kernel-level vulnerability allows an attacker to impact the underlying host and all the containers running on it.\n",

Exploitation of the management plane could have a long-term impact on the availability and confidentiality of the operator's services, including critical services.\nHistoric management of telecoms networks has relied heavily upon standard corporate devices doubling up as administrative workstations. Consequently, machines that perform standard 'office' type functionality such as email, and web access are also defining the operation of the network. This is often referred to as a 'browse up architecture', and brings significant risk. Where it is used, several commodity classes of attack can be performed with relative ease, upon administrative users, and these can achieve a significant impact. Several attack vectors exist, the most notable being the possibilities afforded to an attacker via phishing of administrative users, targeted or otherwise, which can result in credential loss, remote code execution, and further exploitation of networks or users.\nAttacks of this type tend not to be noisy, meaning that there is no overt impact on the network, and they may be maintained for years, growing in scale and complexity over time. These attacks are likely to have a significant impact on the operator and hence securing the management plane should be treated as a priority. Given the risks, it is not appropriate for operators to be using a 'browse up architecture'. Instead, operators should architect, and operate, their management plane infrastructure to inhibit network compromise through administrative access. Operators should treat virtualisation administration as a management plane.\nNOTE:\tA host compromise will compromise all workloads running on that host, and as such the administration of the underlying hardware is as critical as the administration of the virtualisation fabric.\n",

This enclave is protected from eavesdropping, replay and alteration attacks as the programs within the enclave are executed'.\nUtilizing an HMEE within the NFVI may solve the issue of Virtual Network Function (VNF) isolation, memory introspection, and confidentiality of data-in-use in both virtualized and containerized environments. HMEE solutions offer protection from co-located VNFs running on the same physical host as well as protection from the host itself. General purpose HMEE can be equipped with Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware that may be used to host the NFVI.\nUse of an HMEE in the NFVI provides the means to support at least the following security controls:\n-\tSecurity of data-in-use. When code is executed on a shared physical host it is at risk of being modified or inspected by co-located VNFs or the host itself. With HMEE, code is executed in a secure environment, protecting the code and data from co-located VNFs and the host.\n-\tData integrity. HMEE is resistant to unauthorized modifications of information inside HMEE.\nTo scale across 5G NFV this solution proposes to utilize the trust domains from solutions to key issue #1. For example, trust domains that have security critical functions are only be deployed on hosts that have HMEEs enabled. Meanwhile, less sensitive functions belong to a lower trust domain and do not need to be deployed on HMEE enabled hosts.\n",

The architecture emphasizes the secure and efficient exchange of attestation information between these components, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted.\nFigure 6.6.2.1-1: Reference Architecture for Attestation\nAn attestation architecture typically involves three roles:\n-\tAttester: performs integrity measurements on the target system which is to be attested and generates a set of claims called Evidence.\n-\tVerifier: verifies the Evidence on the basis of reference values or other complex logic and generates an Attestation Result that declares the target system as trustworthy or not.\n-\tRelying Party: depends on the Attestation Results to apply specific actions.\nA typical attestation cycle consists of the following steps illustrated in figure 6.6.2.1-1:\n1)\tVerifier sends an attestation request to the target system.\n2)\tUpon receiving the attestation request, the Attester measures the target's untrusted environment and collects the integrity measurements into evidence.\n3)\tAttester sends the evidence to the Verifier.\n4)\tUpon receiving the evidence, the Verifier validates the received measurements against reference values or applies implementation-specific logic. The validation results assert whether the system under evaluation is in trustworthy state or not.\n5)\tVerifier sends validation results to a Relying Party.

When the Verifier is remote, this is referred to as remote attestation.\nAttestation procedures should adhere to the following in order to trust the process:\n-\tAn Attester should run in a trusted environment with complete access to the system so that it can take accurate and comprehensive measurements even when measuring a corrupted component.\n-\tAn Attester should run on component boot up.\n-\tMeasurements should be sent from the Attester to the Verifier in a manner that ensures freshness, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.\n-\tMeasurements on a component should be stored in a secure manner to prevent unauthorized modification prior to being sent to the Verifier.\n-\tA Verifier should run in a trusted environment.\n-\tAttestation results should be sent from the Verifier to the Relying Party in a manner that ensures freshness, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.\nIn a NFV environment, a virtualised 3GPP NF executes inside a virtual instance (e.g. virtual machine or OS container) created by virtualisation software (e.g. hypervisor or container engine). The virtualisation software mediates access to virtual resources that it abstracts from the physical resources in the hardware platform. The hardware platform includes other building blocks (e.g. BIOS, operating systems, etc.) for operation. Therefore, the scope of attestation of a VNF comprises all the aforementioned systems and components involved.\nAttestation in an NFV environment is established with a chain of trust (CoT). That is, the trustworthiness of the VNF is guaranteed by the trustworthiness of the virtual instance, the trustworthiness of the virtual instance is guaranteed by the trustworthiness of the virtualisation software, and so on back to the trustworthiness of the hardware. A component participating in a CoT cannot influence its own measurement procedure, as its execution begins only after it has been measured and verified (ETSI GR NFV-SEC 007 [14]). The CoT starts with an implicitly trusted attester, called a Root of Trust (RoT), and extends up to the last software component.\nIn the NFV architecture, components participating in the CoT are under the control of different domains. The VNF and virtual instance it runs within are in the 3GPP functional domain. Whereas the virtualisation software and the hardware platform are in the NFVI domain.\nTo illustrate the interdependency of attestation across domains, figure 6.6.2.2-1 shows a conceptual flow of measurements needed to form a CoT from the hardware layer to the VNF. The steps include:\n1)\tRoT measures hardware (including supporting components: firmware/BIOS, OS, etc.).\n2)\tHardware measures virtualisation layer (e.g. hypervisor or container engine).\n3)\tVirtualisation layer (e.g. hypervisor or container engine) measures the virtual instance (e.g. VM or container).\n4)\tVirtualized RoT (vRoT) measures the VNF. The vRoT is a virtual instance associated to the hardware protected RoT. The virtualisation layer software provides this virtual resource to the virtual instance.\nFigure 6.6.2.2-1 illustrates the conceptual flow of measurements that form a CoT from the hardware layer to the VNF. The figure depicts the various components involved in the process, including the network elements, measurement points, and the CoT. The network elements are represented by the various boxes, while the measurement points are indicated by the circles. The CoT is represented by the central box, which is connected to all the other components through lines. The figure provides a clear and concise overview of the process, allowing for a better understanding of how measurements are collected and processed to form a CoT.\nFigure 6.6.2.2-1: Conceptual flow of measurements that form\na CoT from the hardware layer to the VNF\nA VNF's trusted state relies on the state of trust of the underlying elements. More precisely, measurement of the VNF relies on a mechanism in the NFVI domain (in this example the vRoT). The cross-over in domain affects the scope of attestation for VNFs. The target of attestation, i.e. the VNF, is in the 3GPP functional domain and the mechanism for generating evidence on the target, e.g. the vRoT, is in the NFVI domain. Furthermore, trust in any measurements logged by the virtual resource (e.g. vRoT) is predicated on trust in the virtualisation layer software (e.g. hypervisor or container engine) that instantiates the resources to be used by the virtual instance (e.g. VM or OS container).\nAdditionally, relying parties in the 3GPP functional domain that make decisions based on attestation results may need to influence what is measured during the attestation process according to the level of assurance required by the relying party. Different 3GPP VNFs (i.e. relying parties) may have different criteria for trustworthiness. These aspects on configuration are within scope of 3GPP.\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution focuses on boot-time attestation, where a chain of trust is established during the boot process of the NFVI. The chain is extended to include attestation of the VNF when it is first instantiated on top of the NFVI. Run-time attestation methods for NFVI and VNFs are not considered in this solution.\nDefining attestation for NFV environments is out of scope of 3GPP. However, attestation of NFVI and attestation of VNFs are discussed in this solution to layout the foundational building blocks and propose a set of requirements from the perspective of 3GPP functional domain. It is also necessary to examine NFVI and VNF attestation to understand how attestation results can be used within 3GPP functional domain and how the 3GPP functional domain can influence configuration of attestation in the NFV domain.\nA new function called the Profile and Attestation Check Function (PACF) is proposed to enable access to the attestation results from the 3GPP functional level and distribute attestation policy to control how attestation is applied. The PACF may be standalone or co-located with OSS/BSS, NRF, or other network security functions.\nThis solution proposes using proof of attestation results to decide whether to register a VNF. A modified NF Registration procedure is proposed that uses the PACF to obtain access to the attestation results.\nThis solution is complementary to attestation services performed by the management layer.\nFigure 4.2-1 shows the ETSI NFV high-level architecture. The NFVI is a collection of NFVI-Nodes. Each NFVI-Node is a physical device deployed and managed as a single entity, providing the NFVI functions required to support the execution environment for VNFs. Each node goes through the attestation process to produce a chain of trust starting from the server/hardware layer. Only after successful attestation of each layer, the NFVI-node joins the NFV infrastructure.\nEach NFVI-node includes at minimum the following components:\n1)\tServer / Hardware Resource – bare metal equipment that the entire NFV stack runs upon. It provides physical storage, compute, and network I/O to the OS and virtualization software. Virtual resources are instantiated on these physical resources for VNFs.\n2)\tOperating System (OS) – full featured or customized OS that runs the software necessary for a NFV.\n3)\tVirtualization Layer– software (e.g. hypervisor or container engine) that creates a virtual instance (e.g. Virtual Machine or OS container) to run VNFs\nAny attestation solutions for NFVI should provide the following chain of attestation:\n1)\tAttestation of the Server / Hardware Resource: a RoT measures and verifies the server platform consisting of firmware and hardware. After successful attestation of the server, it will act as the attester for the layer above. The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by a verifier for subsequent access.\n2)\tAttestation of the OS: the server measures and verifies the OS. After successful attestation of the OS, it will act as attester for the layer above. The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by a verifier for subsequent access.\n3)\tAttestation of the Virtualisation Layer software: the OS measures and verifies the virtualisation software. The virtualisation software may be a hypervisor or a container engine. If the virtualisation software is pre-loaded into the OS, then its attestation is included with the attestation of the OS. The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by a verifier for subsequent access.\nIf any step in the attestation process fails, the CoT cannot be expanded further and a recovery procedure should be activated to handle the failure.\nAs a precondition to attestation of VNFs, it is assumed the NFVI-node has been successfully attested and can be trusted to attest VNFs running on its platform. More precisely, the virtualization layer software has been successfully attested and can act as the attester for VNFs.\nAlso note that a VNF runs inside a virtual instance, either VM-based or based on an OS-container. Thus, any attestation solutions for VNFs should consider both use cases.\nAny attestation solution for VNFs should provide a process that includes the following steps.\nThe process is initiated by the NFV MANO requesting to instantiate a new VNF:\n1)\tThe NFVI retrieves the virtual instance from network storage that is within the NFVI.\n2)\tIf the VNF software is not preloaded on the virtual instance, the VNF software specific to the type of VNF being instantiated is retrieved from network storage.\n3)\tThe NFVI attests the virtual instance and VNF:\na)\tThe virtualisation layer software (e.g. hypervisor or container engine) measures the virtual instance and VNF software and reports the evidence to a Verifier.\nb)\tThe Verifier validates the measurements. The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by the verifier for subsequent access.\n4)\tNFV MANO provides the VNF with a signed NF profile [13], clause 4.17.1. (3GPP TS 23.502 [13], clause 4.17.1, note 2 states the NF profile is configured by OAM system).\n5)\tThe NFVI begins to run the VNF.\nIf any step in the attestation process fails, the CoT cannot be expanded further and a recovery procedure should be activated to handle the failure.\nCurrently, no specification exists that defines support for attestation in NFV environments. The following requirements are proposed for consideration for future development of NFV specifications to assist the 3GPP functional domain in VNF attestation:\n1)\tThe NFV architecture shall provide support for attestation.\n2)\tSupport for attestation shall include NFVI subsystems and components described in clause 6.6.3.2.\n3)\tSupport for attestation of VNFs shall include VM-based and container-based use cases as described in clause 6.6.3.3.\n4)\tThe NFV architecture shall provide external access to the attestation measurements and attestation results.\n5)\tVerification of attestation evidence from NFVI shall be performed by a verifier external to NFVI to support remote attestation.\n6)\tThe external verifier should be within the NFV MANO domain.\n7)\tSupport for a mechanism to establish trust between the 3GPP functional domain and the external verifier shall be provided.\n8)\tThe NFV architecture shall provide an interface and protocol to allow the 3GPP functional domain to send attestation policies to the NFV architecture to support configuration of attestation parameters.\nSince the attestation procedures to verify the trustworthiness of VNFs and NFVI exist outside the domain of the 3GPP functional level, access to the attestation results is needed from within the 3GPP functional level. This access allows attestation to be integrated with select procedures in the control plane, such as NF registration and slicing operations. For instance, enterprise slices for some verticals may require the ability to query for proof of successful attestation to support their use cases. Applicability to NF registration is discussed in clause 6.6.3.6.\nAdditionally, default application of the same level of attestation to every virtualized NF in a 3GPP network may not be necessary. In which case, the 3GPP functional level can provide an attestation policy to the infrastructure responsible for attestation. The attestation policy describes the conditions for applying attestation and the type of measurements required to meet a specified level of assurance per VNF.\nThis solution proposes the PACF to coordinate access to attestation results from the 3GPP functional level and administer policy to help control how and when attestation is applied. Figure 6.6.3.5-1 presents a reference architecture integrating PACF into the NFV architecture. This architecture assumes the NFVI has been successfully attested and the virtualization layer software can act as the attester for VNFs.\nFigure 6.6.3.5-1 illustrates a reference architecture that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PACF) with Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) architecture. The figure showcases the integration of PACF at various layers, including the transport layer, network layer, and application layer. PACF is depicted as a set of interconnected components, such as the PACF controller, PACF manager, and PACF service modules. These components work together to analyze and optimize network performance. The NFV architecture is represented by a series of virtualized network functions, such as virtual routers and virtual switches, which are interconnected through a common infrastructure. The figure highlights the benefits of integrating PACF with NFV, such as improved network performance, reduced operational costs, and increased flexibility.\nFigure 6.6.3.5-1: Reference architecture with PACF integrated with NFV architecture\nThe PACF serves as a bridge between the 3GPP functional level and the attestation infrastructure outside its domain. The PACF requires a secure communication path to the Verifier. Policy information is sent from PACF to the Verifier. Attestation results are sent from the Verifier to the PACF. A trust relationship must be pre-established between the PACF and the Verifier. Other network functions acting as Relying Parties must also trust the Verifier. This solution assumes the Verifier is located within the NFV MANO domain.\nNote: Communication between the PACF and NFV MANO is not addressed in the present document.\nThis solution proposes to provide proof to the 3GPP functional domain that a new VNF has been successfully attested before registration occurs in the 5G Core.\nNote a: The process for verifying attestation results of the NRF and PACF is not addressed in the present document.\nOnce successfully instantiated, a new VNF will register with the NRF. The original NF Service Registration procedure is detailed in 3GPP TS 23.502 [13], clause 4.17.1. The modified NF Service Registration procedure shown in Figure 6.6.3.6-1 includes attestation by adding steps 2, 3, and 4. Steps 1, 5, and 6 are steps from the original procedure.\nThe modified NF Service Registration procedure retrieves attestation results based on the NF Instance ID in the NF profile. This solution proposes the use of digital signatures to enable integrity protection and verification of the NF profile sent in the registration request by the VNF. The NF profile should be signed by the OAM, NFV MANO, or an authorized delegate when the VNF instance is provisioned and instantiated on the NFVI. The NF profile should only be signed after the integrity of the VNF instance has been verified. Signing the NF profile prevents the registering VNF from altering the NF profile by forging the NF Instance ID of a successfully attested VNF.\nNOTE 1:\tA signed NF profile is within alignment of 3GPP TS 23.502 [13] clause 4.17.1. 3GPP TS 23.502 [13] clause 4.17.1, note 2 states: the NF profile is configured by OAM system and note 3 states: that whether the NF profile sent by NF service consumer to NRF needs to be integrity protected by the NF service consumer and verified by the NRF is to be decided by SA3.\nFigure 6.6.3.6-1 illustrates the NF Service Registration Procedure with PACF, showcasing the process of network function (NF) service registration within a service provider's access and customer premises equipment (APC). The figure highlights the interaction between the NF service provider, NF service, and NF service request, emphasizing the role of the policy and accounting context function (PACF) in managing and controlling network resources. The diagram emphasizes the importance of efficient service registration for maintaining network performance and security.\nFigure 6.6.3.6-1: NF Service Registration Procedure with PACF\nWhen an NF requires attestation results to register, the following steps are proposed for the registration procedure:\nStep 1:\tNF service consumer, i.e. an NF instance, sends Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister Request message to NRF to inform the NRF of its NF profile when the NF service consumer becomes operative for the first time.\nStep 2:\tThe NRF initiates a request for attestation results and sends the signed NF profile to the PACF.\nStep 3:\tThe PACF verifies the signature on the NF profile and retrieves attestation results from the Verifier using the NF Instance ID from the NF profile.\nIf signature verification fails, the NF service consumer cannot be trusted and an exception handling procedure should be activated to handle an untrusted NF.\nStep 4:\tThe PACF responds to the NRF with attestation results it received from the Verifier.\nStep 5:\tIf the attestation results affirm successful attestation, the NF service consumer can be trusted. The NRF stores the NF profile of NF service consumer and marks the NF service consumer available.\nOtherwise, if the attestation results affirm an unsuccessful attestation, the NF consumer cannot be trusted and a recovery procedure should be activated to handle an untrusted NF.\nStep 6:\tThe NRF acknowledge NF Registration is accepted via Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister response.\nThere can also be interactions between NFs with MnF (as defined in 3GPP TS 28.533 [16]) for NF management service.\nBesides the above procedures defined in 3GPP, the NFs can also interact with domains defined in other SDOs, e.g. MANO defined in ETSI.\nThe main idea is requiring the Verifier to expose the attestation results of different layers to the network entities (NRF, NFp, PS, MnF, MANO, OAM, etc.) which will interact with the attested NF, then, on receiving the interaction from the NF, these network entities can invoke the attestation /results and take further actions.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Verifier itself can also be distributed in different layers. The network entities can communicate with the Verifier directly or via a unified proxy.\n",

Vice versa, the producer authorizes the consumer by means of verifying an OAuth 2.0 token included in the service request.\nThe consumer requests and receives the OAuth 2.0 token from the NRF. During the token request the NRF authenticates the NF requesting the token. The authentication is based on a X.509 certificates and a corresponding private key, which together are acting as the consumer's OAuth Client Id and Client Secret.\nThere can also be interactions between NFs with MnF (as defined in TS 28.533[16]) for NF management service.\nBesides the above procedures defined in 3GPP, the NFs can also interact with domains defined in other SDOs, e.g. MANO defined in ETSI.\nTherefore, there can be multiple approaches, how the concept of remote attestation could be linked to the existing security concept, for instance:\n1)\tRemote Attestation is executed during each interaction between consumer and NRF and between consumer and producer.\n2)\tRemote Attestation is executed during enrolment of client and server certificates to the NFs. Afterwards trust is based on these certificates and their corresponding private keys.\nThe main idea is requiring the Remote Attestation server to exposure the RA report/result of different layers to the network entities (NRF, NFp, PS, MnF, MANO, OAM, etc.) which will interact with the attested NF, then, on receiving the interaction from the NF, these network entities can invoke the RA report/result and take further actions.\nNOTE:\tThe RA server itself can also be distributed in different layers. The network entities can communicate with the RA server directly or via a unified proxy.\nThe proposed solution takes the PS as an example.\nThis approach assumes that the NF can protect the private key linked to the certificate from any attack. That is the cryptographic material needs to reside within a trusted execution environment and must not be visible outside of the trusted execution environment at any time, not even during provisioning.\nIt is up to implementation and specific security requirements, if the NF is using a trusted execution environment based on enclave technologies for handing of the private key and certificate, or if the entire NF is executed in a trusted execution environment.\n",

The individual steps are only indicative. A detailed specification is FFS or up to normative work.\n\nThe given figure illustrates an attestation architecture, where the Network Function NF serves as the Attester, the Provisioning Server PS acts as the Relying Party, and the Attestation Server AS functions as the Verifier. This setup is crucial for ensuring secure and reliable communication within a network. The NF attests the capabilities of the PS, which in turn relies on the AS to verify the authenticity of the attestation. This three-way interaction forms the basis of secure communication and resource management in the network.\nNOTE a:\tIn terms of an attestation architecture [20] the Network Function NF is acting as Attester, the Provisioning Server PS as the Relying Party, and the Attestation Server AS as the Verifier.\n\nFigure 6.7.3-1: Combining provision of 3GPP identities and certificates to the process of remote attestation. I\nStep 1.\tNF is requesting secure channel from the provisioning server.\nDepending on the exact specification of the protocol in this step the NF might also verify the identity of the provisioning server. For instance, if TLS is used as a secure channel, the NF could verify the server certificate of the provisioning server using a preconfigured root certificate.\nStep 2.\tThe provisioning server is replying with a request for evidence. The request includes a nonce, which will be used to ensure the freshness of the evidence provided in the subsequent steps.\nStep 3-\tThe NF collects claims and prepares the signed evidence, which includes the Nonce.\nThe claims included in the evidence are for further study and might be out of scope of 3GPP. Claims in the evidence might include claims related to the NF Software and to the NF configuration, but also claims related to the Hardware and the Cloud Software stack. If NF is deployed in the form of several components, the evidence might also include claims from the individual components.\nFurthermore, the evidence needs to include a claim, which binds the secure channel to the attestation process. For instance, an ephemeral public key, whose corresponding private key is only known to the NF and protected by the NF by means of a trusted execution environment, could be included in the evidence.\nStep 4.\tThe NF sends the evidence to the provisioning server.\nStep 5.\tThe provisioning server requests verification of the evidence from the attestation server.\nStep 6.\tThe attestation server appraises the provided evidence using endorsements and refence values. The way, how this appraisal is executed and how the attestation server receives endorsements and reference values might be out of scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of a negative outcome of the appraisal the attestation server might inform the management system about this incident. The management might take immediate action on this incident including identifying, isolating, and shutting down of the potentially malicious NF. Furthermore, the incident might cause a root cause analysis with the target of closing the security gap, which was causing the incident.\nStep 7.\tThe attestation server returns the result of the appraisal to the provisioning server\nStep 8.\tBased on the attestation results and other policies the provisioning server decides whether the NF is eligible for provisioning or not.\nStep 9.\tThe establishment of the secure channel is completed.\nNOTE 2:\tThe establishment of the secure channel includes usage of the claim related to the channel, which was included in the evidence provided in step 3 from the NF to the provisioning server.\nStep 10.\tNF and provisioning server use the secure channel to enrol necessary identities and certificates to the NF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PS may need not forward messages between NF and AS but only invoke the final result directly to AS.

These responsibilities should only be given to privileged admins. If the admin account is compromised or the admin is malicious then the account can be used to conduct attacks on the NFV (e.g. data exfiltration/espionage, selling user data, unauthorized configuration or package modification, service disruption). To reduce the risk of a malicious admin or MANO single point of failure the principles highlighted in Annex A and Solution #3 must be followed.\nTo that end, this solution proposes using a ticket-based authentication system and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) on the NFV management plane. Within ETSI GS NFV-SEC 003 [17] it suggests that a token-based authentication mechanism such as Kerberos may be used between the Tenant Domain and Infrastructure Domain. Similarly, this solution uses an Authentication Server (AS) to authenticate the admin. Next, a Ticket Granting Server (TGS) issues a ticket to authenticated admins which is used to connect securely to an NFV component. Tickets issued should be restricted by both time and number of usages. All other connection requests to the NFV environment shall be denied.\nAnother token-based authorization framework that can be used is OAuth 2.0, specified in IETF RFC 6749 [19]. Herein only details for the Kerberos option are given here.\nOnce, the admin is authenticated and has established a secure connection with the NFV environment, they must also be authorized to perform tasks. ABAC may be used to provide fine grain access control to resources within the NFVI or the VNFs. ABAC uses policies that are based on subject attributes (e.g. user, admin, senior admin), object attributes (e.g. VNF, NFVI), and environmental conditions (e.g. time, location, authentication strength). Such attribute based policies help protect the NFV environment from unusual/ suspicious behaviour, even when the source is authenticated. Together, ticket-based authentication and ABAC provide secure access to the NFV resources, and fine grain access control.\n",

                            "text_content": "To implement necessary access controls, this solution proposes using a ticket-based authentication mechanism and ABAC. Kerberos, described in IETF RFC 4120 [18], is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to authenticate a client's connection to a server. It uses shared secret key cryptography to provide a secure connection between the client, Key Distribution Centre (KDC), and server.\nIn this solution, a ticket-based authentication protocol, like Kerberos, is used to authenticate admins attempting to gain access to the NFV resources (VNF or the NFVI). In this case the client is an admin requesting access to the NFV environment. Additionally, ABAC is used on the resource side to authorize the admin. The ABAC server is per domain (VNF or NFVI) and implemented in such a way as to not be a single point of failure (e.g. distributed or redundant). The procedure for admin authentication and authorization to perform Management and Orchestration (MANO) functions is depicted in figure 6.8.2-1.\nNote that the VNFs themselves and the infrastructure they run on (NFVI) can and should be two different administrative domains. The KDC can be per domain or can serve several domains. A policy server can be a part of the KDC and handles access control for each domain.\nFigure 6.8.2-1 illustrates the step-by-step procedure for administrators to authenticate and authorize themselves to perform Management and Orchestration (MANO) functions within the network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) and virtual network functions (VNF) domains. The process begins with the administrator accessing the MANO system, where they are required to authenticate using their credentials. Once authenticated, the administrator is granted access to the MANO dashboard, which provides a centralized view of the network resources and their status.\n\nThe dashboard allows the administrator to perform various tasks, such as creating, modifying, or deleting network resources, as well as monitoring their performance. To ensure the security of the network, the administrator must also authorize themselves to perform these actions. This is done by providing the necessary permissions to the administrator's identity within the MANO system.\n\nThe figure outlines the importance of a secure and efficient MANO system in managing and orchestrating network resources, ensuring that the network operates smoothly and meets the required performance standards. The process depicted in the figure is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the network, as it prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only authorized personnel can perform critical network management tasks.\nFigure 6.8.2-1: Procedure for admin authentication and authorization to perform Management and\nOrchestration (MANO) functions, applicable for each of the domains: NFVI and VNF\nStep 1:\tThe admin (i.e. client) sends an authentication request to the Authentication Server (AS) that is part of the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The Kerberos configuration (e.g. KDC deployment, principals, realms) is implementation specific and out of 3GPP scope. The KDC does not need to be collocated with the resource, in this case the resource is the VNF or the NFVI depending on the administrative task and role. The interface between the admin and the KDC is out of 3GPP scope.\nNOTE:\tThe Kerberos protocol has built-in security measures for protection of messages on the interface between a client and the KDC such as timestamps, cache, and symmetric key cryptography.\nStep 2:\tUpon successful authentication the KDC issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the admin.\nStep 3:\tThe admin sends the TGT to the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) that is part of the KDC to request access to the resource (NFVI/VNF).\nStep 4:\tIf access is approved, the KDC sends the admin a session key and ticket to access the resource (NFVI/VNF). If the KDC limits the number of access attempts, then the remaining access attempts should be decreased by one every time a ticket is issued.\nStep 5:\tOnce authenticated and authorized by the KDC, the admin can send the ticket with the session key to the resource (NFVI/VNF). Admin can use the session key to communicate securely with the resource (NFVI/VNF) for the duration of time on the ticket. The reference point between the admin and the NFVI or the VNF, Nf-Vi and Ve-Vnfm reference points respectively, are defined in ETSI NFV 002 [2]. Security for the Nf-Vi and Ve-Vnfm reference points is in ETSI GS NFV-SEC 003 [17].\nStep 6:\tThe resource (NFVI/VNF) sends an authorization request to the ABAC server on behalf of the admin. The ABAC server may be co-located with the resource (NFVI/VNF), but access must only be granted to authorized admins with the highest privileges. The ABAC server grants authorization using attribute based rules (e.g. admin A is allowed access to resource B from IP address: 1.2.3.4 from 9:00-10:00 UTC).\nStep 7:\tThe resource (NFVI/VNF) sends an authorization response. If the admin is unauthorized to perform the requested MANO functions, then the resource drops the connection.\nStep 8:\tThe admin performs the authorized MANO functions.\nStep 9:\tOnce the allotted time on the Ticket is reached, the resource (NFVI/VNF) drops the connection with the admin.\n",

The lowest level is isolating different VNFCIs in one VNFI. For example, a particular service in one NF may be more critical than others and hence needs to be protected in a dedicated host. Another level of isolation is about VNFs within a specific network slice. For example, a NF in a network slice needs to be isolated from other NFs in the same slice. The above two levels of isolation are supported by the corresponding affinity and anti-affinity attributes contained in VNFD and NSD as defined in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [21]. In addition, it is proposed that 3GPP define the isolation principles and guidelines so that network managers can define the corresponding VNFD and NSD (ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [21]).\nBesides the above two levels, the isolation between network slices should also be considered, e.g. two network slices should be deployed in separate host groups or DCs. The solution proposes to define umbrella isolation groups to cover such case while reusing the current affinity and anti-affinity attributes.\n",

                            "text_content": "It is proposed to first define a set of isolation principles for network design. The general 3 levels of isolation principles are listed as follows:\n1)\tIsolation between slices: Network slices for critical sectors (e.g. energy sector, emergency services sector, critical manufacturing sector, etc.) should be isolated from general commercial network slices. This implies that all NFs in critical should be isolated from NFs in other ordinary slice or a particular set of NFs in critical slice should be isolated from other NFs.\nAs explained above, this type of isolation needs enhancement work in ETSI NFV ISG. The related slices need to be considered as a whole service, and then several umbrella isolation groups will be defined. Afterwards, the affinity and anti-affinity attributes should be allocated to each group. For instance, if NF_A in slice_A is to be isolated from NF_B in slice_B, then, NF_A and NF_B can be allocated with the same group ID. Such a group is to be assigned with a specific anti-affinity attribute. The MANO can by this means allocate isolated resources for these two NFs in two slices.\n2)\tIsolation between network functions in the same slice: In a particular network slice, several NFs are more sensitive than others, e.g. UDM/AUSF/ARPF, etc. It may be needed to isolate these NFs from others even in the same network slice.\n3)\tIsolation between network services in the same NF: It's general recommended to isolate sensitive services (e.g. LI service) in a NF from other services.\nBoth scenarios mentioned in 2 and 3 are already supported by the existing affinity and anti-affinity attributes contained in VNFD and NSD.\nNOTE:\tThe above general principles are just examples to showing aspects that network operators can adjust in reality.\nBased on the above schemes, MANO can allocate isolated resources based on the isolated attributes in NSD.\n",
