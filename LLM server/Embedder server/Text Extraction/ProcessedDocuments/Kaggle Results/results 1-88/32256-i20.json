In order to provide the data required for the management activities outlined in TS 32.240 [1] (Credit-Control, accounting, billing, statistics, etc.), the AMF shall be able to perform converged charging for each of the following:\n-\tCharging data related to registration.\n-\tCharging data related to N2 connection between the AN and the AMF.\n-\tCharging data related to user location.\nThe AMF shall use the AMF charging profile defined in clause 5.2.1.2. The default AMF charging profile is provided by Charging Characteristics applicable to AMF are described in Annex A.\nThe AMF shall be able to perform converged charging by interacting with CHF, for charging data related to registration, connection and location management. The Charging Data Request and Charging Data Response are exchanged between the AMF and the CHF, based on IEC, PEC or ECUR scenarios as specified in TS 32.290 [57]. The Charging Data Request is issued by the AMF towards the CHF when certain conditions (chargeable events) are met.\nThe contents and purpose of each charging event that triggers interaction with CHF, as well as the chargeable events that trigger them, are described in the following clauses.\nA detailed formal description of the converged charging parameters defined in the present document is to be found in TS 32.291 [58].\nA detailed formal description of the CDR parameters defined in the present document is to be found in TS 32.298 [51].\nWhen a charging event is issued towards the CHF, it includes details such as Subscriber identifier (e.g. SUPI).\nEach trigger condition (i.e. chargeable event) defined for the 5G connection and mobility converged charging functionality, is specified with the associated behaviour when they are met.\nTable 5.2.1.2.1.1 summarizes the set of default trigger conditions and their category which shall be supported by the AMF when charging is active for the corresponding AMF functionality. For \"immediate report\" category, the table also provides the corresponding Charging Data Request message sent from AMF towards the CHF.\nTable 5.2.1.2.1.1: Default Trigger conditions in AMF\n\nAMF functionality charging activation/deactivation is performed by CHF via AMF charging profile update as defined in clause 5.2.1.2.3.\nThe AMF charging profile is defined in clause 5.2.1.2.2 and shall be used by the AMF to determine whether converged charging is active or not, and which scenario is applicable when active.\nDuring UE initial registration in the AMF, if registration charging is active in the Charging Characteristics, a Charging Data Request [Event, Registration] or Charging Data Request [Initial, Registration] shall be sent to CHF in the corresponding charging scenario (i.e. IEC, PEC or ECUR) when applicable triggers are met. At N2 connection, if N2 connection charging is active in the AMF charging profile, a Charging Data Request [Event, N2 connection] shall be sent to CHF in PEC scenario when applicable triggers are met.\nAt N2 connection, if location reporting charging is active in the AMF charging profile, the AMF shall start the location reporting control procedure towards NG-RAN specified in clause 4.10 of TS 23.502 [202] for a continuous reporting whenever the UE location changes. A Charging Data Request [Event, location reporting] shall be sent by AMF upon receiving the location report from NG-RAN with current UE location.\nIf the AMF receives in a Charging Data Response [Event/Initial] from CHF, an updated AMF charging profile deactivating location reporting charging, and the AMF has a N2 connection, the AMF shall cancel the location reporting control procedure towards NG-RAN.\nAn AMF charging profile is defined to allow AMF determination of applicable trigger conditions for each functionality (i.e Registration, N2 connection, Location Reporting), and includes:\n-\tcharging active or inactive;\n-\tIEC, ECUR or PEC scenario.\nFor location reporting charging it includes in addition, the level for location change to be reported (i.e. TAI change and/or Cell Change), or UE presence in Presence Reporting Area(s) to be reported. The UE Presence in Presence Reporting Area (PRA) functionality is detailed in clause 5.2.1.3.\nIEC and ECUR scenarios are applicable for registration only.\nThe AMF charging profile is per UE and per AMF.\nThe default AMF charging profile is provided by the Charging Characteristics which is described in Annex A.\nDuring the UE registration lifetime in the AMF, the CHF may activate/deactivate charging for any AMF functionality (i.e. Registration, N2 connection, Location Reporting) each time the CHF is invoked for a given AMF functionality. The set of triggers enabled/disabled via charging activation/deactivation by CHF are independent from the invoked AMF functionality. The triggers activation/deactivation take effect at the next AMF functionality invoking the CHF.\nTable 5.2.1.2.3.1 describes the applicable messages for CHF to activate/deactivate triggers via update of AMF Charging profile:\nTable 5.2.1.2.3.1: AMF charging profile update by CHF\n\nIn ECUR scenario, any update of AMF Charging Profile received in Charging Data Response [Initial] will take effect after the corresponding Charging Data Response [Termination].\nAt UE initial registration in the AMF, the CHF may subscribe to changes of UE presence status(es) in PRA(s) in the Charging Data Response [Event, Registration] or Charging Data Response [Initial, Registration] respective IEC or ECUR scenarios. This subscription is performed, by activation of location reporting charging in the AMF charging profile with a list of PRAs supplied in addition.\nThe PRAs list may be composed of:\n-\tCore Network pre-configured Presence Reporting Area(s) identified by PRA Identifier(s);\n-\tUE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area(s) defined by a PRA Identifier(s) each provided with its elements.\nOnce location reporting charging is activated, the registration is completed, the AMF starts the location reporting procedure towards to NG-RAN specified in clause 4.10 of TS 23.502 [202] with parameters associated to the PRA(s), as described in clause 5.2.2.4.2.\nWhen a Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area(s) is detected for PRA(s) subscribed-to by the CHF, the AMF sends Charging Data Request [Event, location reporting] to CHF with the PRA Identifier(s) and indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting Area(s).\nThe CHF may update the list of Presence Reporting Area(s) subscription or remove the list of Presence Reporting Area(s), in any Charging Data Response [Event/Initial] as per table 5.2.1.2.3.1.\nThe AMF provides for NR RedCap UE using NR the RAT Type NR_REDCAP, according to clause 5.41 of TS 23.501 [200].\nA Public Network Integrated NPN (PNI-NPN), i.e. a non-public network deployed with the support of a PLMN, is specified in clause 5.30.3 of TS 23.501 [200]. End user charging for PNI-NPN network usage of access is based on registration management charging in AMF.\nThe AMF can collect charging information including CAG Identifier(s) per UE registration to the 5GS, if available, and sends it to CHF. The CAG information of the UE is included in the subscription as part of the Mobility Restrictions as defined in clause 5.30.3 of TS 23.501 [200]:\n-\tan Allowed CAG list i.e. a list of CAG Identifiers the UE is allowed to access; and\n-\toptionally, a CAG-only indication whether the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells.\nThe charging information collected by AMF can also be S-NSSAI or dedicated DNNs, or dedicated DNN and S-NSSAI combination.\nA Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN), i.e. operated by an NPN operator and not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN, is specified in clause 5.30.2 of TS 23.501 [200].\nEnd user charging for SNPN network usage of access is based on registration management charging in AMF. The AMF collects charging information including SNPN ID (PLMN ID and NID identifying an SNPN) per UE registration to the 5GS.\nThe AMF determines and reports the RAT type for NR satellite access, i.e. NR(LEO), NR(MEO), NR(GEO) and NR(OTHERSAT).\nThe AMF may initiate Network-initiated Deregistration if it detects that the UE's registered PLMN is not allowed to operate in the present UE location.\nIf N2 Context Release Request cause indicates the release is requested due to a UE using satellite access moved out of PLMN serving area, the AMF may deregister the UE, described in clause 5.2.2.2.8 Network-initiated Deregistration before continuing with the AN Release procedure in Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1.\n\n",
