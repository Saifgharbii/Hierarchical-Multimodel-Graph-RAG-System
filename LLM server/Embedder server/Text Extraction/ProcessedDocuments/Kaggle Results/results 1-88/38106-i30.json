                            "text_content": "The NCR-MT supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or downlink in this release. From a BS perspective, different NCR-MT channel bandwidths may be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from NCR-MT connected to the BS. Transmission of multiple carriers to different NCR-MT within the BS channel bandwidth can be supported.\nFrom a NCR-MT perspective, the NCR-MT per passband is configured with one carrier and NCR-MT is configured with one more BWP. The NCR-MT does not need to be aware of the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS allocates bandwidth to different NCR-MT.\nThe placement of the NCR-MT channel bandwidth for NCR-MT carrier is flexible but can only be completely within the NCR-Fwd passband.\nThe relationship between the NCR-MT channel bandwidth, the guardband and the transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in Figure 5.4.1-1.\nFigure 5 illustrates the relationship between channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth configuration for one NR (New Radio) channel. The figure shows that the channel bandwidth is defined as the range of frequencies over which the channel operates, while the transmission bandwidth is the range of frequencies used for data transmission. The figure also depicts the allocation of these bandwidths, with the channel bandwidth typically being larger than the transmission bandwidth to account for potential interference and noise. The figure is essential for understanding the performance and efficiency of NR channels in a wireless communication system.\nFigure 5.4.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth configuration for one NR channel\n",

In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe out-of-band emissions requirement for the Repeater transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).\nThe maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the operating band edge is ΔfOBUE. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating band of repeater type 1-C UL, plus the frequency ranges ΔfOBUE above and ΔfOBUE below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.\nThe values of ΔfOBUE are defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2 for the NR operating bands.\nTable 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink operating band of repeater type 1-C, NCR-Fwd type 1-C and NCR-Fwd type 1-H DL\n\nTable 6.5.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink operating band of repeater 1-C UL\n\nFor NCR-Fwd type 1-H the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the TAB connector TX min cell groups for all the configurations supported by the repeater. The basic limits and corresponding emissions scaling are defined in each relevant clause.\nThere is no co-location unwanted emission requirement for LA NCR-Fwd type 1-C and repeaters type 1-C deployed in Femto cell scenario.\n\n",

It applies for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.\nUnless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).\nFor Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over all antenna connectors for Repeater type 1-C shall not exceed the minimum requirements defined in clause 6.5.5.2.\n\nThe basic limits of either table 6.5.4.2.1-1, table 6.5.4.2.1-2 (Category A limits) or table 6.5.4.2.1-3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.5.3.\nTable 6.5.4.2.1-1: General transmitter spurious emission basic limits for DL in FR1, Category A\n\nTable 6.5.4.2.1-2: General transmitter spurious emission basic limits for UL in FR1, Category A\n\nTable 6.5.4.2.1-3: General transmitter spurious emission basic limits in FR1, Category B\n\nThese basic limits may be applied for the protection of system operating in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nThe spurious emission basic limits are provided in table 6.5.4.2.2-1 where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply for repeater type 1-C. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.5.4.2.2-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.5.4.2.2-1: Repeater type 1-C spurious emissions basic limits for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted basic limits apply to a repeater operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.5.4.2.3 -1 do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.5.5.2.3 -1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tFor unsynchronized operation, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor NR Band n28 repeater, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for repeater for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 5:\tFor NR Band n29 repeater, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for NR repeater for co-existence with UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band. ΔfOBUE is defined in clause 6.5.1.\nThe spurious emission basic limit for this requirement are:\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-2: Repeater spurious emissions basic limit for repeater for co-existence with PHS for DL\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR repeater operating in Band n50 and n75 within the 1432 – 1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and Band n76. The basic limit are specified in Table 6.5.4.2.3-4. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-4: Additional operating band unwanted emission basic limit for NR repeater operating in Band n50 and n75 within 1432 – 1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and n76\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to repeater operating in NR Band n50 and n75 within 1492-1517 MHz and in Band n74 within 1492-1518 MHz. The maximum level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies Ffilter with filter bandwidth according to Table 6.5.4.2.3-5, shall be defined according to the basic limits PEM,n50/n75,a nor PEM,n50/n75,b declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-5: Operating band n50, n74 and n75 declared emission above 1518 MHz\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band n13 and n14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-6: Repeater spurious emissions basic limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR repeater operating in Band n30. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-7: Additional NR repeater spurious emissions basic limits for Band n30\n\nThe following requirement may apply to repeater operating in Band n48 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-8: Additional repeater spurious emissions basic limits for Band n48\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nNOTE:\tThe regional requirement, included in [12], is defined in terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.\nThe following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-9: Repeater spurious emissions basic limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to Repeater for Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the Repeater downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the Repeater downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-10: Additional repeater spurious emissions basic limit for Band n41 and n90\n\nThe following requirement may apply to repeater operating in 3.45-3.55 GHz in Band n77 in certain regions. Basic limits are specified in table 6.5.4.2.3-11.\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-11: Additional repeater spurious emissions basic limits for Band n77\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nThe following requirement may also apply to repeater operating in Band n54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.5.4.2.3-12 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,n54,a, PEM,n54,b, PEM,n54,c, PEM,n54,d, PEM,n54,e and PEM,n54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-12: Declared Band n54 emissions basic limits for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419 are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the repeater unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the repeater antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT and repeater receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT, or repeater are co-located.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with same class.\nThe basic limits  are in table 6.5.4.2.3-1. Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared class. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.5.4.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.5.4.2.3-1: Spurious emissions minimum requirements for co-location with BS, IAB-Node or repeater-Node\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.5.4.2.4-1 do not apply for the frequency range extending ΔfOBUE immediately outside the transmit frequency range. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [3].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.5.4.2.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nThe Tx spurious emissions for repeater type 1-C for each antenna connector shall not exceed the basic limits specified in clause 6.5.4.2.\nFor Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over all antenna connectors for repeater type 1-C shall not exceed the basic limits defined in clause 6.6.4.2.\n6.5.4.4.1.1\tMinimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-C\nThe Tx spurious emissions for NCR-Fwd type 1-C for each antenna connector shall not exceed the basic limits specified in clause 6.5.4.2.\nFor Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over all antenna connectors for NCR-Fwd type 1-C shall not exceed the basic limits defined in clause 6.6.5.2.\nFor joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the spurious emissions limits shall apply to the total emissions from both the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.\n6.5.4.4.1.2\tMinimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-H\nThe Tx spurious emissions requirements for NCR-Fwd type 1-H are that for each TAB connector TX min cell group and each applicable basic limit in clause 6.5.4.2, the power summation emissions at the TAB connectors of the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell group shall not exceed a limit specified as the basic limit + X, where X = 10log10(NTXU,countedpercell) for DL and for WA UL and X=0 for LA UL, unless stated differently in regional regulation.\nNOTE:\tConformance to the NCR-Fwd type 1-H spurious emission requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:\n1) The sum of the emissions power measured on each TAB connector in the TAB connector TX min cell group shall be less than or equal to the limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.\nOr\n2) The unwanted emissions power at each TAB connector shall be less than or equal to the NCR-Fwd type 1-H limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log10(n), where n is the number of TAB connectors in the TAB connector TX min cell group.\nFor joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the spurious emissions limits shall apply to the total emissions from both the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.\n6.5.4.4.2.1\tMinimum requirements for NCR-MT type 1-C\nWhen NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the requirements in clause 6.6.4 of TS 38.104 applies for WA NCR-MT type 1-C and the requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for LA NCR-MT type 1-C.\nWhen NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for LA NCR-MT type 1-C for sum of NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.\n6.5.4.4.2.2\tMinimum requirements for NCR-MT type 1-H\nLimits for NCR-MT type 1-H apply to the sum of emissions across all TAB connectors.\nWhen WA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the requirements in clause 6.6.4 of TS 38.104 relaxed with the following scaling factor applies for WA NCR-MT type 1-H.\n10log(NTXU,counted), where NTXU,counted = min(NTXU,active ,8)\nWhen WA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements in clause 6.6.4 of TS 38.104 relaxed with the following scaling factor applies for the sum of NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.\nWhen LA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for LA NCR-MT type 1-H without scaling factor allowed for the sum of the spurious emissions.\nWhen NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for sum of NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.\n",

Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific beam peak direction.\nFor each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam identity, reference beam direction pair, beamwidth, rated beam EIRP, OTA peak directions set, the beam direction pairs at the maximum steering directions and their associated rated beam EIRP and beamwidth(s).\nFor a declared beam and beam direction pair, the rated beam EIRP level is the maximum power that the repeater is declared to radiate at the associated beam peak direction.\nFor each beam peak direction associated with a beam direction pair within the OTA peak directions set, a specific rated beam EIRP level may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as described below. Rated beam EIRP is only required to be declared for the beam direction pairs subject to conformance testing as detailed in TS 38.115-2 [8].\nNOTE 1:\tOTA peak directions set is set of beam peak directions for which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met.

If the NCR-MT is not provided with SMTC configuration then the NCR-MT may assume that the target SSB periodicity is no larger than 20 ms.\nTSI-NR: It is the time required for receiving all the relevant system information according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of system information blocks defined in TS 38.331 [23] for the target NR cell.\nTPRACH: It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH occasion in the target NR cell.
