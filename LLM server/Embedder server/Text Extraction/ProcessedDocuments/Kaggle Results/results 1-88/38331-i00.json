A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.\nFigure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the UE state machine and state transitions in NR, showcasing the various stages of a user equipment's interaction with a network. The figure begins with the initial state, where the UE is in a low power mode, ready to connect to the network. As the UE receives a connection request, it transitions into the active state, where it communicates with the network and other devices. In this state, the UE can send and receive data, and may also enter a low power mode to conserve energy. The figure also depicts the state where the UE is disconnected from the network, and the process of re-establishing a connection. The various states and transitions in the UE state machine are crucial for managing network resources and ensuring efficient communication.\nFigure 4.2.1-1:\tUE state machine and state transitions in NR\nFigure 4.2.1-2 illustrates an overview of UE state machine and state transitions in NR as well as the mobility procedures supported between NR/5GC, E-UTRA/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC.\nFigure 4.2.1-2 illustrates the UE state machine and the transitions between various network entities such as New Radio (NR), Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), and Evolved Packet Core (EPC). The figure showcases the different states a UE can be in, including the initial state, the state where it connects to the network, and the state where it is actively communicating. The transitions between these states are depicted, highlighting the complex interactions between the UE and the network. This figure is crucial for understanding the dynamic nature of a 5G network and how a UE moves through different stages of communication with the network.\nFigure 4.2.1-2:\tUE state machine and state transitions between NR/5GC, E-UTRA/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC\nFigure 4.2.1-3 illustrates the mobility procedure supported between NR/5GC and UTRA-FDD.\nFigure 4.2.1-3 illustrates the mobility procedure supported between NR/5GC and UTRA-FDD, showcasing the seamless handover process between the new radio access technology (NR) and the evolved universal terrestrial radio access (UTRA) frequency division duplex (FDD) networks. The figure highlights the synchronization and signaling mechanisms, including the use of the Non-Standalone (NSA) and Standalone (SA) modes, to ensure optimal performance and minimal latency for mobile users. The figure also emphasizes the importance of the 5G core network (5GC) in managing the complex handover procedures and maintaining a high level of service quality for the end-users.\nFigure 4.2.1-3:\tMobility procedure supported between NR/5GC and UTRA-FDD\n\n",

More specifically, the following SRBs are defined:\n-\tSRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;\n-\tSRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;\n-\tSRB2 is for NAS messages and for RRC messages which include logged measurement information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security activation;\n-\tSRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC, all using DCCH logical channel;\n-\tSRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB4 has a lower priority than SRB1 and can only be configured by the network after AS security activation.\n-\tSRB5 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB5 has a lower priority than SRB1 and SRB3 and can only be configured by the SN serving the SCG when the UE is in NR-DC, after AS security activation.\nIn downlink, piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e. with joint success/failure) procedure: bearer establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS message is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and connection resume.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.\nOnce AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2, SRB3, SRB4 and SRB5, including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].\nSplit SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options as well as MP in both SRB1 and SRB2 (split SRB is not supported for SRB0, SRB3, SRB4 and SRB5).\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, SRB0, SRB1 and SRB3 are assigned with the highest priority Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC), (i.e. CAPC = 1) while CAPC for SRB2 is configurable.\n",

The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframes as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according to the period of SSB;\nNOTE 1:\tIf the period of SSB is larger than 80 ms, the MIB is transmitted with the same periodicity as that of SSB.\n-\tthe SIB1 is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms and variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13. The default transmission repetition periodicity of SIB1 is 20 ms but the actual transmission repetition periodicity is up to network implementation. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, SIB1 repetition transmission period is 20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2/3, SIB1 transmission repetition period is the same as the SSB period (TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). SIB1 includes information regarding the availability and scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity, SI-window size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are only provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE to perform the SI request. SIB1 is cell-specific SIB;\n-\tSIBs other than SIB1 and posSIBs are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs or posSIBs having the same periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. SIBs and posSIBs are mapped to different SI messages, i.e. an SI message contains either only SIBs or only posSIBs. Each SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows with same length for all SI messages). Each SI message is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI message is transmitted. An SI message may be repeated with the same content a number of times within the SI-window. Any SIB or posSIB except SIB1 can be configured to be cell specific or area specific, using an indication in SIB1. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within a cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable within an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several cells and is identified by systemInformationAreaID;\n-\tThe mapping of SIBs to SI messages is configured in schedulingInfoList and schedulingInfoList2, while the mapping of posSIBs to SI messages is configured in posSchedulingInfoList and schedulingInfoList2.\nEach SIB and each posSIB is mapped to a single SI message. posSIBs of the same posSibType carrying GNSS Generic Assistance Data for different GNSS/SBAS (identified by gnss-id/sbas-id, see TS 37.355 [49]) are mapped to different SI messages.\nEach SIB and posSIB is contained at most once in an SI message.\nFor SIBs and posSIBs with segments, the segments contained in SI messages are transmitted according to the SI message periodicity, with one segment of a particular sibType/posSibType in each SI message;\n-\tFor a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the network can provide system information through dedicated signalling using the RRCReconfiguration message, e.g. if the UE has an active BWP with no common search space configured to monitor system information, paging, or upon request from the UE.\n-\tFor PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by dedicated signalling, i.e. within an RRCReconfiguration message. Nevertheless, the UE shall acquire MIB of the PSCell to get SFN timing of the SCG (which may be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI for SCell, the network releases and adds the concerned SCell. For PSCell, the required SI can only be changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.\nNOTE 2:\tThe physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. The maximum SIB1 or SI message size is 2976 bits.\n",

The figure depicts the various components involved, including the system information acquisition module, which is responsible for collecting data from different parts of the system. This data is then transmitted to the central processing unit, which analyzes the information and uses it to optimize the system's performance. The figure also shows how the system can be integrated with external databases and applications, allowing for seamless data exchange and analysis. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the system's information acquisition process, highlighting its importance in ensuring the efficient operation of the telecommunication system.\nFigure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition\nThe UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS, NAS- and positioning assistance data information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.\nThe UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at least) the MIB, SIB1 through SIB4, SIB5 (if the UE supports E-UTRA), SIB11 (if the UE is configured for idle/inactive measurements), SIB12 (if UE is capable of NR sidelink communication/discovery and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery), and SIB13, SIB14 (if UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication), SIB15 (if UE is configured by upper layers to report disaster roaming related information), SIB16 (if the UE is capable of slice-based cell reselection and the UE receives NSAG information for cell reselection from upper layer), SIB17 (if the UE is using TRS resources for power saving in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE), SIB19 (if UE is accessing NR via NTN access) and SIB22 (for ATG access).\nThe UE capable of MBS broadcast which is receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) via a broadcast MRB shall ensure having a valid version of SIB20, regardless of the RRC state the UE is in.\nThe UE shall ensure having a valid version of the posSIB requested by upper layers.\nThe UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification, upon receiving request (e.g., a positioning request) from upper layers; and whenever the UE does not have a valid version of a stored SIB or posSIB or a valid version of a requested SIB.\nWhen the UE acquires a MIB or a SIB1 or an SI message in a serving cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList for non-NPN-only cells or the first NPN identity (SNPN identity in case of SNPN, or PNI-NPN identity in case of PNI-NPN) in the NPN-IdentityInfoList for NPN-only cells, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, and the valueTag, if present, as indicated in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB. If the UE stores the acquired posSIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, the valueTag, if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, and the expirationTime if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element. The UE may use a valid stored version of the SI except MIB, SIB1, SIB6, SIB7 or SIB8 e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after the reception of SI change indication. The valueTag and expirationTime for posSIB is optionally provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, as specified in TS 37.355 [49].\nA L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE can inform the interested SIB(s) to the connected L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.8.2 and receive the SIB(s) from the L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.9.3. A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED receives SIB1 and other SIB(s) in RRCReconfiguration message and performs on-demand SI request if required, as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.5 and 5.2.2.3.6. The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED is not required to obtain SI over Uu interface, but it may decide to perform the SI acquisition procedure over Uu interface as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 by UE implementation.\nNOTE:\tThe storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tdelete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid;\n1>\tfor each stored version of a SIB:\n2>\tif the areaScope is associated and its value for the stored version of the SIB is the same as the value received in the si-SchedulingInfo for that SIB from the serving cell:\n3>\tif the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:\n4>\tif the first NPN identity included in the NPN-IdentityInfoList, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the NPN identity, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:\n5>\tconsider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;\n3>\telse if the first PLMN-Identity included in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the PLMN-Identity, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:\n4>\tconsider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;\n2>\tif the areaScope is not present for the stored version of the SIB and the areaScope value is not included in the si-SchedulingInfo for that SIB from the serving cell:\n3>\tif the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:\n4>\tif the first NPN identity in the NPN-IdentityInfoList, the cellIdentity and valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the NPN identity, the cellIdentity and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:\n5>\tconsider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;\n3>\telse if the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the cellIdentity and valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the PLMN-Identity, the cellIdentity and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:\n4>\tconsider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;\n1>\tfor each stored version of a posSIB:\n2>\tif the areaScope is associated and its value for the stored version of the posSIB is the same as the value received in the posSIB-MappingInfo for that posSIB from the serving cell and the systemInformationAreaID included in the si-SchedulingInfo is identical to the systemInformationAreaID associated with the stored version of that posSIB:\n3>\tif the valueTag (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the serving cell is identical to the valueTag associated with the stored version of that posSIB; or if the expirationTime (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated with the stored posSIB has not been expired:\n4>\tconsider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;\n2>\tif the areaScope is not present for the stored version of the posSIB and the areaScope value is not included in the posSIB-MappingInfo for that posSIB from the serving cell and the cellIdentity for the posSIB received from the serving cell is identical to the cellIdentity associated with the stored version of that posSIB:\n3>\tif the valueTag (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the serving cell is identical to the valueTag associated with the stored version of that posSIB; or if the expirationTime (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated with the stored posSIB has not been expired:\n4>\tconsider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;\nA modification period is used, i.e. updated SI message (other than SI message for ETWS, CMAS, positioning assistance data, and some NTN-specific information as specified in the field descriptions ) is broadcasted in the modification period following the one where SI change indication is transmitted. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m = 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information. If H-SFN is provided in SIB1, and UE is configured with eDRX, modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m = 0.\nFor UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE configured to use an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period, an eDRX acquisition period is defined. The boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 1024 = 0.\nThe UE receives indications about SI modifications and/or PWS notifications using Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within preceding modification period or within preceding eDRX acquisition period. SI change indication is not applicable for SI messages containing posSIBs.\nUEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing shall monitor for SI change indication in its own paging occasion(s) that the UE monitors as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period if the UE is provided with common search space, including pagingSearchSpace, searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, on the active BWP to monitor paging, as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13.\nUEs in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is ongoing shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period, if the initial downlink BWP on which the SDT procedure is ongoing is associated with a CD-SSB.\nDuring a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or stopped, the SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in posSchedulingInfoList may change, so the UE might not be able to successfully receive those posSIBs in the remainder of the current modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling information received prior to the change.\nETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing shall monitor for indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion(s) that the UE monitors as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every defaultPagingCycle if the UE is provided with common search space, including pagingSearchSpace, searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, on the active BWP to monitor paging.\nETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is ongoing shall monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every defaultPagingCycle, if the initial downlink BWP on which the SDT procedure is ongoing is associated with a CD-SSB.\nFor Short Message reception in a paging occasion, the UE monitors the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for paging as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 38.213 [13].\nA L2 U2N Remote UE is not required to monitor paging occasion for SI modifications and/or PWS notifications. It obtains the updated system information and SIB6/7/8 from the connected L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.9.3.\nIf the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:\n1>\tif the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, the etwsAndCmasIndication bit of Short Message is set, and the UE is provided with searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation on the active BWP or the initial BWP:\n2> immediately re-acquire the SIB1;\n2>\tif the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB6:\n3>\tacquire SIB6, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;\n2>\tif the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB7:\n3>\tacquire SIB7, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;\n2>\tif the UE is CMAS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB8:\n3>\tacquire SIB8, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;\nNOTE:\tIn case SIB6, SIB7, or SIB8 overlap with a measurement gap it is left to UE implementation how to immediately acquire SIB6, SIB7, or SIB8.\n1>\tif the UE does not operate an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period and the systemInfoModification bit of Short Message is set:\n2>\tapply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the start of the next modification period;\n1>\tif the UE operates an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period and the systemInfoModification-eDRX bit of Short Message is set:\n2>\tapply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the start of the next eDRX acquisition period boundary.\n\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tapply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;\n1>\tif the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or\n1>\tif the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:\n2>\tacquire the MIB, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];\n2>\tif the UE is unable to acquire the MIB;\n3>\tperform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;\n2>\telse:\n3>\tperform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.\n1>\tif the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and pagingSearchSpace and has received an indication about change of system information; or\n1>\tif the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, UE has not acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or\n1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1, and, the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, si-BroadcastStatus for the required SIB(s) or posSI-BroadcastStatus for the required posSIB(s) is set to notBroadcasting in acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or\n1>\tif the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or\n1>\tif the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:\n2>\tif ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates SIB1 is transmitted in the cell (TS 38.213 [13]) and if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE:\n3>\tacquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];\n3>\tif the UE is unable to acquire the SIB1:\n4>\tperform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;\n3>\telse:\n4>\tupon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.\n2>\telse if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE and ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is not scheduled in the cell:\n3>\tperform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 and MBS broadcast if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception, i.e., the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located. The UE in RRC_INACTIVE state while SDT procedure is ongoing, is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 and MIB if the UE can acquire them without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.\nNOTE 2:\tUE in RRC_INACTIVE that does not support inactiveStateNTN-r17 enters RRC_IDLE upon cell reselection between TN cell and NTN cell, and initiates the NAS signalling connection recovery (see TS 24.501 [23]).\nFor SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined according to searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on search space indicated by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the SI window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion (s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI messages is up to UE implementation.\nWhen acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:\n1>\tdetermine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as follows:\n2>\tif the concerned

                            "text_content": "RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The network completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful AS security activation. However, the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message when AS security has been activated.\nUpon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate AS security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2, DRBs and multicast MRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered. After having initiated the initial AS security activation procedure, the network may initiate the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs and/or multicast MRBs, i.e. the network may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial AS security activation from the UE. In any case, the network will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2, DRBs and/or multicast MRBs. The network should release the RRC connection if the initial AS security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails. A configuration with SRB2 without DRB or multicast MRB, or with DRB or multicast MRB without SRB2 is not supported (i.e., SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB must be configured in the same RRC Reconfiguration message, and it is not allowed to release all the DRBs and multicast MRBs without releasing the RRC Connection). For IAB-MT and NCR-MT, a configuration with SRB2 without any DRB/MRB is supported.\nThe release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA carrier frequency.\nThe suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered.\nThe resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN or for SDT. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s) and/or multicast MRB(s), if configured.\nUpon initiating the resume procedure for SDT, AS security (both ciphering and integrity protection) is re-activated for SRB2 (if configured for SDT) and for SRB1. In addition, AS security is also re-activated (if security is configured) for all the DRBs configured for SDT. Further, the PDCP entities of SRB1 and PDCP entities of the radio bearers configured for SDT are re-established and resumed whilst the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE state. Transmission and reception of data and/or signalling messages over radio bearers configured for SDT can happen whilst the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state and SDT procedure is ongoing.\nIn response to a request to resume the RRC connection or in response to a resume procedure initiated for SDT, the network may resume the suspended RRC connection and send UE to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE (with a wait timer), or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery (in this case the network sends an RRC setup message).\nNOTE:\tIn case the UE receives the configurations for NR sidelink communication via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in clause 5.3 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331[10], respectively.\nAS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).\nRRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled for a DRB and two parameters, namely the keySetChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change), connection re-establishment and/or connection resume.\nThe integrity protection algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured), SRB4 (if configured), SRB5 (if configured) and DRBs configured with integrity protection, with the same keyToUse value. The ciphering algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured), SRB4 (if configured), SRB5 (if configured) and DRBs configured with the same keyToUse value. Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.\nNOTE 0:\tAll DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same enable/disable setting for ciphering and the same enable/disable setting for integrity protection, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].\nRRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering for SRBs are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (nea0).\nThe 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (nia0) is used only for SRBs and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 [11] and when used for SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case the ′NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.\nNOTE 1:\tLower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity protection check has failed and indicate the integrity protection verification check failure to RRC.\nThe AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc), one for integrity protection of user data (KUPint) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All four AS keys are derived from the KgNB key. The KgNB key is based on the KAMF key (as specified in TS 33.501 [11]), which is handled by upper layers.\nThe integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed with reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint and KUPenc) change upon reconfiguration with sync (if masterKeyUpdate is included), and upon connection re-establishment and connection resume.\nFor each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio bearer, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering and integrity protection.\nIt is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. As specified in TS 33.501 clause 6.9.4.1 [11], the network is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers and multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g. use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key, or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED transition.\nIn order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (HFN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the network.\nFor each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.\nFor a UE provided with an sk-counter, keyToUse indicates whether the UE uses the master key (KgNB) or the secondary key (S-KeNB or S-KgNB) for a particular DRB. The secondary key is derived from the master key and sk-Counter, as defined in TS 33.501[11]. Whenever there is a need to refresh the secondary key, e.g. upon change of MN with KgNB change or to avoid COUNT reuse, the security key update is used (see 5.3.5.7). When the UE is in NR-DC, the network may provide a UE configured with an SCG with an sk-Counter even when no DRB is setup using the secondary key (S-KgNB) in order to allow the configuration of SRB3. The network can also provide the UE with an sk-Counter, even if no SCG is configured, when using SN terminated MCG bearers.\n",

The figure depicts the various stages of the reconfiguration process, including the initial state, the process of configuration, and the final state. Key components of the figure include the RRC (Radio Resource Control) module, the RRC connection manager, and the RRC connection setup procedure.

The figure depicts the relationship between the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol and the underlying network layers, including the User Equipment (UE) and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS). The RRC protocol is responsible for managing the communication between the UE and the BTS, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the communication process.\n\nThe figure shows the various stages of RRC reconfiguration, which involve the exchange of control messages between the UE and the BTS. These messages are used to update the RRC parameters, such as the radio bearer parameters and the authentication parameters, in order to improve the performance of the communication link. The figure also highlights the potential failure scenarios that can occur during the RRC reconfiguration process, such as a network outage or a communication error.\n\nOverall, Figure 5.3.5.1-2 provides a comprehensive overview of the RRC reconfiguration process and its impact on the overall performance of the telecommunication system.

The flowchart begins with the input of data, which is then processed through a series of checks and verifications. The final output is the result of the counter check, which is essential for ensuring accurate and reliable communication. The figure highlights the importance of thorough and systematic procedures in maintaining the quality and security of telecommunication systems.\nFigure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure\nThe counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB.

The figure showcases the various stages of re-establishing a radio link connection, starting from the initial connection attempt, followed by the handover process, and finally the successful re-establishment of the connection. The figure highlights the role of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol in ensuring reliable communication between the mobile device and the network. Key components include the mobile station (MS), home base station (H-BTS), and the network elements involved in the handover process. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient handover management in maintaining seamless connectivity for mobile users.\nFigure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful\n\nFigure 5.3.7.1-2 illustrates the process of RRC re-establishment and fallback in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts the sequence of events that occur when a radio resource control (RRC) connection is lost, and the system must revert to the RRC establishment process. The visual representation shows the various stages, including the initial RRC connection, the subsequent loss of the connection, and the successful re-establishment of the RRC. Key components such as the mobile station (MS), the radio network controller (RNC), and the home location register (HLR) are highlighted, emphasizing the complex interactions between these entities during the RRC re-establishment process.\nFigure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment, successful\nThe purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least one DRB/multicast MRB setup or, for IAB and NCR, SRB2, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an RRCSetup according to clause 5.3.3.4.\nThe network applies the procedure e.g as follows:\n-\tWhen AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies the UE context:\n-\tto re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;\n-\tto re-establish and resume the SRB1;\n-\tWhen UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context:\n-\tto discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs and BH RLC channels and Uu Relay RLC channels;\n-\tto fallback to establish a new RRC connection.\nIf AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'other'. If AS security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB and NCR, SRB2, are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.\nThe UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:\n1>\tupon detecting radio link failure of the MCG and t316 is not

Associated with this measurement object, the network may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'exclude-listed' cells and a list of 'allow-listed' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting. Allow-listed cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.\n-\tThe measObjectId of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is indicated by servingCellMO within the serving cell configuration.\n-\tFor inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the network can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of 'exclude-listed' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.\n-\tFor inter-RAT UTRA-FDD measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA-FDD carrier frequency.\n-\tFor NR sidelink measurements of L2 U2N Relay UEs, a measurement object is a single NR sidelink frequency to be measured.\n-\tFor CBR measurement of NR sidelink communication, a measurement object is a set of transmission resource pool(s) on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink communication.\n-\tFor CBR measurement of NR sidelink discovery, a measurement object is a set of discovery dedicated resource pool(s) or transmission resource pool(s) also used for NR sidelink discovery on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink discovery.\n-\tFor CBR measurement of NR sidelink positioning, a measurement object is a set of positioning dedicated resource pool(s) or transmission resource pool(s) also used for NR sidelink positioning on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink positioning.\n-\tFor CLI measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time location of SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources, and subcarrier spacing of SRS resources to be measured.\n2.\tReporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object. Each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:\n-\tReporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.\n-\tRS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).\n-\tReporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE includes in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated information such as the maximum number of cells and the maximum number beams per cell to report.\nIn case of conditional reconfiguration, each configuration consists of the following:\n-\tExecution criteria: The criteria the UE uses for conditional reconfiguration execution.\n-\tRS type: The RS that the UE uses for obtaining beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block-based or CSI-RS-based), used for evaluating conditional reconfiguration execution condition.\n3.\tMeasurement identities: For measurement reporting, a list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities, it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger configuration. And up to 2 measurement identities can be linked to one conditional reconfiguration execution condition.\n4.\tQuantity configurations: The quantity configuration defines the measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For NR measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a reference in the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be used. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for measurements per cell and per beam.\n5.\tMeasurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements.\n6.\tEffective measurement window: Periods that the UE may use to perform inter RAT measurements.\nA UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification. The measurement object list possibly includes NR measurement object(s), CLI measurement object(s), inter-RAT objects, and L2 U2N Relay objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes NR, inter-RAT, and L2 U2N Relay reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.\nThe measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:\n1.\tThe NR serving cell(s) – these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.\n2.\tListed cells – these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).\n3.\tDetected cells – these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies) and subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).\nFor NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s)/serving Relay UE (for L2 U2N Remote UE), listed cells and/or detected cells. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and detected cells and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on the configured resources on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of UTRA-FDD, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For CLI measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on configured measurement resources (i.e. SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources). For L2 U2N Relay object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving NR cell(s), as well as the discovered L2 U2N Relay UEs.\nWhenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.\nIn NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent measConfig:\n-\ta measConfig, associated with MCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1; and\n-\ta measConfig, associated with SCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB3, or, alternatively, included within a RRCReconfiguration message embedded in a RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1.\nIn this case, the UE maintains two independent VarMeasConfig and VarMeasReportList, one associated with each measConfig, and independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.5 for each measConfig and the associated VarMeasConfig and VarMeasReportList, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nThe configurations related to CBR measurements are only included in the measConfig associated with MCG.\nThe configurations related to Rx-Tx time difference measurement are only included in the measConfig associated with MCG.\n",

For all cell measurement results, except for RSSI, and CLI measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria, measurement reporting or the criteria to trigger conditional reconfiguration execution. For cell measurements, the network can configure RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSCP or EcN0 as trigger quantity. For CLI measurements, the network can configure SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI as trigger quantity. For cell and beam measurements, reporting quantities can be any combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR; only RSCP; only EcN0; RSCP and EcN0), irrespective of the trigger quantity, and for CLI measurements, reporting quantities can be either SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI. For conditional reconfiguration execution, the network can configure up to 2 quantities, both using same RS type. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the CBR measurements. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the Rx-Tx time difference measurements.\nThe network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2.

The figure depicts the various stages of the process, including the initial connection setup, data exchange, and authentication procedures. Key components such as the eNodeB, UE, and the network server are highlighted, emphasizing their roles in facilitating the capability transfer. The figure also highlights the importance of security measures, such as encryption and authentication protocols, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the transferred data. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the UE capability transfer process, showcasing the intricate interplay between different network entities and the critical role of security in modern telecommunications.\nFigure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer\nThe network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information.

The UE shall ensure that the feature set IDs are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries with the same fields with the same values, i.e. UE-CapabilityRequestFilterNR, UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon and fields in UECapabilityEnquiry message (i.e. requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC, requestedCapabilityNR, eutra-nr-only flag, and requestedCapabilityCommon) as defined in TS 36.331, where applicable.\nNOTE 1:\tCapability enquiry without frequencyBandListFilter is not supported.\nNOTE 2:\tIn (NG)EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types nr and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSets in the UE-NR-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types eutra and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSetsEUTRA in the UE-EUTRA-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the E-UTRA UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used in the featureSets must match the IDs referred to in featureSetCombinations across all three containers. The requirement on consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set combinations.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tif the UE is an eRedCap UE, the UE may in the remainder of this procedure assume frequencyBandListFilter to be the filter containing all the supported bands of the UE;\n1>\tcompile a list of \"candidate band combinations\" according to the filter criteria in capabilityRequestFilterCommon (if included), only consisting of bands included in frequencyBandListFilter, and prioritized in the order of frequencyBandListFilter (i.e. first include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination, the parameters of the band do not exceed maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL, maxCarriersRequestedUL, ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;\n1>\tfor each band combination included in the list of \"candidate band combinations\":\n2>\tif the network (E-UTRA) included the eutra-nr-only field, or\n2>\tif the requested rat-Type is eutra:\n3>\tremove the NR-only band combination from the list of \"candidate band combinations\";\nNOTE 4:\tThe (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for nr but indicate with the eutra-nr-only flag that the UE shall not include any NR band combinations in the UE-NR-Capability.

For unicast, the PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between a pair of a Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in the AS. The PC5-RRC signalling, as specified in clause 5.8.9, can be initiated after its corresponding PC5 unicast link establishment (TS 23.287 [55]). The PC5-RRC connection and the corresponding sidelink SRBs and sidelink DRB(s) are released when the PC5 unicast link is released as indicated by upper layers.\nFor each PC5-RRC connection of unicast, one sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB0) is used to transmit the PC5-S message(s) before the PC5-S security has been established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB1) is used to transmit the PC5-S messages to establish the PC5-S security. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB2) is used to transmit the PC5-S messages after the PC5-S security has been established, which is protected. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB3) is used to transmit the PC5-RRC signalling, which is protected and only sent after the PC5-S security has been established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB4) is used to transmit/receive the NR sidelink discovery messages.\nFor unicast of NR sidelink communication, AS security comprises of integrity protection of PC5 signalling (SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs), and it further comprises of ciphering of PC5 signaling (SL-SRB1 only for the Direct Link Security Mode Complete message as specified in TS 24.587 [57] for V2X service or TS 24.554 [72] for Proximity-services, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs). The ciphering and integrity protection algorithms and parameters for a PC5 unicast link are exchanged by PC5-S messages in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], and applied to the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in the AS. Once AS security is activated for a PC5 unicast link in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], all messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and/or user data on SL-DRBs of the corresponding PC5-RRC connection are integrity protected and/or ciphered by the PDCP.\nFor unicast of NR sidelink communication, if the change of the key is indicated by the upper layers as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or TS 24.554 [72], UE re-establishes the PDCP entity of the SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3 and SL-DRBs on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case the configurations for NR sidelink communication are acquired via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in clause 5.8 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], respectively.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this release, there is one-to-one correspondence between the PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 38.300[2].\nNOTE 3:\tAll SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same activation/deactivation setting for ciphering and the same activation/deactivation setting for integrity protection as specified in TS 33.536 [60].\nNOTE 4:\tWhen integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers [57].\nNOTE 5:\tThe selection of NULL algorithms means that the PC5 messages are considered protected for the purposes of being allowed to be sent or received.\n",

When UE transmits SL-PRS in dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, the sidelink DRX configuration is not applied.\nFor sidelink unicast, if both a RX UE and its peer TX UE for a direction of sidelink communication are capable of sidelink DRX, the RX UE that is interested in sending the sidelink DRX assistance information may send the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink as the sidelink DRX assistance information to its peer UE when the sidelink DRX assistance information has not been sent previously or when the previously transmitted sidelink DRX assistance information has changed.\nFor sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1, it may report the sidelink DRX assistance information received within the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink from its peer UE to the network as specified in 5.8.3. For sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 2 or is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or out of coverage, regardless of whether the UE has obtained the sidelink DRX assistance information from the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink transmitted from its peer UE or not, it may determine the sidelink DRX configuration SL-DRX-ConfigUC for its peer UE.\nNOTE:\tWhen UE determines the sidelink DRX configuration for its peer UE, it may take the sidelink DRX assistance information received from its peer UE into account.\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tif the PC5 Relay RLC channel release was triggered after the reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message; or\n1>\tafter receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the PC5 Relay RLC channel release was triggered due to the configuration received within the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR; or\n1> for unicast in L2 U2U relay operation, if there is no end-to-end sidelink DRB(s) associated with this RLC channel:\n2>\tfor each SL-RLC-ChannelID in sl-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList received in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration, or for each SL-RLC-ChannelID included in the received sl-RLC-ChannelToReleaseListPC5 that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration, or for the RLC channel to be released:\n3>\trelease the RLC entity and the corresponding logical channel associated with the SL-RLC-ChannelID;\n1>\tif the PC5 Relay RLC channel release was triggered for a specific destination by upper layers as specified in 5.8.9.5, or for a specific destination corresponding to the received sl-DestinationIdentityRemoteUE by upper layers as specified in 5.8.9.10.4, or due to sidelink RLF as specified in 5.8.9.3:\n2>\trelease the RLC entity and the corresponding logical channel associated with the SL-RLC-ChannelID of the specific destination;\nUpon PC5-RRC connection establishment between the L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE shall:\n1>\testablish a SRAP entity as specified in TS 38.351 [66], if no SRAP entity has been established;\n1>\tapply RLC specified configuration of SL-RLC0 as specified in clause 9.1.1.4:\n1>\tapply RLC default configuration of SL-RLC1 as defined in clause 9.2.4 if the L2 U2N Relay UE is in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE state;\nUpon PC5-RRC connection establishment between the L2 U2U Remote UE and L2 U2U Relay UE, and PC5-RRC connection establishment between the L2 U2U Relay UE and peer L2 U2U Remote UE, the L2 U2U Remote UE or L2 U2U Relay UE shall:\n1>\testablish a SRAP entity as specified in TS 38.351 [66], if no SRAP entity has been established;\n1>\tapply RLC specified configuration of SL-U2U-RLC as specified in clause 9.1.1.4;\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tif the PC5 Relay RLC channel addition/modification was triggered due to the reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message; or\n1>\tafter receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the PC5 Relay RLC channel addition/modification was triggered due to the configuration received within the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR; or\n1>\tafter receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the PC5 Relay RLC channel addition/modification was triggered for an end-to-end sidelink DRB based on the configuration in SIB12 or SidelinkPreconfigNR:\n2>\tif the current configuration contains a PC5 Relay RLC channel with the received sl-RLC-ChannelID or sl-RLC-ChannelID-PC5; or\n2>\tif the configuration in SIB12 or SidelinkPreconfigNR has updated, based on which the PC5 Relay RLC channel is derived:\n3>\treconfigure the sidelink RLC entity in accordance with the received sl-RLC-Config or sl-RLC-ConfigPC5;\n3>\treconfigure the sidelink MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance with the received sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfig or sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfigPC5;\n2>\telse (a PC5 Relay RLC channel with the received sl-RLC-ChannelID or sl-RLC-ChannelID-PC5 was not configured before):\n3>\testablish a sidelink RLC entity in accordance with the received sl-RLC-Config (in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, or SIB12, or SidelinkPreconfigNR) or sl-RLC-ConfigPC5;\n3>\tconfigure the sidelink MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance with the received sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfig or sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfigPC5.\nFigure 5.8.9.8 .1-1 presents a detailed overview of remote user equipment (UE) information in a telecommunication network.

The diagram emphasizes the efficient and secure communication between vehicles, enabling real-time data sharing and enhancing road safety.\nFigure 5.8.9.9.1-1: Uu message transfer in sidelink\nThe purpose of this procedure is to transfer Paging message and System Information from the L2 U2N Relay UE to the L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE.\nThe L2 U2N Relay UE initiates the Uu message transfer procedure when at least one of the following conditions is met:\n1>\tupon receiving Paging message related to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE from network (including Paging message within RRCReconfiguration message);\n1>\tupon acquisition of the SIB(s) requested by the connected L2 U2N Remote UE (as indicated in sl-RequestedSIB-List in the RemoteUEInformationSidelink) or upon receiving the updated SIB(s) from network which has been requested by the connected L2 U2N Remote UE;\n1>\tupon acquisition of the posSIB(s) requested by the connected L2 U2N Remote UE (as indicated in sl-RequestedPosSIB-List in the RemoteUEInformationSidelink) or upon receiving the updated posSIB(s) from network which have been requested by the connected L2 U2N Remote UE;\n1>\tupon unsolicited SIB1 forwarding to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE or upon receiving the updated SIB1 from network;\nFor each associated L2 U2N Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE shall set the contents of UuMessageTransferSidelink message as follows:\n1>\tinclude sl-PagingDelivery if the Paging message received from network containing the ue-Identity of the L2 U2N Remote UE;\n1>\tinclude sl-SIB1-Delivery if any of the conditions for initiating Uu message transfer procedure related to SIB1 are met;\n1>\tinclude sl-SystemInformationDelivery if any of the conditions for initiating Uu message transfer procedure related to System Information are met;\n1>\tsubmit the UuMessageTransferSidelink message to lower layers for transmission.\nNOTE:\tThe L2 U2N Relay UE may perform unsolicited forwarding of SIB1 to the L2 U2N Remote UE based on UE implementation.\nUpon receiving the UuMessageTransferSidelink message, the L2 U2N Remote UE shall:\n1>\tif sl-PagingDelivery is included:\n2>\tperform the paging reception procedure as specified in clause 5.3.2.3;\n1>\tif sl-SystemInformationDelivery and/or sl-SIB1-Delivery is included:\n2>\tperform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.\nFigure 5.8.9.8 .1-1: Notification message in sidelink\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the process of a notification message being transmitted in sidelink, which is a feature of LTE-based communication systems. The figure shows the message being sent from the eNodeB to the UE, with intermediate nodes involved in the process. The figure highlights the importance of sidelink in providing reliable communication even in areas with poor signal strength, as it allows for direct communication between devices without relying on the main network. The figure also shows how sidelink can be used for various applications such as device-to-device communication and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.\nFigure 5.8.9.8.1-1: Notification message in sidelink\nThis procedure is used by a U2N Relay UE to send notification to the connected U2N Remote UE, or used by a U2U Relay UE to send notification to the peer connected U2U Remote UE when condition(s) as specified in 5.8.9.10.2 is met with the connected U2U Remote UE.\nThe Relay UE may initiate the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:\n1>\tif the UE is acting as U2N Relay UE:\n2>\tupon Uu RLF as specified in 5.3.10;\n2>\tupon reception of an RRCReconfiguration including the reconfigurationWithSync;\n2>\tupon cell reselection;\n2>\tupon L2 U2N Relay UE's RRC connection failure including RRC connection reject as specified in 5.3.3.5 and 5.3.13.10, and T300 expiry as specified in 5.3.3.7, and RRC resume failure as specified in 5.3.13.5;\n1>\tif the UE is acting as L2 U2U Relay UE:\n2>\tupon detection of PC5 RLF with L2 U2U Remote UE as specified in 5.8.9.3;\nThe Relay UE shall set the indication type as follows:\n1>\tif the UE is acting as U2N Relay UE:\n2>\tif the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to Uu RLF:\n3>\tset the indicationType as relayUE-Uu-RLF;\n2>\telse if the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to reconfiguration with sync:\n3>\tset the indicationType as relayUE-HO;\n2>\telse if the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to cell reselection:\n3>\tset the indicationType as relayUE-CellReselection;\n2>\tif the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to Uu RRC connection establishment/Resume failure:\n3>\tset the indicationType as relayUE-Uu-RRC-Failure;\n2>\tsubmit the NotificationMessageSidelink message to lower layers for transmission.\n1>\tif the UE is acting as L2 U2U Relay UE:\n2>\tif the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to PC5 RLF with L2 U2U Remote UE:\n3>\tset the sl-IndicationType as relayUE-PC5-RLF;\n3>\tset the sl-DestinationIdentityRemoteUE as the associated destination for L2 U2U Remote UE;\n3>\tsubmit the NotificationMessageSidelink message to lower layers for transmission;\nUpon receiving the NotificationMessageSidelink, the Remote UE shall:\n1>\tif the UE is acting as U2N Remote UE:\n2>\tif the indicationType is included:\n3>\tif the UE is L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED:\n4>\tif MP is configured and MCG transmission (i.e. direct path) is not suspended;\n5>\tinitiate the indirect path failure information procedure as specified in 5. 7. 3c to report indirect path failure;\n4>\telse if T301 is not running, initiate the RRC connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;\n3>\telse (the UE is L3 U2N Remote UE, or L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE):\n4>\tif the PC5-RRC connection with the U2N Relay UE is determined to be released:\n5>\tindicate upper layers to trigger PC5 unicast link release;\n4>\telse (i.e., maintain the PC5 RRC connection):\n5>\tif the UE is L2 U2N Remote UE and the indicationType is relayUE-HO or relayUE-CellReselection:\n6>\tconsider cell re-selection occurs;\nNOTE 1:\tFor L3 U2N Remote UE, or L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, it is up to Remote UE implementation whether to release or keep the PC5 unicast link.\nNOTE 2:\tThe L2 U2N Remote UE may ignore the NotificationMessageSidelink if it does not release the PC5 unicast link in source side yet during an indirect-to-direct path switch, i.e. T304 is running.\n1>\tif the UE is acting as L2 U2U Remote UE:\n2>\tif sl-IndicationType is relayUE-PC5-RLF:\n3>\tindicate PC5 RLF received from L2 U2U Relay UE to the upper layers for the indicated L2 U2U Remote UE based on the received sl-DestinationIdentityRemoteUE;\n3>\tperform PC5 RLF related actions as specified in 5.8.9.3, for the indicated L2 U2U Remote UE based on the received sl-DestinationIdentityRemoteUE;\nNOTE 3:\tIt is up to the upper layers on whether to trigger U2U Relay reselection and whether to keep or release the PC5 link with the U2U Relay UE after the PC5 RLF indication received from U2U Relay UE.\nFigure 5.8.9.11.1-1 illustrates the sidelink UE information procedure in a cellular network, detailing the exchange of information between the eNB and the UE. The figure showcases the process of UE registration, including the transmission of UE information, such as the UE's identity and location, as well as the establishment of a sidelink connection.

                            "text_content": "UE receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) applies MBS broadcast procedures described in this clause as well as the MBS Interest Indication procedure as specified in clause 5.9.4.\nMBS broadcast configuration information, except CFR configuration for MCCH/MTCH, is provided on MCCH logical channel. MCCH carries the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message which indicates the MBS broadcast sessions that are provided in the cell as well as the corresponding scheduling related information for these sessions. Optionally, the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message may also contain a list of neighbour cells providing the same broadcast MBS service(s) as provided in the current cell. The configuration information required by the UE to receive MCCH is provided in SIB1 and SIB20. Additionally, System Information may provide information related to service continuity of MBS broadcast in SIB21.\nThe MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period and within a configured transmission window. MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. If searchspaceMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message reception in the MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchspaceMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the MCCH transmission window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for MCCH message in MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for an MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception MCCH messages is up to UE implementation.\nChange of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period).\nWhen the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change starting from the beginning of the MCCH modification period via PDCCH which schedules the MCCH in every repetition in that modification period.\nUpon receiving a change notification, a UE receiving or interested to receive MBS services transmitted using MBS broadcast acquires the new MCCH information starting from the same slot. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information. The notification is transmitted with a 2-bit bitmap, see TS 38.212 [17] clause 7.3.1.5.1. The MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBS service(s). The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates modification of MCCH information other than the change caused by start of new MBS service(s), e.g. modification of a configuration of an on-going MBS session(s), MBS session(s) stop or neighbouring cell information modification.\n",

This exchange of information between the MSC and HLR is essential for the subscriber to make informed decisions about their mobile service selection, ensuring efficient and effective network usage.\nFigure 5.9.4.1-1: MBS Interest Indication\nThe purpose of this procedure is to inform the network that the UE in RRC_CONNECTED is receiving or is interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) and to inform the network about the priority of MBS broadcast versus unicast and multicast MRB reception. MBS Interest Indication can only be sent after AS security activation.\nAn MBS capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several cases including upon successful connection establishment/resume, upon entering or leaving the broadcast service area, upon MBS broadcast session start or stop, upon change of interest, upon change of priority between MBS broadcast reception and unicast/multicast reception, upon change to a PCell providing SIB21 (i.e. where the SIB1 scheduling information contains SIB21), upon receiving SIB20 of an SCell via dedicated signalling, upon handover, and upon RRC connection re-establishment, upon change to a PCell providing nonServingCellMII in SIB1, upon starting or stopping reception of MBS broadcast service on a non-serving cell, upon change of CFR information or subcarrier spacing for MBS broadcast reception on a non-serving cell. If the UE does not have the CFR information and subcarrier spacing for MBS broadcast reception on a non-serving cell at the time it sends the MBS Interest Indication, the UE sends an MBS Interest Indication after it has acquired those information from the non-serving cell.\nUpon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:\n1>\tif SIB21 is provided by the PCell; or\n1>\tif nonServingCellMII is provided in SIB1 by the PCell:\n2>\tensure having a valid version of SIB21 for the PCell, if present;\n2>\tif the UE did not transmit MBS Interest Indication since last entering RRC_CONNECTED state;

If the UE is notified to stop monitoring the G-RNTI(s) for all the joined multicast sessions, it stops monitoring the Multicast MCCH-RNTI for the cell where it received the notification.\nMulticast MCCH carries the MBSMulticastConfiguration message which indicates the MBS multicast sessions that are provided in the cell as well as the corresponding scheduling related information for these sessions. Optionally, the MBSMulticastConfiguration message may also contain a list of neighbour cells providing the same MBS multicast service(s) for RRC_INACTIVE as provided in the current cell. The configuration information required by the UE to receive multicast MCCH is provided in SIB24.\nThe multicast MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over multicast MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period and within a configured transmission window. MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to Multicast MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for the multicast MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMulticastMCCH. If searchspaceMulticastMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for the multicast MCCH message reception in the multicast MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213 [13]. If searchspaceMulticastMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for the multicast MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMulticastMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for the multicast MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the multicast MCCH transmission window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for the multicast MCCH message in the multicast MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in multicast MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the multicast MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for a multicast MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception multicast MCCH messages is up to UE implementation.\nChange of multicast MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same multicast MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period).\nWhen the network changes (some of) the multicast MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change starting from the beginning of the multicast MCCH modification period via PDCCH which schedules the multicast MCCH in every repetition in that modification period.\nUpon receiving a change notification, a UE receiving MBS multicast service(s) in RRC_INACTIVE acquires the new multicast MCCH information starting from the same slot. The UE applies the previously acquired multicast MCCH information until the UE acquires the new multicast MCCH information.\n",

The figure depicts the exchange of control channel (CCH) and multi-cast control channel (MCCH) messages between the network nodes.

This information is crucial for efficient data forwarding and delivery in multicast communication scenarios. The figure highlights the role of the network nodes, including the home agent (HA) and the multicast routing and forwarding nodes (MRF nodes), in coordinating multicast traffic and ensuring proper resource allocation.\nFigure 5.10.2.1-1: Multicast MCCH information acquisition\nThe UE applies the multicast MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBS multicast configuration information from the network. The procedure applies to UEs configured to receive MBS multicast services in RRC_INACTIVE.\nIf configured to receive MBS multicast services in RRC_INACTIVE, a UE applies the multicast MCCH information acquisition procedure for PTM configuration update and upon reselection to a new cell providing SIB24.

All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction for RRC message and in the sidelink for PC5 RRC message. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.\nIf conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the message or information element specifying the need of the field for each condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify what the UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the network for the RRC message or by the peer UE in the sidelink RRC message. Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network behaviour when transmitting downlink RRC message or invalid UE behavior when transmitting PC5 RRC message, which the UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the CondC or CondM condition.\nFor guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7.\nTable 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present\nNOTE:\tIn this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM are not used.\nAny field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as Need R.\nThe need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case (part of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have different need codes for different parts of the condition. In particular, the CondX definition may contain the following \"otherwise the field is absent\" parts:\n-\t\"Otherwise, the field is absent\": The field is not relevant or should not be configured when this part of the condition applies. In particular, the UE behaviour is not defined when the field is configured via another part of the condition and is reconfigured to this part of the condition. A need code is not provided when the transition from another part of the condition to this part of the condition is not supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot or there is no difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in case the field is mandatory present according to the other part of the condition).\n-\t\"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R\": The field is released if absent when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE behaviour in case the field is configured via another part of the condition and this part of the condition applies (which means that network when transmitting downlink RRC message or peer UE transmitting PC5 RRC message can assume UE releases the field if this part of the condition is valid).\n-\t\"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M\": The UE retains the field if it was already configured when this part of the condition applies. This means the network when transmitting downlink RRC message or the peer UE when transmitting PC5 RRC message cannot release the field, but UE retains the previously configured value.\nUse of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be avoided.\nFor downlink RRC message and sidelink PC5 RRC messages, the need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present. Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the absence of the parent field implies that.\nFor (parent) fields without need codes in downlink RRC messages or sidelink PC5 RRC message, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink RRC messages and sidelink PC5 RRC message without need codes where this rule applies are:\n-\tnonCriticalExtension fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE extension mechanism,\n-\tgroups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), and\n-\tnon-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).\nThe handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nRRCMessage-IEs ::=                SEQUENCE {\nfield1                            InformationElement1            OPTIONAL,  -- Need M\nfield2                            InformationElement2            OPTIONAL,  -- Need R\nnonCriticalExtension              RRCMessage-v1570-IEs           OPTIONAL\n}\n\nRRCMessage-1570-IEs ::=           SEQUENCE {\nfield3                            InformationElement3            OPTIONAL,  -- Need M\nnonCriticalExtension              RRCMessage-v1640-IEs           OPTIONAL\n}\n\nRRCMessage-v1640-IEs ::=          SEQUENCE {\nfield4                            InformationElement4            OPTIONAL,  -- Need R\nnonCriticalExtension              SEQUENCE {}                    OPTIONAL\n}\n\nInformationElement1 ::=           SEQUENCE {\nfield10                           InformationElement10           OPTIONAL,  -- Need N\nfield11                           InformationElement11           OPTIONAL,  -- Need M\nfield12                           InformationElement12           OPTIONAL,  -- Need R\n...,\n[[\nfield13                           InformationElement13           OPTIONAL,  -- Need R\nfield14                           InformationElement14           OPTIONAL   -- Need M\n]]\n}\n\nInformationElement2 ::=           SEQUENCE {\nfield21                           InformationElement11           OPTIONAL,  -- Need M\n...\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:\n-\tif field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE does not modify or take action on any child fields configured within field1 (regardless of their need codes);\n-\tif field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE releases the field2 (and also its child field field21);\n-\tif field1 or field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is present, UE retains or releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;\n-\tif field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is present but the extension group containing field13 and field14 is absent, the UE releases field13 but does not modify field14;\n-\tif nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v1570-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 but releases field4;\n",

The IE contains parameters which a UE would typically acquire from SSB, MIB or SIBs when accessing the cell from IDLE. With this IE, the network provides this information in dedicated signalling when configuring a UE with a SCells or with an additional cell group (SCG). It also provides it for SpCells (MCG and SCG) upon reconfiguration with sync.\nServingCellConfigCommon information element\n-- ASN1START\n--

the associated band combination. Across the associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand. All FeatureSetsPerBand in one FeatureSetCombination must have the same number of entries.\nThe number of FeatureSetsPerBand in the FeatureSetCombination must be equal to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The first FeatureSetPerBand applies to the first band entry of the band combination, and so on.\nEach FeatureSet contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs for UL and DL.\nIn case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the FeatureSets IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position in the featureSetsUplink / featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSet IE.\nIn case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined in TS 36.331 [10] and conveyed as part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability container.\nThe FeatureSetUplink and FeatureSetDownlink referred to from the FeatureSet comprise, among other information, a set of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Ids and FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Ids. The number of these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE is able to aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the corresponding band. The number of carriers supported by the UE is also restricted by the bandwidth class indicated in the associated BandCombination, if present.\nIn feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries with same or lower capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE supports those.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it supports additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by setting FeatureSet IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous fallback) and by reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a Feature Set (intra-band contiguous fallback). Or by separate BandCombination entries with associated FeatureSetCombinations.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE may advertise a FeatureSetCombination containing only fallback band combinations. That means, in a FeatureSetCombination, each group of FeatureSets across the bands may contain at least one pair of FeatureSetUplinkId and FeatureSetDownlinkId which is set to 0/0.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Network configures serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration to comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of activated/deactivated serving cell(s) and BWP(s).\nFeatureSetCombination information element\n-- ASN1START\n-- TAG-FEATURESETCOMBINATION-START\n\nFeatureSetCombination ::=       SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxSimultaneousBands)) OF FeatureSetsPerBand\n\nFeatureSetsPerBand ::=          SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxFeatureSetsPerBand)) OF FeatureSet\n\nFeatureSet ::=                  CHOICE {\neutra                           SEQUENCE {\ndownlinkSetEUTRA                FeatureSetEUTRA-DownlinkId,\nuplinkSetEUTRA                  FeatureSetEUTRA-UplinkId\n},\nnr                              SEQUENCE {\ndownlinkSetNR                   FeatureSetDownlinkId,\nuplinkSetNR                     FeatureSetUplinkId\n}\n}\n\n-- TAG-FEATURESETCOMBINATION-STOP\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe IE FeatureSetCombinationId identifies a FeatureSetCombination.

The BandCombination entries in the BandCombinationList then indicate the ID of the FeatureSetCombination that the UE supports for that band combination.\nThe entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index position. For example, the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id = 4 identifies the 4th element in the featureSetsUplinkPerCC list.\nNOTE:\tWhen feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future versions of the specification, new versions of the FeatureSetDownlink, FeatureSetUplink, FeatureSets, FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC and/or FeatureSetUplinkPerCC will be created and instantiated in corresponding new lists in the FeatureSets IE. For example, if new capability bits are to be added to the FeatureSetDownlink, they will instead be defined in a new FeatureSetDownlink-rxy which will be instantiated in a new featureSetDownlinkList-rxy list. If a UE indicates in a FeatureSetCombination that it supports the FeatureSetDownlink with ID #5, it implies that it supports both the features in FeatureSetDownlink #5 and FeatureSetDownlink-rxy #5 (if present).

It is recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step;\n-\tWhen decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.\n",

                            "text_content": "The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:\n-\tMessage (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.\n-\tType identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.\n-\tField identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.\n-\tIdentifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like 'Info') for the name.\n-\tIdentifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.\n-\tIdentifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.\n-\tFor future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the form \"-rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form \"-rXb\" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, \"-rXc\" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"-vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.\n-\tMore generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.\n-\tIt should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within the elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to avoid certain compiler errors).\nTable A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1 identifiers\n\nNOTE:\tThe table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive.

How these hooks are used is further described in clause A.4.\nCritical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.\nCritical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.\nFurther critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.\nIn PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nRRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {\nrrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,\ncriticalExtensions                  CHOICE {\nrrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8\nRRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,\ncriticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}\n}\n}\n\nRRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {\n-- Enter the fields here.\n...\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nNon-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.\nNon-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.\nNon-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nRRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=                   SEQUENCE {\nfield1                                  InformationElement1,\nfield2                                  InformationElement2,\n\nnonCriticalExtension                    SEQUENCE {}                     OPTIONAL\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.\n\nThe field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.\nThe following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.\nThe parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.\n",

IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.\nA group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 clause. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The \"PRACH-Config\" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the \"SIB\" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.\nThe same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 clause defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.\nLocal IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 clause and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 clause. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.\nAn IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 clauses in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 clause should be defined in a separate clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 clause (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.\nNOTE:\tReferring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 clause, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.\nThe ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.\n",

                    "text_content": "In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN.1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list. In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nAnExampleIE ::=         SEQUENCE {\nelementsToAddModList    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element                                     OPTIONAL,   --  Need N\nelementsToReleaseList   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId                                   OPTIONAL,   --  Need N\n...\n}\n\nElement ::=             SEQUENCE {\nelementId               ElementId,\naField                  INTEG ER (0..16777215),\nanotherField            OCTET STRING,\n...\n}\n\nElementId ::=           INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)\n\nmaxNrofElements         INTEGER ::= 50\nmaxNrofElements-1       INTEGER ::= 49\n\n-- /example/ ASN1STOP\n\nAs can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER) that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as well as in the elementsToReleaseList.\nBoth lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as \"Need N\". The need code reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but rather updates its configuration using the information therein. In other words, it is not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a previously signalled elementsToAddModList or elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would imply). The update is always in relation to the UE's internal configuration.\nNote that the release of a field (a list element as well as any other field) releases all its sub-fields (sub-fields configured by elementsToAddModList and any other sub-field).\nIf no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList, the following generic procedure applies:\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tfor each ElementId in the elementsToReleaseList,:\n2>\tif the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:\n3>\trelease the Element from the current UE configuration;\n1>\tfor each Element in the elementsToAddModList:\n2>\tif the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:\n3>\tmodify the configured Element in accordance with the received Element;\n2>\telse:\n3>\tadd received Element to the UE configuration.\n",

That also means that the field aField will be treated as if it was newly created, i.e. network must include it if it wishes UE to utilize the field even if it was previously signalled. This also implies that the Need M field (aField) will be treated in the same way as the Need R field (anotherField), i.e. delta signalling is not applied and the network has to signal the field to ensure UE does not release the value (which is why Need M should not normally be used in the entries of these lists).\n",

If used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.\nIt should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.\nThe non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when there is a need to introduce a 'clean' message version. Such a need appears when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with the extension markers.

The \"outer branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner branch\" mechanism.\nThe \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form \"MessageName-rX-IEs\" (e.g., \"RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs\") or \"spareX\", with the spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.\nThe following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:\n-\tFor certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.\n-\tAn outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.\n-\tThe number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical extension likelihood may be based on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.\n-\tIn messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions are added using the outer branch.\nThe following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release\n-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Original release\n\nRRCMessage ::=                          SEQUENCE {\nrrc-TransactionIdentifier               RRC-TransactionIdentifier,\ncriticalExtensions                      CHOICE {\nc1                                      CHOICE{\nrrcMessage-r8                           RRCMessage-r8-IEs,\nspare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL\n},\ncriticalExtensionsFuture                SEQUENCE {}\n}\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Later release\n\nRRCMessage ::=                          SEQUENCE {\nrrc-TransactionIdentifier               RRC-TransactionIdentifier,\ncriticalExtensions                          CHOICE {\nc1                                          CHOICE{\nrrcMessage-r8                               RRCMessage-r8-IEs,\nrrcMessage-r10                              RRCMessage-r10-IEs,\nrrcMessage-r11                              RRCMessage-r11-IEs,\nrrcMessage-r14                              RRCMessage-r14-IEs\n},\nlater                                      CHOICE {\nc2                                         CHOICE{\nrrcMessage-r16                             RRCMessage-r16-IEs,\nspare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,\nspare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL\n},\ncriticalExtensionsFuture                SEQUENCE {}\n}\n}\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nIt is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN is unaware if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release.\n-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Original release\n\nRRCMessage ::=                          SEQUENCE {\nrrc-TransactionIdentifier               RRC-TransactionIdentifier,\ncriticalExtensions                      CHOICE {\nc1                                      CHOICE{\nrrcMessage-r8                           RRCMessage-r8-IEs,\nspare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL\n},\ncriticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}\n}\n}\n\nRRCMessage-rN-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {\nfield1-rN                           ENUMERATED {\nvalue1, value2, value3, value4}     OPTIONAL,   -- Need N\nfield2-rN                           InformationElement2-rN                  OPTIONAL,   -- Need N\nnonCriticalExtension                RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs   OPTIONAL\n}\n\nRRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {\nfield2-rM                                 InformationElement2-rM            OPTIONAL, -- Cond NoField2rN\nnonCriticalExtension                      SEQUENCE {}                       OPTIONAL\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n\nFinally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the critical extension.\nIn the case of list fields (SEQUENCE OF types in ASN.1) using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction, the use of critical extensions to increase the size of a list should be avoided; that is, replacing the original list field by a new field also used to signal entries previously covered by the original field (i.e. extensions done according to the following example) should be avoided:\n-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Discouraged example\n\nContainingStructure ::=                 SEQUENCE {\nlistElementToAddModList                 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement         OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\n...,\n[[\nlistElementToAddModList-rN              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements-rN)) OF ListElement      OPTIONAL     -- Need N\n]]\n}-- ASN1STOP\n\nInstead, a non-critical list extension mechanism should typically be used, such that the extension field only adds the new entries of the list.  This approach is further described in clause A.4.3.6.\nIf the critical extension mechanism for a list is used, it should be clarified in the field description that the two versions of the list are not configured together, and that the network should release the contents of the original version when configuring the replacement version.\n",

Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field1.\n–\tWithin the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged.

The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.\nThe example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.\nParentIE-WithEM information element\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nParentIE-WithEM ::=                 SEQUENCE {\n-- Root encoding, including:\nchildIE1-WithoutEM                  ChildIE1-WithoutEM              OPTIONAL,       -- Need N\nchildIE2-WithoutEM                  ChildIE2-WithoutEM              OPTIONAL,       -- Need N\n...,\n[[\nchildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0             ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0     OPTIONAL,       -- Need N\nchildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0             ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0     OPTIONAL        -- Need N\n]]\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nSome remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:\n–\tThe fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).\n–\tIn general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.\nThe IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:\n–\tWhen initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.\n–\tWhen the configurable feature is released, the new field should be released also.\n–\tWhen omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).\n–\tWhen omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).\nThe above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.\nChildIE1-WithoutEM information element\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nChildIE1-WithoutEM ::=              SEQUENCE {\n-- Root encoding, including:\nchIE1-ConfigurableFeature           ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature       OPTIONAL        -- Need N\n}\n\nChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ::=     SEQUENCE {\nchIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0      ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0  OPTIONAL    -- Cond ConfigF\n}\n\nChIE1-ConfigurableFeature ::=       CHOICE {\nrelease                             NULL,\nsetup                               SEQUENCE {\n-- Root encoding\n}\n}\n\nChIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0 ::=  SEQUENCE {\nchIE1-NewField-rN                   INTEGER (0..31)\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n\nThe IE ChildIE2-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, typically used to control certain radio configurations.

The differential size of the extended list uses the suffix \"Diff\". A new ToRelease list is needed, and its range should include only the increase in list size. In many cases, extending the list size will also require an extended list element ID type to account for the increased size of the list; in these cases the element type will need to be extended to include the extended element ID, resulting in a more complex extension (see example 3 for further discussion of this case). The field description table should indicate that the UE considers the original list and the extension list as a single list; thus entries added with the original list can be modified by the extension list (or removed by the extension of the ToRelease list), or vice versa. The result is as shown in the following example:\n\n-- /example 1/ ASN1START\n\nContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {\nlistElementToAddModList              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement             OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementId           OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\n...,\n[[\n-- Non-critical extension lists\nlistElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNxy  SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement      OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId    OPTIONAL     -- Need N\n]]\n}\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n–\tWhen fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used if available. If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields, with the suffix \"Ext\" added to the end of the field name and the element structure type name (before the -vNxy suffix), and a parallel ToAddMod list introduced to hold the new structures, also with the \"Ext\" suffix. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the original list. No new ToRelease list is typically needed (unless the list element ID type changes). It should typically be ensured that the contained fields in the \"Ext\" elements are releasable without release and add of the entire list element; this can, for instance, be ensured by having the new fields be OPTIONAL Need R. If multiple extensions of the same list are needed, the version suffix should distinguish the lists (e.g. listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz added after listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy). The result is as shown in the following example:\n-- /example 2/ ASN1START\n\nContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {\nlistElementToAddModList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement             OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseList            SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementId           OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\n...,\n[[\n-- Parallel list\nlistElementToAddModListExt-vNxy     SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementExt-vNxy     OPTIONAL     -- Need N\n]],\n[[\n-- Second parallel list from a later spec version\nlistElementToAddModListExt-vNwz\t\tSEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementExt-vNwz     OPTIONAL    -- Need N\n]]\n}\n\nListElement ::=                      SEQUENCE {\nelementId                            ListElementId,\nfield1                               INTEGER (0..3),\nfield2                               ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }\n}\n\nListElementExt-vNxy ::=              SEQUENCE {\nfield3-rN                            BIT STRING (SIZE (8))                                              OPTIONAL     -- Need R\n}\n\nListElementExt-vNwz ::=              SEQUENCE {\nfield4-rN                            INTEGER (0..255)                                                   OPTIONAL     -- Need R\n}\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n–\tWhen the size of a list is extended and fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used for the added fields if available, and the list extended with the non-critical mechanism as described in example 1 above. Note that if the list element ID type changes in this case, the new ID can be added after the extension marker, and the entries of the size-extended ToRelease list should have the type of the new ID (e.g. ListElementId-vNxy). If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields and a parallel list with ToAddMod introduced to hold the extension structures, as in the second example above, for entries of the original list and for entries of the extension list holding new entries. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the concatenation of the original list and the extension list. An extended ToRelease list is needed, but no additional parallel ToRelease list is needed (i.e. there is no listElementToReleaseListExt-vNxy in the example below), as the original and extended ToRelease lists suffice to release any element of the combined list. The extended element ID type should be captured as a non-critical extension of the original element ID type, with the field description indicating that if the extended ID is present, the original ID is ignored. The result is as shown in the following example:\n-- /example 3/ ASN1START\n\nContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {\nlistElementToAddModList               SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement                 OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseList              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementId               OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\n...,\n[[\n-- Non-critical extension lists\nlistElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNxy  SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement           OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId-vNxy    OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\n-- Parallel list with maxNrofListElements-rN = maxNrofListElements + maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN\nlistElementToAddModListExt-vNxy      SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements-rN)) OF ListElementExt-vNxy       OPTIONAL     -- Need N\n]]\n}\n\nListElement ::=                      SEQUENCE {\nelementId                            ListElementId,\nfield1                               INTEGER (0..3),\nfield2                               ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }\n}\n\nListElementExt-vNxy ::=              SEQUENCE {\n-- Field description should indicate that if the elementId-vNxy is present, the elementId (without suffix) is ignored\nelementId-vNxy                       ListElementId-vNxy                                                 OPTIONAL,    -- Need S\nfield3-rN                            BIT STRING (SIZE (8))                                              OPTIONAL     -- Need R\n}\n\nListElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofListElements-1)\n\nListElementId-vNxy ::= INTEGER (maxNrofListElements..maxNrofListElements-1-rN)\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n–\tWhen different extensions are made to a list in separate releases, the extension mechanisms described above may interact. In case fields are added in Rel-M (listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy) and later the list size is extended in Rel-N (listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNwz), the size-extended list in Rel-N should be a single list extending the combination of listElementToAddModList and listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy. This requires creating a new type (ListElement-rN) to contain the combined fields of ListElement and ListElementExt-vMxy. A corresponding ToRelease list is needed. The result is as shown in the following example:\n-- /example 4/ ASN1START\n\nContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {\nlistElementToAddModList              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement             OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementId           OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\n...,\n[[\n-- Parallel list (Rel-M)\nlistElementToAddModListExt-vMxy      SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementExt-vMxy     OPTIONAL     -- Need N\n]],\n[[\n-- Size-extended list (Rel-N) with maxNrofListElements-rN = maxNrofListElements + maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN\nlistElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNwz  SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement-rN   OPTIONAL,    -- Need N\nlistElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNwz SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId-vNwz     OPTIONAL    -- Need N\n]]\n}\n\nListElement ::=                      SEQUENCE {\nelementId                            ListElementId,\nfield1                               INTEGER (0..3),\nfield2                               ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }\n}\n\nListElementExt-vMxy ::=              SEQUENCE {\nfield3-rM                            BIT STRING (SIZE (8))                                              OPTIONAL     -- Need R\n}\n\nListElement-rN ::=                   SEQUENCE {\nelementId-vNwz                       ListElementId-vNwz,\nfield1                               INTEGER (0..3),\nfield2                               ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 },\nfield3-rN                            BIT STRING (SIZE (8))                                              OPTIONAL     -- Need R\n}\n\nListElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofListElements-1)\n\nListElementId-vNwz ::= INTEGER (maxNrofListElements..maxNrofListElementsDiff-1-rN)\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n",

            "description": "There are two possible ways to configure BWP#0 (i.e. the initial BWP) for a UE:\n1)\tConfigure BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon, but do not configure dedicated configurations in BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.\n2)\tConfigure both BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon and configure dedicated configurations in at least one of BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.\nThe same way of configuration is used for UL BWP#0 and DL BWP#0 if both are configured.\nWith the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP#0 is not considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e., UE only supporting one BWP can still be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. The BWP#0 can still be used even if it does not have the dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since only the SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only DCI format 1_0 can be used with BWP#0 without dedicated configuration, so changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn't support DCI-based switching.\nFigure B2-1 illustrates the BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration, showcasing the various components involved in the process. The figure displays the BWP#0 interface, which is a crucial element in the configuration. Additionally, it highlights the use of the 'no dedicated configuration' option, which is a feature that allows for a more streamlined and efficient configuration process. The figure also includes a detailed explanation of the different settings and parameters involved in the configuration, providing valuable insights for those working with BWP#0. Overall, this figure serves as a useful reference for anyone looking to understand the BWP#0 configuration process in more detail.\nFigure B2-1: BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration\nWith the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP#0 is considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP#0 e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the BWP#0 (compared to the first option).\nFigure B2-2 illustrates the BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration, showcasing the various parameters and settings involved in managing a broadband wireless protocol. The figure displays the different elements, such as the BWP (Broadband Wireless Protocol) interface, the dedicated configuration, and the associated parameters. These include the BWP_IF_NAME, BWP_IF_TYPE, BWP_IF_ADDR, and BWP_IF_MTU. The figure also highlights the importance of configuring the BWP_IF_MTU to ensure proper data transmission and minimize packet loss. The dedicated configuration ensures that the BWP protocol operates efficiently and effectively, optimizing network performance and reliability.\nFigure B2-2: BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration\nFor BWP#0, the BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.\nIf an (e)RedCap-specific initial DL BWP is configured, for BWP switching, the BWP #0 always maps to the (e)RedCap-specific initial DL BWP. If a RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is configured, for BWP switching on NUL, the BWP #0 always maps to the RedCap-specific initial UL BWP, for BWP switching on SUL, the BWP#0 always maps to the initial UL BWP.\n\nThis annex lists the Change Requests (CRs) whose changes may be implemented by a UE of an earlier release than which the CR was approved in (i.e. CRs that contain on their coversheets the sentence \"Implementation of this CR from Rel-N will not cause interoperability issues\").\nTable C-1: List of CRs Containing Early Implementable Features and Corrections\n\nThis clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax support, i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.\nA UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease shall comprehend the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features it does not support.\nIn case a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease supports a feature specified in release Y, which is later than release X, (i.e. early UE implementation) additional requirements apply. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).\nCritical extensions (dedicated signaling)\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions in dedicated signalling, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early. This, in particular, concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the feature.\nIf configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release Y involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented feature(s), the UE needs, however, not to support functionality beyond what is defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.\nLet's consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field accessStratumRelease that supports the features A1, A3, and A5, associated with fields fieldA1, fieldA3 and fieldA5 of InformationElementA (see ASN.1 below).\nThe feature A5 implemented early is associated with fieldA5, and can only be configured by the –rY version of InformationElementA. In such case, the UE should support configuration of all the features A1, A3 and A5 associated with fields fieldA1, fieldA3 and fieldA5 by the –rY version of InformationElementA.\nIf, however, one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature A3 associated with fieldA3, the network should assume the UE only supports the feature A3 according to the release it indicated in field accessStratumRelease (i.e. X).\nThe UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (n80-vY0) nor the additional sub-field (fieldA3c-rY).\nInformationElementA-rX ::=      SEQUENCE {\nfieldA1-rX                      InformationElementA1-rX                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need N\nfieldA2-rX                      InformationElementA2-rX                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need R\nfieldA3-rX                      InformationElementA3-rX                 OPTIONAL    -- Need R\n}\n\nInformationElementA-rY ::=      SEQUENCE {\nfieldA1-rY                      InformationElementA1-rX                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need N\nfieldA2-rY                      InformationElementA2-rX                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need R\nfieldA3-rY                      InformationElementA3-rY                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need R\nfieldA4-rY                      InformationElementA4-rY                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need R\nfieldA5-rY                      InformationElementA5-rY                 OPTIONAL    -- Need R\n}\n\nInformationElementA3-rX ::= SEQUENCE {\nfieldA3a-rX                     InformationElementA3a-rX                OPTIONAL,   -- Need N\nfieldA3b-rX                     ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40}              OPTIONAL    -- Need R\n}\n\nInformationElementA3-rY ::=    SEQUENCE {\nfieldA3a-rY                     InformationElementA3a-rX                OPTIONAL,   -- Need N\nfieldA3b-rY                     ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40, n80-vY0}     OPTIONAL,   -- Need R\nfieldA3c-rY                     InformationElementA3c-rY                OPTIONAL    -- Need R\n}\n\nNon-critical extensions (dedicated and broadcast signaling)\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early.\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in dedicated signaling, the network does not include extensions introduced after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE indicates early support of in UE capabilities. The UE shall anyway comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) which indicate absence of such extensions.\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in system information, the SIB(s) containing the release Y fields related to the early implemented features may also include other extensions introduced after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE supports. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).\n\n\n\n",
