In the context of this specification this is implemented by use of the Gxx procedures.\nIP-CAN session: association between a UE and an IP network.\nThe association is identified by one or more UE Ipv4 addresses/ and/or Ipv6 prefix together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN represented by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or more IP-CAN bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is IP-CAN specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.\nPolicy counter: A mechanism within the OCS to track spending applicable for a subscriber.\nPolicy counter status: A label whose values are not standardized and that is associated with a policy counter’s value relative to the spending limit(s) (the number of possible policy counter status values for a policy counter is one greater than the number of thresholds associated with that policy counter, i.e policy counter status values describe the status around the thresholds). This is used to convey information relating to subscriber spending from OCS to PCRF. Specific labels are configured jointly in OCS and PCRF.\nRAN user plane congestion: RAN user plane congestion occurs when the demand for RAN resources exceeds the available RAN capacity to deliver the user data for a prolonged period of time.\nNOTE:\tShort-duration traffic bursts is a normal condition at any traffic load level, and is not considered to be RAN user plane congestion. Likewise, a high-level of utilization of RAN resources (based on operator configuration) is considered a normal mode of operation and might not be RAN user plane congestion.\nRestricted local operator services: communication services provided by an operator that involve either automated or human assistance (e.g. credit card billing, directory assistance, customer care) for which successful authentication is not necessary.\nSpending limit: A spending limit is the usage limit of a policy counter (e.g. monetary, volume, duration) that a subscriber is allowed to consume.\nSpending limit report: a notification, containing the current policy counter status generated from the OCS to the PCRF via the Sy reference point.\nTDF session: An association between an IP-CAN session and the assigned TDF for the purpose of application detection and control by the PCRF . The association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix together with optionally a PDN represented by a PDN ID and a set of ADC rules to be applied by the TDF.\n",

The architecture is designed to efficiently handle data traffic and ensure seamless connectivity for mobile users.\nFigure 3a.1: Overall PCC architecture for non-roaming scenario\nFigure 3a.2 provides an overview of the Packet Core (PCC) architecture for roaming with a home routed access scenario. The figure illustrates the various components involved, including the Home Routing Node (HRN), Home Routing Agent (HRA), and the Roaming Node (RN). The HRN and HRA work together to manage the home network, while the RN handles the roaming connections. The figure also shows the interconnections between these nodes, highlighting the importance of seamless communication and coordination for a smooth roaming experience.\nFigure 3a.2: Overall PCC architecture for roaming with home routed access scenario\n\nFigure 3a.3 illustrates the overall Packet Communication Control (PCC) architecture for roaming with a visited access scenario. The figure showcases the key components involved in the process, including the Home Location Register (HLR), Visitor Location Register (VLR), and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). The diagram highlights the handover process between the home and visited access networks, emphasizing the role of the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and the Packet Data Network Gateway (PANG).

                    "text_content": "There are three distinct network scenarios for an IP-CAN Session:\nCase 1. No Gateway Control Session is required, no Gateway Control Establishment occurs at all (e.g. 3GPP Access where GTP-based S5/S8 are employed, and Non-3GPP access where GTP-based S or GTP-based S2b is employed).\nCase 2. A Gateway Control Session is required. There are two subcases:\n2a)\tThe BBERF assigns a Care of Address (CoA) to the UE and establishes a Gateway Control Session prior to any IP-CAN session establishment that will apply for all IP-CAN sessions using that CoA.\n2b) At IP-CAN session establishment a Gateway Control Session is required before the PCEF announces the IP-CAN Session to the PCRF. At BBERF change and pre-registration the Gateway Control Session shall match an IP-CAN session that the PCEF has already announced. Each IP-CAN session is handled in a separate Gateway Control Session.\nThe PCRF shall select whether case 2a or case 2b applies based on the information received in the Gateway Control Session Establishment. For a user identified with a Subscription-Id AVP, when the PDN identifier included as part of the Called-Station-Id AVP is received, case 2b applies. If not received, case 2a applies.\nThe following considerations shall be taken into account when interpreting the signalling flows:\n-\tV-PCRF is included to also cover the roaming scenarios.\n-\tH-PCRF will act as a PCRF for non-roaming Ues.\n-\tThe steps numbered as “number+letter” (e.g. “3a”) will be executed, for the roaming case, instead of steps numbered as “number” (e.g. “3”), as indicated in the explanatory text below the signalling flows.\n-\tEmergency services and RLOS are handled locally in the serving network, therefore the S9 reference point does not apply.\nNOTE: For the Visited Access case, the operator can by roaming agreement decide not to use S9 reference point.\nThe procedure to detect that the Gx session or a Gateway Control Session is restricted to Emergency Services is described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\n-\tThe procedure to detect that the Gx session is restricted to RLOS is described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\n-\tSubscription-related information is not relevant for the policy control of Emergency Sessions and RLOS; therefore Sp reference point does not apply in that case.\n-\tWith the UDC-based architecture as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.335 [51], SPR, whenever mentioned in the present specification, refers to UDR. The Ud interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.335 [52] is the interface between the PCRF and the UDR.\n-\tWhen monitoring event reporting via PCRF applies as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [38], the SCEF is acting as an AF. In this case, only the flows where the AF is located in the home network apply. Support of this functionality is detailed in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], Annex D.\n-\tIf the PCEF/BBERF/TDF needs to send an IP-CAN session/ Gateway Control Session/ TDF session modification request towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the IP-CAN session/ Gateway Control Session/ TDF session establishment, the PCEF/BBERF/TDF shall follow the PCRF Failure and Restoration procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\nNOTE:\tOnly the interaction with OCS for spending limits reporting over Sy interface is introduced in this document.\n-\tThe PCEF and TDF are depicted as monolithic entities in the signalling flows, but each of those can be decomposed into a User Plane Function and a Control Plane Function connected via the Sx reference point. Signalling on the Sx reference point is not shown.\n",

                    "text_content": "This subclause is applicable if a new IP-CAN Session is being established.\nFigure 4.1.1 illustrates the process of establishing an IP-CAN session, which is a type of communication protocol used in telecommunication networks. The figure depicts the sequence of events that occur from the initiation of a session to its successful completion. It begins with the sender initiating the session by sending a request to the receiver. The sender's request is encapsulated in a frame and transmitted over the network. Upon receiving the frame, the receiver acknowledges the request and sends a confirmation back to the sender. This confirmation is also encapsulated in a frame and transmitted back to the sender. Once the sender receives the confirmation, the session is established and both parties can communicate with each other. The figure also shows the use of error checking and correction mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the data being transmitted.\nFigure 4.1.1: IP-CAN Session Establishment\n1.\tThe BBERF may initiate a Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure as defined in subclause 4.4.1 (applicable for cases 2a during initial attach and 2b, as defined in subclause 4.0), if appropriate. In this step, the PCRF determines whether the cases  or 2b applies, as defined in subclause 4.0.\n2.\tThe PCEF receives an Establish IP-CAN Session Request. The form of the Establish IP-CAN Session Request depends upon the type of the IP-CAN.\n3.\tFor the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF of the IP-CAN Session establishment. The PCEF starts a new Gx session by sending a CCR to the H-PCRF using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The PCEF provides UE identity information, PDN identifier, the UE Ipv4 address and/or UE Ipv6 prefix and, if available, the PDN connection identifier, IP-CAN type, RAT type and/or the default charging method and additional charging parameters as defined in subclause 4.5.1 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] and may send charging characteristics if available. The PCEF provides, when available, the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS and the APN-AMBR to the PCRF. The PCEF may provide the applicable TDF routing information in TDF-Information AVP. If the UE has declared support for the extended TFT filter format and the PCEF does not prevent the use thereof, the PCE F shall indicate that the support for extended TFT filters is available in the IP-CAN session. For types of IP-CAN, where the H-PCRF can be in control of IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCEF also provides a new bearer identifier and information about the requested bearer, such as QoS. If applicable for the IP-CAN type, it will also provide information to indicate whether NW-initiated bearer control procedures are supported, if available. The PCRF links the Gx session for the new IP-CAN session with the corresponding Gateway Control Session as defined in subclause 4.0. The PCRF maintains aligned set of PCC and QoS rules in the PCEF and BBERF(s) as applicable for the case. For case 2a and if IP flow mobility is supported, the PCEF provides, when available, the IP flow mobility routing rules. For case 1 and if NBIFOM is supported, the PCEF provides, when available, the NBIFOM support and NBIFOM mode information. If available, the PCEF provides a timestamp corresponding to the time at which the request was initiated by the originating node, and additionally the PCEF can include the maximum wait time as defined in subclause 4.5.1 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\nFor the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 3a~3c are executed instead of step 3.\n3a.\tThe PCEF informs the V-PCRF of the establishment of the IP-CAN session. The PCEF starts a new Gx session by sending a CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The parameters for CCR as listed in step 3 are applicable here.\n3b.\tThe V-PCRF determines that the request is for a roaming user and concludes the IP-CAN session uses visited access. V-PCRF stores the received information.\n3c.\tIf there is not an already established S9 session for this roaming user, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.\nIf there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.\n4.\tThe H-PCRF stores the information received in the CCR. For cases 2a and 2b, the H-PCRF links the Gx session with the Gateway Control Session(s).\nNOTE 1:\tIn the case 2a, when an additional PDN connection is established, the Gx session is linked with the already established Gateway Control Session.\n5.\tIf the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have it, the H-PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.\n6.\tThe SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the information about the allowed service(s), QoS information, PCC Rules information and may include MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and IMS Signalling Priority for establishing a PS session with priority.\nNOTE 2:\tFor steps 5 and 6: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release. The SPR’s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.\n7.\tIf the PCRF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the OCS and no Sy session yet has been established for this subscriber, the PCRF sends an Initial Spending Limit Report Request as defined in subclause 4.7.1. If the Sy sesson is already established for this subscriber, the PCRF may send, if required, an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in subclause 4.7.2.\n8.\tThe H-PCRF selects or generates PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The H- PCRF may also make a policy decision by deriving an authorized QoS and by deciding whether service flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or disabled. If MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level, and IMS Signalling Priority are present for the user, the PCRF takes the information into account. If NBIFOM is supported, the PCRF determines whether the NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session and selects the NBIFOM mode.\n9.\tThe H-PCRF stores the selected PCC Rules. The H-PCRF selects the Bearer Control Mode that will apply during the IP-CAN session if applicable for the particular IP-CAN. If the H-PCRF controls the binding of IP-CAN Bearers, the H-PCRF stores information about the IP-CAN Bearer to which the PCC Rules have been assigned. If the BBERF/PCEF controls the binding of IP-CAN bearers, the H-PCRF may derive the QoS information per QCI applicable to that IP-CAN session for non-GBR bearers.\n10.\tWhen user profile configuration indicates that Application Detection and Control function is enabled, the H-PCRF makes the policy decision for the application detection and control. For the non-roaming case, or for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF selects the applicable PCC Rules to be provided for application detection and control for the PCEF supporting ADC feature, or the applicable ADC rules for the solicited application reporting with a TDF. For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, the H-PCRF selects the applicable PCC Rules to be provided for application detection and control. For solicited application reporting with a TDF, the H-PCRF finds the TDF by using the TDF-Information AVP received from the PCEF in step 3, or, if not received, using a pre-configured TDF address.\n11.\tOnly applicable for non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a home routed case, In case of solicited application reporting with a TDF, the PCRF initiates a TDF Session Establishment procedure, according to subclause 4.6.1, with the selected TDF.\n12.\tIf traffic steering control over St applies andthe H-PCRF determines that traffic steering control information is needed for the IP-CAN session, the PCRF initiates an St session establishment procedure according to subclause 4.9.1 with the TSSF. The TSSF identifier is pre-configured on the PCRF per e.g. PCEF.\n13.\tFor the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the PCEF using CCA. The H-PCRF also provides the selected Bearer Control Mode if applicable for the particular IP-CAN and if available, the QoS information per QCI. If the PCEF has indicated that the support for extended TFT filters is available in the IP-CAN session, then the PCRF may, by indicating the PCRF support for extended TFT filters, enable the use of the extended TFT filter format in the IP-CAN session. The PCRF may also provide event triggers listing events for which the PCRF desires PCC Rule Requests. Furthermore, the PCRF may provide authorized QoS including the APN-AMBR and the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS, User Location Information, user CSG information (if received from the BBERF) and Presence Reporting Area Information. If usage monitoring is enabled, the H-PCRF may provide the applicable thresholds for usage monitoring control at PCEF within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If NBIFOM is supported, the H-PCRF provides the decision on whether the NBIFOM is supported and the selected NBIFOM mode if applicable.\nFor types of IP-CAN, where the PCRF controls IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCRF indicates the IP-CAN Bearer where the PCC Rules are to be installed and that the authorized QoS refers to. Otherwise, the PCRF operates without any further reference to any specific bearer.\nIf the PCEF supports Application Detection and Control feature, the PCRF provisions the applicable PCC Rules to the PCEF for the corresponding IP-CAN session.\nIf online charging is applicable then the PCEF requests credit information from the OCS over the Gy interface. If the PCEF receives credit re-authorisation triggers from the OCS then, for case 2b, it requests the PCRF via a CCR message to provision the triggers at the BBERF. The triggers to be provisioned are specified in the Event-Report-Indication AVP in the CCR message.\nFor the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 13a -13g are executed.\n13a.\tThe PCC Rules, if they were selected in step 9, are provisioned by the H-PCRF to the V-PCRF by using a CCA. The H-PCRF includes PCC Rules in the Subsession-Decision-Info AVP of the CCA, along with the S9 subsession identifier as received in step  within the Subsession-Id AVP. Other parameters listed in step 9 are also applicable here.\n13b.\tThe V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization requested by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements.\n13c. In case of TDF, if Application Detection and Control function is enabled for the IP-CAN session, the V-PCRF extracts ADC rules from the received PCC rules from the H-PCRF and stores the ADC rules.\n13d.\tThe V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF when a request has been denied and may provide the acceptable QoS Information for the service.\n13e.\tThe H-PCRF acknowledges the CCR and may additionally include new or modified PCC rules to the V-PCRF. When user profile configuration indicates that Application Detection and Control function is enabled, some of those PCC Rules may be dedicated for application detection and control.\n13f.\tIn case of solicited application reporting with a TDF, the V-PCRF initiates a TDF Session Establishment procedure, according to subclause 4.6.1, with the selected TDF and provides ADC Rules extracted from the corresponding PCC Rules.\n13g.\tThe V-PCRF provisions PCC rules received from the H-PCRF to the PCEF by using CCA. The parameters listed in step 11a are applicable here, User Location Information and user CSG information (if received from the BBERF).\nNOTE 3:\tFrom this point and onward, the PCRF is responsible for keeping the active PCC, ADC and QoS rules aligned.\n14.\tIf case 2a or 2b applies, the PCRF aligns the set of QoS rules at the BBERF with the set of active rules at the PCEF.\n15.\tThe PCEF installs the received PCC Rules. The PCEF also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flows according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules. If QoS information is received per QCI, PCEF sets the upper limit accordingly for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to the non-GBR bearer(s) for that QCI. In case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, the PCEF enforces the application detection and control.\n16. The PCEF sends a response to the Establish IP-CAN Session Request.\nFor GPRS, the GGSN accepts the PDP Context Request based on the results of the authorisation policy decision enforcement. If the requested QoS parameters do not correspond to the authorized QoS, the GGSN adjusts (downgrades /upgrades) the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the authorized values.\nNOTE 4:\tThe PCRF can reject the IP-CAN session establishment, e.g. the PCRF cannot obtain the subscription-related information from the SPR and the PCRF cannot make the PCC rule decisions, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\nPCEF can also enforce active preconfigured PCC rules which are not know to the PCRF.\nThe PCEF can also reject the IP-CAN session establishment, e.g. there is no active PCC rule for the IP-CAN session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2].\n",

The figure depicts the AF (Access Function) situated within the HPLMN, which is responsible for handling the session termination. The session is initiated by the UE and proceeds through various stages, including the establishment of the IP-CAN connection, data transmission, and finally, the successful termination of the session. The figure highlights the role of the AF in managing the session and ensuring a smooth termination process, which is crucial for maintaining network efficiency and user satisfaction.\nFigure 4.2.1.1.1: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination – AF located in the HPLMN\nIn the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming scenarios. H-PCRF acts as the PCRF for non-roaming UEs.\n1.\tIf case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF receives a request to remove the IP-CAN session. In case , the request goes transparently through the BBERF. In all cases, the PCEF receives a request to remove the IP-CAN Session. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Session Request depends upon the type of the IP-CAN.\n2.\tIf case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF-initiated Gateway Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (BBERF-Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated.\n3.\tFor the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the PCEF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Session termination. The PCEF requests the termination of the Gx session using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. If the usage monitoring is enabled, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report. If the Required-Access-Info AVP is included in any PCC Rule, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the access network information. If NAS-RAN-Cause feature is supported the PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the access network information and the failure cause(s), if available.\nFor the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps ~3b are executed instead of step 3:\n.\tThe PCEF sends a CCR to the V-PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Session termination. The PCEF requests the termination of the Gx session using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. If the usage monitoring is enabled, the PCEF informs the V-PCRF about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report. If the Required-Access-Info AVP is included in any PCC Rule, the PCEF informs the V-PCRF about access network information.\n3b\tIf there is an active TDF session between the TDF and the V-PCRF, for roaming UE with visited access, the TDF Session termination is initiated as defined in Section 4.6.2. For this case, the PCRF described in Section 4.6.2 acts as a V-PCRF.\n3c.\tIf congestion reporting is active for the user id and PDN id, for roaming UE with visited access, the V-PCRF initiates a UE context removal as defined in clause 4.8.5.\n3d.\tThe V-PCRF sends the CCR to the H-PCRF. If case 2b or case 1 applies and this is the last subsession associated with the S9 session, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF to request the termination of the S9 session using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. Otherwise, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST and a Subsession-Enforcement-Info within which the Subsession-Operation AVP set to value TERMINATION to request the termination of the conresponding S9 subsession.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the usage monitoring is enabled on PCEF and/or TDF, the V-PCRF gathers the reports and provides them all to H-PCRF in the single CCR message.\n4.\tThe H-PCRF identifies the AF sessions that are bound to IP flows of the removed IP-CAN Session.\n5.\tFor the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF acknowledges the Gx session termination by sending a CCA to the PCEF.\nFor the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps ~ are executed instead of step 5:\n. The H-PCRF acknowledges the S9 session or subsession termination by sending a CCA to the V-PCRF.\n5b. The V-PCRF removes the information related to the terminated IP-CAN Session.\n5c. The V-PCRF acknowledges the Gx session termination by sending a CCA to the PCEF.\n6.\tThe PCEF sends a response to the Remove IP-CAN Session Request. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Session Response depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. Step 6 may be executed in parallel with step 3 or 3a (as applicable).\n7. If there is an activeTDF session between the TDF and the H-PCRF, for non-roaming UE/roaming UE with home routed access, the TDF Session termination is initiated as defined in Section 4.6.2.\nNOTE 2: Step 7 can occur anytime after step 3.\nFor each AF session identified in step 4 as bound to the IP-CAN Session being removed, steps 7-11 are executed:\n8.\tIf congestion reporting is active for the user id and PDN id, for non-roaming UE or UE is roaming in home routed case, the H-PCRF initiates a UE context removal as defined in clause 4.8.5.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 8 can occur anytime after step 3.\n9.\tThe H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the H-AF by sending an ASR to the H-AF.\n10.\tThe H-AF responds by sending an ASA to the H-PCRF.\n11.\tThe H-AF sends an STR to the H-PCRF to indicate that the session has been terminated.\n12.\tThe H-PCRF responds by sending an STA to the H-AF. If the provided PCC rules are related to an AF session associated with a sponsor, usage thresholds were provided by the H-AF earlier, and the H-PCRF has usage data that has not yet been reported to the H-AF, the H-PCRF informs the H-AF about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report. If the BBERF in step 2 or PCEF in step 3 reports the access network information and if the AF requested the H-PCRF to report access network information previously and/or the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the H-PCRF informs the H-AF about the access network information and/or RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN failure cause(s) if available.\n13.\tIf this is the last IP-CAN session for this subscriber the Final Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.3 is sent. If any existing IP-CAN sessions for this subscriber require policy counter status reporting, the Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.2 can be sent to alter the list of subscribed policy counters.\n14.\tIf case  applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure as defined in clause 4.4.3 (Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision) may be initiated to remove the QoS rules associated with the IP-CAN session being terminated. This applies e.g. in case the Gateway Control Session remains to serve other IP-CAN sessions.\nAlternatively, if UE acquires a care of address (CoA) that is used for the S reference point and the H-PCRF determines that all QoS rules are to be removed and the Gateway Control Session to be terminated, the PCRF-initiated Gateway Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (PCRF-Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated. This applies e.g. in case the UE is detached and the CoA acquired by the UE is not used for any other IP-CAN session.\n15. The H-PCRF sends a cancellation notification request to the SPR if it has subscribed such notification. The H-PCRF stores the remaining usage allowance in the SPR if all IP-CAN sessions of the user to the same APN are terminated. Step 14 may be initiated any time after step 5 or 5a (as applicable).\n16.\tThe SPR sends a response to the H-PCRF.\nNOTE 4:\tFor steps 14 and 15: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release. The SPR’s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.\n17.\tIf the H-PCRF has provided traffic steering control information to the TSSF for the IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF initiates the St session termination procedure to the TSSF to remove the traffic steering control information associated to the UE IPv4 address and/or to the UE IPv6 prefix for the terminated IP-CAN session according to the subclause 4.9.3.\nNOTE 5:\tStep 17 can be initiated any time after step 5.\nThis clause is applicable only for the Visited Access scenario for the case when an IP-CAN Session is being released by the UE and the AF is located in the VPLMN.\nFigure 4.2.1.2.1 illustrates the termination of an IP-CAN session initiated by the User Equipment (UE) within the Access and Fixed (AF) Location-Based Network (VPLMN). The figure depicts the AF located within the VPLMN, which is responsible for managing the session. The session is terminated when the UE is no longer in the coverage area of the VPLMN.

Otherwise, the H-PCRF sends a RAR to the V-PCRF including the Subsession-Decision-Info AVP with the Session-Release-Cause AVP to indicate the request for terminating the S9 subsession corresponding to the IP-CAN session.\n2b. The V-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the PCEF.\n3.\tThe PCEF removes all the PCC Rules which are applied to the IP-CAN session.\n4.\tFor the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the PCEF sends a RAA to acknowledge the RAR.\nFor the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps ~4b are executed instead of step 4:\n4a.\tThe PCEF sends a RAA to the V-PCRF.\n4b. The V-PCRF sends a RAA to the H-PCRF and acknowledges the request for terminating the S9 session or the S9 subsession corresponding to the IP-CAN session.\n5.\tThe PCEF applies IP CAN specific procedures to terminate the IP CAN session.\n6. – 21.\tSame as Steps 3-18 in figure 4.2.2.1.1.\nThis clause is applicable only for the Visited Access scenario for the case when an IP-CAN Session is being released by the PCRF and the AF is located in the VPLMN\nFigure .2.1 illustrates the process of PCRF-initiated IP-CAN session termination within the context of an Access and Mobility Management (AMM) system, specifically focusing on the AF (Access Function) located within the VPLMN (Visitor Location Management Network). The figure depicts the interaction between the PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function) and the AF, which is responsible for managing the session termination process. The figure highlights the role of the AF in terminating IP-CAN (IP Communication and Notification) sessions initiated by the PCRF, ensuring that the appropriate policies and charging rules are applied. The figure also shows the interaction between the AF and the VPLMN, emphasizing the importance of coordination between these components for efficient session termination and overall network management.\nFigure .2.1: PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination  – AF located in the VPLMN\nIf the AF resides in the VPLMN, the V-PCRF proxies AF session signalling over S9 between the V-AF and the H-PCRF.\n1.\tIn order to perform PCRF initiated IP-CAN Session Termination Procedures, step 1 through step 12: asspecified in Figure 4.2.3.1.1: PCRF Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination – AF Located in the HPLMN areexecuted.\nFor each AF session identified in step 6 (Figure 4.2.3.1.1) as bound to the IP-CAN Session being removed, steps 2-9 are executed:\n2.\tThe H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the V-AF in VPLMN by sending an ASR to the V-PCRF.\n3.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the ASR to the V-AF.\n4.\tThe V-AF responds by sending an ASA to the V-PCRF.\n5.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the ASA to the H-PCRF.\n6.\tThe V-AF sends an STR to the V-PCRF to indicate that the session has been terminated.\n7.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the STR to the H-PCRF.\n8.\tThe H-PCRF responds by sending an STA to the V-PCRF.\n9.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the STA to the V-AF.\n10.\tStep 17 through step 20: as specified in Figure 4.2.3.1.1: PCRF Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination – AF Located in the HPLMN are executed, as needed.\nNOTE:\tFor steps 19 and 20: the details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release.

The figure showcases the flow of data and control signals between these entities, highlighting the coordination required for session modifications. The diagram emphasizes the importance of these interactions in ensuring efficient and reliable communication within the network.\nFigure 4.3.1.1.1: Interactions between BBERF, PCEF, TDF, OCS, TSSF and PCRF for PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\n1.\tThe H-PCRF receives an internal or external trigger to re-evaluate PCC Rules and policy decision for an IP-CAN Session. Possible external trigger events are described in clause 4.3.1.2. In addition, this procedure is triggered by\n-\tPCEF subscribed event\n-\tSPR subscription data modification (e.g. change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority, or change in user profile configuration indicating whether supporting application detection and control).\n-\tOCS status of a policy counter identifier(s) has changed and the PCRF requested notification for spending limits apply.\n-\tApplication detection information report from TDF.\n2.\tThe H-PCRF selects the PCC Rule(s) to be installed, modified or removed for the IP-CAN Session. In case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, some of those PCC rules may be used for application detection and control. The H-PCRF may also update the policy decision by defining an authorized QoS and enable or disable the service flow(s) of PCC Rules. If the PCEF controls the binding of IP-CAN bearers, the H-PCRF may add or change QoS information per QCI applicable to that IP-CAN session. In case of TDF, the H-PCRF selects the applicable ADC rules for the solicited application reporting with a TDF. If NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session and Network-initiated mode is selected, the H-PCRF determines the access that is to be used for the transfer of traffic and include the allowed access type in the PCC rules. If NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF determines one access is to be removed from multi access IP-CAN session.\n3.\tThe H-PCRF stores the updated PCC Rules, and ADC rules if available.\n4.\tStep 4 is only applicable if the Bearer Control Mode (BCM) selected is UE-only or, for UE/NW the H-PCRF determines that UE mode applies for the affected PCC Rules, and the PCRF receives an external trigger from the AF.\nThe PCRF may start a timer to wait for a UE requested bearer resource initiation, modification or removal procedure initiated by the UE, as depicted in figure 4.3.2.1.1.\nIf a UE requested bearer resource initiation, modification or termination procedure initiated by the terminal is received for the affected PCC rules while the timer is running, all subsequent steps in the present figure shall not be executed and, for case 1, the steps in figure 4.3.2.1.1 (on provisioning based on PULL procedure at PCEF –initiated IP-CAN session modification when the AF is located in the HPLMN), 4.3.2.2.1 (on provisioning based on PULL procedure at PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session modification when the AF is located in the VPLMN) and for cases 2a and 2b, the steps in figure 4.4.2.1.1 (Home Routed case) or 4.4.2.2.1 (Visited Access case) shall be executed instead.\nOtherwise, if the BCM selected is UE/NW, the PCRF shall proceed with the subsequent steps (provisioning based on PUSH procedure) in the present figure after timer expiry.\nNOTE 1:\tFor IMS Emergency session and RLOS session step 4 is not applicable.\n5.\tFor case 2a and 2b, if Gxx applies for the IP-CAN session and the user is not roaming, or the user is roaming in a Home Routed scenario or a Visited Access scenario for case 2a when the available QoS rule are not related to any IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules provisioning procedures described in clause 4.4.3.\nNOTE 2: This step is not executed if this procedure is triggered by PCEF subscribed events and/or credit re-authorisation triggers reported by the BBERF.\n6.\tThe H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the PCEF installs, modifies or removes PCC Rules and updates the policy decision, or to report PCEF subscribed events reported by the BBERF. The report includes the User Location Information and the User CSG Information (If received from the BBERF). If the provided PCC rules are related to an AF session associated with a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the service, the H-PCRF includes, in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP, the Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that it received from the AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL and, if AF provided the application usage thresholds, the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If the AF requests the access network information, the H-PCRF includes Required-Access-Info AVP in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and/or Charging-Rule-Remove AVP. In addition, the H-PCRF includes the Event-Trigger set to the value \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" if not provided yet. If the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP are provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP, the PCRF may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]. The PCRF includes the Removal-Of-Access AVP set to the value REMOVAL_OF_ACCESS (0) and the IP-CAN-Type AVP set to the value of removed access to remove one access from the multi access IP-CAN session. If the H-PCRF subscribes the change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, the H-PCRF may provide the Presence Reporting Area Information to the PCEF. If the RAN-Support-Info feature is enabled and local policy allows, for PCC rules with QCI of 1, the PCRF can provide the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP including the maximum packet loss rate(s) for uplink and/or downlink direction(s) in the Max-PLR-UL/DL AVP(s) respectively.\nWhen the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 6a ~ 6e are executed instead of step 6:\n6a.\tThe H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the V-PCRF to request that the PCEF installs, modifies or removes PCC Rules and updates the policy decision. In the case of VPLMN supporting Application Detection and Control feature for solicited application reporting, some of those PCC Rules may be used for application detection and control. If the provided PCC rules are related to an AF session associated with a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the service, the H-PCRF includes, in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP, the Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that it received from the AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL and, if AF provided the application usage thresholds, the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If the AF requests the access network information, the H-PCRF includes Required-Access-Info AVP in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and/or Charging-Rule-Remove AVP. In addition, the H-PCRF includes the Event-Trigger set to the value \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" if not provided yet.\n6b. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding PCC rules requested by the H-PCRF based on roaming agreements or locally configured policy. In case of TDF, V-PCRF extracts the ADC rules from the PCC Rules received from the H-PCRF and stores them.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the V-PCRF rejects provisioned PCC rules received from the H-PCRF, the remaining steps in this call flow are not followed. Instead, the V-PCRF shall notify the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter RAA, including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value PCC_RULE_EVENT, identify the failed PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9], and additionally may provide the acceptable QoS Information for the service.\n6c. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, for roaming UE with visited access, the V-PCRF initiates the TDF session establishment, modification, or termination. If the provided ADC rules are related to an AF session associated with a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the service, the H-PCRF includes, in the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP, the Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that are received from the AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL. Additionally, if the AF provided the application usage thresholds, the H-PCRF includes the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If the last ADC rule is deactivated, the V-PCRF requests the TDF to terminate the TDF session toward the V-PCRF as defined in clause 4.6.2. If there is no active TDF session between the TDF and the V-PCRF, the V-PCRF requests the TDF to establish the TDF session towards V-PCRF and provides ADC Rules to the TDF as defined in clause 4.6.1. If there is already an active TDF session between the TDF and the V-PCRF, the V-PCRF provides the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in clause 4.6.3.2.\n6d.\tFor case 2a and 2b, V-PCRF will derive the QoS rules from the PCC rules. The V-PCRF will initiate a Gateway Control and QoS Rule procedure as described in clause 4.4.3 to install, modify or remove QoS rules and optionally subscribe to new events in the BBERF.\n6e.\tThe BBERF installs, modifies or removes the identified QoS Rules. The BBERF also enforces the authorized QoS of the corresponding QoS Rules.\n6f. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the PCEF installs, modifies or removes PCC Rules.\n7.\tThe PCEF installs, modifies or removes the identified PCC Rules. The PCEF also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules. If QoS information is received per QCI, PCEF shall set/update the upper limit for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to the non-GBR bearer for that QCI. In the case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, the PCEF may also enforce application detection and control. The PCEF may perform resource sharing among PCC rules if requested from the PCRF. If allowed access type information is included in the PCC rules, the PCEF generates the NBIFOM routing rules based on the PCC rules. If the RAN-Support-Info feature is supported, the PCEF sets the UL/DL maximum packet loss rate value(s) as described in subclause B.3.18 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\nThe following applies for emergency sessions only:\nWhen the PCEF receives an IP-CAN Session Modification Request from the PCRF requesting the removal of the PCC rules of an emergency session, the PCEF starts an inactivity timer to enable the PSAP to request a callback session with the UE.\nWhen the timer expires, the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN Session Termination Request (per clause 4.2.2.1) to terminate the emergency session.\nIf, before the timer expires, the PCEF receives an IP-CAN Session Modification Request from the PCRF with PCC rules for an emergency session the PCEF cancels the timer.\n8.\tThe PCEF sends a Diameter RAA to acknowledge the RAR. The PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the outcome of the PCC rule operation\nWhen the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 8a ~ 8d are executed instead of step 8:\n8a.\tThe BBERF informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the operation by sending a Diameter RAA command.\n8b.\tThe PCEF informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the PCC rule operation by sending a Diameter RAA command.\n8c.\tThe V-PCRF stores the received information.\n8d.\tThe V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF about the outcome of the operation by sending a Diameter RAA command.\n9.\tIn case of TDF, solicited application reporting, for non-roaming UE/roaming UE with home routed access, H-PCRF initiates the TDF session establishment, modification, or termination. If the provided ADC rules are related to an AF session associated with a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the service, the H-PCRF includes, in the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP, the Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that are received from the AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL. Additionally, if the AF provided the application usage thresholds, the H-PCRF includes the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If the last ADC rule is deactivated, the H-PCRF requests the TDF to terminate the TDF session toward the H-PCRF as defined in clause 4.6.2. If there is no active TDF session between the TDF and the H-PCRF, the H-PCRF requests the TDF to establish the TDF session towards H-PCRF and provides ADC Rules to the TDF as defined in clause 4.6.1. If there is already an active TDF session between the TDF and the H-PCRF, H-PCRF provides the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in clause 4.6.3.2.\nNOTE 4: Step 9 can occur anytime after step 6.\n10.\tIf traffic steering control over St applies, if the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information needs to be provisioned for the IP-CAN session; the PCRF initiates the St session establishment procedure according to the subclause 4.9.1. If the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information provisioned to the TSSF needs to be updated, the PCRF initiates the St session modification procedure according to the subclause 4.9.2. If the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information is not needed for the IP-CAN session any more, the PCRF initiates the St session termination procedure according to the subclause 4.9.3.\n11.\tIn case of spending limits, for non-roaming/roaming UE with both home routed and visited access, H-PCRFinitiates Initial/ Intermediate/ Final Spending Limit Report Request. The H-PCRF sends an Initial Spending Limit Report Request if this is the first time a status notification of policy counter is requested for the user as defined in clause 4.7.1. If the H-PCRF decides to modify the list of subscribed policy counters the H-PCRF sends an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.2. If the H-PCRF decides to unsubscribe any future status notification of policy counters, it sends a Final Spending Limit Report Request to cancels the request for reporting the change of the status of the policy counters available at the OCS as defined in clause 4.7.3.\nNOTE 5: Step 11 can occur anytime after step 2.\n12.\tIf usage monitoring is enabled and the H-PCRF either removed the last PCC rule applicable for certain monitoring key, or disabled usage monitoring or requested usage report, the PCEF shall initiate an IP-CAN session modification procedure.\n13.\tWhen Gxx does not apply for the IP-CAN session, IP-CAN bearer signalling is executed separately for each IP-CAN bearer under the following conditions:\n-\tIf all PCC rules bound to a bearer have been removed or deactivated (bearer deactivation is applicable)\n-\tIf one or more bearers have to be modified\n-\tIf the PCEF needs to establish a new bearer (bearer establishment is applicable).\n-\tIf the PCEF needs to request access network information.\n-\tif the PCEF needs to send the NBIFOM routing rules to the UE in the corresponding access.\n14.\tIf the AF, in step 1, has requested notifications from the PCRF, e.g. in the case of access network information the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN session modification procedure to provide the requested information as described in clause 4.3.2.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the conditions of both step 14 and step 12 apply the PCEF can make use of only one IP-CAN session modification procedure in step 14.\n4.3.1.2.1.1\tAF located in HPLMN\nFigure 4.3.1.2.1.1.1 illustrates the process of AF session establishment triggered by PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification in an HPLMN. The figure depicts the interaction between the PCRF, AF, and HPLMN components, highlighting the session modification process. Key steps include session establishment, PCRF-initiated modification, and the resulting changes in the AF session. The figure emphasizes the importance of these interactions in managing and optimizing network resources for efficient communication.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.1.1.1: AF session establishment triggers PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification (AF in HPLMN)\n1.\tThe AF receives an internal or external trigger to set-up a new AF session and provides Service Information. The AF identifies the Service Information needed (e.g. IP address of the IP flow (s), port numbers to be used, information on media types, etc).\n2.\tThe AF provides the Service Information to the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter AAR for a new Rx Diameter session. If this AF session is associated with a sponsor, Sponsor-Identity AVP, optionally the Sponsoring-Action AVP set to applicable value and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP are included in Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP. If usage thresholds are to be associated with this sponsored AF session, then Granted-Service-Unit AVP is included in Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP. The AF can request access network information within the AAR by adding Required-Access-Info AVP(s) and Specific-Action AVP set to the value \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\". If the Service can be subject to resource sharing, the AF includes the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP. If PrioritySharing feature is supported and the service is allowed to use the same Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other AF sessions, the AF includes the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the Media-Component-Description AVP. If the CHEM feature is supported, the AF may also include the maximum packet loss rate(s) for uplink and/or downlink direction(s) in the Max-PLR-UL/DL AVP(s) respectively within the Media-Component-Description AVP. If the service has negotiated the background data transfer policy, the AF includes the reference id of the transfer policy within the Reference-Id AVP. To invoke MPS for DTS, the AF includes the MPS-Action AVP within the AAR, as specified in clause 5.3.\n3.\tThe H-PCRF stores the received Service Information.\n4.\tIf the H-PCRF requires subscription related information and does not have it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information. If the Reference-Id AVP is received, the PCRF retrieves the corresponding transfer policy from the SPR and derives the PCC rules for the background data transfer according to the transfer policy.\nIf the AF session is for MPS for DTS invocation, the PCRF performs MPS subscription checks if and only if requested by the AF, as described in subclause 4.4.11 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].\n5.\tThe SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the information about the allowed service(s), QoS information and PCC Rules information.\nNOTE:\tFor steps 4 and 5: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release.

The PCRF indicates whether the support for UE IP address/mask in the TFT filter is available in the IP-CAN session.\n8.\tThe H-PCRF interacts with the PCEF/BBERF/V-PCRF according to figure 4.3.1.1.1 (Interactions between BBERF/PCEF and PCRF for PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification).\n4.3.1.2.1.2\tAF located in VPLMN\nFigure 4.3.1.2.1.2.1 illustrates the process of AF session establishment triggered by PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification in a VPLMN. The figure depicts the interaction between the PCRF, IP-CAN, and VPLMN components, highlighting the session modification process. Key elements include the PCRF, which initiates the session modification, and the IP-CAN, which facilitates the communication between the PCRF and the VPLMN. The VPLMN component is responsible for managing the session and ensuring proper communication between the different entities involved. The figure provides a clear overview of the complex process involved in establishing an AF session in a VPLMN, showcasing the intricate interplay between these components.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.1.2.1: AF session establishment triggers PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification (AF in VPLMN)\n1.\tThe AF receives an internal or external trigger to set-up a new AF session and provides Service Information.

The figure depicts the interaction between the PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function) and the AF, which triggers the session modification. The session is initiated by the AF and managed by the PCRF, ensuring proper policy enforcement and charging capabilities. The figure highlights the role of the AF in session establishment and the collaboration between the AF and PCRF for session modification, emphasizing the importance of these functions in maintaining efficient and secure communication within the HPLMN.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.2.1.1: AF session modification triggers PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification (AF in HPLMN)\n1.\tThe AF receives an internal or external trigger to modify an existing AF session and provide related Service Information.\n2.\tThe AF identifies the Service Information needed (e.g. IP address of the IP flow(s), port numbers to be used, information on media types, etc.).\n3.\tThe AF provides the Service Information to the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter AAR for the existing Rx Diameter session corresponding to the modified AF session.

If this AF session is associated with a sponsor and the AF wants to disable sponsored data connectivity the AF includes the Sponsoring-Action AVP set to the value \"DISABLE_SPONSORING\" within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP. The AF can request access network information within the AAR by adding Required-Access-Info AVP(s) and Specific-Action AVP set to the value \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\". If resource sharing conditions have been changed, the AF includes the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP. If the service has negotiated the background data transfer policy, the AF includes the reference id of the transfer policy within the Reference-Id AVP. If PrioritySharing feature is supported and the service is allowed to use the same Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other AF sessions, the AF includes the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP to indicate if priority sharing is enabled or disabled. The AF may also include the Pre-emption-Capability AVP and the Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP for the PCRF to determine the ARP values and include the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP at the command level for the PCRF to perform the pre-emption control. If the CHEM feature is supported, the AF may also include the maximum packet loss rate(s) for uplink and/or downlink direction(s) in the Max-PLR-UL/DL AVP(s) respectively within the Media-Component-Description AVP. To invoke/revoke MPS for DTS, the AF includes the MPS-Action AVP within the AAR as specified in clause 5.3.\n4.\tThe H-PCRF stores the received Service Information. If the Reference-Id AVP is received, the PCRF retrieves the corresponding transfer policy from the SPR and derives the PCC rules for the background data transfer according to the transfer policy.\nIf the AF session is for MPS for DTS invocation, the PCRF performs MPS subscription checks if and only if requested by the AF, as described in subclause 4.4.11 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].\n5.\tIf the AF session is associated with a sponsor and sponsored service is enabled,\n-\tif the UE is in the non-roaming case or UE is roaming with the home routed case and operator policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCRF authorizes the request based on sponsored data connectivity profile obtained from the SPR;\n-\tif the UE is roaming with the home routed case and operator policies do not allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case or the UE is roaming with the visited access case, the H-PCRF rejects the request.\nThe H-PCRF identifies the affected established IP-CAN Session(s) using the information previously received from the PCEF/V-PCRF and the Service Information received from the AF.\n6.\tThe H-PCRF sends a Diameter AAA to the AF.\n7.\tThe H-PCRF interacts with the BBERF/PCEF/V-PCRF according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.2. 2 . 1 illustrates the process of an Access Function (AF) session modification in a mobile network, specifically triggered by a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF). This session modification involves an IP-based Charging and Network Control (IP-CAN) Session Modification, which is initiated within the VPLMN (Virtual Private Land Mobile Network). The figure showcases the intricate network interactions and protocols that occur when a service provider modifies a subscriber's data plan or adds new services, ensuring accurate billing and network management.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.2.2.1 AF session modification triggers PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification (AF in VPLMN)\n1.\tThe AF receives an internal or external trigger to modify an existing AF session and provide related Service Information.\n2.\tThe AF identifies the Service Information needed (e.g. IP address of the IP flow(s), port numbers to be used, information on media types, etc.). If resource sharing conditions have been changed, the AF includes the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP. If PrioritySharing feature is supported and the service is allowed to use the same Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other AF sessions, the AF may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP to indicate if priority sharing is enabled or disabled.\n3.\tThe AF provides the Service Information to the V-PCRF by sending a Diameter AAR for the existing Rx Diameter session corresponding to the modified AF session. If this AF session is associated with a sponsor, Sponsor-Identity AVP and Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP are included in Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP. If usage thresholds are to be associated with this sponsored AF session, then Granted-Service-Unit AVP is included in Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP. The AF can request access network information within the AAR by adding Required-Access-Info AVP(s) and Specific-Action AVP set to the value \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\". To invoke/revoke MPS for DTS, the AF includes the MPS-Action AVP within the AAR, as specified in clause 5.3.\n4.\tThe V-PCRF stores the received Service Information.\nNOTE: \tThe V-PCRF may employ operator policies and reject the  from the AF if the provided Service Information is not acceptable. If this happens, the V-PCRF replies immediately to the AF, includes an unsuccessful Result-Code or Experimental-Result-Code in the AAA, and the remaining steps of this call flow are not carried out.\n5.\tThe V-PCRF forwards the Diameter AAR to the H-PCRF.\n6.\tThe H-PCRF stores the received Service Information.\nIf the AF session is for MPS for DTS invocation, the PCRF performs MPS subscription checks if and only if requested by the AF, as described in subclause 4.4.11 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].\n7.\tThe H-PCRF identifies the affected established IP-CAN Session(s) using the information previously received from the PCEF/V-PCRF and the Service Information received from the AF.\n8.\tThe H-PCRF responds with a Diameter AAA.\n9.\tThe V-PCRF forwards the Diameter AAA to the AF.\n10.\tThe H-PCRF interacts with the BBERF/PCEF via the V-PCRF according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.3. 1 . 1 depicts the removal of PCC/QoS rules at the AF session release in an HPLMN network. The figure illustrates the process of releasing an Access Function (AF) session, which involves the deactivation of Quality of Service (QoS) policies and Performance Call Control (PCC) rules. This step is crucial for ensuring efficient network management and resource allocation. The figure highlights the interaction between the Serving GNodeB (S-GNB), the Access and Mobility Management Entity (AMME), and the Home Location Register (HLR) in the context of an HPLMN network. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of coordination and communication among these entities for a smooth session release and optimal network performance.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.3.1.1: Removal of PCC/QoS Rules at AF session release (AF in HPLMN)\n1.\tThe AF receives an internal or external trigger for a session release.\n2.\tThe AF sends a session termination request, Diameter STR, to the H-PCRF to request the removal of the session. The AF can request access network information within the STR by adding a Required-Access-Info AVP.\n3.\tThe H-PCRF identifies the affected IP-CAN Session where PCC Rules and, if available, QoS Rules for the IP flow(s) of this AF session are installed. These PCC/QoS Rules need to be removed.\nIf the AF session being terminated corresponds to a session that included the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the Media-Component-Description AVP, if the related media flow(s) was in priority sharing with other media flows, the PCRF should readjust the Allocation and Retention Priority for the remaining services sharing priority. These PCC/QoS Rules may need to be modified.\nIf the AF did not request access network information, and if no usage thresholds due to an AF session associated with a sponsor were provided that relate to the installed PCC rules and RAN-NAS-Cause feature is not supported, step 4a applies. If AF requested access network information, or usage thresholds due to an AF associated with a sponsor were provided that relate to the installed PCC rules,step 4b applies. If RAN-NAS-Cause is supported but Enh-RAN-NAS-Cause is not supported over Gx and the previous conditions do not apply , step 4a applies.. Otherwise step 4b applies.\n4a.\tThe H-PCRF sends Diameter STA, session termination answer, to the AF.\n4b.\tThe H-PCRF sends Diameter STA, session termination answer, to the AF and includes access network information and/or information about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report or RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN release cause(s) if available obtained in step 5.\n5.\tThe H-PCRF interacts with the BBERF/PCEF/V-PCRF according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.3.2.1 illustrates the process of removing PCC/QoS rules at the AF session release in an AF in VPLMN. The figure depicts the network elements involved, including the PCC, AF, and VPLMN, and the steps taken to remove the rules during the session release. This process is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable communication in the network.\nFigure 4.3.1.2.3.2.1: Removal of PCC/QoS Rules at AF session release (AF in VPLMN)\n1.\tThe AF receives an internal or external trigger for a session release.\n2.\tThe AF sends a session termination request, Diameter STR, to the V-PCRF to request the removal of the session.

The figure depicts the interaction between the PCEF (Packet Classification and Encapsulation Function) and the AF, which is responsible for handling IP-CAN (Inter-Process Communication) sessions. The session modification is depicted through the exchange of messages between the PCEF and the AF, highlighting the synchronization and coordination required for efficient communication within the HPLMN (Home PLMN). The figure emphasizes the importance of accurate session management in maintaining seamless connectivity and data transmission within the network.\nFigure 4.3.2.1.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification. AF in HPLMN.\n1.\tFor case 2a and 2b, the BBERF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules request procedure described in subclause 4.4.2.\n2.\tThe PCEF may receive a request for IP-CAN Session modification. The IP-CAN session modification can be initiated upon receiving UE-initiated resource modification request (case 1), a new IP-CAN bearer establishment signalling (case 1), due to a specific event (e.g. UE requested PDN connectivity in all cases) or an internal trigger(e.g. if the PCEF supports Application Detection and Control feature, the start/stop of application traffic event that matches with one or more activated PCC rules for application detection and control that do not contain the Mute-Notification AVP has been detected by the PCEF).\n3.\tThe PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the IP-CAN session modification for non-roaming case and Home Routed roaming scenario. The PCEF sends a CCR command to the H-PCRF including the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value “UPDATE_REQUEST”. For an IP-CAN Session modification where an existing IP-CAN bearer is modified, the PCEF supplies the specific event that caused the IP-CAN Session modification within the Event-Trigger AVP and the PCC rule name(s) and their status within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP. For an IP-CAN Session modification where an existing IP-CAN bearer is terminated, the PCEF supplies the affected PCC rule name(s), their status set to inactive, the rule failure code and, if available, the RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN cause(s) within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP. In the case where the UE initiates a resource modification request procedure, the PCEF includes the Packet-Filter-Information AVP, Packet-Filter-Operation AVP and QoS-Information AVP, if applicable. In the case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, when the start or stop of the application’s traffic, identified by TDF-Application-Identifier, is detected, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, the PCEF shall report the information regarding the detected application’s traffic in the Application-Detection-Information AVP in the CCR command. If NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session, if one of the conditions specified in subclause 4.5.25.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] applies, the PCEF informs the PCRF accordingly making use of the applicable event trigger, i.e. \"ADDITION_OF_ACCESS\", \" REMOVAL_OF_ACCESS\", \"UNAVAILIBILITY_OF_ACCESS\", \"AVAILIBILITY_OF_ACCESS\" or \"ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE\".\nWhen the UE is roaming in a Visited Access case, steps 3a ~ 3c are executed instead of step 3:\n3a.\tThe PCEF sends a Diameter CCR to the V-PCRF to request PCC/ADD Rules for the roaming user. The parameters listed in step 3 are applicable here.\n3b. The V-PCRF stores the information received in the Diameter CCR from the PCEF.\n3c. The V-PCRF sends a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to “UPDATE_REQUEST” to the H-PCRF. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP and the assigned S9 subsession identifier within Subsession-Id AVP. The Subsession-Operation AVP is set to the value “MODIFICATION”.\n4.\tIf the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.\n5.\tThe SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information.\nNOTE 1:\tFor steps 4 and 5: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release. The SPR’s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.\n6.\tIf the AF requested a notification of the corresponding event, the H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the event that caused the request. If the session modification affected a sponsored data flow and the H-PCRF detects that the usage threshold provided by the AF has been reached, this message includes the accumulated usage in the Used-Service-Unit AVP within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP and the Specific-Action AVP set to the value USAGE_REPORT.\n7.\tIf step 6 takes place, the AF may take the application specific procedure (e.g. for IMS refer to 3GPP TS 23.228 [59], replies with a Diameter RAA and may provide updated service information within. Additionally, the AF may terminate the Rx session as per subclause 4.3.1.2.3.\n8-11.\tIf all service data flows for an AF session are deleted, the AF session is terminated. If the session modification affected a sponsored data flow and the H-PCRF detects the UE is roaming with home routed case, the H-PCRF initiates the AF session termination.\nIf the IP-CAN session is associated with a sponsor, usage thresholds were provided by the AF earlier, and the H-PCRF has usage data that has not yet been reported to the AF, the H-PCRF informs the AF, in step 11, about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report.\nIf RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN cause(s) and/or access network information were received in step 3, the H-PCRF sends this information to the AF in step 11.\nNOTE 2:\tInitial/intermediate/Final Spending Limit Report Request can be triggered at any time after this if PCRF, based on policy decisions, find the need to initialize, modify, or deactivate spending limit reporting for the subscriber according to subclause 4.7.1/2/3 respectively.\n12. \tThe H-PCRF selects or generates PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The H-PCRF may also identify existing PCC rules that need to be modified or removed. In the case of VPLMN supporting Application Detection and Control feature for solicited application reporting, some of those PCC Rules may be used for application detection and control. The PCC Rules may relate to any of the matching AF sessions or may exist in the PCRF without matching to any AF session. The H-PCRF may also make a policy decision by deriving an authorized QoS and by deciding whether service data flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or disabled. The H-PCRF may also update the ADC decisions and select the ADC rules to be installed, modified or removed for the IP-CAN session in the non-roaming case. If the NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session, the PCRF can also make a decision of NBIFOM as defined in subclause 4.5.25.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\n13. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the PCEF using CCA command. The H-PCRF also provides the selected Bearer Control Mode, if changed and applicable for the IP-CAN type. The PCRF may also provide a new list of event triggers for which the PCRF requires to be notified. The PCRF may provide QoS information within the APN-AMBR AVP and the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP. In the case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, the H-PCRF may provision the PCC rules for application detection and control to the PCEF.\nWhen the UE is roaming in a Visited Access, steps 13a ~13c are executed instead of step 13:\n13a. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter CCA to the V-PCRF including the PCC Rules to be provisioned within the Subsession-Decision AVP, along with the S9 subsession identifier as received in step 3b within the Subsession-Id AVP. Other parameters listed in step 9 are also applicable here.\n13b. The V-PCRF validates the QoS parameters requested within the PCC Rules and enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization requested by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements. In case of TDF, the V-PCRF extracts and validates the ADC rules from the PCC rules received from the H-PCRF according to the local policy and roaming agreements if provided by the H-PCRF.\nNOTE:\tIf the V-PCRF rejects provisioned PCC rules received from the H-PCRF, the remaining steps in this call flow are not followed. Instead, the V-PCRF shall notify the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter CCR, including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value PCC_RULE_EVENT, identify the failed PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], and additionally may provide the acceptable QoS Information for the service.\n13c. The V-PCRF provisions PCC rules to the PCEF by using CCA command. The parameters listed in step 13a are applicable here.\n13d. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, the V-PCRF provisions the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in subclause 4.6.3.2. In case of TDF, unsolicited application reporting, the V-PCRF initiates the TDF session termination as defined in clause 4.6.2 if the PCEF reported the UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE to the V-PCRF and there is an active Ipv4 address related TDF session for that IP-CAN session.\n14. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, the H-PCRF provisions the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in subclause 4.6.3.2. In case of TDF, unsolicited application reporting, the H-PCRF initiates the TDF session termination as defined in subclause 4.6.2 if the PCEF reported the UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE to the H-PCRF and there is an active Ipv4 address related TDF session for that IP-CAN session.\n15. The PCEF installs, modifies or removes the provided PCC Rules. The PCEF also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flows according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules. In the case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, the PCEF enforces application detection and control.\n16. If traffic steering control over St applies, if the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information needs to be provisioned for the IP-CAN session; the PCRF initiates the St session establishment procedure according to the subclause 4.9.2. If the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information provisioned to the TSSF needs to be updated, the PCRF initiates the St session modification procedure according to the subclause 4.9.3. If the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information is not needed for the IP-CAN session any more, the PCRF initiates the St session termination procedure according to the subclause 4.9.2.\n17.\tThe PCEF may initiate IP-CAN session signalling or acknowledges any IP-CAN Session signalling for IP-CAN Session modification received in step 2.\n18.\tIf the PCRF requested to confirm that the resources associated to a PCC Rule have been successfully allocated or the resource release procedure has concluded, the PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure is performed again starting from step 3.\n19.\tFor case 2a and 2b, the PCRF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules Provision procedure described in subclause 4.4.3.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.1 illustrates the process of PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification, where the AF session signalling is proxied over S9 between the V-AF and the H-PCRF when the AF resides in the VPLMN. The figure depicts the interaction between the V-PCRF, H-PCRF, and the AF, highlighting the role of the PCEF in modifying IP-CAN sessions within the VPLMN. The diagram emphasizes the importance of this process in managing and optimizing IP-CAN sessions for improved network performance and reliability.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification, AF in VPLMN. If the AF resides in the VPLMN, the V-PCRF proxies the AF session signalling over S9 between the V-AF and the H-PCRF.\n1.\tSteps 1 to 5 in figure 4.3.2.1.1 are executed.\nWhen all PCC Rules related to a particular AF session are removed, the H-PCRF initiates the AF session termination procedure. For each AF session bound to the modified IP-CAN session that is being removed, steps 2-9 are executed instead of steps 10-13:\n2.\tThe H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the V-PCRF by sending a Diameter ASR to the V-PCRF.\n3.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the Diameter ASR command to the V-AF.\n4.\tThe V-AF responds by sending a Diameter ASA command to the V-PCRF.\n5.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the ASA command to the H-PCRF.\n6.\tThe V-AF sends a Diameter STR command to the V-PCRF to indicate that the session has been terminated.\n7.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the Diameter STR command to the H-PCRF.\n8.\tThe V-PCRF proxies the Diameter STA command to the V-AF.\n9.\tThe H-PCRF responds by sending a Diameter STA command.\nWhen the H-PCRF receives event triggers related to specific actions that the AF has subscribed to, the H-PCRF initiates the AF session modification procedure to notify the AF of these specific actions. For each Afsession bound to the modified IP-CAN session that has subscribed to these specific actions, steps 10-13 are executed instead of steps 2-9:\n10. If the H-PCRF is notified of an event in the access network that has to be notified to the V-AF for an AF session, the H-PCRF informs of the event by sending a RAR command to the V-PCRF.\n11. The V-PCRF proxies the RAR command to the V-AF.\n12.\tThe V-AF responds by sending a RAA command to the V-PCRF.\n13. The V-PCRF proxies the RAA to the H-PCRF.\n14.\tSteps 12 to 18 in figure 4.3.2.1.1 are executed.\n",

The figure highlights the importance of this process in ensuring the smooth operation of network services and the efficient management of network resources.\nFigure 4.4.1.1 Gateway Control Session Establishment.\n1.\tThe BBERF receives a message or indication that it needs to establish a Gateway Control session.\nFor case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF detects that a UE has been assigned a Local IP address that the UE may use as a Care-of Address in MIP registrations (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clause 6.3).\nFor case 2b, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF detects that the UE requests an IP-CAN session to be established (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clauses 4.5.2 and 5.6.1) or, at BBERF relocation, to be resumed with a certain APN (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2) or the UE requests a pre-registration with this BBERF (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clause 9.3.1).\n2.\tFor the non-roaming case, the BBERF initiates a Gateway Control session with the H-PCRF by sending a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST.

The figure depicts the initial handshake between the client and the server, where the client sends a TDF packet to initiate the session. The server responds with a TDF packet containing a session ID and a timestamp. The client then verifies the session ID and timestamp, ensuring the integrity of the server's response. This process is crucial for secure and reliable communication in telecommunication networks.\nFigure 4.6.1A.1: TDF Session Establishment in case of unsolicited reporting\n1.\tThe TDF initiates a session by sending a CCR to the PCRF using the CC-Request-Type  set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST.

This leads to using separate TDF sessions for the Ipv6 addresses for the same IP-CAN session. The TDF reports new application detection information related to that Ipv6 prefix via any of the TDF sessions at a later stage.\n",

                    "text_content": "Session binding is the association of the AF session information to an IP-CAN session.\nWhen the PCRF accepts an AA-Request from the AF over the Rx interface with service information, the PCRF shall perform session binding and associate the described service IP flows within the AF session information (and therefore the applicable PCC rules) to one and only one existing IP-CAN session. When the PCRF receives an AA-Request from the P-CSCF acting as an AF over the Rx interface for P-CSCF Restoration, the PCRF shall perform session binding and associate the request to the existing IMS PDN connection and perform P-CSCF Restoration for that impacted IMS PDN connection. This association is done comparing the user IP address received via the Rx interface in either the Frame-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP with the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 prefix received via the Gx interface. The UE Identity if present in the Subscription-Id AVP and the PDN information if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP may also assist on this association. The Domain identity if available in the IP-Domain-Id AVP may also assist on this association, e.g. if other user identity information than the UE IP address is unavailable and the UE IP addresses is not unique for a certain APN.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE IP address is unique per Domain identity.\nNOTE 2:\tThe IP-Domain-Id AVP is helpful in the following scenario: Within a PLMN, there are several separate IP address domains, with PCEF(s) that allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same private address range to Ues. The same IP address can thus be allocated to Ues served by PCEFs in different address domains. If one PCRF controls several PCEFs in different IP address domains, the UE IP address is thus not sufficient for the session binding. An AF can serve Ues in different IP address domains, either by having direct IP interfaces to those domains, or by having interconnections via NATs in the user plane between PCEFs and the AF. If a NAT is used, the AF obtains the IP address allocated to the UE via application level signalling and supplies it for the session binding as Framed-IP-Address to the PCRF. The AF supplies an IP-Domain-Id value denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in addition. The AF can derive the appropriate value from the source address (allocated by the NAT) of incoming user plane packets.\nNOTE 3：When the scenario described in NOTE 2 applies and the AF is a P-CSCF it is assumed that the P-CSCF has direct IP interfaces to the different IP address domains and that no NAT is located between P-GW and P-CSCF. How a non-IMS AF obtains the UE private IP address to be provided to the PCRF is out of scope of the present release; it is unspecified how to support applications that use a protocol that does not retain the original UE’s private IP address.\nIf the Domain identity is not used to assist association, the PCRF will determine that the UE has an IP-CAN session if the IP address (Ipv4 or Ipv6) received over the Rx interface matches the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 prefix received via one or more of the following interfaces: Gx interface and S9 interface, and if the UE identity is used to assist the association, the UE identity received over the Rx interface matches the UE identity received via one or more of the following interfaces: Gx interface and S9 interface.\nIf the Domain identity is used to assist association, the PCRF will determine that the UE has an IP-CAN session if the Domain identity received over the Rx interface matches the PCEF Identity received via the Gx interface, and the IP address (Ipv4) received over the Rx interface matches the Ipv4 address received via the Gx interface.\nFor the roaming scenario, the Domain identity may be used for session binding when the AF and PCEF are located in same PLMN, i.e. for the home routed case, the Domain identity may be used by the (H-)PCRF for session binding, and for the visited case, Domain identity could be used by the V-PCRF for session binding.\nFor an IP-CAN session associated to a dedicated APN for the purpose of offering services to remote UEs via a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, the PCRF shall use the UE IPv6 prefix alone in the session binding.\nNOTE 4:\tIn case the UE identity in the IP-CAN and the application level identity for the user are of different kinds, the PCRF needs to maintain, or have access to, the mapping between the identities. Such mapping is not subject to specification within this TS.\nNOTE 5:\tAn Ipv6 address provided over Rx matches an Ipv6 prefix provided over Gx or S9 if the Ipv6 address belongs to the Ipv6 (sub-)network prefix.\nNOTE 6:\tThe PCRF derives the PCEF identity from the Origin-Host AVP of the CCR command received from the PCEF. In order to correlate the PCEF Identity and the domain identity received over the Rx interface, the PCRF uses configured mapping between those identities. The Domain Identity is useful for assistance in session binding if the Origin-Host of the Gx CCR command is not modified by intermediate Diameter proxies deployed between the PCEF and the PCRF.\nNOTE 7:\tThe PCEF identity is not transported over S9 reference point in the present release. So for the visited access with AF located in HPLMN case, session binding assisted with Domain identity is not supported in the present release. Session binding is still possible based on other available information in addition to the IP address when provided by the AF, according to the current procedures.\nIf the PCRF uses the Called-Station-Id AVP to assist the association, the PCRF shall apply the procedures in Annex I to match APN information.\nAs a result from the session binding function, the PCRF identifies what IP-CAN session the current AF session is related with. If the PCRF is not capable of executing the Session Binding, the PCRF shall issue an AA-Answer command to the AF with a negative response.\n",

The re-evaluation may, for a service data flow, require a new binding with another IP-CAN bearer. The BBF should, if the PCRF requests the same change to the ARP/QCI for all PCC/QoS Rules bound to the same bearer, modify the bearer ARP/QCI as requested.\nNOTE 5:\tA QoS change of the default EPS bearer causes the bearer binding for PCC/QoS rules previously bound to the default EPS bearer to be re-evaluated.\nDuring PCC/QoS rules enforcement, if packet filters are provided to the UE, the BBF shall provide packet filters with the same content as that in the SDF template filters received over the Gx/Gxx interface from the PCRF within the Flow-Description or the Flow-Information AVP. The representation/format of the packet filters provided by the network to the UE is access-system dependent and may vary between accesses and also may be different from that of the SDF template filter on the Gx/Gxx interface. The PCRF may control the provisioning of packet filters to the UE, i.e. which filters are required to be sent to the UE, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\nIf PCC rule(s) with application identifier(s) are the only PCC rule(s) that are bound to a bearer which requires traffic mapping information, the PCEF shall derive traffic mapping information based on implementation specific logic (e.g. traffic mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]) and provides it to the UE.\nNOTE 6:\tFor GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one bearer with no TFT packet filter for the uplink direction.\nRequirements specific for each type of IP-CAN are defined in the IP-CAN specific Annex. The Bearer Binding Function may also be located in the PCRF (e.g. as specified in Annex D for GPRS running UE only IP-CAN bearer establishment mode). Selection of the Bearer Binding location shall be based on the Bearer Control Mode selected by the PCRF.\n",

                    "text_content": "Several QoS parameters mapping functions are needed during PCC interaction. These functions are located at the AF, PCRF, PCEF and UE. The main purpose of these mapping functions is the conversion of QoS parameters from one format to another. Examples of QoS information are:\n-\tParts of a session description language (SDI), e.g. SDP, MPD.\n-\tIP QoS parameters.\n-\tAccess specific QoS parameters.\nOne QoS mapping function is located at the AF, which maps the application specific information into the appropriate AVPs that are carried over the Rx interface. The AF derives information about the service from the SDI or from other sources. The mapping is application specific. If SDP (IETF RFC 2327 [11]) is used as SDI, the AF should apply the mapping described in clause 6.2. If MPD (3GPP TS 26.247 [30]) is used, the AF may apply the mapping described in Annex X in 3GPP TS 26.247 [30]. For IMS, the mapping rules in clause 6.2 shall be used at the P-CSCF. The AF passes service information to the PCRF over the Rx interface. Subclause 6.2 specifies the QoS parameter mapping functions at the AF applicable for all IMS P-CSCFs regardless of the access technology.\nOne QoS mapping function is located at the PCRF, which maps the service information received over the Rx interface into IP QoS parameters (e.g. QCI, GBR, MBR, ARP, …). This mapping is access independent. Subclause 6.3 specifies the QoS mapping functions at the PCRF applicable for all accesses.\nThe other mapping functions located at PCEF, BBERF, and UE are implementation dependent and are not specified within this specification except for GPRS case.\nThe PCRF notes and authorizes the IP flows described within this service information by mapping from service information to Authorized IP QoS parameters for transfer to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. Both the PCEF and BBERF will map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters to the access specific QoS parameters. For GPRS, the GGSN acting as PCEF will map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters to the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters.\nThe general QoS mapping framework is shown in figure 6.1.1.\nFigure 6.1.1 illustrates the framework for Quality of Service (QoS) mapping, which is essential for ensuring optimal network performance. The figure showcases various components involved in the process, including the network elements, traffic classes, and QoS parameters. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of mapping traffic classes to appropriate network resources and the role of QoS parameters in achieving the desired performance levels. The framework depicted in the figure is crucial for network administrators to effectively manage and optimize network resources for different traffic types, thereby improving overall network efficiency and user experience.\nFigure 6.1.1: Framework for QoS mapping\nNOTE 1:\tThe AF can derive the Service information from the AF session signalling.\nNOTE 2:\tService Information on Rx interface to Authorized IP QoS parameters mapping.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the UE initiated bearer setup, the UE may derive IP QoS parameters, requested Access-Specific QoS parameters mapping and Authorized Access-Specific QoS parameters from the AF session signalling.\nNOTE 4:\tAuthorized IP QoS parameters to Authorized Access-Specific QoS parameters mapping.\nNOTE 5:\tAccess Specific QoS parameters with Authorized Access-Specific QoS parameters comparison.\n",

When a UE desires to establish/modify an IP-CAN bearer the following steps are followed:\n1.\tThe AF can map from SDI within the AF session signalling to service information passed to the PCRF over the Rx interface. (see clause 6.2 if SDP is used as SDI).\n2.\tThe PCRF shall map from the service information received over the Rx interface to the Authorized IP QoS parameters that shall be passed to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. The mapping is performed for each IP flow. Upon a request from the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF combines per direction the individual Authorized IP QoS parameters per flow (see clause 6.3).\n3.\tThe UE derives access specific QoS parameters, e.g. UMTS QoS parameters, and, if an IP BS manager is present, IP QoS parameters from the AF session signalling in an application specific manner. The IP and access specific QoS parameters should be generated according to application demands.\n\nFor GPRS, the recommendations for conversational (3GPP TS 26.114 [29]) or streaming applications (3GPP TS 26.234 [6]) should also be taken into account when the UE derives the IP and UMTS QoS parameters. If SDP is used as SDI, e.g. for IMS, the UE should apply clause 6.5.1.and should also apply mapping rules for the authorised QoS parameters in clause 6.5.2 to derive the maximum values for the different requested bit rates and traffic classes. In case the UE multiplexes several IP flows onto the same PDP Context, it has to combine their IP and UMTS QoS parameters. If an IP BS manager is present, the Translation/Mapping function maps the IP QoS parameters to the corresponding UMTS QoS parameters.\n4.\tThe PCEF/BBERF shall map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters received from PCRF to the Authorized access specific QoS parameters.\nFor GPRS. The GGSN shall map to the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters (see clause 6.4.1.1).\n5.\tThe PCEF/BBERF shall compare the requested access specific QoS parameters against the authorized access specific QoS parameters.\nFor GPRS, the GGSN shall compare the UMTS QoS parameters of the PDP context against the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters (see clause 6.4.1.2).\nThe mapping that takes place in the UE and the network should be compatible in order to ensure that the PCEF will be able to correctly authorize the session.\nFigure 6.1.1.1 shows the different kind of QoS parameters in the different points of QoS mapping figure. Due to the UE requests, there are bidirectional flows between the UE and the PCRF.\nFigure 6.1.1.1 illustrates the Quality of Service (QoS) mapping for User Equipment (UE) initiated IP Control Plane (CAN) bearer traffic. The figure depicts the various stages of the IP CAN bearer, starting from the UE and moving through the network infrastructure, including the Core Network Gateway (CGN), the IP Core Network, and finally reaching the Internet. The QoS mapping is essential for ensuring that critical traffic, such as voice and video calls, are prioritized and delivered with minimal latency and jitter. The figure also highlights the role of the IP Core Network in managing and controlling the traffic flow, as well as the importance of the CGN in providing a seamless transition between the mobile network and the IP Core Network. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the QoS mapping process for UE initiated IP CAN bearers, emphasizing the importance of efficient network management and traffic prioritization in modern telecommunications networks.\nFigure 6.1.1.1: QoS mapping for UE initiated IP CAN bearers\n",

The steps are:\n1.\tThe Application provides the UMTS BS Manager, possibly via the IP BS Manager and the Translation/Mapping function, with relevant information to perform step 2 or step 4. (Not subject to standardization within 3GPP).\n2.\tIf needed, information from step 1 is used to access a proper set of UMTS QoS Parameters. See 3GPP TS 26.114 [29] for Conversational Codec Applications and 3GPP TS 26.234 [6] for Streaming Codec Applications.\n3.\tIf SDP is available then the SDP Parameters should give guidance for the UMTS BS Manager (possibly via the IP Manager and the Translation/Mapping function) ,according to the rules in clause 6.5.1, to set the Maximum Bitrate UL/DL and the Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL. Furthermore the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL and Maximum Authorised Traffic Class should be derived according to the rules in clause 6.5.2.\n4.\tA set of UMTS QoS Parameters values from step 2 (or directly from step 1) is possibly merged together with the Maximum Bitrate UL/DL and the Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL from step 3. The result should constitute the requested UMTS QoS Parameters. The UE should check that the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL (depending on the requested Traffic Class) does not exceed the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL derived in step 3. Furthermore, if the UE has implemented the mapping rule for Maximum Authorized Traffic Class, as defined in clause 6.5.2, the UE should check that the requested Traffic Class does not exceed the Maximum Authorised Traffic Class derived in step 3.\nFigure 6.5.1 illustrates the framework for generating requested Quality of Service (QoS) parameters in the User Equipment (UE). The figure depicts the various components involved in the process, including the UE, the Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) platform, and the Network Management System (NMS). The UE sends a request to the NFV platform, which then processes the request and sends the necessary QoS parameters back to the UE. The NMS is responsible for monitoring and managing the network, ensuring that the QoS parameters are being met. The figure also shows how the different components are interconnected, highlighting the importance of coordination and communication between them.\nFigure 6.5.1: Framework for generating requested QoS parameters in the UE\n",

For visited access case, the V-PCRF shall send the Diameter session modification message to the H-DRA to update the DRA binding information only if the UE’s address(es) is updated. The detailed procedure is similar to the Establishment of Diameter sessions, which is described in the clause 7.4.2.1.\nTermination of Diameter sessions that impact the DRA binding occur at the following cases:\n-\tGateway control session termination\n-\tIP-CAN session termination\nThe DRA client (BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below if the DRA (redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or an appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect) interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as described in clause 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].\nFigure 7.4.2.3.1.1 illustrates the termination of Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect), showcasing the process of session termination in a telecommunications network. The figure depicts the interaction between the client, server, and redirector, highlighting the role of the redirector in managing session termination. Key components include the client, server, redirector, and the session context, which are essential for efficient communication and resource management. The figure emphasizes the importance of proper session termination in maintaining network stability and security.\nFigure 7.4.2.3.1.1: Termination of Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect)\n1.\tClient receives an external trigger (e.g. an IP-CAN session termination is initiated by the UE or PCRF) that triggers the client to terminate Diameter session with server (i.e. PCRF)\n2\tA Diameter Termination Request (e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and 4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to the DRA (redirect).\n3.\tA Diameter Termination Request (e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and 4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to PRCF-1.

The figure illustrates the process where a Diameter session is redirected to another network, represented by the arrow pointing from the initiating network to the terminating network. Key components include the Diameter Application Server (DAS), which handles the session initiation, and the Diameter Registrar (DR), which manages the session termination.

The PCRF can push policy decisions and provision event triggers in an unsolicited fashion using an RAR. It can also install policy decisions in a solicited manner by responding to a CCR sent by the client (BBERF for Gxx, PCEF for Gx, TDF for Sd, V-PCRF for S9).\nThe client and the server can initiate transactions that modify the state of the session independently (e.g. CCR from the client and RAR from the server) and potentially concurrently. Additionally, there may be Diameter agents in between the client and server (e.g. DRA or in general Diameter relays/proxies) that could cause messages to be delivered out of order. This can lead to race conditions that may result in the wrong information maintained by the client and/or server for a session.\nNote that race conditions occur in different ways based on the application. Also, their impact is specific to the application. For example, even though Gx is based on DCCA (RFC 4006), Gx is much more vulnerable to race conditions as Gx allows sessions to be updated based on RARs and CCAs whereas DCCA only allows the server to update the session based on a CCA. The RAR is merely used to solicit the client to send a CCR.\n",

                    "text_content": "This clause describes the optional procedures for handling Diameter race conditions in a deterministic manner for the following interfaces: Gx,  and S9. These procedures apply to the PCEF (Gx), BBERF (Gxx), TDF (Sd) and PCRF (Gx,  and S9).\nIn this clause, the terms “client” and “server” are relative to the session context. As an example, for the Gx interface, the client is the PCEF and the server is the PCRF. The term “node” can refer to either a client or a server. The term “transaction” refers to a Diameter request and its associated answer. The term “ongoing transaction” refers to a transaction that has an outstanding answer.\nA node that supports the procedures defined in this clause and is configured to comply with them, shall advertise such support by setting the corresponding PendingTransaction feature bit in the Supported-Features AVP during session establishment as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] for Gx, Gxx and Sd and 3GPP TS 29.215 [22] for S9.\nOn receipt of a Diameter request for an existing Diameter session, the recipient Diameter node shall check if it has an ongoing transaction on that session:\n1.\tIf there are no ongoing transactions on the session, the node shall process the incoming request normally.\n2.\tIf there is an ongoing transaction on the session and optionally, if the recipient node cannot determine that the incoming request can be safely handled without creating a state mismatch:\na.\tThe client shall reject the incoming request with a Diameter experimental result code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].\nb.\tThe server shall either reject the incoming request with a Diameter experimental result code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION or shall wait for one of the following conditions to occur:\ni.\tThe ongoing transaction completes. In this case, the session is updated at the server based on the completion of the ongoing transaction and afterwards, the incoming request (e.g. CCR) is processed normally based on the updated session state.\nii.\tThe waiting period has exceeded its allotted time. In this case, the server shall reject the incoming request with a Diameter experimental result code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION.\nNOTE 1:\tIf there is an ongoing transaction on the session and optionally, if the recipient node can determine that the incoming request can be safely handled without creating a state mismatch, the client and the server could handle the incoming request normally.\n3.\tOn receipt of a DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION result code, a client shall retry the request. On the other hand, if a server had rejected a request from the client with a DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION, the server should not retry the failed request until it responds to  the re-attempted request from the client. This is to avoid having both the client and server concurrently retry their requests. In all other cases, if the session on the client still needs to be updated, the server shall retry the request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe server retries the request either by resending the command (e.g. RAR) or by including the initial requested information in the command (e.g. CCA) answering the re-attempted request from the client. However, including the initial requested information in the command (e.g. CCA) answering the re-attempted request is only possible if the server does not require a response to the command.\n4.\tNodes should limit the number of times they re-attempt the same request due to receipt of a DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION.\n5.\tThe only exception to the rules above is a session termination request (e.g. CCR with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to TERMINATION_REQUEST) or a request for session release (e.g. RAR with Session-Release-Cause AVP). In both cases, the request should be handled as follows:\na.\tWhen receiving a request for a session release that requires new transactions to be initiated, a client shall acknowledge the request immediately (e.g. a RAR command with Session-Release-Cause AVP shall be acknowledged with a RAA command). The client shall wait for the current transaction to complete (either by the server acknowledging the request or rejecting it with DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION) before completing the session termination procedure (e.g. before sending the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to TERMINATION_REQUEST).\nNOTE 3:\tThe client needs to wait for the outcome of the session modification to determine if the session termination procedure will be used to report information that could not be reported as part of the session modification procedure.\nNOTE 4: \tAfter having sent a request for session termination, the server acknowledges any unrelated incoming request immediately (either by the server acknowledging the request or rejecting it with DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION) without a waiting period.\nb.\tWhen receiving a session termination request the server shall handle it immediately.\n\nThe signalling flows in clause 4 are also applicable for IMS. This Annex adds flows that show interactions with SIP/SDP signalling of the IMS.\n",

            "description": "The IMS calls out procedures for NAT traversal for media and signalling within IMS. One of the methods supported by IMS for media traversal of NATs is a UE controlled NAT traversal solution based on the IETF Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol, IETF RFC 8445 [67]. When a UE uses the ICE protocol for media traversal of NATs, additional enhancements to the existing PCC procedures are necessary to allow for proper ICE operation.\nThis annex presents a set of rules that PCC network elements use to build flow descriptors, identify the proper UE IP addresses used by the PCRF for session and bearer binding, and gating control when the ICE procedures are invoked by the UE.\nIn order for the ICE procedures to work a static, preconfigured PCC rule needs to be in place at the PCEF which allows the UE to perform STUN binding requests prior to offering or answering an SDP.\nNOTE 1:\tPredefined PCC rules can be created to allow the UE to communicate with the STUN relay much in the same way the UE is allowed to communicate with the IMS network for session management.\nNOTE 2:\tGiven that a STUN relay is a forwarding server under the direction of the UE, necessary precaution needs to be taken by the operator in how it chooses to craft these rules. It is recommended that such predefined rules only guarantee the minimal amount of bandwidth necessary to accomplish the necessary UE to STUN relay communication. Such an approach helps reduce the resources required to support NAT traversal mechanisms. Finally, such an approach allows the preconfigured rule to be over-ridden by dynamic rules which allow for the necessary bandwidth needed by the session.\nNOTE 3:\tThe dynamic PCC rule will need to differentiate between different media traffic between UE and STUN relay (e.g. voice vs. video), which can be identified by the different ports assigned by the residential NAT. Session bindings need to take into account that the relevant terminal IP address may be contained within the ICE candidates contained in the session description, rather than in the normal media description.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is assumed that the NAT device is located between the UE and the PCEF. NAT traversal outside of IMS in FBI services is considered FFS in the current 3GPP stage 2 specifications.\nNOTE 5:\tWhen a NAT device is located between the UE and the PCEF, it is assumed that the IP CAN session signalling will contain the IP address assigned by the residential NAT, rather than the UE IP address.\nNOTE 6:\tIt is assumed that NAT devices that assign multiple IP addresses for the UE are outside the scope of release 7.\nNOTE 7:\tIn this release, only one IP address per subscription is supported by session binding at the PCRF. Multiple Ues behind a NAT will use the same IP CAN session and IP address.\n",

The signalling flows for these cases are as per Figure 4.3.1.2.1.\nA bearer-event-initiated Request of PCC Rules occurs when a new bearer is established or when an existing bearer is modified. For GPRS, these are PDP Context Modification(s) or secondary PDP context Activation(s). An IP-CAN Session modification triggers a PCC Rule request only if the PCRF has previously requested a PCC Rule request for the given modification event.\nFigure D.3.1.2.1 illustrates the process of an UE initiating an IP-CAN bearer establishment and modification. The figure depicts the various stages of this process, starting with the UE sending a request to the network. The network then responds with a confirmation, and the UE sends a modification request. The figure shows how the IP-CAN bearer is established and modified, highlighting the key components involved in this process.\nFigure D.3.1.2.1: UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Establishment and Modification.\n1.\tThe GW receives IP-CAN Bearer signalling that is a trigger for a PCC Rule request. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a secondary Establish PDP Context Request or an Update PDP Context Request.\n2.\tThe GW informs the PCRF of the modification of the IP-CAN Session due to the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1, using a Diameter CCR with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The GW reuses the existing Gx DCC session corresponding to the IP-CAN Session.\nIf the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1 established a new IP-CAN Bearer, the GW assigns a new bearer identifier to this IP-CAN Bearer. The GW provides information about the new or modified bearer, e.g. requested QoS and TFT filters. If the event that caused the bearer modification applies uniquely to that bearer and PCRF performs the bearer binding, then, the bearer identifier should be provided within the CCR. If no bearer identifier is provided, the event trigger will apply to the IP-CAN session.\n3.\tThe PCRF stores the received information in the Diameter CCR.\n4.\tThe PCRF binds the IP-CAN Session to existing of AF session(s) using the information received from the GW and the Service Information included in the stored PCC rules, which was previously received from the AF(s) , as depicted in figure 4.3.1.1.1.\nThe PCRF also binds the IP-CAN Bearers within the IP-CAN Session to all matching IP flow(s) of existing AF session(s) using the bearer information received from the GW and the Service Information received from the AF(s). If IP flow(s), which have previously been bound to other bearers, have been bound to the modified bearer, PCC Rules in other bearer(s) may need to be removed. For GPRS, an IP flow may need to be removed if a matching higher priority TFT filter in the newly established PDP context takes precedence over a matching lower priority TFT filter in another PDP context. Furthermore, if IP Flow(s), which have previously been bound to the modified bearer are be bound to other bearer(s), PCC Rules may need to be installed in other bearers. For GPRS, an IP flow may be bound to another PDP context if it was previously bound to the modified PDP context due to a removed higher priority TFT filter, and a lower priority TFT filter in the other PDP context matches the IP flow.\n5.\tIf the PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.\n6.\tThe SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information.\nNOTE:\tFor steps 5 and 6: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release. The SPR’s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.\n7.\tFor IP CAN session modification, if the AF requested a notification of the corresponding event at the initial authorisation of the AF session, the PCRF shall sent a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the trigger event that caused the request.\n8.\tIf step 7 happens, the AF replies with a Diameter RAA and may provide updated service information within.\n9.\tThe PCRF selects the new PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The PCRF can also identify existing PCC Rules that need to be modified or removed. The PCC Rules may relate to any of the matching AF sessions identified in step 4 or may exist in the PCRF without matching to any AF session. The PCRF may also make a policy decision by defining an authorized QoS and by deciding whether service flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or disabled. \nFor types of IP-CAN, where the PCRF controls IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCC Rules may affect the IP-CAN Bearer identified in the CCR of step 2 or any other IP-CAN Bearer identified in step 4.\n10.\tThe PCRF stores the modified PCC Rules.\n11.\tThe PCC Rules are provisioned by the PCRF to the GW using Diameter CCA. The PCRF may also provide authorized QoS. The PCRF identifies the affected IP-CAN Bearer for each of the PCC Rules and the authorized QoS. The PCRF may provision PCC Rules and authorized QoS for several IP-CAN Bearers within the same CCA.\n12.\tThe GW installs the received PCC Rules. The GW also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules.\n13.\tThe GW sends a response to the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1.\nFor GPRS, the GGSN accepts the secondary Establish PDP Context Request or the Update PDP Context Request based on the results of the authorisation policy decision enforcement and sends an Establish PDP Context Response or Update PDP Context Response. If the requested QoS parameters do not correspond to the authorized QoS, the GGSN adjusts (downgrades/upgrades) the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the authorized values.\nThe PCRF may have decided in step 4 to modify PCC Rules and/or authorized QoS of other IP CAN bearers than the IP-CAN Bearer identified in the CCR of step 2. For each such other IP-CAN Bearer identified in step 4, the GGSN executes the following steps.\n14.\tThe PCRF may start a timer to wait for PDP context modification requests from the UE.\n15.\tThe PCRF interacts with the GW according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.\nThis clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Bearer is being released while other IP-CAN Bearers and thus the IP-CAN Session are not released.\nFor the termination of IP-CAN Bearers, three cases are covered:\n-\tBearer release that does not cause service data flow(s) within an AF session to be disabled;\n-\tBearer release that causes at least one but not all the service data flow(s) within an AF session to be disabled; and\n-\tBearer release that causes all the service data flows within an AF session to be disabled.\nA Bearer release may not cause a service data flow within this bearer to be disabled if the IP flow can be bound to another bearer. For GPRS, an IP flow can be bound to another PDP context if a lower precedence TFT filter matching the IP flow is installed at the other PDP context.\nFigure D.3.1.2.2 illustrates the termination of an IP-CAN bearer initiated by the user equipment (UE). The figure depicts the various components involved in the termination process, including the IP-CAN bearer, the UE, the home network gateway (HNG), and the access network. The figure also shows the signaling and handover processes that occur between the UE and the network. The figure highlights the importance of efficient termination processes in ensuring seamless connectivity and high-quality service for users.\nFigure D.3.1.2.2: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Bearer Termination\n1.\tThe GW receives a Remove IP-CAN Bearer Request that request the deactivation of an IP-CAN Bearer while other IP-CAN Bearers and thus the IP-CAN Session are not released. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Bearer Request depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Request.\n2.\tThe GW sends a Diameter CCR message with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to the PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Bearer termination.\n3.\tThe PCRF identifies the IP flows bound to the removed bearer and updates the stored bearer information. The PCRF re-evaluates the binding of IP flows, as IP flows may now be bound to other bearers. For GPRS, an IP flow may be bound to another PDP Context if it was previously bound to the removed PDP context due to a higher priority TFT filter, and a lower priority TFT filter in another PDP context matches the IP flow.\nThe following steps 4 and 5 are performed for each of the other bearers identified in step 3:\n4.\tThe PCRF selects the PCC Rule(s) to be installed or modified for the affected bearer. The PCRF may also update the policy decision for this bearer.\n5.\tThe PCRF stores the updated PCC Rules for the affected bearer.\n6.\tThe PCRF acknowledges the bearer termination by sending a Diameter CCA message. \nThe PCRF provides PCC Rules and possibly updated authorized QoS for each of the other bearers identified in step 3. The PCRF identifies the affected IP-CAN Bearer for each of the PCC Rules and the authorized QoS.\n7.\tThe GW removes those PCC Rules, which have not been moved to other IP CAN bearers by the CCA message and are installed in the IP-CAN bearer, for which a termination has been requested in step 1.\n8.\tThe GW sends a Remove IP-CAN Bearer Response. For GPRS, the GGSN sends the Delete PDP Context Response message.\n9.\tIt the PCRF has provided PCC Rules and possibly updated authorized QoS for other bearers in step 6, the GW installs or modifies the identified PCC Rules. The GW also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules.\nThe following steps 10 to 13 or 10a to 13a apply for the case where at least one IP Flow within an AF session is being disabled, i.e. if the IP Flow is not bound to any other bearer that is still established. The steps shall be performed separately for each ongoing AF session that is affected by the bearer release as explained below.\nIf all IP flow(s) within the AF session are disabled by the bearer release:\n10.\tThe PCRF indicates the session abort to the AF by sending a Diameter ASR message to the AF.\n11.\tThe AF responds by sending a Diameter ASA message to the PCRF.\n12.\tThe AF sends a Diameter STR message to the PCRF to indicate that the session has been terminated.\n13.\tThe PCRF responds by sending a Diameter STA message to the AF.\nIf at least one but not all of the IP flow(s) within the AF session are disabled by the bearer release, and the AF has requested notification of bearer removal:\n10a.\tThe PCRF indicates the release of the bearer by sending a Diameter RAR to the AF.\n11a.\tThe AF responds by sending a Diameter RAA to the PCRF.\n12a.\tThe AF may send an  to the PCRF to update the session information.\n13a.\tIf step 12a occurs, the PCRF responds by sending a AAA to the AF.\n",
