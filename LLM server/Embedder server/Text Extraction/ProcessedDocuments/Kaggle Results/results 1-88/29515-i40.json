The model showcases multiple layers, including the physical layer, transport layer, and application layer, each with distinct functionalities. The physical layer is responsible for transmitting data through physical mediums, while the transport layer ensures the secure and efficient transfer of data packets. The application layer, on the other hand, is responsible for providing various telecommunication services to end-users. The model also highlights the role of the cloud in managing and orchestrating these layers, enabling efficient resource allocation and management.\nFigure 4-1: Reference model – GMLC\nThe functionalities supported by the GMLC are listed in clause 4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [4].\n",

See Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2 - 1 illustrates the ProvideLocation Request/Response for a target UE, showcasing the process of exchanging location information between the network and the user equipment. The figure depicts the interaction between the network server and the UE, highlighting the exchange of location data through the use of a Location Request message and a corresponding Location Response. The diagram emphasizes the importance of accurate location data for various services, such as mobile broadband, voice, and video, as well as the role of the network server in managing and maintaining the UE's location information.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1: ProvideLocation Request/Response for a target UE\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the URI associated with the \"provide-location\" custom operation.

See Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.3-1 illustrates the process of a ProvideLocation Request/Response for a target group in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the interaction between the network entities, including the network element (NE), network element location (NEL), and the target group. The process begins with the network element sending a ProvideLocation Request to the network element location, which then forwards the request to the target group. The target group responds with a ProvideLocation Response, which includes the location information of the network element. This figure is essential for understanding the location management process in telecommunication networks and ensuring efficient communication between network entities.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.3-1: ProvideLocation Request/Response for a target group\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the URI associated with the \"provide-location\" custom operation. The input parameters the target group identification (the External Group ID or the Internal Group ID), LCS client type, eventNotificationUri shall be included in the HTTP POST request body, LDR type, LDR reference shall be also included in the request if requesting the deferred LCS service, the required QoS, supported GAD shapes, external Service Identity, service coverage should be included in the request. If the request is related to location determination at the scheduled time, the scheduled location time shall be included in the HTTP POST request body.\nIf the request is to use a location reporting via user plane, an indication of the request of location reporting via user plane shall be included in the HTTP POST contents.

See Figure 5.2.2.3.1-1.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.1-1: LocationUpdate Request/Response illustrates the process of a device requesting and receiving location updates from a network server. The figure depicts the exchange of messages between the device and the server, highlighting the role of the Location Update Request and Response messages in determining the device's current position. Key components include the device, network server, and Location Update Request and Response messages, which are essential for accurate location tracking and services.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.1-1: LocationUpdate Request/Response\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the URI associated with the \"location-update\" custom operation. The request body shall contain a LocUpdateData object..\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the GMLC.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.4.2-2 may be returned. For a 4xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.4.2-2.\nThe service operation is used during the procedure:\n-\tCancellation of Reporting of Location Events by an AF, an NF or External LCS Client or GMLC (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], clause 6.3.3)\nThe CancelLocation enables the consumer NF to use the service operation to cancel a deferred 5GC-MT-LR procedure for periodic or triggered location for a single UE or for a group. See Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1: CancelLocation Request/Response depicts a communication process where a client requests the cancellation of a previously registered location. The figure illustrates the exchange of messages between the client and the network service provider, highlighting the necessary steps and protocols involved in the cancellation process. Key elements include the client's device, the network service provider's system, and the underlying communication protocols. The diagram emphasizes the importance of accurate and timely communication to ensure successful location cancellation.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1: CancelLocation Request/Response\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the URI associated with the \"cancel-location\" custom operation. The input parameters for the request ((H-)GMLC contact address, LDR reference number, LMF identification, serving AMF address) should be included in the HTTP POST request body.\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.3.2-2 may be returned. For a 4xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.2-2.\nThe following procedures are supported using the \"EventNotify\" service operation:\n-\tEventNotify for a single UE\n-\tEventNotify for the UEs in a target group\nThe service operation is used during the procedure:\n-\tDeferred 5GC-MT-LR Procedure for Periodic, Triggered and UE Available Location Events (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], clause 6.3)\n-\tUnified Location Service Exposure Procedure without routing by a UDM (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], clause 6.5.1)\nThe EventNotify for a single UE enables the consumer NF (e.g. (H)GMLC, NEF, NWDAF) to get notified about the geodetic and optionally local and/or civic location, the completion or activation of deferred location, mobility to a different AMF/MME of a UE with deferred location for a target UE, the active state of the location reporting over user plane, or the statistics on the location reporting over user plane, when some certain events are detected. See Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.5. 2 - 1: EventNotify Notification for a single UE depicts the process of a user equipment (UE) being notified of an event through the EventNotify Notification protocol. The figure illustrates the communication flow between the network elements involved, including the UE, the home network, the network element, and the EventNotify Notification server. The UE sends a request to the home network, which then forwards it to the network element. The network element processes the request and sends a response back to the home network. The home network then relays the response to the UE, completing the notification process. This protocol is crucial for ensuring timely and accurate communication between the network and the UE, enabling efficient management and troubleshooting of network events.\nFigure 5.2.2.5.2-1: EventNotify Notification for a single UE\n1.\tThe GMLC shall send an HTTP POST to the locationNotificationUri to send a notification. The input parameters for the notification (Notification Correlation ID, UE (SUPI and if available GPSI), Type of location related event (e.g. deferred location for the UE available event, activation of location for periodic or triggered location, mobility of a target UE to a new AMF or MME for a deferred location, Geodetic Location, Local Location, Civic Location, Position Methods Used, serving LMF identification etc.) should be included in the HTTP POST request body.\nIf the GMLC receives the statistics on the location reporting over user plane (e.g., the number of location reports over user plane) from the AMF, the statistics on the location reporting over user plane shall be included in the HTTP POST contents.\nThe locationNotificationUri shall be set to:\nIf the notification is sent from (V)GMLC to (H)GMLC when roaming with (V)GMLC used,\n-\tthe hgmlcCallBackURI received from the AMF/LMF;\nIf the notification is sent from (H)GMLC to NEF, or other NF (e.g. NWDAF),\n-\tthe callback URI (i.e., eventNotificationUri) of NEF or other NF (e.g. NWDAF) provided by NEF or other NF (e.g. NWDAF) during requesting the ProvideLocation service operation for the periodic or triggered deferred location for a target UE or ;\n-\tthe callback URI of NEF locally provisioned in the (H)GMLC.\n2a.\tIf the notification is received, the NF Service Consumer shall reply with the status code 204 indicating the notification is received, in the response message.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.4.2.3.1-2 may be returned. For a 4xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.4.2.3.1-2.\nThe service operation is used during the procedure:\n-\tBulk Operation of LCS Service Request Targeting to Multiple UEs (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], clause 6.8)\nThe EventNotify for the UEs in a target group enables the consumer NF (e.g. NEF, NWDAF) to get notified about the geodetic and optionally local and/or civic locations (immediate locations or deferred locations) for the UEs in target group, the failures of requesting location for the UEs in the target group, completion or activation of deferred location for the UEs in the target group. See Figure 5.2.2.5.3-1.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.5.3-1 illustrates the EventNotify notification process for User Equipment (UEs) in a target group within a telecommunication network. The figure showcases the interaction between the base station (gNB), the network elements, and the UEs. It highlights the role of the gNB in sending notifications to the UEs, which are represented by the small circles. The UEs then respond to these notifications, as indicated by the arrows pointing towards them. This process is crucial for managing network resources and ensuring efficient communication between the gNB and the UEs.\nFigure 5.2.2.5.3-1: EventNotify Notification for the UEs in a target group\n1.\tThe GMLC/(H)GMLC shall send an HTTP POST to the locationNotificationUri to send a notification. The Request body shall contain event report(s) for one or more UEs in the group. The event report for each UE shall include the LDR Reference, UE identifier (SUPI or GPSI), location data (location data for immediate location service request or location data for deferred location service request) or failure cause of positioning. The locationNotificationUri shall be set to:\n-\tthe callback URI of NEF, or other NF (e.g. NWDAF) provided by NEF during requesting the ProvideLocation service operation for a target group of UEs or;\n-\tthe callback URI of NEF locally provisioned in the GMLC/(H)GMLC.\n2a.\tIf the notification is received, the NF Service Consumer shall reply with the status code 204 indicating the notification is received, in the response message.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.4.2.3.1-2 may be returned. For a 4xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.4.2.3.1-2.\nThe service operation is used during the procedure:\n-\t5GC-MO-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], clause 6.2)\nThe LocationUpdateNotify enables the NF consumer (e.g. NEF) to get notified about the UE location information update. See Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.6.1-1: LocationUpdateNotify Notification\n\nThis telecommunication figure illustrates the process of LocationUpdateNotify notification in a network. The figure shows the sequence of events and the communication between different entities involved in the process. The key components include the Location Update Server (LUS), the Network Server (NS), and the User Equipment (UE). The figure demonstrates how the LUS sends a LocationUpdateNotify message to the NS, which then forwards it to the UE. The diagram highlights the importance of accurate location information in real-time communication and the role of the LUS and NS in ensuring this.\nFigure 5.2.2.6.1-1: LocationUpdateNotify Notification\n1.\tThe GMLC shall send an HTTP POST request to the notifURI of the NF consumer (e.g. NEF). The response body shall contain a LocUpdateNotification object.\nThe notifURI (e.g. NEF address for callback) is locally configured on GMLC or discovered via NRF.\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF consumer.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.4.3.3.1-2 may be returned. For a 4xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.4.3.3.1-2.\nThis service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. NEF) to trigger a subscription to notifications on UE location information update for the 5GC-MO-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], clause 6.2). See Figure 5.2.2.7.1-1.\nNOTE:\tThis service operation is not used by the current stage 2 specifications in 3GPP TS 23.273 [4], i.e. the subscription to notifications on UE location information update is implicit.\n\nFigure 5.2.2.7.1-1: Subscription to UE location information update illustrates the process of a network operator subscribing to updates on the location of a user equipment (UE) in a mobile network. This figure shows the various entities involved, such as the network operator, the home location register (HLR), and the location register (LR). The process involves the network operator requesting location updates from the UE, which then sends the information to the HLR. The HLR then forwards the updates to the LR, which in turn provides the location information to the network operator. This process is crucial for providing accurate location-based services to mobile users.\nFigure 5.2.2.7.1-1: Subscription to UE location information update\n1.\tThe NF service consumer (e.g. NEF) sends a POST request to the parent resource, i.e. collection of subscriptions (.../loc-update-subs), to create a subscription to UE location information update for the 5GC-MO-LR Procedure, as provided in LocUpdateSubs information conveyed in the message body.\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the GMLC.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.5.2-2 may be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.4.2-2.\n",
