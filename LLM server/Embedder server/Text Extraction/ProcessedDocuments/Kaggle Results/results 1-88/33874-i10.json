                            "text_content": "According to TS 23.501 [1], SST refers to the expected Network Slice behaviour in terms of features and services. An SST could be represented with a standardised SST value or without a standardised SST value. The currently standardized SST values can indicate the slice types of eMBB, URLCC, MIoT and V2X, from which sensitive information of a specific slice can hardly be derived. Hence there is no privacy issue if SST is included in the broadcast SIB.\nAn S-NSSAI is comprised of a SST and an optional Slice Differentiator (SD), which is to differentiate amongst multiple network slices of the same Slice/Service type. An S-NSSAI may contain privacy-sensitive information, e.g. when dedicated to a group of users may expose the group identity. An S-NSSAI may also contain sensitive information, e.g. network topology that the operator may not want to share with others.\nA cell broadcasting sensitive S-NSSAI may become a target of attackers interested in the S-NSSAI information. It is likely for an attacker to further link the S-NSSAI with its UEs/users together with other knowledge/tools, e.g. a frequency band supports only the sensitive S-NSSAI or a few allowing attackers to narrow down the scope. Broadcasting sensitive S-NSSAI should be avoided.\nSlice group information may or may not leak sensitive information depending on how the slice group is defined. For example, if a slice group is defined based on the standardized slice type or SST values, there may be no privacy issue as discussed above. S-NSSAIs with only SST values are valid slice identifiers. On the other hand, there may be cases that a not well designed slice group contains only one SST (used in an S-NSSAI as a valid slice identifier), one S-NSSAI or a few S-NSSAI having the same SD values thus exposing network topologies or being dedicated to special groups of users. In such a case, broadcasting group info may lead to leak of sensitive information.\nSlice grouping information (slice group identity and group mapping info) is assumed to be delivered to UE through NAS signaling which is protected. The group identifier is broadcasted rather than Slice Group itself. The group identifier is to be defined to identify the slice group.\nTherefore, the slice group information for which the slice group identifier is to be broadcasted needs to be defined taking into consideration the leakage of sensitive information.\n",

However, the NSAC procedure needs to be studied further to address potential security risks, for examples:\n-\tIn the current NSAC procedure, the number of registered UE in an S-NSSAI is updated independently from other S-NSSAIs during the registration procedure. In other words, the granularity level at registration is S-NSSAI. However, it is not the case in the de-registration procedure. The numbers are only updated when the UE exits from all network slices, i.e. de-registered. Since a UE may access multiple slices, e.g. eight, the UE would still be counted against quota usage of ALL S-NSSAIs even the UE is not using some or most of slices (\"idly occupied\" by the UE). This may lead to the quota reached fast which does not reflect the real usage of a slice. Other legitimate UEs will suffer from DoS – \"dog in the mager\". It is notable that an attacker can use legitimate UEs to launch such attacks.\n-\tThe Early Admission Control (EAC) mode has been introduced where the admission control can be inactive if the number of UE bellows a pre-configured threshold. This may pose a security risk that exceeds the slice quota when a sudden increase in the slice registration requests, maliciously or accidentally.\n",

For the Oauth 2.0 based authorization, the NRF takes the role of Authentication Server and the NEF takes the role of Resource Server.\nIf an AF a third party NF, authentication and authorization is based on the mechanisms defined in Clause 12 in TS33.501 [7], where mutual authentication is performed between the AF and the NEF. For the Oauth 2.0 based authorization, the NEF takes both roles of Authentication Server and the Resource Server.\nIn order to avoid sensitive information leakage involving S-NSSAI, S-NSSAI is not sent to or made available to a third party AF. Instead, NEF keeps a mapping between S-NSSAI and ENSI (External Network Slice Information) and ENSI (instead of S-NSSAI) is available at the third party AF. The notification procedure (adapted from the clause 4.15.3.2.10 of TS 23.502 [3]) with ENSI is described as below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1.2.1-1: Number of UEs and PDU Sessions per network slice notification procedure\n0.\tAuthentication of AF: AF is authenticated by NRF or authenticated by NEF based on description above.

It is noted that the AF token includes claim for the authorized S-NSSAI or ENSI (if AF is a third party NF).\n1.\tTo subscribe or unsubscribe for the number of UEs or the number of PDU Sessions per network slice notification with the NSACF, the AF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe/Unsubscribe Request (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information) message to the NEF. The Event ID parameter defines the subscribed event ID, i.e. Number of Registered UEs or Number of Established PDU Sessions. The Event Filter parameter defines the S-NSSAI for which reporting is required. If the AF is a 3GPP NF, The Event Filter parameter is S-NSSAI whereas the Event Filter parameter is ENSI if the AF is a third party NF. The Event Reporting information parameter defines the mode of reporting, i.e. threshold based reporting with included a threshold value or periodic reporting with included periodicity time interval.\n2.\tThe NEF checks whether the AF is authorised for the requested subscription based on the AF token. It needs to check whether the token claims matches the AF's identity and the Event Filter parameter. If authorised, the NEF may query the NRF to find the NSACF responsible for the requested S-NSSAI (NEF needs to map to S-NSSAI based on ENSI for a third party AF). The NEF forwards the request to the NSACF with Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe/Unsubscribe Request (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information). The Event Filter parameter is the mapped S-NSSAI for the third party AF.\n3.\tThe NSACF confirms with Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe/Usubscribe Response message to the NEF.\n4.\tThe NEF forwards the response from NSACF via the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe/Unsibscribe Response message to the AF. The Event Filter parameter is changed to the mapped ENSI for the third party AF.\n5.\tWhen the reporting condition for a subscribed event is fulfilled, the NSACF triggers a notification towards the AF.\n6.\tThe NSACF sends the Nnsacf_SliceEvent Exposure_Notify (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information) message to the NEF. If the subscription is for event based notification (e.g. based on the monitored event reaching a threshold value), the Event Reporting information parameter contains confirmation for the event fulfilment. If the subscription is for periodic notification, the Event Reporting information parameter provides information for the current number of UEs registered with a network slice (e.g. represented in percentage of the maximum number of the UEs registered with the network slice) or information for the current number of PDU Sessions on a network slice (e.g. represented in percentage of the maximum number of the UEs established on the network slice) or both. It is\n7.\tThe NEF forwards the message to the AF in the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information) message. The Event Filter parameter is changed to the mapped ENSI for the third party AF.\n\n\nFigure 5.1.2.2-1: Number of UEs and PDU Sessions per network slice status retrieval by AF procedure\n\n1.\tTo retrieve information about the number of the UEs registered with a network slice or the number of the PDU Sessions established on a network slice or both, the AF sends Nnef_SliceStatus_Retrieval Request (Event ID, Event Filter) message to the NEF.\nThe Event ID parameter defines the information to be reported, i.e. the number of registered UEs with a network slice or the number of the PDU sessions with a network slice or both. The Event Filter parameter defines the S-NSSAI for which reporting is required. If the AF is within the 3GPP operator domain, the Event Filter parameter is S-NSSAI whereas the Event Filter parameter is ENSI for the AF outside the 3GPP operator domain.\nNOTE: If AF is from the 3rd party that belongs to a different security domain than the operator, ENSI shall be used to meet the requirement for AF in clause 5.9.2.3, TS 33.501[7].\n2.\tThe NEF checks whether the AF is authorised based on the AF token. It needs to check whether the token claims matches the AF's identity and the Event Filter parameter. If authorised, the NEF may query the NRF to find the NSACF responsible for the requested S-NSSAI. The authorization check by NEF needs to make sure the AF is allowed to access the S-NSSAI.\nThe NEF shall map to S-NSSAIs from ENSI for the AF outside the 3GPP operator domain. The authorization check by NEF needs to make sure the AF is allowed to access the S-NSSAI.\n3.\tThe NEF forwards the request to the NSACF with Nnsacf_SliceStatus_Retrieval Request (Event ID, Event Filter).\n4.\tThe NSACF returns the Nnsacf_SliceStatus_Retrieval Response (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information) message to the NEF, as in TS23.502 [3].\n5.\tThe NEF forwards the message to the AF in the Nnef_SliceStatus_Retrieval Response (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information) message. The Event Filter parameter is changed to the mapped ENSI for the AF outside the 3GPP operator domain.\n",
