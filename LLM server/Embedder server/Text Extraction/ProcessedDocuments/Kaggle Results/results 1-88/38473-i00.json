The F1 interface provides means for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of a gNB within an NG-RAN, or for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of an en-gNB within an E-UTRAN. The F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) supports the functions of F1 interface by signalling procedures defined in the present document. F1AP is developed in accordance to the general principles stated in TS 38.401 [4] and TS 38.470 [2].\n",

                    "text_content": "elementary procedure: F1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several F1AP EPs together is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 38.470 [2]).\nAn EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:\n-\tClass 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).\n-\tClass 2: Elementary Procedures without response.\nFor Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:\nSuccessful:\n-\tA signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.\nUnsuccessful:\n-\tA signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.\n-\tOn time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).\nSuccessful and Unsuccessful:\n-\tOne signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests.

This procedure is also used to command the gNB-DU to stop data transmission for the UE for mobility (see TS 38.401 [4]). The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.\nFigure 8.3.4.2-1 illustrates the UE Context Modification procedure, detailing the successful operation of modifying the user equipment context in a telecommunication network. The figure showcases the various stages, including the initial state, context modification, and final state, with key components such as the UE, network elements, and signaling protocols. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of accurate context modification for maintaining seamless network connectivity and performance.\nFigure 8.3.4.2-1: UE Context Modification procedure.

F1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an F1AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:\n-\tIEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.\n-\tObject set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value \"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.\nNOTE:\tIn the above \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.\nIf an F1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.\n",
