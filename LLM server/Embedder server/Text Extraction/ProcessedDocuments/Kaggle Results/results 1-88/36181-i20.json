The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 3.646 us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path in the power delay profile.\nThe performance requirements for TDD are optional and only valid for base stations supporting TDD.\nThe parameters of NPRACH test preambles are listed in table 8.5.3.1-1.\nTable 8.5.3.1-1 NPRACH Test Parameters\n\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 36.108 [2] clause 8.5.3.1.1 and 8.5.3.2.1.\nThe test shall verify the receiver’s ability to detect NPRACH preamble under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment: Normal, see annex B.\nRF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.\n1)\tConnect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN antenna connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5.\n1)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth.\nTable 8.5.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input\n\n2)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A.\n3)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex F.\n4)\tAdjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table 8.5.3.5-1.\n5)\tAdjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.5.3.5-1 is achieved at the SAN input during the NPRACH preambles.\n6) \tThe test signal generator sends a preamble with repetitions and the receiver tries to detect the preamble.

Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.\nPfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only noise.\nThe probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error cases – detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing estimation.

                            "text_content": "The performance requirement of NPUSCH format 2 for ACK missed detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.\nThe probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.\nThe probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of detection of the ACK when the ACK was sent per NPUSCH format 2 transmission when the signal is present.\nThe tests for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing are applicable to the base stations supporting 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements. The tests for 15 kHz subcarrier spacing are applicable to the base stations supporting 15 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements.\nFor SAN type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 36.102 [2] clause 11.5.2.1 and 11.5.2.2.\nThe test shall verify the receiver’s ability to detect ACK under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment: Normal, see clause D.2.\nRF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.7.\nDirection to be tested:\tOTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).\n1)\tPlace the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in annex D.7.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN with the test system.\n3)\tSet the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.\n4)\tConnect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).\n5)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to TS 38.211 [8], and according to additional test parameters listed in table 11.5.1.4.2-1.\nTable 11.5.1.4.2-1: Test parameters for testing NPUSCH format 2\n\n6)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.\n7)\tAdjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.5.1.5.1, and that the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.\nThe power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level quoted in table 11.5.1.4.2-2.\nTable 11.5.2.4.2-2: AWGN power level at the SAN input\n\n8)\tThe signal generator sends a test pattern with the pattern outlined in figure 11.5.2.4.2-1. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACKs falsely detected in the idle periods and the number of missed ACKs. Each falsely detected ACK transmission in the idle periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK detection, and each missed ACK transmission per NPUSCH format 2 transmission is accounted as one error for the statistics of missed ACK detection. The frames are sent with certain frequency and time offsets per segment as described below in Figure 11.5.2.4.2-3 and table 11.5.2.4.2-4. The time offset is reset back to zero between segments.\nFigure 11.5.2.4.2-1 presents a test signal pattern for N-PUS-CH format 2 demodulation tests, illustrating the complex arrangement of signals used in the communication process. The figure showcases multiple signal paths, each represented by a distinct line, indicating the various routes through which data is transmitted and received. The meticulous organization of these paths demonstrates the precision required in signal processing to ensure effective communication. The figure highlights the importance of accurate signal demodulation, as the correct interpretation of these signals is critical for the successful transmission and reception of data.\nFigure 11.5.2.4.2-1: Test signal pattern for NPUSCH format 2 demodulation tests\nTable 11.5.2.4.2-3: Frequency Offsets for testing NPUSCH format 2\n\nTable 11.5.2.4.2-4: Timing Offsets for testing NPUSCH format 2\n\nThe fraction of falsely detected ACKs shall be less than 1% and the fraction of correctly detected ACKs shall be larger than 99% for the SNR listed in table 11.5.2.5-1 and table 11.5.2.5-2.\nTable 11.5.2.5-1 Required SNR for NPUSCH format 2 test, 200 kHz channel bandwidth, 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing, 1Tx\n\nTable 11.5.2.5-2 Required SNR for NPUSCH format 2 test, 200 kHz channel bandwidth, 15 kHz subcarrier spacing, 1Tx\n\nNOTE:\tIf the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.

A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 3.646 us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path in the power delay profile.\nThe performance requirements for TDD are optional and only valid for base stations supporting TDD.\nThe parameters of NPRACH test preambles are listed in table 11.5.3.1-1.\nTable 11.5.3.1-1 NPRACH Test Parameters\n\nFor SAN type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 36.102 [2] clause 11.5.3.1.1 and 11.5.3.2.1.\nThe test shall verify the receiver’s ability to detect NPRACH preamble under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment:\tNormal, see clause D.2.\nRF channels to be tested:\tM; see clause 4.7.\nDirection to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).\n1)\tPlace the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in annex D.7.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN with the test system.\n3)\tSet the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.\n4)\tConnect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7.

Vibration conditions for SAN are defined in TS 38.181 [6], annex B.4.\nThe measurement accuracy of the test environments are defined in TS 38.181 [6], annex B.5.\n\nThe test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification TS 36.108 [2] using the test tolerances (TT) defined here. When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.\nThe TTOTA values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TTOTA values may sometimes be set to zero.\nThe TTOTA values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).\nNote that a formula for applying TTOTA values is provided for all OTA tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined TTOTA value in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.\n\n",

The figure depicts a typical OTA (over-the-air) test environment, where a transmitter and receiver are positioned to measure the OOB emissions from a device under test (DUT). The setup includes various components such as the DUT, an antenna, a power meter, and a spectrum analyzer. The transmitter sends signals to the DUT, which then emits OOB radiation. The receiver captures these emissions, and the power meter and spectrum analyzer measure the levels of OOB radiation to ensure that they meet regulatory requirements.
