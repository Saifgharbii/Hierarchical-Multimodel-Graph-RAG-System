Required manufacturer declarations may be included here.\nX.2\tMinimum requirement\nThis clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference (or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement. For each requirement, there are separate references for MSR and single RAT, where applicable in the core requirement. If the requirement does not apply to a particular RAT, this is explicitly stated here (rather than through a reference).\nX.3\tTest purpose\nThis clause defines the purpose of the test.\nX.4\tMethod of test\nX.4.1\tGeneral\nIn some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one test procedure is applicable, that is stated here. Guidance to which TAB connectors are subject to the test is also given here.\nX.4.2y\tFirst test method\nX.4.2y.1\tInitial conditions\nThis clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-up. The test system is assumed to be correctly calibrated as part of the initial conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.\nX.4.2y.2\tProcedure\nThis clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port), domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms (e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g. average result from several measurement positions).\nX.4.3y\tAlternative test method (if any)\nIf there are alternative test methods, each is described with its initial conditions and procedures.\nX.5\tTest requirement\nThis clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test, see clause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. Test requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be mentioned.\nThe test requirements may be different depending on the test method applied. A test requirement for each test method applicable to the respective MSR/Single RAT requirement is given in separate clauses where applicable.\n",

In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nFor AAS BS in single RAT E-UTRA operation and MSR operation, the out-of-band emissions requirement for the AAS BS transmitter is specified in terms of an operating band unwanted emissions requirement that defines limits for emissions in each supported downlink operating band plus the frequency ranges ΔfOBUE above and ΔfOBUE below each band, where ΔfOBUE is the maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emission mask from the operating band edge. Emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement. For UTRA FDD single RAT AAS BS, the out of band emission requirement for AAS BS transmitter is specified in terms of spectrum emission mask requirement.\nThe values of ΔfOBUE are defined for hybrid AAS BS for E-UTRA and UTRA operating bands in Table 6.6.1-1.\nTable 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink operating band\n\nThe unwanted emission level limit of a TAB connector TX min cell group is in general defined by the unwanted emission basic limit which is the same as the corresponding applicable Non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement specified in [2], [3], [4] or [5],and its scaling by NTXU,countedpercell. The unwanted emission requirements are applied per the TAB connector TX min cell groups for all the configurations supported by the AAS BS. The basic limits and corresponding scaling are defined in each relevant clause.\nThere are in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR requirement.\n",

When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nThe measurement device characteristics shall be:\n-\tMeasurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515 MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.\n-\tMeasurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4.0 MHz and (f_offsetmax - 500 kHz).shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth.\n-\tDetection mode: True RMS.\nThe emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.2-1.\nb)\tFor single carrier operation set the TAB connector to transmit at manufacturers declared rated carrier output power per TAB connector (PRated,c,TABC)\nFor a TAB connector declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation set the TAB connector to transmit on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.12.\n6.6.4.4.2.1\tUTRA FDD\n1)\tStep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified measurement bandwidth.

The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the AAS BS, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.4.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below. The basic limit any spurious emission are in table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 for TAB connector(s) where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For multi-band TAB connector(s), the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-1: Spurious emissions basic limits for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 25/n25, Band 27, Band 28/n28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in table 4.4-1 or table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III, E-UTRA Band 3 or NR Band n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements are 1805 – 1850 MHz and 1710 – 1755 MHz respectively.\nNOTE 4:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 5:\tFor Band 28/n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 6:\tFor Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band.\nThe basic limit for any spurious emission is:\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-2: Spurious emissions basic limits for co-existence with PHS\n\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-3: Void\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to TAB connectors operating in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS transmitter operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS transmitter operating band. The basic limit for any spurious emission is:\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-4: Spurious emissions basic limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to TAB connectors operating in Band 26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe basic limit for any spurious emission is:\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-5: BS Spurious emissions basic limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-6: Void\n\nIn addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.6.5.2.1 to 6.6.6.5.2.5 and above in the present clause, the TAB connector may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [24], when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.\nThe following requirement may apply to a TAB connector operating in Band 30 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe basic limit for any spurious emission is:\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-7: Additional Spurious emissions basic limits for Band 30\n\nThe following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 48 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-8: Additional E-UTRA BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 48\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to BS operating in Band 54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-9 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,B54,a, PEM,B54,b, PEM,B54,c, PEM,B54,d, PEM,B54,e and PEM,B54,f declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.5-9: Declared Band 54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.\n\n6.6.6.5.2.6\tCo-location with other Base Stations\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receiver units when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nThe basic limit for any spurious emission are in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 for a MSR, E-UTRA or UTRA FDD TAB connector or tables 6.6.6.5.2.6-2 and 6.6.6.5.2.6-3 for UTRA TDD, where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For a multi-band TAB connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Notes column of table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.6-1: Spurious emissions basic limits for MSR, E-UTRA or UTRA (FDD) or NR BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the TAB connector transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (clause 4.5). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [21].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding TAB connector transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.5 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor UTRA MR BS the measurement bandwidth is the same as for E-UTRA (100 kHz).\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.6-2: Spurious emissions basic limits\nfor UTRA TDD Wide Area BS co-located with another BS\n\nFor UTRA TDD in geographic areas where 1,28 Mcps TDD is deployed, the RRC filtered mean power of any spurious emission in case of co-location shall not exceed the maximum level given in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-3.\nFor multi-band TAB connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Notes of table 6.6.6.5.2.6-3 for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.6.5.2.6-3: Spurious emissions basic limits for co-location\nwith unsynchronised 1,28 Mcps UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD\n\n",
