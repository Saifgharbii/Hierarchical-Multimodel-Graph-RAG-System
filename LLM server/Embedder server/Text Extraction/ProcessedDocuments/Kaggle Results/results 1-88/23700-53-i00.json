            "description": "The purpose of this Technical Report is to enhance the ATSSS feature by investigating solutions that can support the following capabilities:\n1)\tSupport new steering functionalities that can steer/switch/split non-TCP traffic flows (e.g. UDP traffic flows and IP traffic flows). Two types of such steering functionalities are studied: (i) a steering functionality based on the QUIC protocol and its multipath extensions, and (ii) a steering functionality based on the DCCP protocol and its multipath extensions.\n2)\tSupport redundant traffic steering for both GBR and non-GBR traffic flows. With redundant traffic steering, a traffic flow (GBR or non-GBR) can be replicated on multiple access paths and, therefore, can improve transmission reliability and reduce packet latency.\n3)\tSupport traffic switching between one non-3GPP access path, from a UE to a N3IWF in a PLMN, and another non-3GPP access path, from the UE to a TNGF in the same PLMN.\n4)\tSupport the establishment of a MA PDU Session with one 3GPP access path via 5GC and one non-3GPP access path via ePDG/EPC. This is to complement the existing ATSSS capability that supports the establishment of a MA PDU Session with one non-3GPP access path via 5GC and one 3GPP access path via EPC.\nFor each of the above capabilities, the conclusions of the study identify whether a solution is required for the normative phase and, if required, which solution to consider in the normative phase.\n",

Presently, traffic splitting of non-TCP traffic flows is not fully supported with the ATSSS-LL because this steering functionality may introduce out of order delivery, which can severely impact the transport performance.\nEditor's note:\tWhether support of steering, switching and splitting of Ethernet traffic flows is required is FFS.\nMore specifically, this key issue aims to:\n1)\tContinue the Rel-17 study of the QUIC-based steering functionality and its multipath extensions by considering some of the aspects that were left open (see clause 8.2 of TR 23.700-93 [5]). The resolution of these aspects may lead to new solutions, in addition to those specified in TR 23.700-93 [5], and any of them should support per-packet splitting. For example, it will be considered whether the QUIC-based steering functionality will apply other IETF protocols, such as the MASQUE protocol, and whether a single multipath QUIC connection can support one or multiple steering modes.\nThe study of the QUIC-based steering functionality is based on the QUIC protocol [6], its multipath extensions (e.g. draft-ietf-quic-multipath [10]) and, possibly, on other relevant documents specified by IETF, such as RFC 9001 [7], RFC 9002 [8], draft-ietf-quic-datagram [9].\nAny security aspects associated with the QUIC protocol mandating the usage of TLS 1.3 for key exchange, authentication, and negotiation of security and performance parameters (see RFC 9001 [7]), will be studied in conjunction with SA WG3.\n2)\tStudy a new steering functionality based on the DCCP protocol RFC 4340 [11] and its multipath extensions draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp [12] that provide support for per-packet splitting.\nThe conclusions of the study will identify which one of the above two steering functionalities may be specified in the normative phase.\nThis key issue shall also consider the following additional aspects:\n-\tHow the new steering functionalities can co-exist with MPTCP and ATSSS-LL;\n-\tWhat is the impact on the user plane performance (e.g. additional overhead) for each one of the new steering functionalities;\n-\tWhether it is needed and how to negotiate the support of the new steering functionalities between the UE and the network;\n-\tWhether it is needed and how to enhance PCC rules, ATSSS rules and N4 rules to support the new steering functionalities;\n-\tUE impacts in order to support each one of the new steering functionalities;\n-\tHow to treat out-of-order delivery caused by per packet-splitting.\n",

It allows the traffic transmitted via 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in a redundant way to achieve the lowest latency and to lower the loss rate.\nIt is proposed to further enhance the redundancy steering mode as described in TR 23.793 [26], with which the traffic will always be transmitted over both accesses once applied, to make it possible that the traffic transmission goes via both accesses, if necessary, or via only one access to save the transport resource. In details, when the traffic is allowed on both accesses and the packet loss rate (PLR) is provided with the redundancy steering mode:\n-\tThe UE and the UPF can select any one of the accesses (based on implementation) to transport the traffic, if both accesses can satisfy the PLR requirement.\n-\tIf only one access can satisfy the PLR value, this access is applied to transport the traffic.\n-\tOtherwise, redundant transmission over both accesses is triggered, if the PLR is satisfied again over one access during the redundant transmission, the redundant transmission should be deactivated. This access is applied to transport the traffic.\nFor example, if the loss rate on one access does not exceed the PLR threshold, then only this one access is applied, otherwise, redundant transmission is triggered.\nWhen the traffic is allowed on both accesses and the redundancy steering mode is provided without a PLR threshold value, both accesses are always applied for the redundant transmission.\nSee below Figure 6.1.2-1 for details, where UL packet flow is taken as an example. The DL packet flow shares the same mechanism.\nThis redundancy steering mode can be applied by the MPTCP functionality with new requirements to be derived from this study/solution.\nNOTE 1:\tThe redundant transmission algorithm required by the redundancy steering mode with packet loss rate relies on the implementation of the MPTCP by the OS today.\nNOTE 2:\tThe redundancy steering mode with packet loss rate does not apply to the ATSSS-LL steering functionality.\nEditor's note:\tHow the receiver will treat duplicated packets in case of MP-QUIC or MP-DCCP is FFS.\nEditor's note:\tThe redundant traffic steering mode for the GBR traffic is FFS.\nEditor's note:\tWhether threshold values other than packet loss rate, such as RTT, are applicable, or whether and how multiple threshold values can be used together, is FFS.\nNOTE:\tFor the MA PDU session, when the UE performs traffic switching between the 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in 5GS and the MPTCP functionality is applied for the traffic, the UE and the UPF may trigger the redundant transmission via the 3GPP and non-3GPP access. This redundant transmission can be applied to all the MPTCP traffic with any steering mode.\nEditor's note:\tHow the UE and the UPF decide to trigger the redundant transmission via the 3GPP and non-3GPP access during the traffic switching is FFS.\nFigure 6.1.2-1 illustrates the redundancy steering mode in a telecommunication network, showcasing the various steering modes available for managing network redundancy. The figure highlights the importance of efficient steering in maintaining network stability and reliability. Key components include the steering elements, such as steering matrices and steering vectors, which are essential for directing traffic and ensuring optimal resource allocation. The diagram also emphasizes the role of the network controller in coordinating these steering elements to achieve the desired redundancy management strategy.\nFigure 6.1.2-1: Redundancy steering mode\n\n",

                            "text_content": "This solution addresses Key Issue #2 \"New steering functionalities for non-TCP traffic\" proposing MP-DCCP-LL to enable Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting for any type of traffic, e.g. UDP, etc.\nThe ATSSS feature is to enable a UE the advantage that application traffic can use both access resources to raise the bandwidth or/and access reliability by simultaneously connecting over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. Since release-16, the splitting mode is only available to TCP streams using the ATSSS-HL functionality based on MPTCP. For UDP and even plain IP traffic, it can only be supported by the ATSSS-LL functionality, thus an UDP or even an IP packet flow cannot be efficiently split over both accesses due to missing re-ordering support and to the lack of access path bandwidth capabilities, so actually the increase of bandwidth requirement is not achieved for those types of traffic. This solution is proposed to introduce a new steering method based on MP-DCCP to resolve this issue.\nThe Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) was specified in IETF in RFC 4340 [11] for the transport layer to complement TCP and UDP for traffic that does not require reliable transport and re-transmission (in contrast to TCP traffic), but needs session and congestion control (in contrast to UDP traffic). For an introduction to DCCP please refer to RFC 4336 [15]. DCCP RFC 4340 [11] and its multipath pendant MP-DCCP, draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp [12] provide protocol inherent measurement of path characteristics like latency, packet loss and available bandwidth. In that regard MP-DCCP is similar to MPTCP and therefore can support the same steering modes. Different to MPTCP though, is the handling of missing packets. Re-transmission and resulting head-of-line blocking are not under the responsibility of (MP-)DCCP, which is therefore similar to the ATSSS-LL characteristics provided for any type of traffic. This makes it suitable to be applied to Ethernet, IP and higher layer traffic when it becomes integrated with an encapsulation framework, which tunnels these types of traffic over a MP-DCCP connection. Moreover MP-DCCP provides measures to facilitate the process of re-ordering at the termination points of ATSSS. For this purpose, timing and sequencing information are transmitted along with the encapsulated data to facilitate re-ordering or partial reordering of the data received from the 3GPP and non-3GPP access. Both access types provide different path characteristics that let the original data stream scramble during transport after it has been split. Re-ordering helps in the receiving ATSSS entity (UPF or UE) to reconstruct a certain degree order.\nFor example, MP-DCCP supports similar functionality as provided by ATSSS-LL and ATSSS-HL (MPTCP) for all ATSSS steering modes, for any type of traffic, and provides re-ordering capabilities. MP-DCCP does not introduce encryption but relies on the security layer of 3GPP.\nThis solution can be applied to any type of traffic, at least to the UDP based application traffic, with IP-based MA PDU Sessions for various IP versions (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6).\n",

MP-DCCP-LL is able to co-exist with ATSSS-LL and MPTCP, even if it can take over their functionality.\nTo support ATSSS using the MP-DCCP-LL steering functionality, the architecture reference model for ATSSS, as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 4.2.10, is enhanced as shown in Figure 6.3.2-1. The MP-DCCP-LL steering functionality is implemented in the UE and in the PSA UPF. The PMF functionality is not needed for an MA PDU Session that applies MP-DCCP-LL.\nFigure 6.3.2-1 illustrates the reference architecture for an ATSSS system utilizing MP-DCCP. The figure showcases the various components involved, including the ATSSS server, MP-DCCP server, and the network infrastructure. The architecture emphasizes the efficient use of resources and the secure transmission of data, with a focus on real-time processing and low latency. The figure highlights the integration of different technologies and protocols, demonstrating the complex yet interconnected nature of modern telecommunications systems.\nFigure 6.3.2-1: Reference Architecture for ATSSS using MP-DCCP\nThe MP-DCCP protocol is specified in draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp [12]: \"DCCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses\". It is designed to support the multipath scenario, and provides the means for access traffic steering, switching, and splitting. Depending on the traffic direction, the UE or PSA UPF acts as ATSSS sender or ATSSS receiver, respectively. The UE uses the MP-DCCP-LL functionality to establish multiple sub-flows as DCCP tunnels which are set up and operated towards the PSA UPF for bi-directional usage. Within each sub-flow inherent sequencing is given and DCCP congestion control provides real-time path characteristic information, which is required for splitting based steering modes (e.g. priority-based, smallest delay, load-balancing) and packet reordering measures.\nThe MP-DCCP-LL provides an unreliable tunnelling service between the UE and the UPF that is based on:\n1.\tThe DCCP protocol specified in RFC4340 [11] along with accompanying documents that describe congestion control (CCID2, RFC 4341 [19], CCID3, RFC 4342 [20], CCID4, RFC 5622 [21], CCID5); and\n2.\tThe DCCP extension specified in draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp [12] for supporting multipath DCCP.\nThe Figure 6.3.2-2 shows the model of an MA PDU Session that operates using the MP-DCCP-LL steering functionality.\nFigure 6.3.2-2 presents a detailed model of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Data Center Communication Protocol (DCCP) Low Latency (LL) session. The figure illustrates the process of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) exchanges between the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Core and the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). The figure also shows the use of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) to optimize the flow of data packets. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the complex process of data transmission in a data center environment.\nFigure 6.3.2-2: Model of MA PDU Session using MP-DCCP-LL\nThe MP-DCCP-LL is composed of the following components which can also be found in Figure 6.3.2-3:\n-\tMP-DCCP Tunnel Client (MDTC): The MDTC operates in the UE as a MP-DCCP client application and provides the following functionality:\n-\tIt establishes N MP-DCCP connections with the MP-DCCP tunnel server (MDTS) in the UPF. The number N of MP-DCCP connections, as well as the destination IP address & port for each MP-DCCP connection, is determined from information contained in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message (see the \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup Information\" below). Each MP-DCCP connection is established immediately after the setup of the MA PDU Session.\nNOTE 1: As explained below, each MP-DCCP connection carries the traffic of one QoS flow only. By using a separate MP-DCCP connection for each QoS flow, we ensure that PDUs belonging to different QoS flows, which may require a different QoS treatment, are not multiplexed in the same MP-DCCP connection, hence, each MP-DCCP connection does not need to support QoS-aware scheduling.\n-\tIt receives UL PDUs from the upper layer and, for each UL PDU:\n-\tFirst, it selects a QoS flow based on the QoS rules in the UE.\n-\tThen, it selects a steering mode to be applied for the UL PDU based on the ATSSS rules in the UE.\n-\tIf negotiated, it compresses the inner headers (e.g. IP, UDP, TCP, Ethernet) of the UL PDU.\n-\tFinally, it selects a MP-DCCP connection to transmit the PDU based on the selected QoS flow and the selected steering mode. For each established MP-DCCP connection, the MDTC maintains an associated steering mode and QoS flow indicator.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is assumed that the scheduler of a MP-DCCP connection can apply only one steering mode. Therefore, if different steering modes are needed for the traffic of a QoS flow, then different MP-DCCP connections are setup for this QoS flow, one per steering mode.\n-\tMP-DCCP Tunnel Server (MDTS): The MDTS operates in the UPF as a MP-DCCP server application and provides the following functionality:\n-\tIt accepts the MP-DCCP connections requested by MDTC in the UE.\n-\tIt receives DL PDUs from the upper layer and, for each DL PDU, it selects (a) a QoS flow, (b) a MP-DCCP connection to transmit the PDU, and (c) a steering mode. The MP-DCCP connection is selected based on the N4 (e.g. MAR) rules.\n-\tIf negotiated, it compresses the inner headers (e.g. IP, UDP, TCP, Ethernet) of the DL PDU.\n-\tMP-DCCP protocol: The DCCP protocol as defined by IETF with the applicable multipath extensions, draft-ietf-tsvwg-multipath-dccp [12]. It receives PDUs from the MDTC in the UE (or the MDTS in the UPF) indicating the MP-DCCP connection to be sent on and, for each PDU, it selects an access type (i.e. a MP-DCCP sub-flow) to transmit the PDU. The access type selection is based on the steering mode associated with the MP-DCCP connection and the measurements provided by the MP-DCCP protocol (e.g. RTT, loss rate, congestion).\nThe MP-DCCP-LL functionality tunnels PDUs (e.g. IP packets or Ethernet frames) over a multipath DCCP transport. The protocol stack in the UE and UPF is shown in Figure 6.3.2-3. The different IP addresses shown in this figure are explained in the next clause.\n\nFigure 6.3.2-3 illustrates the protocol stack for Multipath Diffusion Congestion Control Protocol with Low Latency (MP-DCCP-LL), which is a protocol designed to efficiently manage network congestion and minimize latency in data transmission. The figure showcases the various layers of the protocol, including the application layer, transport layer, and network layer, as well as the data link layer and physical layer. The visual representation emphasizes the interaction between these layers, highlighting the mechanisms by which MP-DCCP-LL ensures reliable and timely data delivery across multiple network paths.\nFigure 6.3.2-3: Protocol stack for MP-DCCP-LL\nIn summary, the MP-DCCP-LL steering functionality:\na.\tSupports a multipath, unreliable, and transparent bi-directional tunnelling service between the UE and UPF.\nb.\tDoes not support retransmission of lost DCCP datagrams but supports loss detection, according to RFC 4340 [11].\nc.\tProvides mechanisms for reordering of out-of-order arrived DCCP datagrams as described in clause 6.3.7.\nd.\tSupports congestion control per DCCP sub-flow, based on standardized CC algorithms RFC 4341 [19], RFC 4342 [20], RFC 5622 [21]).

                            "text_content": "\nFigure 6.3.3-1 illustrates the process of Multi-Access PDU Session establishment using Multiplexed Protocol Data Unit (MP-DCCP) in a Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) environment. The figure depicts the interaction between the Mobile Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (MAODV) routing protocol and the Media Independent Call Control Protocol (MICCP) for establishing a PDU session. The figure highlights the role of the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the process, which coordinates the session establishment and manages the handover of sessions between mobile nodes. The figure also shows the use of the Mobile IPv6 protocol for maintaining a persistent IP address during node mobility.\nFigure 6.3.3-1: MA PDU Session establishment using MP-DCCP\nThe above Figure 6.3.3-1 shows how an MA PDU Session is established when (a) the UE indicates support for MP-DCCP-LL and (b) the network accepts to apply MP-DCCP-LL for one or more traffic flows. All steps are the same as the steps used to establish an MA PDU Session in Rel-17 specifications. The additions to support MP-DCCP-LL are further discussed below.\n1a.\tIn the PDU Session Establishment Request the UE indicates (in the 5GSM capability) that it supports the MP-DCCP-LL steering functionality, inner header compression (IHC), supported compression profile, and, possibly, other steering functionalities such as MPTCP and ATSSS-LL.\n1b.\tThe AMF selects an SMF supporting ATSSS.\n5a.\tIn the SM Policy Control Create Request, the SMF includes the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU Session (see TS 23.502 [3] and TS 29.512 [23]), which contain the MP-DCCP-LL capability and, possibly, other capabilities already defined, such as \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode\", etc.\n5b.\tThe PCF decides to allow the requested MA PDU Session and creates PCC rules containing MA PDU Session Control information (see TS 29.512 [23]), which specifies a steering functionality (e.g. MP-DCCP-LL, ATSSS-LL), a steering mode (e.g. Active/Standby), etc.\n6a.\tBased on the received PCC rules, the SMF creates N4 rules for the UPF including MAR rules for MP-DCCP-LL and decides to use IHC and which compression profile.\n6b.\tIn the N4 Session Establishment Request, the SMF includes the N4 rules and indicates to UPF that MP-DCCP-LL Control Information should be provided (see next step). The MP-DCCP-LL Control Information indicates to UPF how many MP-DCCP connections are needed, which is determined from the received PCC rules which map to QoS Flows and steering modes. For example, if the SMF has two QoS Flows carrying traffic with steering functionality = MP-DCCP-LL and steering mode= smallest delay then the SMF indicates to UPF that two MP-DCCP connections are needed. It also includes IHC configuration information.\n6c.\tBased on the requested MP-DCCP-LL Control Information, the UPF provides the following MP-DCCP-LL parameters:\n1)\tTwo \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses used only by the MP-DCCP-LL functionality in the UE, one associated with the 3GPP access and another associated with the non-3GPP access. It is possible that the UPF provides \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses that are not routable via N6 (e.g. IPv6 link-local addresses). For example, the \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses may be the following:\nUE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address over 3GPP access = 10.10.1.1\nUE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address over non-3GPP access = 10.10.2.1\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses are similar to the \"UE link-specific multipath\" IP addresses used for MPTCP, specified in TS 23.502 [3] and TS 29.244 [24].\nNOTE 2:\tIn case MP-DCCP-LL and MPTCP are enabled for the same MA PDU Session, the \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses and the \"UE link-specific multipath\" IP addresses can be the same.\n2)\t\"MP-DCCP Address Information\" which contains the \"UPF link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP address for the UPF, and one UPF port number per MP-DCCP connection.\n3)\n7.\tBased on the received PCC rules and the MP-DCCP-LL parameters received from UPF, the SMF creates the following information, which will be sent to the UE:\n-\tATSSS rules;\n-\tQoS rules; and\n-\t\"MP-DCCP Connection Setup Information\" which contains\na)\tinformation for the UE to setup the MP-DCCP connections with the UPF. For example, it indicates that a MP-DCCP Connection over 3GPP access should be established toward the UPF IP address 10.10.3.1and UPF port 53671 for QFI-x and steering mode=smallest delay.\nb)\tIHC configuration information\n8a.\tIn the PDU Session Establishment Accept, the ATSSS Container (defined in TS 24.193 [13]) contains:\n1)\tThe ATSSS rules, which are applied by MDTC in the UE to route the traffic of the MA PDU Session across the DCCP connections; and\n2)\tThe \"network steering functionalities information\" (see TS 24.193 [13]), which contains:\na.\tThe two \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses provided by UPF in step 6c; and\nb.\tThe \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup information\" created by SMF in step 7.\n11.\tBased on the received \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup information\" the MDTC in the UE establishes one or more MP-DCCP connections with the MDTS in the UPF. The UE establishes the MP-DCCP connections immediately after receiving the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. The application protocol negotiated during each MP-DCCP connection will be decided by stage-3 (for example, it could be \"mp-dccp-ll\").\nWhen MP-DCCP-LL functionality is enabled for the MA PDU Session:\n-\tany QoS rules or PDRs that apply to the MA PDU Session IP address/prefix and port also apply to the \"link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes and ports used by the UE to establish MP-DCCP subflows over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses; and\n-\tany QoS rules or PDRs that apply to the IP address/prefix and port of the final destination server in DN also apply to the IP address and port of the MDTS for corresponding MP-DCCP subflows that are terminated at the UPF.\nNOTE 2:\tHow these associations are made is left up to the UE and UPF implementations.\nThe MP-DCCP connections established between the MDTC in UE and the MDTS in UPF include also MP-DCCP connections associated with downlink-only QoS flows. This is achieved by sending \"MP-DCCP connection setup information\" to UE that includes information for establishing a MP-DCCP connection associated with a downlink-only QoS flow. The UE does not send uplink PDUs to a MP-DCCP connection associated with a downlink-only QoS flow, because the UE has no associated QoS rule for this MP-DCCP connection. However, the UE sends DCCP packets (e.g. Data-ACK, etc.) over this MP-DCCP connection based on the normal MP-DCCP protocol operation.\n6.3.4\tMA PDU Session Modification procedure\nThe MA PDU Session Modification procedure (either network-requested or UE-requested) may be used to add or remove QoS flows from an established MA PDU Session, as specified since Rel-16.\nAfter the MA PDU Session Modification procedure is completed, then:\n-\tIf a QoS flow is deleted and this QoS flow was used to transfer MP-DCCP-LL traffic, then the MP-DCCP connection associated with this QoS flow (one DCCP connection per access) is released. The UE receives updated \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup Information\" in order to determine which MP-DCCP connection to release.\n-\tIf a QoS flow is created and this QoS flow will be used to transfer MP-DCCP-LL traffic, then the MP-DCCP connection associated with this QoS flow (one DCCP connection per access) is established between the UE and UPF. The UE receives updated \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup Information\" in order to determine the UPF IP addresses and ports for the new MP-DCCP connections.\n",

In this example, it is assumed that the PCF creates two PCC rules which contain steering functionality = MP-DCCP-LL (see Figure 6.3.5-1 below) and the UPF provides the following MP-DCCP-LL parameters:\n1)\t\"UE Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses:\nUE Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address over 3GPP access = 10.10.1.1\nUE Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address over non-3GPP access = 10.10.2.1\n2)\tMP-DCCP-LL Address Information:\nUPF Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address for both 3GPP access and for non-3GPP access = 10.10.3.1\nUPF Port for MP-DCCP Connection #1 = 53671\nUPF Port for MP-DCCP Connection #2 = 53672\nBased on the above MP-DCCP-LL Address Information, the SMF creates the following \" MP-DCCP Connection Setup information\", which is sent to UE.\n-\tMP-DCCP Connection #1:\n-\tUPF Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address for 3GPP access: 10.10.3.1\n-\tUPF Port: 53671\n-\tAssociated QFI: QFI-x\n-\tAssociated Steering Mode: Active/Standby\n-\tMP-DCCP Connection #2:\n-\tUPF Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address for both 3GPP accessand non-3GPP access: 10.10.3.1\n-\tUPF port: 53672\n-\tAssociated QFI: QFI-y\n-\tAssociated Steering Mode: Smallest Delay\nThe UE applies the received \"UE link-specific MP-DCCP-LL\" IP addresses and the \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup information\" and establishes two MP-DCCP connections with the UPF over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, as shown below.\nFigure 6.3.5-1 illustrates the operation of Multipath Diffusion Channel Propagation (MP-DCCP-LL) in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts a network with multiple nodes, each representing a transmitter and receiver pair. The nodes are connected by multiple paths, which are represented by lines of varying thicknesses. The figure shows how the signals propagate through these paths, with some paths being more direct and others being more indirect. The figure also shows how the signals are combined at the receiver, with some signals being more dominant than others. The figure is a useful tool for understanding how signals propagate through a telecommunication network and how different propagation paths can affect the overall signal quality.\nFigure 6.3.5-1: Example of MP-DCCP-LL Operation\nAfter the two MP-DCCP connections are established between the UE and the UPF, the MP-DCCP-LL routes the PDUs received from the upper layers to one of the flows of a MP-DCCP connection, as illustrated in Figure 6.3.5-2 and Figure 6.3.5-3 below for up-link and down-link traffic, respectively.\nFirst, the QoS rules are applied on a received PDU (e.g. IP packet or Ethernet frame) to determine a QFI for this PDU. Subsequently, the MDTC finds a matching ATSSS rule for the PDU based on which it identifies the steering mode that should be applied for this PDU. Finally, the MDTC selects a MP-DCCP connection for the PDU based on the selected QFI and the steering mode. For each MP-DCCP Connection, the MDTC maintains an associated steering mode and QFI according on the received \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup information\". Finally, the PDU is encapsulated in a DCCP datagram and is added to a DCCP/IP packet destined to [UPF Link-specific MP-DCCP-LL IP address = 10.10.3.1, UPF Port = 53671].\nNOTE 1:\tThe QFI selected for a PDU is transferred down to the selected access (3GPP or non-3GPP) so that the selected access can transfer the PDU via the corresponding QoS flow. For a packet created by the MP-DCCP protocol itself (e.g. a Data ACK), the QFI delivered to the access is the QFI associated with the MP-DCCP connection over which this packet is transmitted.\nNOTE 2:\tThe header compression, if performed by the MP-DCCP Tunnel Client and the MP-DCCP Tunnel Server (see clause 6.3.2) is not shown in the following two figures for simplicity.\nFigure 6.3.5-2 illustrates the user-plane operation with Multipath Diffusion Congestion Control Protocol with Link Layer Discovery (MP-DCCP-LL) in the uplink (UL) direction. The figure depicts the interaction between the user equipment (UE) and the network elements, including the gNB (gateway Node B), eNB (evolved Node B), and the core network. The figure highlights the data flow from the UE to the gNB, where MP-DCCP-LL is applied to manage the congestion and ensure reliable data transmission. The figure also shows the use of MP-DCCP-LL in discovering and selecting the best path for data transmission, which is crucial for efficient and high-quality communication in a mobile network.\nFigure 6.3.5-2: Example of user-plane operation with MP-DCCP-LL (UL direction)\nFigure 6.3.5-3 illustrates the user-plane operation in the downlink direction utilizing Multi-Path Downlink Control Channel (MPDCCP-LL). The figure depicts the process of data transmission from the eNB (evolved Node B) to the UE (User Equipment) through multiple paths. The eNB utilizes MPDCCP-LL to control the transmission of data over these paths, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure highlights the importance of efficient control channels in managing data transmission over multiple paths, which is crucial for achieving high-speed and low-latency communication in modern telecommunication networks.\nFigure 6.3.5-3: Example of user-plane operation with MPDCCP-LL (DL direction)\n",

                            "text_content": "With this solution redundant traffic steering is enabled as a new steering mode. The new steering mode enforces, based on certain criteria, that a Packet Data Unit (PDU) is duplicated and sent to the other access. Traffic duplication can be activated and de-activated by setting or re-setting the traffic duplication criteria.\nThe UE indicates its capability for support of traffic duplication during the MA PDU session establishment procedure.\nTraffic duplication reduces end-to-end latency and packet loss rate, but at the cost of utilizing resources over both accesses. Thus, selective duplication is a necessity to avoid wasting unnecessarily network, and especially radio resources. The state of each access is dynamically changing over time, and hence a static selection of an access as primary access is suboptimal.\nThe new steering mode operates on a per PDU basis in the following way: First, for each PDU the access to be used as primary access is determined either statically, or dynamically based on access conditions, e.g. smallest delay. Second, once the primary access for the PDU is selected and if the duplication criteria are met, the PDU is duplicated and sent over the other (the current secondary) access.\nAs part of the ATSSS Rule and MA Rule at SDF level, the UE and the UPF respectively receive the necessary information to use the new steering mode.\nIn certain cases, duplication of traffic may be desired only for a specific access, e.g. limited to the non-3GPP access to avoid excessive charging. For this purpose, an Access Constraint Indicator can be provided indicating the access to which duplication is not allowed, i.e. it can be set to 3GPP or non-3GPP. If not set, duplication can be applied for any access.\n1.\tRegarding the selection of the primary access, the following configuration parameter can be set:\na.\tStatic: One access is indicated and set as the primary access. The other access is the secondary access used for duplication.\nb.\tDynamic: Based on measured performance criteria (e.g. PLR, RTT), the best-performing access is selected as primary access, and the other access is used as secondary access.\n2.\tIf none of the duplication criteria described below is provided and the Access Constraint Indicator is not set, all the traffic sent to the primary access is duplicated to the secondary access. If duplication criteria are provided, (part of the) traffic is duplicated to the other access whenever the duplication criteria are met, and the secondary access is available.\nThe new steering mode is applicable to GBR and non-GBR traffic as it generally improves the user experience. For GBR traffic networks resources need to be reserved on both accesses.\nEditor's note:\tHow the receiver will treat duplicated packets in case of MP-QUIC or MP-DCCP is FFS.\nIf present, traffic duplication criteria are evaluated by the UE for the UL and by the UPF for the DL to decide which packets need to be duplicated. One or more of the following traffic duplication criteria can be applied to the traffic on the primary access:\n1.\tLink quality: Traffic duplication is started or stopped based on link quality measurements, e.g. considering Packet Loss Rate (PLR) or Round Trip Time (RTT) thresholds. The measurement result focuses only on the performance of a single link, i.e. the 3GPP or non-3GPP link in UL or DL. When the measured link performance violates the provisioned threshold, the next packets will be duplicated to the other path, otherwise the traffic will be sent on the currently selected primary access. This allows to limit duplication of traffic to the case where the link quality decreases, thus the probability to lose packets increases. These duplication threshold values can be specified in a similar way to existing Threshold values.\nThe link quality criterion allows to specify the duplication conditions for the selected primary access.\nDuplication threshold values: One or more threshold values may be provided for a steering mode. A threshold value may be either a value for RTT or a value for PLR. The threshold values are applicable to currently selected primary access and are applied by the UE and UPF to decide whether a PDU shall be duplicated and send on the other access.\nApplicability: This criterion keeps track of the status of the primary access path and enables the UE and the UPF to independently apply duplication when considered useful based on the measurements available. Thus, it can tackle temporary degradation of an access path in UL and/or DL.\n2.\tPercentage of duplicated traffic (Max or fixed percentage is possible): The max percentage variant, if indicated, allows to define a duplication budget as the max percentage (e.g. up to 20%) of traffic that can be duplicated over a certain time. It is up to implementation which traffic is duplicated. The fixed percentage variant, if indicated, mandates the exact percentage of traffic that should be duplicated to the secondary access. For example, fixed 20% duplication rate would mean that UE and UPF duplicate 20% of the packets, e.g. every 5th packet. A max of 20% duplication rate would mean that UE and UPF duplicate every 5th or less packet over a certain time period.\nApplicability: Unless fixed percentage is indicated, this criterion enables the UE and the UPF to select how much and which of the traffic to duplicate based for example on locally available information such as the battery state of the UE or other possible criteria, such as:\ni.\tImportant PDUs: Traffic duplication is applied based on header information indicating whether a PDU is important or not, i.e. only important PDUs are duplicated, and up to the maximum duplication budget. For example, duplicating only PDUs carrying I-frames, and not P-frames (which is indicated in a RTP header extension), in video streams, or duplicating only video and not audio in a video surveillance application.\nNOTE 1:\tThe concrete information in the PDU header that is used for traffic duplication is not specified.\nii.\tSurvival time: Survival Time, as defined in TS 23.501 [2], refers to the time period an application can survive without any data burst (with a certain burst size). As per TSC feature, Survival Time is part of TSCAI (see TS 23.501 [2]). The AF may provide the time an application can survive without any burst. It refers to the time that an application consuming a communication service may continue without an anticipated message and can be expressed as the maximum number of messages or in terms of time units.\nNOTE 2:\tThe exact usage of the Survival Time in the TSCAI information is not specified, but the Survival Time has to be included as part of the ATSSS and MA rules to be used by the UE and the UPF respectively.\nEssentially the two criteria are easily combinable since:\n1.\tthe first (Link quality) controls the dynamic activation of duplication of traffic\n2.\tthe second (Percentage), upon activation determines which PDUs should be duplicated based on the indicated budget.\nAccess selection is based on relative performance of the two accesses, and by selecting always the best one it reduces the need for duplication. On the other hand, Link quality criterion for duplication captures the temporal evolution of access state and relies on absolute performance values. The combination of dynamic primary access selection and partial duplication significantly reduces the duplication overhead since the duplication is applied only when needed and to the extent it is needed.\nThe duplication steering mode, together with duplication criteria, needs to be authorized by the PCF in the PCC Rules, and the SMF provides an indication for duplication and the duplication criteria in the ATSSS Rule to the UE, and in the Multi-Access Rule (MAR) to the UPF. After receiving the rules, UE and UPF determine when and how to duplicate traffic based on the provided duplication criteria and the measured performance of each access.\nThe AF can also request to start and stop traffic duplication by including the corresponding duplication steering mode indication and traffic duplication criteria to be applied for the application traffic. The NEF provides an API allowing the AF to request start and stop of traffic duplication and providing traffic duplication criteria.\nThe duplication steering mode requires that the Multi-Access Rule (MAR) and the ATSSS Rule, both generated by the SMF will need to be updated as follows:\nTable 6.5.2-1: Updated structure of ATSSS Rule and MA Rule\n\n(1)\tStatic primary and Static secondary access are configured together.\n(2)\tDynamic primary access excludes configuration of Static primary and Static secondary access.\n\n",

If 0% is indicated, it means that no duplication takes place and that all the traffic is sent only over the primary access link. If, e.g. 20, 50 or 100% is indicated, it means that that only 20, 50 or 90% of the traffic sent over the primary access link is duplicated over the secondary access link. 100% means that all traffic is duplicated over the secondary access link. The indication can be different for UL and DL. For example, there could be a duplication factor of 50% in UL and of only 30% in DL.\n-\tindication of which of the access paths is the secondary access. If secondary access = 'non-3GPP access', then 100% of the traffic is sent over the 3GPP access path and the X% duplicated PDUs (indicated by the duplication factor) will be sent over the non-3GPP access path. The indication can be different for UL and DL.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the duplication factor is not indicated, it is implicitly assumed that all the traffic is duplicated.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the receiver (i.e. the UPF in UL, the UE in DL) handles duplicated PDUs is up to implementation. For example, for each PDU sent by the sender (i.e. the UE in UL, the UPF in DL) over the primary access whose duplicate PDU is sent over the secondary access, the receiver retains the PDU that arrives at destination first and discards the one arriving later.\nIn addition, in scenarios in which the QoS requested for one or more QoS flows of a single access PDU Session cannot be met (e.g. a too high PER), the SMF may decide, based on information provided by the RAN and/or implementation dependent mechanisms, to use, instead use the regular single access PDU Session, a MA PDU Session with RSM to match the QoS requirements from the AF.\nIn order to do this, two options are possible:\n-\tOption 1: UE proactively indicating the possible use of a MA PDU Session.\nIf the UE can proactively indicate its willingness to upgrade to a MA PDU Session, then the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment with Network Modification to MA PDU Session procedure can be reused. The UE sends its ATSSS rules with the MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed indication and the SMF can trigger the switch to the MA PDU Session with RSM according to the indicated ATSSS rules.\n-\tOption 2: SMF asking UE to upgrade to a MA PDU Session.\nIn that case, UE initially triggers the establishment of a regular single access PDU Session Establishment procedure without indicating ATSSS rules nor MA PDU Session Request. In the PDU Session Establishment Accept the SMF may indicate to the UE that if it establishes a MA PDU Session the provided QoS level will increase. The UE, after receiving such indication, may decide to upgrade to a MA PDU session by modifying the single access PDU Session and sending its ATSSS capabilities together with the MA PDU Request indication.\n",

The SMF will then sends the appropriate ATSSS rules and N4 rules to the UE and to the UPF, respectively, to initiate the usage of the RSM.\n-\tOption 2: Modification of AF session setup and PDU Session Establishment procedures\nThis option is based on the extension of the following procedures.\nAF session setup\nThe AF uses the procedure for setting up an AF session with the required QoS by sending an Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create message (see clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3]) to indicate the QoS requirements for a given UE. The PDU Session is identified by indicating the proper DNN/S-NSSAI combination. The following changes apply to the existing procedure:\n-\tStep 1: instead of using UE's IP address, the AF indicates that the UE's GPSI to the NEF when it provides the related QoS requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is assumed that the AF knows (e.g. based on application level subscription) when to provide the QoS requirements for the UE even the PDU Session is not yet established.\n-\tStep 3:\nThe NEF temporarily stores the QoS requirements associated to the UE's GPSI and it triggers the storage of a 'retrieve QoS requirements' flag associated to the GPSI and of the NEF's endpoint address in the UDM. This flag is later used at PDU session establishment by the SMF to contact the NEF to retrieve the QoS requirements.\nPDU Session Establishment\nThe UE Requested PDU Session Establishment (see clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]) is extended with the following changes:\n-\tStep 4: If the Session Management Subscription data is not available, then, as per current Rel-17 behavior, the SMF retrieves the Session Management Subscription data from the UDM. The SMF identifies the 'retrieve QoS requirements' flag in the UDM and the NEF's endpoint address and retrieves the QoS requirements from the NEF.\n-\tStep 11: the SMF is aware that the QoS requirements for a certain QoS flow of the PDU Session that is being established cannot be met. Because of that the QoS flow is established with lower QoS characteristics levels.\n-\tAfter step 17: the SMF sends a PDU Session Modification Command message to the UE including an indication that, if the UE switches to MA PDU Session, then the QoS levels will be improved.\nAfter the UE receives the indication from the SMF and the single access PDU Session is established, the UE may decide to modify the PDU Session into a MA PDU Session by sending its ATSSS capabilities and a MA PDU Request indication. The SMF will then provide the appropriate ATSSS rules and N4 rules to the UE and the UPF, respectively, to initiate the usage of the RSM and improve the QoS provided to the UE (see clause 4.22.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).\n",

The figure outlines the steps involved in the process, including the activation of the data traffic switching feature, the configuration of the access paths, and the monitoring of the switching process.

The figure highlights the importance of efficient handover procedures and seamless session management in modern mobile networks.\nFigure 6.10.3-1: Non-3GPP access path switching procedure for an MA PDU Session\nThe above Figure 6.10.3-1 shows how the non-3GPP access path of an MA PDU Session is switched to another Non-3GPP access path.\n0.\tThe UE is registered over untrusted non-3GPP access and established MA PDU Session. The UE may be registered over 3GPP access. During registration procedure over non-3GPP access, the UE includes its capability of non-3GPP path switching in the Registration Request message and the AMF informs to UE whether the network supports non-3GPP access path switching for MA PDU Session.\n1.\tThe UE determines that the existing non-3GPP access path of the MA PDU Session needs to be changed to trusted non-3GPP access.\n2.\tIn the Registration Request message, the UE includes ATSSS path switching indication and List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. ATSSS path switching indication indicates that this request is for the registration for the second non-3GPP access path via target non-3GPP access network (the trusted non-3GPP access in this case). List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated includes the PDU Session ID of the MA PDU Session.\nThe same AMF is selected using GUAMI provided by the UE. If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching for MA PDU Session, the AMF determines whether this request is for registration over the second non-3GPP access path of the established MA PDU Session. AMF determines RAT Type of trusted non-3GPP access (as defined in clause 5.3.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), and checks if it is different with that of the existing non-3GPP access path of the MA PDU Session.\n3\tThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request which includes the ATSSS path switching indication, PDU Session ID of the MA PDU Session, Target RAT Type (e.g. trusted W-LAN), and Source RAT Type (e.g. untrusted non-3GPP).\n4.\tThe SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response which includes Access Path Switching Lifetime Value.

The AMF starts De-registration timer corresponding to the Access Path Switching Timer. The AMF can decide Access Path Switching Timer as longer value than Access Path Switching Lifetime Value received from the SMF in step 5, to avoid triggering the de-registration before the MA PDU Session Establishment over the second non-3GPP access path is finished.\n6.\tThe UE requests MA PDU Session Establishment over the trusted non-3GPP access before the expiry of the Access Path Switching Timer received in step 6.\n7.\tThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSessin_CreateSMContext Request which includes ATSSS path switching indication, PDU Session ID of the MA PDU Session, Target RAT Type, and Source RAT Type.

After this step, there can be three user plane tunnels (i.e. 3GPP access, untrusted non-3GPP access, and trusted non-3GPP access) in the UE and the UPF. The UPF switches all downlink traffic from untrusted non-3GPP access to trusted non-3GPP access.\n15.\tThe SMF initiates the MA PDU Session release over untrusted non-3GPP access.

                            "text_content": "The solution in clause 6.11 specifies a new ATSSS steering functionality, called Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) steering functionality, and addresses the objective of KI#2 for a QUIC-based steering functionality. It borrows several aspects from solutions studied in TR 23.700-93 [5], mainly from Solution #6 \"MPQUIC-LL Steering Functionality\" and from Solution #14 \"Proxy based solution using MP-QUIC\".\nThe solution is primarily based on RFC 9298 \"proxying UDP in HTTP\" [27], which specifies how UDP traffic can be transferred between a client (UE) and a proxy (UPF) using the HTTP/3 protocol [28]. The HTTP/3 protocol operates on top of the QUIC protocol [6], which supports simultaneous communication over multiple paths, as defined in draft-ietf-quic-multipath [10].\nThe solution supports the following transport modes for transmitting a UDP flow between UE and UPF (see further details in clause 6.11.3, step 5):\n-\tDatagram mode 2: This transport mode is the mode already supported in RFC 9298 [27]. It encapsulates UDP packets within QUIC Datagram frames and provides unreliable transport with no sequence numbering and no packet reordering / deduplication. It can be applied for UDP flows where the application is robust against out-of-order delivery and jitter (e.g. because it can perform itself appropriate packet reordering / deduplication).\n-\tDatagram mode 1: This transport mode is an extension of the mode supported in RFC 9298 [27]. It encapsulates UDP packets within QUIC Datagram frames and provides unreliable transport but with sequence numbering and with packet reordering / deduplication. It can be applied for any UDP flows, e.g. for applications that perform re-transmissions. The datagram mode 1 requires the definition of a new Context ID (see RFC 9298), which can be done in stage-3. Also, additional details (e.g. the algorithms for packet re-ordering) may also be considered in stage-3.\n-\tStream mode: This transport mode is readily supported by the QUIC protocol. It encapsulates UDP packets within QUIC Stream frames and provides reliable transport with sequence numbering and with packet reordering / deduplication. It can be applied for UDP flows where it is known that the application does not perform retransmissions.\nThe PCF selects which of the above transport modes shall be applied for a UDP flow (SDF). The selected transport mode is provided to UE and UPF within the ATSSS rules and N4/MAR rules respectively.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the Datagram mode 2 is used with steering modes that use both accesses simultaneously, e.g. the Load-Balancing steering mode, traffic scheduling with per-packet splitting can result to excessive out-of-order delivery.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Stream mode provides strict reliability and in-order delivery with re-transmissions and therefore can lead to melt down phenomena [see http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html] when reliable traffic (e.g. QUIC) is carried, or counteracts application decisions when UDP is selected to avoid reliability and/or in-order delivery. Therefore, it can be avoided for applications which perform their own reliability mechanisms.\nThe Datagram mode 1 and the Stream mode can be used for supporting per-packet splitting, i.e. when the packets of a UDP flow are split across multiple accesses and may be received out-of-order. The Datagram mode 2 is a transport mode which can be applied for applications that can tolerate packet reordering or duplicated packets. The Datagram mode 2 is required (although it does not support re-ordering) because the MPQUIC steering functionality (as any other ATSSS steering functionality) must support all steering modes and not only steering modes that require packet reordering / deduplication. The Datagram mode 2 features benefits compared to ATSSS-LL as it supports congestion control, RTT/PLR measurements without the need to implement the PMF protocol, and it is implemented in high-layers so it can interact with applications. However, it also adds additional overhead and encryption.\n",

Therefore, the UE supports an HTTP/3 client and the UPF supports an HTTP/3 proxy, both of them operating over QUIC.\n-\tWhen the UE wants to transmit the first uplink packet of a new UDP flow, the UE:\n-\tSelects which QUIC connection will be used for the uplink traffic of the UDP flow based on the QoS flow associated with the UDP flow;\n-\tCreates a new bidirectional QUIC stream on the selected QUIC connection;\n-\tConfigures the QUIC stream to apply a steering mode (i.e. the steering mode that should be used for the uplink traffic of the UDP flow based on the ATSSS rules);\n-\tSends to UPF, via the QUIC stream, an extended HTTP CONNECT request [27] containing 'path' information that identifies a destination address and port for the UDP flow (i.e. identifies the remote host where the UDP flow should be forwarded to); and\n-\tForwards to UPF the uplink packets of the UDP flow using multipath QUIC transport.\n-\tWhen the UPF wants to transmit a downlink packet of a UDP flow, the UPF:\n-\tSelects which QUIC connection will be used for the downlink traffic of the UDP flow based on the QoS flow associated with the UDP flow (this QUIC connection is the same as the one selected by UE for the UDP flow, assuming the QoS flow in UL and DL directions is the same);\n-\tSelects a bidirectional QUIC stream on the selected QUIC connection (this QUIC stream is the same as the one created by the UE for the UDP flow);\n-\tConfigures the QUIC stream to apply a steering mode (i.e. the steering mode that should be used for the downlink traffic of the UDP flow based on the N4 rules); and\n-\tForwards to UE the downlink packets of the UDP flow using multipath QUIC transport.\nThe following figure illustrates how the traffic of a UDP flow is transferred between the UE and UPF using multipath QUIC transport. In this figure, it is assumed that the uplink traffic and the downlink traffic of the UDP flow are mapped to the same QoS flow (QFI-1). Therefore, both the uplink traffic and the downlink traffic of the UDP flow use the same multipath QUIC connection.\nFigure 6 illustrates the utilization of multipath QUIC transport for a UDP flow, showcasing the efficient handling of concurrent connections and data transmission. The figure depicts the QUIC protocol's ability to establish multiple paths for data transfer, enhancing reliability and reducing latency. The diagram highlights the QUIC handshake process, where the client and server negotiate a secure connection, and the use of multiplexing to manage multiple concurrent connections. The UDP flow is shown as a single line, emphasizing the simplicity and efficiency of QUIC's transport mechanism.\nFigure 6.11.2-1: Using multipath QUIC transport for a UDP flow\nThe bidirectional QUIC stream is established by the UE to enable transmission of uplink data packets (blue) and downlink data packets (red) of the UDP flow. The UE configures this stream to send uplink traffic with a steering mode determined based on the ATSSS rules in the UE (uplink steering mode). The UPF configures this stream to send downlink traffic with a steering mode determined based on the N4 rules in the UPF (downlink steering mode). The data packets of the UDP flow shown in Figure 6.11.2-1 are transmitted in datagram mode (mode 1 or mode 2), i.e. they are encapsulated in HTTP datagrams and in QUIC DATAGRAM frames, each one carrying header information (see the Quarter Stream ID defined in RFC 9297 [29]) that associates it with the established bidirectional stream. As discussed below, the data packets of the UDP flow may be transmitted in stream mode (instead of datagram mode), i.e. transmitted directly over the bidirectional stream. In this case, the data packets of the UDP flow are encapsulated in DATAGRAM capsules (see [29]) and in QUIC STREAM frames.\nFigure 6.11.2-2 and Figure 6.11.2-3 illustrate the components of the MPQUIC steering functionality used to support data transmission in the uplink and downlink direction respectively. The MPQUIC steering functionality is composed of three components:\n1)\tQoS flow selection & Steering mode selection: This component in the UE initiates the establishment of one or more QUIC connections, after the establishment of the MA PDU Session and, for each uplink UDP flow, it selects a QoS flow (based on the QoS rules), and a steering mode and a transport mode (based on the ATSSS rules). This component in the UPF selects, for each downlink UDP flow, a QoS flow (based on the N4 rules), a steering mode and a transport mode (based on the N4 rules).\nIn the UE, this component is only used in the uplink direction, while, in the UPF, this component is only used in the downlink direction.\n2)\tHTTP/3 layer: Supports the HTTP/3 protocol defined in RFC 9114 [28] and the extensions defined in:\n-\tRFC 9298 [27] for supporting UDP proxying over HTTP;\n-\tRFC 9297 [29] for supporting HTTP datagrams; and\n-\tRFC 9220 [30] for supporting Extended CONNECT.\nThe HTTP/3 layer selects a QUIC connection to be used for each UDP flow and allocates a new QUIC stream on this connection that is associated with the UDP flow. It also configures this QUIC stream to apply a specific steering mode.\nIn the UE, the HTTP/3 layer implements an HTTP/3 client, while, in the UPF, it implements an HTTP/3 proxy.\n3)\tQUIC layer: Supports the QUIC protocol as defined in the applicable IETF specifications (RFC 9000 [6], RFC 9001 [7], RFC 9002 [8]) and the extensions defined in:\n-\tRFC 9221 [9] for supporting unreliable datagram transport with QUIC; and\n-\tdraft-ietf-quic-multipath [10] for supporting QUIC connections using multiple paths simultaneously.\nFigure 6 illustrates the components of MPQUIC steering functionality utilized for uplink (UL) data transmission in a telecommunication system. The figure showcases the interaction between the base station (BS), mobile station (MS), and the MPQUIC protocol stack. Key elements include the MS, which sends data to the BS, and the BS, which processes and transmits the data through the network. The figure emphasizes the role of MPQUIC in managing the transmission process, ensuring efficient and reliable data exchange between the MS and the BS.\nFigure 6.11.2-2: Components of MPQUIC steering functionality used for UL data transmission\nFigure 6 illustrates the components of MPQUIC steering functionality utilized for downlink (DL) data transmission in a telecommunication system. The figure showcases the interaction between the baseband unit (BBU), mobile station equipment (MSE), and the network. Key elements include the MPQUIC protocol stack, the physical layer (PHY), and the medium access control (MAC) layer. The diagram highlights the role of the BBU in managing resource allocation and the MSE in processing the received signals. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient steering functionality in ensuring reliable and high-speed data transmission in a 5G network.\nFigure 6.11.2-3: Components of MPQUIC steering functionality used for DL data transmission\nThe protocol stack of the solution is depicted in Figure 6.11.2-4 below.\nFigure 6 illustrates the Universal Packet (UP) protocol stack of the solution, showcasing the various layers involved in data transmission. The figure depicts the network stack, starting from the physical layer at the bottom, moving upwards through the data link, network, transport, and application layers, culminating in the user space. Each layer is represented by a distinct block, with arrows indicating the flow of data.

                            "text_content": "Figure 6.11.3-1 below depicts the key steps of the procedure that enables data traffic to be exchanged between the UE and UPF using the MPQUIC steering functionality. For simplicity, the components of the MPQUIC steering functionality at the UPF are not depicted.\nFigure 6 illustrates the procedure for enabling data traffic using the MPQUIC steering functionality, showcasing the interaction between the network elements involved in the process. The figure depicts the MPQUIC steering functionality, which is responsible for steering data traffic between the network elements. The figure also shows the relationship between the network elements, including the MPQUIC steering functionality, the MPQUIC steering request, and the MPQUIC steering response. The figure provides a clear and concise overview of the process for enabling data traffic using the MPQUIC steering functionality, making it an essential resource for understanding this complex process.\nFigure 6.11.3-1: Procedure for enabling data traffic using the MPQUIC steering functionality\n1.\tThe UE establishes a MA PDU Session with the 5G core (5GC) network. During the MA PDU Session establishment:\n-\tIn the PDU Establishment Request message, the UE indicates that it supports the MPQUIC steering functionality. This indication can be used by the network (a) to select a UPF that supports the MPQUIC steering functionality and (b) to decide whether the ATSSS/N4 rules for the MA PDU Session may use the MPQUIC steering functionality.\n-\tThe UE receives MPQUIC proxy information, i.e. one IP address of UPF, one UDP port number and the proxy type (e.g. \"connect-udp\"). This information is used by the UE for establishing QUIC connections with the UPF, which is also referred to as \"MPQUIC proxy\".\n-\tThe UE receives one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU Session and two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called \"link-specific multipath QUIC\" addresses; one associated with 3GPP access and another associated with non-3GPP access. These two addresses can be used by the UE to create two paths in a multipath QUIC connection.\n-\tThe UE receives QoS rules and ATSSS rules to be applied for the MA PDU Session, for QoS enforcement and traffic steering enforcement respectively. Similar rules (N4 rules) are received by UPF.\n2.\tAfter the MA PDU Session is established and the UE identifies that one or more ATSSS rules require traffic steering using the MPQUIC steering functionality, the UE determines the number of multipath QUIC connections to be established with the UPF (MPQUIC proxy). For example, the UE determines to establish as many multipath QUIC connections, as the number of QoS flows of the MA PDU Session, i.e. one multipath QUIC connection per QoS flow. This way, every QUIC packet can carry only traffic (e.g. one or more UDP payloads) that belongs to the same QoS flow, which facilitates QoS handling in the access layer.\nThe QoS rules provided to UE include downlink QoS information and the UE applies the downlink QoS information to establish QUIC connections for the QoS flows used for downlink traffic only.\n3.\tThe UE establishes the number of multipath QUIC connection with the UPF (MPQUIC proxy) determined in the previous step. This results into several multipath QUIC connections between the UE and UPF, each one composed of multiple paths, e.g. one path over 3GPP access and another path over non-3GPP access.\nNOTE 1:\tData transmitted over a multipath QUIC connection must be encrypted according to RFC 9001 [7]. However, encryption might not be necessary when the multipath QUIC connection is established between UE and UPF, because the underlying 5G security mechanisms can be applied.\nEditor's note:\tWhether and how encryption in the QUIC layer can be omitted is FFS and need to be studied by SA WG3. It could be studied, for example, whether RFC 9150 \"TLS 1.3 Authentication and Integrity-Only Cipher Suites\" can be applied to omit the data encryption. The impact due to encryption regarding overhead and performance is FFS in SA WG3.\nDuring a QUIC connection establishment, the UE and UPF negotiate QUIC transport parameters and indicate (a) support of QUIC Datagram frames and (b) support of multipath. They indicate support of QUIC Datagram frames by providing the \"max_datagram_frame_size\" transport parameter with a non-zero value (see RFC 9221 [9]) and they indicate support of multipath by providing the \"enable_multipath\" transport parameter (see draft-ietf-quic-multipath [10]).\nAfter a QUIC connection establishment, the HTTP/3 client and the HTTP/3 proxy negotiate HTTP settings and indicate support of HTTP Datagrams (see RFC 9297 [29]) and support of Extended CONNECT (see RFC 9220 [30]).\nThe QoS flow associated with a QUIC connection is also negotiated between the UE and UPF. This is done by using a new QUIC transport parameter (defined by 3GPP) when the QUIC connection is established.\nNOTE 2:\tThe new QUIC transport parameter needs to be registered in IANA (by stage 3).\n4.\tAn app in the UE generates a new data packet (also referred to as \"UDP payload\") that should be sent via the MA PDU Session. This data packet initiates a new UDP flow, i.e. a sequence of data packets using the same 5-tuple. In the example shown in Figure 6.11.3-1, the data packet should be sent to IP address 144.23.1.47 and to UDP port 556.\n5.\tFor the new UDP flow (and for each new UDP flow):\n-\tThe UE selects a QoS flow (QFI) over which the UDP flow should be transmitted. This is selected by using the received QoS rules.\n-\tThe UE selects a steering mode that should be applied for the UDP flow. This is selected by using the received ATSSS rules.\n-\tThe UE selects a transport mode that should be applied for the UDP flow. This is selected by using the received ATSSS rules, i.e. each ATSSS rule which indicates that the MPQUIC steering functionality should be applied for the matching traffic, indicates also the transport mode that should be applied for this traffic.\nAs specified in clause 6.11.1, three transport modes are supported (Datagram mode 1, Datagram mode 2 and Stream mode) and the transport mode that should be applied for a UDP flow is selected by PCF and is provided to UE and UPF within the ATSSS rules and the N4/MAR rules respectively.\n-\tThe Datagram mode 2 is already specified in RFC 9298 [27] and does not require further specification in 3GPP. In this mode, the HTTP/3 proxy/client encapsulates each UDP data within an HTTP Datagram that contains a Context Id=0. Then, the HTTP Datagram is sent to the QUIC layer for multipath transmission. No sequence numbers are included in the HTTP Datagrams (see [27]).\n-\tThe Datagram mode 1 is similar to the Datagram mode 2 but it also provides a sequence number for each UDP data. In this mode, the HTTP/3 proxy/client encapsulates each UDP data within an HTTP Datagram that contains a Context Id and a sequence number. Then, the HTTP Datagram is sent to the QUIC layer for multipath transmission. The value of this Context Id will be defined in stage-3 and indicates that a sequence number is also included. The sequence numbers are used by the receiving endpoint to re-order the UDP data and remove duplicated UDP data. Details of how packet reordering is supported (including the mechanisms for reordering) can be specified in stage-3.\nThe Datagram mode 1 and Datagram mode 2 use two different (and pre-defined in 3GPP) Context IDs, e.g. Context ID=0 and Context ID=1, respectively. With Context ID=0, the HTTP Datagram Payload contains the UDP data, whereas, with Context ID=1, the HTTP Datagram Payload contains a sequence number followed by the UDP data. The format of QUIC DATAGRAMs used in both datagram modes is shown below. As specified in clause 6.11.6, the Datagram mode 1 supports reordering in the HTTP/3 layer (as described above).\nThe following table shows how UDP data is encapsulated in a QUIC datagram using the Datagram mode 1 and the Datagram mode 2. It is assumed that the value of Context Id used in Datagram mode 1 is set to 1.\n\n\n6.\tThe UE selects a multipath QUIC connection to be used for the new UDP flow (e.g. based on the selected QFI) and the UE allocates a new bidirectional QUIC stream (e.g. stream 40) in this multipath QUIC connection. This new stream is associated with the new UDP flow. The UE configures the new stream to transmit uplink data traffic using the selected steering mode for this UDP flow.\n7-9. The UE sends the data packet using the allocated new stream on the selected QUIC connection.\nWhen the datagram transport mode is selected (either mode 1 or mode 2), the UE encapsulates the data packet within an HTTP DATAGRAM frame [27], which is transferred inside a QUIC DATAGRAM frame [9]. The header of the HTTP DATAGRAM indicates that this datagram is associated with stream 40 (i.e. the Quarter Stream ID is set to 10).\nWhen the stream transport mode is selected, the UE encapsulates the data packet within an HTTP DATAGRAM frame [29] that is further encapsulated in a DATAGRAM capsule (see clause 3.5 in [29]), which is transferred inside a QUIC STREAM frame [6].\nIn the example procedure shown in Figure 6.11.3-1, the datagram transport mode (either mode 1 or mode 2) is selected. The UE sends an HTTP CONNECT request via the allocated stream 40, which indicates to UPF (MPQUIC proxy) that the UE wishes to create an HTTP tunnel to send UDP traffic to remote host 144.23.1.47 and port 556. The :protocol pseudo-header is set to \"connect-udp\" (as defined in [27]) to indicate that the protocol to be spoken on the tunnel is the capsule protocol defined in RFC 9297 [29]. Finally, the UE sends a QUIC DATAGRAM frame to UPF that encapsulates the data packet, which is forwarded to the remote host (144.23.1.47:556). Note that the QUIC DATAGRAM frame may contain a sequence number (as defined in step 5).\nIf the stream transport mode were selected, the HTTP DATA frame in step 8 would contain a DATAGRAM capsule, which would include the data packet in the HTTP Datagram Payload field (see [29]).\n10.\tThe UPF (MPQUIC proxy) responds with an HTTP 200 status, indicating that the request to proxy data packets to a remote host 144.23.1.47 and destination port 556 is accepted.\n11.\tWhen a data packet is received by UPF (MPQUIC proxy) from the remote host (data packet #2), this data packet is transferred to the UE using the established context information for the UDP flow, i.e. using the selected multipath QUIC connection, the selected stream on this connection, the selected steering mode, and the selected transport mode. Such context information is stored in the UPF and in the UE and is applied for all the data packets of the UDP flow.\n12.\tSimilarly, when another data packet is generated by the UE app (data packet #3), this data packet is transferred to UPF (MPQUIC proxy) using again all the stored context information for the UDP flow.\nNOTE 2:\tThe context information for a UDP flow in the UE and in the UPF is created when the first data packet (i.e. Data packet #1) of this UDP flow is transferred. All subsequent data packets of the same UDP flow are transferred between the UE and the UPF using this context information.\nWhen the UE identifies that the context information for a UDP flow is no longer needed (e.g. the app closes the associated UDP socket), the UE deletes this context information and releases the associated QUIC stream, which cause the UPF to delete the context information stored in UPF.\nThe following figure 6.11.3-2 illustrates an example of how the uplink traffic of various UDP flows is transferred from the UE to UPF using QUIC multipath transport, and how the UPF relays this traffic to a final destination (remote host). Note that, for each UDP flow, there is an associated QUIC connection and an associated bidirectional QUIC stream, which is configured to apply a specific steering mode for the uplink traffic. For example, the red UDP flow is associated with the multipath QUIC connection #1 and with the red Stream Y, which is configured to apply the Smallest-delay steering mode in the uplink direction.\nAll UDP flows shown in this figure, except the blue UDP flow, are transferred with the datagram transport mode (mode 1 or mode 2), so their data packets are transferred inside QUIC DATAGRAM frames. The blue UDP flow is transferred with the stream transport mode, so its data packets are transferred inside QUIC STREAM frames.\nThe downlink traffic of UDP flows is transferred between the UE and UPF in a similar way.\nFigure 6.11.3-2 illustrates the user-plane operation in a network using the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) with User Datagram Protocol (UDP) over Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) encapsulation, specifically utilizing the Multiprotocol Quick UDP Port Switching (MPQUIC) steering functionality in the uplink (UL) direction. The figure depicts the path taken by a data packet from the user equipment (UE) to the network core, highlighting the steering of the packet through the network using the MPQUIC protocol. The figure showcases the efficient and direct path taken by the packet, avoiding the need for multiple network hops, which is crucial for maintaining low latency and high throughput in modern network communication.\nFigure 6.11.3-2: Example of user-plane operation using the MPQUIC steering functionality (UL direction)\n",

This proxying mechanism \"allows an HTTP client to create a tunnel for UDP communications through an HTTP server that acts as a proxy\" (see RFC 9298 [27]).\nThe table below provides an estimate of the size of the additional headers for the various transport modes. Note that the exact estimation of the size of the additional headers depends on the QUIC implementation (e.g. how the implementation selects the size of the stream identity) and it is difficult to be calculated. Therefore, the table below provides approximate numbers based on some assumptions.\nTable 6.11.4-1\n\nThe figure 6.11.4-1 below shows that, when two app payloads are provided to the MPQUIC steering functionality they can be multiplexed in the same QUIC packet (this is a feature supported by QUIC), thus, reducing the user-plane overhead. In addition, a single UDP datagram can multiplex multiple QUIC packets, which can further reduce the overhead.\nNOTE:\tAs a consequence of RFC9000 [6] the precondition for possible multiplexing of payload packets is that those payload packets fit completely inside a single QUIC packet, which is limited by the maximum MTU size.\nAn overhead of the MPQUIC steering functionality, which is not evident from the figure below, is the HTTP CONNECT request plus the 200 OK response, sent at the beginning of every UDP flow (see steps 7 and 10 in Figure 6.11.3-1).\nFigure 6 illustrates the process of multiplexing QUIC datagram frames within a single QUIC packet to minimize user-plane overhead when utilizing the MPQUIC steering functionality in the uplink (UL) direction. The figure showcases the QUIC packet structure, with the datagram frames arranged in a manner that optimizes network efficiency and reduces latency.

It borrows several aspects from solutions studied in TR 23.700-93 [5], mainly from Solution #6 \"MPQUIC-LL Steering Functionality\" and from Solution #14 \"Proxy based solution using MP-QUIC\".\nThe solution is primarily based on the draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip [31], which specifies how IP traffic can be transferred between a client (UE) and a proxy (UPF) using the HTTP/3 protocol [28]. The HTTP/3 protocol operates on top of the QUIC protocol [6], which supports simultaneous communication over multiple paths, as defined in draft-ietf-quic-multipath [10].\nThe solution considers the following modes for transmitting an IP flow (see further details in clause 6.12.3, step 5):\n-\tDatagram mode 1: This mode encapsulates the IP packets into QUIC DATAGRAM frames. It provides unreliable transport and adds sequence numbers to the transmitted IP packets, so that the received IP packets can be re-ordered, and the duplicated IP packets can be removed.\n-\tDatagram mode 2: This mode encapsulates the IP packets into QUIC DATAGRAM frames. It provides unreliable transport but does not add sequence numbers to the transmitted IP packets. Therefore, it may result in data delivery with out-of-order packets and/or with duplicated packets.\n-\tStream mode: This mode encapsulates the IP packets into QUIC STREAM frames. It provides reliable transport (based on the existing mechanisms supported by the QUIC protocol) and supports data delivery without out-of-order packets and without duplicated packets.\nNOTE:\tStream mode provides strict reliability and in-order delivery with re-transmissions and therefore leads to melt down phenomena [see http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html] when reliable (e.g. QUIC) is carried, or counteracts application decisions when UDP is selected to avoid reliability and/or in-order delivery.\nThe Datagram mode 1 and the Stream mode are particularly useful for supporting per-packet splitting, i.e. when the packets of an IP flow are split across multiple accesses and may be received out-of-order. The Datagram mode 2 is a simple transport mode which can be applied for applications that can tolerate packet reordering or duplicated packets. The Datagram mode 2 features benefits compared to ATSSS-LL, e.g. (a) it supports congestion control, (b) it supports RTT/PLR measurements without the need to implement the PMF protocol, etc.\nAs clarified in clause 6.12.6, the MPQUIC-IP solution defines the mechanisms needed for packet re-ordering (Datagram mode 1 and Stream mode) and the conclusions should indicate which of those mechanisms should be defined in the normative specs.\n",

                            "text_content": "The key principles of the solution are summarized below.\n-\tAfter the MA PDU Session establishment, the UE creates one or more multipath QUIC connections with the UPF. Each multipath QUIC connection is associated with a QoS flow, i.e. it carries the traffic mapped to a QoS flow.\n-\tThe UE operates as a connect-ip client and the UPF operates as a connect-ip proxy, both defined in draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip [31]. Therefore, the UE supports an HTTP/3 client and the UPF supports an HTTP/3 proxy, both of them operating over QUIC.\n-\tOn each of the established QUIC connections, the UE sends an extended HTTP CONNECT request to UPF (as defined in [31]) indicating that IP proxying over HTTP is needed.\n-\tWhen the UE wants to transmit an uplink packet of an IP flow, the UE:\n-\tSelects which QUIC connection will be used for the uplink traffic of the IP flow based on the QoS flow associated with the IP flow;\n-\tCreates a new bidirectional QUIC stream on the selected QUIC connection;\n-\tConfigures the QUIC stream to apply a steering mode (i.e. the steering mode that should be used for the uplink traffic of the IP flow based on the ATSSS rules); and\n-\tForwards to UPF the uplink packets of the IP flow using multipath QUIC transport.\n-\tWhen the UPF wants to transmit a downlink packet of an IP flow, the UPF:\n-\tSelects which QUIC connection will be used for the downlink traffic of the IP flow (this QUIC connection is the same as the one selected by UE for the IP flow, assuming the QoS flow in UL and DL directions is the same);\n-\tSelects a bidirectional QUIC stream on the selected QUIC connection (this QUIC stream is the same as the one created by the UE for the IP flow);\n-\tConfigures the QUIC stream to apply a steering mode (i.e. the steering mode that should be used for the downlink traffic of the IP flow based on the N4 rules); and\n-\tForwards to UE the downlink packets of the IP flow using multipath QUIC transport.\nThe following figure illustrates how the traffic of an IP flow is transferred between the UE and UPF using multipath QUIC transport [9]. In this figure, it is assumed that the uplink traffic and the downlink traffic of the IP flow are mapped to the same QoS flow (QFI-1). Therefore, both the uplink traffic and the downlink traffic of the IP flow use the same multipath QUIC connection.\nFigure 6 illustrates the utilization of multipath QUIC transport for managing a single IP flow, showcasing the intricate network setup that includes multiple paths and nodes. The figure emphasizes the importance of QUIC in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of data transmission over a complex network infrastructure. The various components, such as the sender (S), receiver (R), and intermediary nodes, are interconnected through multiple paths, demonstrating the dynamic nature of modern network communication. This figure underscores the technical complexity and sophistication required to manage and optimize IP flows in today's interconnected world.\nFigure 6.12.2-1: Using multipath QUIC transport for a IP flow\nThe bidirectional QUIC stream is established by the UE to enable transmission of uplink IP packets (blue) and downlink IP packets (red) of the IP flow. The UE configures this stream to send uplink traffic with a steering mode determined based on the ATSSS rules in the UE (uplink steering mode). The UPF configures this stream to send downlink traffic with a steering mode determined based on the N4 rules in the UPF (downlink steering mode). The data packets of the IP flow shown in Fig. 6.12.2-1 are transmitted in datagram mode (mode 1 or mode 2), i.e. they are encapsulated in HTTP datagrams and QUIC DATAGRAM frames, each one carrying header information (see the Quarter Stream ID defined in draft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram [29]) that associates it with the established bidirectional stream. As discussed below, the IP packets of the IP flow may be transmitted in stream mode (instead of datagram mode), i.e. transmitted directly over the bidirectional stream. In this case, the IP packets of the IP flow are encapsulated in DATAGRAM capsules (see [29]) and QUIC STREAM frames.\nFigure 6.12.2-2 and Figure 6.12.2-3 illustrate the components of the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality used to support data transmission in the uplink and downlink direction respectively. The MPQUIC-IP steering functionality is composed of three components:\n1)\tQoS flow selection & Steering mode selection: This component in the UE initiates the establishment of one or more QUIC connections, after the establishment of the MA PDU Session and, for each uplink IP flow, it selects a QoS flow (based on the QoS rules), a steering mode (based on the ATSSS rules) and a transport mode (see further details below). This component in the UPF selects, for each downlink IP flow, a QoS flow (based on the N4 rules), a steering mode (based on the N4 rules) and a transport mode (see further details below)\nIn the UE, this component is only used in the uplink direction, while, in the UPF, this component is only used in the downlink direction.\n2)\tHTTP/3 layer: Supports the HTTP/3 protocol defined in draft-ietf-quic-http [28] and the extensions defined in:\n-\tdraft-ietf-masque-connect-ip [31] for supporting IP proxying over HTTP; and\n-\tdraft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram [29] for supporting HTTP datagrams.\nThe HTTP/3 layer selects a QUIC connection to be used for each IP flow and allocates a new QUIC stream on this connection that is associated with the IP flow. It also configures this QUIC stream to apply a specific steering mode (further details are provided below).\nIn the UE, the HTTP/3 layer implements an HTTP/3 client, while, in the UPF, it implements an HTTP/3 proxy.\n3)\tQUIC layer: Supports the QUIC protocol as defined in the applicable IETF specifications (RFC 9000 [6],\nRFC 9001 [7], RFC 9002 [8]) and the extensions defined in:\n-\tRFC 9221 [9] for supporting unreliable datagram transport with QUIC; and\n-\tdraft-ietf-quic-multipath [10] for supporting QUIC connections using multiple paths simultaneously.\nFigure 6 illustrates the components of MPQUIC-IP steering functionality used for UL data transmission. The figure showcases the interaction between the base station (BS), mobile station (MS), and the network elements involved in the transmission process. The key components include the MS, BS, and the packet data network (PDN) gateway. The figure also highlights the role of the home subscriber server (HSS) and the mobility management entity (MME) in managing the session and providing the necessary signaling for the transmission. The figure provides a clear understanding of the complex process involved in UL data transmission and the role of each component in ensuring a smooth and efficient process.\nFigure 6.12.2-2: Components of MPQUIC-IP steering functionality used for UL data transmission\nFigure 6 illustrates the components of MPQUIC-IP steering functionality utilized for downlink (DL) data transmission in a telecommunication system. The figure showcases the interaction between the baseband unit (BBU), mobile station (MS), and the network. Key elements include the physical layer (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers, which facilitate data exchange between the MS and the network. The figure also highlights the role of the home subscriber server (HSS) in managing user plane data (UPD) and the role of the mobility management entity (MME) in controlling the radio access network (RAN). The figure emphasizes the importance of these components in ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in a mobile communication system.\nFigure 6.12.2-3: Components of MPQUIC-IP steering functionality used for DL data transmission\nThe protocol stack of the solution is depicted in Figure 6.12.2-4 below.\nFigure 6 illustrates the 12.2-4 UP protocol stack of the solution, showcasing the various layers involved in data transmission. The figure depicts the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers, each playing a crucial role in ensuring efficient communication. The physical layer is responsible for transmitting raw bits over the network, while the data link layer handles error detection and correction. The network layer is in charge of routing data packets, and the transport layer ensures reliable delivery. Finally, the application layer provides services to the end-users, such as email or web browsing. The figure also highlights the role of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in managing the flow of data packets.\nFigure 6.12.2-4: UP protocol stack of the solution\n",

                            "text_content": "Figure 6.12.3-1 below depicts the key steps of the procedure that enables data traffic to be exchanged between the UE and UPF using the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality.\nFigure 6 illustrates the process of enabling data traffic using the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality, which is a crucial aspect of network management. The figure showcases the interaction between the network elements, including the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality, the MPQUIC-IP client, and the MPQUIC-IP server. The MPQUIC-IP steering functionality plays a pivotal role in directing data traffic efficiently, ensuring minimal latency and optimal resource utilization. The figure highlights the importance of this functionality in maintaining the smooth operation of the network and delivering a high-quality user experience.\nFigure 6.12.3-1: Procedure for enabling data traffic using the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality\n1.\tThe UE establishes a MA PDU Session with the 5G core (5GC) network. During the MA PDU Session establishment:\n-\tIn the PDU Establishment Request message, the UE indicates that it supports the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality. This indication can be used by the network (a) to select a UPF that also supports the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality and (b) to decide whether the ATSSS/N4 rules for the MA PDU Session may use the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality.\n-\tThe UE receives MPQUIC-IP proxy information, i.e. one IP address of UPF, one UDP port number and the proxy type (e.g. \"connect-ip\"). This information is used by the UE for establishing QUIC connections with the UPF, which is also referred to as \"MPQUIC-IP proxy\".\n-\tThe UE receives one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU Session and two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called \"link-specific multipath QUIC\" addresses; one associated with 3GPP access and another associated with the non-3GPP access. These two addresses can be used by the UE to create two paths in a multipath QUIC connection.\n-\tThe UE receives QoS rules and ATSSS rules to be applied for the MA PDU Session, for QoS enforcement and traffic steering enforcement respectively. Similar rules (N4 rules) are received by UPF.\n2.\tAfter the MA PDU Session is established and the UE identifies that one or more ATSSS rules require traffic steering using the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality, the UE determines the number of multipath QUIC connections to be established with the UPF (MPQUIC-IP proxy). For example, the UE may determine to establish as many multipath QUIC connections, as the number of QoS flows of the MA PDU Session, i.e. one multipath QUIC connection per QoS flow. The QoS rules provided to UE include downlink QoS information and the UE applies the downlink QoS information to establish QUIC connections for the QoS flows used for downlink traffic only.\n3.\tThe UE establishes the number of multipath QUIC connection with the UPF (MPQUIC-IP proxy) determined in the previous step. This results into several multipath QUIC connections between the UE and UPF, each one composed of multiple paths, e.g. one path over 3GPP access and another path over non-3GPP access.\nNOTE 1:\tData transmitted over a multipath QUIC connection must be encrypted according to RFC 9001 [7]. However, encryption might not be necessary when the multipath QUIC connection is established between UE and UPF, because the underlying 5G security mechanisms can be applied.\nEditor's note:\tWhether and how encryption in the QUIC layer can be omitted is FFS and need to be verified by SA3. The impact due to encryption regarding overhead and performance is FFS.\nDuring a QUIC connection establishment, the UE and UPF negotiate QUIC transport parameters and indicate (a) support of QUIC Datagram frames and (b) support of multipath. They indicate support of QUIC Datagram frames by providing the \"max_datagram_frame_size\" transport parameter with a non-zero value (see RFC 9221 [9]) and they indicate support of multipath by providing the \"enable_multipath\" transport parameter (see draft-ietf-quic-multipath [10]).\nAfter a QUIC connection establishment, the HTTP/3 client and the HTTP/3 proxy negotiate HTTP settings and indicate support of HTTP Datagrams (see draft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram [29]) and support of Extended CONNECT (see draft-ietf-httpbis-h3-websockets [30]).\nThe QoS flow associated with a QUIC connection is also negotiated between the UE and UPF. This is done by using a new QUIC transport parameter (defined by 3GPP) when the QUIC connection is established.\nNOTE 2:\tQUIC transport parameter needs to be registered in IANA (by stage 3).\n4.\tOn each of the established QUIC connections, the UE sends an extended HTTP CONNECT request to UPF (as defined in [31]) indicating that IP proxying over HTTP is needed. If this is accepted by UPF, it responds with a 200 status.\n5.\tThe UE generates a new IP packet (IP packet #1) that should be sent via the MA PDU Session. This IP packet initiates a new IP flow, i.e. a sequence of IP packets using the same 5-tuple. For this new IP flow (and for each new IP flow):\n-\tThe UE selects a QoS flow (QFI) over which the IP flow should be transmitted. This is selected by using the received QoS rules.\n-\tThe UE selects a steering mode that should be applied for the IP flow. This is selected by using the received ATSSS rules.\n-\tThe UE selects a transport mode, e.g. a datagram transport mode or the stream transport mode. This is selected by using the received ATSSS rules, i.e. each ATSSS rule which indicates that the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality should be applied for the matching traffic, indicates also the transport mode that should be applied for this traffic.\nThe datagram transport mode supports the following two sub-modes of operation:\n-\tDatagram mode 1 (with sequence numbers): The HTTP/3 proxy/client or the \"QoS flow selection and Steering mode selection\" layer prefixes each UDP data with a sequence number before passing it to the QUIC layer for multipath transmission. The sequence numbers are applied by the receiving endpoint to re-order the UDP data and remove duplicated UDP data. Details of how packet reordering is support with the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality are provided in clause 6.12.6.\n-\tDatagram mode 2 (without sequence numbers): The HTTP/3 proxy/client does not prefix each IP packet with a sequence number before passing it to the QUIC layer for multipath transmission. This may result (depending on the applied steering mode) in data delivery with out-of-order packets and/or with duplicated packets. For some applications, however, such type of data delivery may be acceptable.\nThe datagram mode 2 is needed (although it does not support re-ordering) because it features benefits compared to ATSSS-LL, e.g. (a) it supports congestion control, (b) it supports RTT/PLR measurements without the need to implement the PMF protocol, etc.\nIn both datagram modes, every IP packet is encapsulated within an HTTP DATAGRAM, which if further encapsulated within an QUIC DATAGRAM frame [9]. The payload of the HTTP DATAGRAM is composed of a Context ID and a Payload (as defined in draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip [31]): HTTP DATAGRAM payload = {Context ID (i), Payload (..)}.\nThe Datagram mode 1 and Datagram mode 2 use two different (and pre-defined in 3GPP) Context IDs, e.g. Context ID=0 and Context ID=1, respectively. With Context ID=0, the Payload contains the IP packet, whereas, with Context ID=1, the Payload contains a sequence number followed by the IP packet. The format of QUIC DATAGRAMs used in both datagram modes is shown below. As specified in clause 6.12.6, the Datagram mode 1 may support reordering either in the HTTP/3 layer (as described above) or in the layer above HTTP/3. In the latter case, the definition of a new Context ID is not needed as sequencing and reordering is performed outside the HTTP/3 layer.\n\n\n6.\tThe UE selects a multipath QUIC connection to be used for the new IP flow (e.g. based on the selected QFI) and the UE allocates a new QUIC stream (e.g. stream 40) in this multipath QUIC connection. This new stream is associated with the new IP flow. The UE configures the new stream to transmit data traffic using the selected steering mode for this IP flow.\n9.\tThe UE sends the IP packet using the allocated new stream on the selected QUIC connection.\nWhen the datagram transport mode is selected (mode 1 or mode 2), the UE encapsulates the IP packet within an HTTP DATAGRAM frame [29], which is transferred inside a QUIC DATAGRAM frame [9]. The header of the HTTP DATAGRAM indicates that this datagram is associated with stream 40 (i.e. the Quarter Stream ID is set to 10).\nWhen the stream transport mode is selected, the UE encapsulates the IP packet within an HTTP DATAGRAM frame [29] that is further encapsulated in a DATAGRAM capsule (see [29]), which is transferred inside a QUIC STREAM frame [6].\nIn the example procedure shown in Figure 6.12.3-1, the datagram transport mode (mode 1 or mode 2) is selected. The UE sends a QUIC DATAGRAM frame to UPF that encapsulates the IP packet, which is forwarded by UPF to the remote host.\n11.\tWhen an IP packet is received by UPF (MPQUIC-IP proxy) from the remote host (IP packet #2), this IP packet is transferred to the UE using the established context information for the IP flow, i.e. using the selected multipath QUIC connection, the selected stream on this connection, the selected steering mode, and the selected transport mode. Such context information is stored in the UPF and in the UE and is applied for all the IP packets of the IP flow.\n12.\tSimilarly, when another IP packet is generated by the UE app (IP packet #3), this IP packet is transferred to UPF (MPQUIC-IP proxy) using again all the stored context information for the IP flow.\nNOTE 2:\tThe context information for an IP flow in the UE and in the UPF is created when the initial IP packet (i.e. IP packet #1) of this IP flow is transferred. All subsequent IP packets of the same IP flow are transferred between the UE and the UPF using this context information.\nWhen the UE identifies that the context information for an IP flow is no longer needed, the UE deletes this context information and releases the associated QUIC stream, which cause the UPF to delete the context information stored in UPF.\nThe following figure 6.12.3-2 illustrates an example of how the uplink traffic of various IP flows is transferred from the UE to UPF using QUIC multipath transport, and how the UPF relays this traffic to a final destination (remote host). Note that, for each IP flow there is an associated QUIC connection and an associated bidirectional QUIC stream, which is configured to apply a specific steering mode for the uplink traffic. For example, the red IP flow is associated with the multipath QUIC connection #1 and with the red Stream Y, which is configured to apply the Smallest delay steering mode in the uplink direction.\nAll IP flows shown in this figure, except the blue IP flow, are transferred with the datagram transport mode (mode 1 or mode 2), i.e. their data packets are transferred inside QUIC DATAGRAM frames. The blue IP flow is transferred with the stream transport mode, so its data packets are transferred inside QUIC STREAM frames.\nThe downlink traffic of IP flows is transferred between the UE and UPF in a similar way.\nFigure 6 illustrates the user-plane operation in a network using the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality in the uplink (UL) direction. The figure depicts the interaction between the network elements, including the MPQUIC-IP Steering Function (SF), Mobility Management Entity (MME), and the User Equipment (UE). The MME is responsible for managing the connection setup and handover processes, while the UE is the device communicating with the network. The MPQUIC-IP steering functionality is responsible for directing the user plane traffic between the MME and the UE, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. The figure highlights the importance of this functionality in maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted connection for mobile users.\nFigure 6.12.3-2: Example of user-plane operation using the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality (UL direction)\n",

These packets need to be reassembled in the correct order (i.e. to be re-ordered) before they are consumed. This out-of-order delivery issue can be significant when:\n-\tThe MPQUIC-IP steering functionality applies the Load-Balancing steering mode for an IP flow and (a) the transmitted packets are scheduled across the two accesses in a per-packet round-robin fashion (aka \"per-packet splitting\") and (b) the difference of RTTs across the two accesses is large.\nIn other scenarios, e.g. when the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality applies a steering mode other than Load-Balancing, the out-of-order delivery caused by multipath transmission is very limited because, most of the time, the traffic of the IP flow is transmitted on one access only.\nEven in the scenarios where Load-Balancing is applied, the excessive out-of-order delivery can be mitigated by avoiding per-packet round-robin scheduling. Note that the ATSSS specifications mandate only the traffic to be split using certain percentages (e.g. 50% over 3GPP, 50% over non-3GPP) but do not specify a time window for achieving these percentages. For example, a UE may choose to perform splitting every 20 packets, e.g. send 10 packets over 3GPP and the next 10 packets over non-3GPP. This type of traffic scheduling can be very well applied by the UE/UPF for Load-Balancing, and it is compliant with the ATSSS specifications. UE/UPF implementations may also choose to adjust their traffic scheduling based on the difference of RTTs across the two accesses in order to minimize the percentage of out-of-order packets.\nNevertheless, to enable scenarios where per-packet spitting is required and out-of-order delivery cannot be avoided otherwise, the MPQUIC-IP steering functionality is able to:\n-\tOffload the re-ordering procedure to the application, when the network indicates (via the \"transport mode\" parameter in the ATSSS/N4 rules) that Datagram mode 2 should be applied.

This may be indicated by PCF for applications that perform retransmissions themselves (e.g. embed QUIC streaming functionality in the application).\nThe new mechanisms that can be used for packet sequencing and re-ordering in Datagram mode 1 can be supported either in the HTTP/3 layer (as described in clause 6.12.3) or can be supported in the layer above HTTP/3. Whether the mechanisms for Datagram mode 1 are needed in Rel-18 or whether the Stream mode is sufficient is considered in the conclusions of KI#2 (in clause 8).\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how to ensure re-ordering on the receiver side is implemented and activated, when needed.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how same re-ordering in both Down- and Uplink can be provided which is pre-requisite for a consistent and good user experience.\nEditor's note:\thttp3 does not specify sequencing.

The figure depicts the layered architecture of these protocols, starting from the physical layer at the bottom and moving up to the application layer at the top. The key components include the Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication, QUIC for reliable transport, and DCCP for efficient data delivery. The figure also shows how these protocols interact with the network stack, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This layered approach ensures that each protocol performs its function optimally while maintaining overall system performance and security.\nFigure 6.14.2-1: Protocol Stack for MP-QUIC and MP_DCCP\nThe MP-QUIC/DCCP Tunnel Client (MxTC) at the UE, and the MP-QUIC/DCCP Tunnel Server (MxTS) at the UPF, rely on the underlying MP-QUIC or MP-DCCP protocol. These protocols support a number of traffic steering modes, including redundant traffic steering.\nIn both cases, the MxTC establishes an MP-QUIC/DCCP connection with the MxTS in the UPF. An MP-QUIC/DCCP connection carries the traffic of only one QoS flow. In addition, it is assumed that an MP-QUIC/DCCP connection will be configured with a single steering mode. The MxTC receives UL PDUs from the upper layer and, for each UL PDU, the MxTC selects a steering mode to be applied for the UL PDU based on the ATSSS rules in the UE. The MxTC subsequently selects a MP-QUIC/DCCP connection to transmit the PDU based on the selected QoS flow and the selected steering mode.\nThis mechanism works well for QoS flows which are known, a priori, to require redundant transmission. For such use cases, the choice of redundant transmission can be made at PDU session establishment, and traffic duplication should always be activated. In other use cases, traffic duplication should only be used when needed, as duplicating traffic over both accesses results in:\n-\tPower consumption at the UE: The UE is required to operate over both accesses.\n-\tCore network load: The redundant transmissions will result in a certain load to the 5GC.\n-\tProcessing at UE and UPF: The UE and UPF both need to handle re-ordering and possible reception of duplicate PDUs.\n-\tRadio resource usage: Radio resources are used over both accesses.\nFor these use cases, traffic duplication should only be used when needed, and should be dynamically activated / deactivated on a per-packet basis.\nNOTE:\tThe mechanism to duplicate the packet is FFS. It may be implemented at the MxTC or it may be implemented in the layers below the MxTC (for example in the MP-QUIC/DCCP layer).\nThe Activation/Deactivation decision should be made at the MxTC for the UE and at the MxTS for the UPF, and should be based on selection criteria and measurements:\n-\tPacket Loss Rate (PLR): This measurement indicates the rate of PDU packet loss for each access network. The measurement is applicable to both uplink and downlink transmissions.\n-\tDelay: This measurement indicates the PDU transmission delay for each access network. This is a one-way delay between UE and UPF for uplink transmissions, and between UPF and UE for downlink transmissions.\n-\tVariability of Delay: This measurement indicates the variability of PDU arrivals (jitter) over an access network. PDU arrivals at the UPF for uplink transmission and PDU arrivals at the UE for downlink transmissions. The variability of delay measurement is a reflection of transfer quality stability within certain time interval. It may be calculated using the mechanisms described in Solution #3 in TR 23.700-93 [5]. Variability of Delay measurements prevent wasteful transmissions over an access path. Some services, such as gaming and IMS voice, are sensitive to variability of delay. For these services, activating traffic duplication over a path that will not meet the variability of delay requirements, will not be useful.\n-\tLoad: This measurement indicates the load over an access network.\nThe selection criteria should rely on these measurements and should allow the UE to activate traffic duplication only when \"needed and effective\". For example, if the PLR is of critical importance of a data flow, the duplication should be activated when the measured PLR on the active access leg(s) is bigger than the threshold. For another example, the UE should not activate traffic duplication over a non-3GPP access, if the delay over the non-3GPP access will not meet the one-way delay requirement for the PDU. In such a case, the duplicate transmissions over the non-3GPP access would be useless. The selection criteria are included in the ATSSS rules provided to the UE and the N4 Rules provided to the UPF. The measurement configuration is included in the Measurement Assistance Information.\nWhen traffic duplication is deactivated, the UE and UPF should rely on a default steering mode (such as \"Active-Standby\" or \"Smallest Delay\") to select which access path to use. The default steering mode configuration could be chosen in a similar way how normal steering mode is configured (e.g. depending on UE/NW capabilities) and provided in the ATSSS rules to the UE and in the N4 rules to the UPF. The duplication criteria is configured in a way that the measurements in default steering mode can be used. For example, if Active-Standby is configured as the default steering mode, the PLR measurement on the active access, instead of both accesses, should be used in the criteria.\nEditor's note:\tHow to handle out-of-order reception due to latency difference between access paths is FFS.\n",

The solution is based on UE triggering a Registration Request via the new non-3GPP AN node and requesting UP establishment using the \"PDU Sessions to be activated\" parameter.\nThe solution allows both single access PDU Sessions and MA PDU Sessions to be \"switched\" using the Registration procedure. A reason for this is that the solution is basically describing how a mobility Registration Update is performed via non-3GPP access. If the UE initiates a mobility Registration Update via 3GPP access and indicates that it wants to activate UP connections using \"PDU Sessions to be activated\" parameter, it applies in the same way for single-access and MA PDU Sessions. It is proposed here that the same is assumed for mobility Registration via non-3GPP access.\n",

A similar procedure is applicable if UE is registered over trusted non-3GPP access first and then switches to untrusted non-3GPP access. The UE may also be registered in 3GPP access. The solution re-uses some aspects of Solution#5.2, e.g. a new registration type.\nFigure 6.16.2-1 illustrates the mobility registration procedure to support non-3GPP access switching, detailing the process of a mobile device registering with a new network. The figure outlines the steps involved, including the mobile device initiating the registration process, interacting with the network server, and obtaining an IP address. The process is depicted through a series of boxes and arrows, emphasizing the flow of information and the role of each component in the registration procedure. The figure highlights the importance of seamless mobility management in modern communication systems, ensuring a smooth transition for users when switching between different network technologies.\nFigure 6.16.2-1: Mobility Registration procedure to support non-3GPP access switching\n1.\tThe UE is registered over an untrusted non-3GPP access and may also be registered in 3GPP access. A MA PDU Session is established that has UP connections via untrusted non-3GPP access and possibly also via 3GPP access. The UE may also have single access (SA) PDU Sessions over 3GPP and/or untrusted non-3GPP access.\nDuring registration in non-3GPP, the AMF indicates to UE whether it supports non-3GPP access switching.\n2.\tThe UE registers over trusted non-3GPP access with Registration type = mobility registration. The UE also indicates whether it is maintaining the old non-3GPP access connectivity by including a \"dual non-3GPP access switching\" indication. The UE includes in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated the MA PDU Sessions that have user plane resources established over untrusted non-3GPP access. The UE may also include SA PDU Sessions active in untrusted non-3GPP access in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. The UE also indicates all SA and MA PDU Sessions that were active over the old non-3GPP access in the PDU Session status parameter.\n3.\tThe AMF may perform authentication based on existing procedures. The AMF may send an Initial Context Setup Request to TNGF and include AS security information. Alternatively, the AMF sends the Initial Context Setup Request to TNGF in step 6, after contacting the SMF(s).\n4.\tThe AMF releases the old N2 connection if the UE did not provide a \"dual non-3GPP access switching\" indication in step 2 or if the AMF only supports a single N2 connection via non-3GPP access.\n5.\tThe AMF notifies to the SMF(s) that the UE requested UP connection activation. For MA PDU Sessions, the AMF also includes the \"dual non-3GPP access switching\" indication, if received from the UE. The AMF repeats this step for all SA and MA PDU Sessions indicated in step 2.\nThe SMF contacts UPF to allocate CN tunnel information, if needed. If the \"dual non-3GPP switch\" indication is received, the SMF does not trigger a release of UP connection (if any) to old non-3GPP access.\nThe SMF replies to AMF including the CN tunnel information.\n6.\tThe AMF sends an N2 message to TNGF and includes the CN tunnel information received from the SMF(s). The N2 message is an Initial Context Setup Request (if not sent in step 3) or a PDU Session Resource Setup request. The AMF knows that the N2 information is targeting TNGF since the UP connection setup is part of the registration in trusted non-3GPP access.\nThe TNGF completes the IPSec SA establishment as described in clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3] and triggers establishment of UP resources towards the UE, e.g. to create a first Child SA for the PDU Session.\nAfter this step, the UE may start to send UL traffic via the new non-3GPP access.\n7.\tThe TNGF replies with Initial Context Setup Response, including AN tunnel information.\n8.\tThe AMF forwards the information to the SMF(s) and the SMF(s) provides the tunnel information to the UPF(s). For MA PDU Sessions, the UPF starts to use the trusted non-3GPP access as the non-3GPP access for the MA PDU Session, i.e. untrusted non-3GPP access is not used for downlink traffic anymore. For SA PDU Sessions, the downlink tunnel is switched to the trusted non-3GPP access. The UPF still accepts uplink packets from the untrusted non-3GPP access.\n9.\tThe AMF triggers a AN release of the untrusted non-3GPP access if not done in step 4. As a result of this procedure, user plane resources over untrusted non-3GPP access of MA PDU is completely released. Also user plane resources of SA PDU Session(s) are deactivated. The N3IWF does not need to signal to the UE since the UE may not be reachable over the old non-3GPP access. Latest when the UE recognize that user plane resources over untrusted non-3GPP access are released, the UE starts to send traffic over trusted non-3GPP access.\n10.\tThe AMF sends a NAS Registration Accept message to the UE, via the TNGF.\n11.\tThe AMF may update the registration for non-3GPP access in UDM, by providing the new RAT type.\n12.\tThe UE may send a NAS Registration Complete message, as described in TS 23.502 [3].\n",

In addition, during the MA PDU Session establishment, the UE and the network indicate whether they support \"Non-3GPP path switch\", i.e. whether they can switch the traffic of an MA PDU Session from one Non-3GPP access path to another Non-3GPP access path.\nc.\tIf both the UE and the network support \"Non-3GPP path switch\", then the following steps apply:\ni)\tWhen the UE wants to switch the traffic of the MA PDU Session from the existing non-3GPP access path to the new non-3GPP access path, the UE initiates registration over the new non-3GPP access path and indicates that the registration is for \"Non-3GPP path switch\". Also, the UE includes in the \"List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated\" the identity of the existing MA PDU Session.\nii)\tA registration procedure (based on clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) takes place over the new non-3GPP access path and the SMF triggers establishment of user-plane resources for the MA PDU Session over the new non-3GPP access path.

This ensures that, if the UE establishes an MA PDU Session when connected to one AMF and receives an indication that \"Non-3GPP path switch\" is supported, the UE can assume the \"Non-3GPP path switch\" is still supported after moving into the serving area of another AMF in the same PLMN.\n",

The same steps can be used to switch the data traffic of an MA PDU Session between any non-3GPP access paths (using either N3IWF or TNGF).\nFigure 6 illustrates the procedure for enabling traffic switching between two non-3GPP access paths, showcasing the steps involved in managing network traffic and ensuring seamless connectivity. The figure outlines the process, which includes the use of a control plane for path selection and a data plane for traffic forwarding. Key components include the network element responsible for path control, the network element managing the traffic, and the interface between the two. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient traffic management in hybrid networks, highlighting the need for a well-defined procedure to maintain optimal performance and reliability.\nFigure 6.17.3-1: Procedure for enabling traffic switching between two non-3GPP access paths\n1.\tOptionally, the UE performs an initial 5G registration over 3GPP access in a PLMN. The selected AMF registers with UDM for 3GPP access and provides its GUAMI and RAT type = NR.\n2.\tThe UE selects an N3IWF and performs an initial 5G registration over untrusted non-3GPP access in the same PLMN. The same AMF is selected, as the one in the previous step. The AMF registers with UDM for non-3GPP access and provides its GUAMI and RAT type = Untrusted WLAN.\n3.\tThe UE requests an MA PDU Session, as specified in clause 4.22.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. Since the UE supports Non-3GPP path switch, the UE includes in the UL NAS Transport message a Non-3GPP path switch supported indication. Based on this indication, the AMF selects an SMF that supports Non-3GPP path switch and sends a Create SM Context Request to SMF including a Non-3GPP path switch indication which indicates that the AMF and the UE support Non-3GPP path switch. The SMF registers with the UDM and additional steps are executed to complete the MA PDU Session establishment including the establishment of user-plane resource over 3GPP access and over untrusted non-3GPP access.\nThe PDU Session Establishment Accept message sent to UE indicates that Non-3GPP path switch is supported for the MA PDU Session.\n4.\tThe UE detects a trusted non-3GPP access network that supports 5G connectivity to the same PLMN. The UE decides to switch the data traffic transferred over the untrusted non-3GPP access of the MA PDU Session to the detected trusted non-3GPP access network.\n5.\tFor this purpose, the UE initiates a 5G registration over trusted non-3GPP access and sends a Registration Request to the same AMF. The Registration Request contains a Non-3GPP path switch indication (e.g. either a new registration type = \"Non-3GPP path switch\" or a registration type = \"Initial\" plus a new IE), which indicates that the registration over trusted non-3GPP access is required for switching the data traffic of an MA PDU Session to another non-3GPP access path. The Non-3GPP path switch indication indicates to AMF that the existing registration via untrusted non-3GPP access should not be released until the path switch is completed.\nIn the \"List of PDU Sessions To Be Activated\" the UE includes the identity of the established MA PDU Session in order to trigger the establishment of user-plane resources over the trusted non-3GPP access.\n6.\tOptionally, an authentication procedure may be executed.\n7.\tThe normal SMC Request / Response messages are exchanged to setup NAS security between the UE and the AMF over the trusted non-3GPP access.\n8.\tThe AMF sends an Initial Context Setup Request to TNGF including the TNGF key, which triggers the establishment of the NWt connection between the UE and the TNGF.\n9.\tSince the UE provided a \"List of PDU Sessions To Be Activated\" including the identity of the established MA PDU Session, the AMF sends an Update SM Context Request to SMF to initiate the establishment of user-plane resources over the trusted non-3GPP access for this MA PDU Session. The Update SM Context Request contains a Non-3GPP path switch indication which indicates that the requested update is for switching the data traffic of an MA PDU Session to the trusted non-3GPP access and that the SMF shall not release the existing user-plane resources over the untrusted non-3GPP access. These resources are released later, in step 13.\n10.\tThe user-plane resources over the trusted non-3GPP access are established. At this point, the MA PDU Session has user-plane resources over the untrusted non-3GPP access path, over the trusted non-3GPP access path, and (optionally) over the 3GPP access path. The SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the selected UPF. The UPF may switch the downlink traffic of the MA PDU Session from the untrusted non-3GPP access path to the trusted non-3GPP access path upon receiving updated N4 rules with new AN tunnel info from the SMF. The updated N4 rules indicate the target non-3GPP access to switch traffic. The UE may switch the uplink traffic of the MA PDU Session from the untrusted non-3GPP access path to the trusted non-3GPP access path upon all IPsec Child SAs for the MA PDU Session over trusted non-3GPP access path are established.\n11.\tThe AMF updates its UDM registration for non-3GPP access by sending a UECM Registration Request to UDM including RAT type = Trusted WLAN.\n12.\tBased on the current procedures, the UDM accepts the new registration for non-3GPP access and notifies the AMF that the previous registration for non-3GPP access (performed in step 2) is now deregistered.\n13.\tAfter updating the UDM, the AMF triggers an AN release procedure towards the N3IWF to release the N2 connection and the user-plane resources over the untrusted non-3GPP access.\n14.\tFinally, the registration procedure is completed by sending a Registration Accept message to the UE. When the UE receives the Registration Accept message, it considers that it is deregistered from the untrusted non-3GPP access, and it is registered over the trusted non-3GPP access.\n",

However, full duplication has the highest cost in terms of network resource utilization, and inevitably increases network congestion. When the user plane is becoming congested, blindly using traffic duplication can further increase network congestion. Thus, though an individual UE would expect improved performance, the collective impact of RSM on the overall network performance can be negative. The network should support to enable suspend/reduce the duplication for some time and to some extent.\n",

Thus, when the UPF detects congestion, or when it considers that duplication is not efficient (e.g. since the same packets are being lost on both accesses due to UPF overload, the same performance would be achievable even without duplication), it may override the RSM configuration and can suspend for certain UEs or certain types of SDFs (e.g. for all Non-GBR SDFs) by indicating the access that is suspended for traffic transport. Especially for cases of full duplication, such an adjustment can rapidly address the congestion issue. This adjustment is referred to as Duplication Adjustment operation.\nEditor's note:\tHow the UPF decides when to apply Duplication adjustment besides using implementation specific means is FFS.\nWhen Duplication Adjustment operation is authorized by the PCF in the PCC Rule, the SMF provides an indication for Duplication Adjustment in the ATSSS Rule to the UE, and in the MAR to the UPF.\nOnce the need for duplication adjustment is identified, UPF can easily adapt to such a situation by changing itself the duplication in the downlink. Regarding the uplink though, the UE needs to be informed about this necessary adjustment. This information can be provided by the UPF via user plane by extending PMF Protocol with a new message. The new message can be implemented similarly to the UE assistance provided by the UE to the network in UE-assistance operation, with the difference that the network provides the guidance to the UE and that the UE is obliged to follow the provided guidance.\nEditor's note:\tWhether the UPF can only fully suspend duplication or could also indicate the desired percentage of partial duplication as the necessary adjustment is FFS.\nOnce the UPF decides to terminate the Duplication Adjustment operation, e.g. when the congestion issue is resolved, the UPF sends a PMF protocol termination message to the UE.\nRemark: Duplication Adjustment can be achieved by updating the ATSSS/N4 rules, but such a solution cannot adapt fast enough to dynamically changing user-plane conditions\n",

The following sub-clauses discuss different aspects of these solutions.\nThe solution #2.3 may also be used for UDP traffic flows but this solution is more suitable when IP traffic flows (other than UDP) should be supported, thus, it should be considered separately.\nAs specified in clause 6.3.5, the MP-DCCP-LL solution requires the UPF to allocate: one IP address and two ports (one per access type) per MP-DCCP connection, as shown in the figure below. The UPF allocates the IP addresses and ports for each MP-DCCP connection based on information received from SMF (MP-DCCP-LL Control Information), which indicates how many MP-DCCP connections are required. The SMF derives this information based on the PCC rules received from PCF. If additional MP-DCCP connections are required during the lifetime of the MA PDU Session, the SMF should ask UPF to allocate more resources for these additional connections and then send a PDU Session Modification message to UE including the allocated UPF resources.\nFigure 7.1.3.2-1 (a) illustrates a wireless communication system, showcasing the various components involved in the transmission and reception of signals. The figure depicts a transmitter, which generates radio frequency (RF) signals, and a receiver, which decodes the received signals. The transmitter is connected to a base station, which is responsible for managing the communication between the transmitter and the receiver. The base station is also connected to a network of antennas, which help to amplify and direct the RF signals. The receiver is equipped with an antenna, which receives the RF signals and converts them into a usable format. The figure also shows the use of modulation and demodulation techniques to ensure the signals are transmitted and received accurately. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the components involved in wireless communication and their roles in transmitting and receiving signals.\nFigure 7.1.3.2-1 (a)\nOn the contrary, the MPQUIC solution requires the allocation of one IP address and one UDP port at the UPF, which are used for all MPQUIC connections of a UE. This is possible because the QUIC protocol can multiplex many connections on the same UDP port (using the \"connection ID\" parameter). The UE receives the IP address and UDP port at the UPF as part of the \"proxy information\" in the PDU Session Establishment Accept (exactly the same as in MP-TCP). When the UE needs to establish a new MPQUIC connection to UPF, the UE applies the received \"proxy information\" and does not require additional resources to be allocated at the UPF.\nFigure 7.1.3.2-1 (b) illustrates the signal flow in a satellite communication system, showcasing the transmission of data from a ground station to a satellite and back to the ground station. The figure depicts the use of multiple antennas at the ground station to capture signals from different satellites, as well as the signal processing and modulation techniques employed to enhance data transmission. The diagram emphasizes the importance of efficient signal reception and transmission in satellite communication systems, which are crucial for global connectivity and communication services.\nFigure 7.1.3.2-1 (b)\nThe MPQUIC solution requires one MPQUIC connection per QoS flow (see clause 6.11.2). Each UDP flow transferred via an MPQUIC connection is associated with a unique QUIC stream on the connection and each QUIC stream is configured to apply a steering mode. Thus, different steering modes can be applied per MPQUIC connection.\nThe MP-DCCP-LL requires one connection per QoS flow and per Steering Mode (see clause 6.3.2), so it needs much more connections than MPQUIC. The MP-DCCP-LL connection management (adding / removing connections) is cumbersome: Every time a new UDP flow should be transmitted using a steering mode for which no MP-DCCP connection supports, a new MP-DCCP connection should be established and the SMF should send a PDU Session Modification message with the parameters (UPF address/ports) for this MP-DCCP connection.\nThe MP-DCCP-LL solution specifies that the UE receives \"MP-DCCP Connection Setup Information\", which indicates the QoS flow and the steering mode associated with each MP-DCCP connection. However, it does not specify how the UPF knows the QoS flow and the steering mode associated with each MP-DCCP connection. Without such information, the UPF cannot determine the MP-DCCP connection that should be used for each DL packet. In the MPQUIC solution, the QoS flow associated with an MPQUIC connection is indicated (as a new transport parameter) during the connection setup.\nWhen the UE creates a \"derived\" QoS rule (see TS 23.501 [2]), the MP-DCCP-LL solution does not specify how an MP-DCCP connection can be created to carry the traffic that matches this QoS rule. In case of the MPQUIC solution, when a \"derived\" QoS rules is created, the UE establishes a new MPQUIC connection and indicates to UPF the QFI associated with this connection (using a new QUIC transport parameter).\nIn some cases, it is beneficial that an application can provide information to the underlying steering functionality, e.g. via an enhanced sockets API, such as, when an application implements itself the QUIC protocol and use it for reliable transport (using QUIC Streams). In this case, it could inform the underlying steering functionality that it should apply unreliable transport (e.g. using QUIC Datagrams) to avoid meltdown effects.\nThe MPQUIC steering functionality is a high-layer functionality implemented higher in the protocol stack and can support interactions with the apps, e.g. via an enhanced sockets API (which is outside the scope of this study).\nBoth the MP-DCCP-LL and the MPQUIC send Ack packets to acknowledge successful reception.\nAs shown in figure below, when two (or more) app payloads are provided to the MPQUIC steering functionality, these payloads can be multiplexed in the same QUIC packet, thus, reducing the user-plane overhead (this is a feature supported by QUIC). In addition, a single UDP datagram can multiplex multiple QUIC packets, which can further reduce the overhead.\nNOTE:\tAs a consequence of RFC 9000 [6] the precondition for possible multiplexing of payload packets is that those payload packets fit completely inside a single QUIC packet, which is limited by the maximum MTU size.\nIn case of MP-DCCP-LL, each app payload will be encapsulated into two IP (inner) packets and will be transmitted with two DCCP-Data packets. However, inner header compression (IHC) can be applied by MP-DCCP-LL to reduce the overhead.\nFigure 7.1.3.5-1 illustrates a telecommunication network's signal processing flow, showcasing the various stages of data transmission and reception. The figure begins with the input signal, which is then processed through a series of filters and amplifiers to enhance its quality. The signal is then transmitted through a network of antennas, which are strategically placed to maximize coverage and minimize interference. At the receiving end, the signal is demodulated and decoded to extract the original message. The figure also highlights the importance of error correction and detection techniques to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the complex process involved in modern telecommunication networks.\nFigure 7.1.3.5-1\nThe table below provides an estimate of the size of the additional headers for the solutions #2.1 and #2.2. Note that the exact estimation of the size of the additional headers depends on the implementation (e.g. how a QUIC implementation selects the size of the stream identity) and it is difficult to be calculated. Therefore, the table below provides approximate numbers based on some assumptions. One assumption is that the link-specific multipath IP addresses in the UE and UPF are IPv4.\nTable 7.1.3.5-1\n\nAs specified in RFC 9001 (Using TLS to Secure QUIC), each QUIC connection is established using TLS v1.3 handshake and all QUIC packets are encrypted, and integrity protected using the negotiated TLS keys and algorithms. However, in case of ATSSS_ph3, where QUIC is applied between the UE and UPF and where access-level security mechanisms are used to protect the user-plane traffic, the additional security mechanism in the QUIC layer is unnecessary. The MPQUIC solution contains the following EN, so this issue is expected to be addressed by SA WG3.\nEditor's note:\tWhether and how encryption in the QUIC layer can be omitted is FFS and need to be verified by SA WG3. The impact due to encryption regarding overhead and performance is FFS.\nIt is noted that RFC 9150 \"TLS 1.3 Authentication and Integrity-Only Cipher Suites\" defines cipher suites which \"provide server authentication and data authenticity, but not data confidentiality.\"\nThe double-layer encryption is not an issue for MP-DCCP-LL, which relies on existing access-level security mechanisms to protect the user-plane traffic. However, the security aspects of MP-DCCP-LL will also have to be studied in SA WG3 (as needed for every solution).\nFigure 7.1.3.6-1 illustrates a telecommunication network's signal flow, showcasing the interaction between various nodes and protocols. The figure depicts a network with multiple layers, including the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers. Each layer is represented by distinct components, such as the physical layer's transmitters and receivers, the data link layer's MAC sub-layer, and the network layer's routers. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient communication between these layers, ensuring seamless data transmission and minimal latency. The layout of the network, with its hierarchical structure, highlights the complexity and interdependence of telecommunication systems.\nFigure 7.1.3.6-1\nBoth MP-DCCP-LL and MPQUIC solutions provide the means to support packet reordering and deduplication.\nThe MP-DCCP-LL solution mentions that \"MP-DCCP protocol itself does not specify re-ordering mechanisms but provides path sequencing (DCCP packet sequencing [11]), connection sequencing (MP_SEQ option [12]), and has inherent latency (MP_RTT option [12]) or timing (DCCP timestamp option[11]) information exchange, i.e. all properties that are necessary for the packet receiving side, i.e. UE or UPF, to be able to implement re-ordering properly.\" Although the MP-DCCP draft [12] states that \"The details of the transmission scheduling mechanism and optional reordering mechanism are up to the sender and receiver, respectively, and are outside the scope of the MP-DCCP protocol,\" it is understood that such mechanisms can be considered and possibly defined in stage 3.\nThe MPQUIC solution can readily support reordering and deduplication by leveraging the existing QUIC stream mechanisms, which are applied in the Stream transport mode. So, when the UDP traffic can be transferred in Stream transport mode, no additional mechanisms need to be specified for supporting packet reordering and deduplication.\nIn addition, the MPQUIC solution support Datagram mode 1 (see clause 6.11.3), which supports unreliable transport and inserts sequence numbers in every UDP data packet. In Datagram mode 1, every UDP packet is encapsulated into a QUIC Datagram frame, which also carries a Context ID and a sequence number. The definition of this Context ID, as well as other aspects of Datagram mode 1 (e.g. reordering mechanisms), will be considered in stage 3.\nThe QUIC multipath draft is planned to be published as a Standards Track RFC, while the DCCP multipath draft is planned to be published as an Experimental RFC.\nAs specified in RFC 2026:\n\"Specifications that are not on the standards track are labelled with one of three \"off-track\" maturity levels:  \"Experimental\", \"Informational\", or \"Historic\".  The documents bearing these labels are not Internet Standards in any sense.\"\nNOTE:\tThe TCP converter used by the MPTCP proxy is based on the Experimental RFC 8803.\n",

If this new steering mode is applied by UE and UPF, the traffic is transmitted via 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in a redundant way.\nConsidering redundant transmission is costly, which consumes at maximum double resources compared with normal transmission without duplication, duplication criteria may be defined to indicate when RSM should be initiated. In other words, predefined conditions or criteria, as proposed by quite a few solutions, such as solution 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, can be defined as trigger points for initiating redundant transmission. The duplication criteria may not always be needed as, in some cases, applications may always require redundant transmission without criteria for activation / deactivation.\nOne of the major benefits of redundant transmission is to reduce packet loss rate, therefore Packet loss rate should be taken as one of the criteria. Except packet loss rate, other criteria proposed by solution 3.3 and / or solution 3.4 to trigger redundant transmission, include Round Trip Time (RTT), jitter, percentage of duplicated traffic and load on an access network.\nAnother benefit of redundant transmission is to reduce the RTT. If the RTT via both accesses cannot satisfy the traffic requirement, the redundant transmission can reduce the RTT because the receiver always selects the packet that arrives faster. Note that if the RTT over 3GPP access is smaller than the RTT over non-3GPP access, this does not mean that all packets arrive faster via 3GPP access. Some percentage of packets will arrive faster via non-3GPP and since the receiver always selects the packet that arrives first, this means that the RTT due to redundant transmission will be smaller than the RTT over 3GPP access and than the RTT over non-3GPP access. However, if both accesses exceed the threshold, but the RTT differs a lot between the two accesses, duplication will not help much. A few packets may arrive earlier via the slow access (depending on the jitter) but the max delay may not decrease in any significant way. Redundant steering based on RTT threshold may thus not be better than using Lowest-Delay steering mode but consumes more resources.\nEditor's note:\tEvaluation of the duplication factor is FFS.\n",

Solution #3.7 proposes to temporarily suspend the use of duplication, whenever it is beneficial for the overall network performance, e.g. due to UPF congestion. Although this can be performed by updating ATSSS and N4 rules, such a pure control-plane solution would be slow and not flexible enough, as it requires the coordination of several network entities. Instead, the UPF can react immediately, and user-plane suspension can be implemented by extensions of the PMF protocol as per solution #3.7.\n",

                    "text_content": "There are two categories of solutions for KI#5, called Option 1 and Option 2:\n-\tOption 1: Switching the data traffic after the Registration procedure (Solution #5.1, #5.3 and #5.4):\n-\tThese solutions propose to perform the Registration procedure over the new non-3GPP access first and after the procedure is finishes, the UE adds a new leg to the existing MA PDU Session by re-using existing access addition procedure. After the access addition is completed, the network performs access release / deregistration over the old non-3GPP access.\nThe main impact of these solutions is maintaining two simultaneous registrations over two non-3GPP accesses. There may exist undisclosed impacts to the system as the overall solution describes only access switching aspects and other procedures are not investigated in detail.\nIn solution #5.1, #5.3 there is impact to the UE, AMF, SMF, UPF and UDM. In solution #5.4, there is no clear description that there is impact to the UDM. However, it seems that the UDM needs to maintain two simultaneous registration states so there is impact to the UDM.\n-\tOption 2: Switching the data traffic during the Registration procedure (Solution #5.2, #5.5 and #5.6):\n-\tThese solutions propose to perform access switching during the Registration procedure over the new non-3GPP access, i.e. there is no need to trigger additional procedure for access switching after the Registration procedure.\nIn these solutions, there is no need to maintain simultaneous registration over two non-3GPP accesses. This enables to perform access switching by registering over the new non-3GPP access without need to trigger another session related procedure to add additional access to the existing MA PDU Session.\nIn solution #5.2 and #5.6, there is impact to the UE, AMF, SMF, UPF while in solution #5.5 there is additional impact to the UDM.\nSeveral aspects of Option 1 and Option 2 are considered below.\nPath switching (PS) capability indication:\nFor option 1:\n-\tUE capability indication - since the traffic switching is initiated by UE, the UE shall be able to support traffic switching. Limiting UE's path switching capability by include indication in its subscription is not necessary since there is no capability indication in subscription for path switching within 3GPP accesses.\n-\tNetwork capability indication - an indication is sent to the UE before switching traffic in order to prevent the UE from initiating the path switching when the AMF/SMF does not support it.\nPath switching (PS) indication:\nFor option 1:\n-\tAMF needs to be informed that this registration via target non-3GPP access is intended for switching the traffic between two non-3GPP access paths. It is used by the AMF to maintain temporary dual-registration via two non-3GPP accesses during the PS procedure. This indication is necessary to allow the AMF to distinguish the scenario where the registration shall be immediately replaced, or temporary registration is maintained for 2 N3GPP accesses.\n-\tSMF needs to be informed that this PDU session establishment request via non-3GPP access is intended for switching the traffic between two non-3GPP access paths. in order to allow the SMF to establish new UP resources on the target access while existing UP resources in source non-3GPP access are preserved.\n-\tConsidering that these two indicators are both necessary and they are only applicable for non-3GPP traffic switching, it is preferable to define only 1 indicator (information element) which is used by both AMF and SMF.\nFor option 2:\n-\tIn this option the UE register for the purpose of traffic switching. When the AMF receives the path switching indication from UE, it shall update the SM context of UE in order to trigger the user-plane resources establishment. The registration results would also indicate whether the path switching between two non-3GPP accesses is success or not. Therefore, from the point of view of the whole procedure, the definition of a new registration type is preferred for option 2.\nList of PDU session indication:\nFor option 1:\n-\tSince UE performs PDU session establishment after the end of registration procedure, the UE can indicate the list of PDU session that wants to move in PDU session establishment and therefore it is not necessary to include list of PDU session in Registration Request procedures.\nFor option 2:\n-\tList of PDU session is already supported in the Registration message. It can used for SMF to distinguish which PDU session the UE is requesting to move, thus it is necessary.\nDeregistration timer:\nFor option 1:\n-\tThe AMF needs to determine the maximum time for maintaining the UE registered via two non-3GPP access in order to allow the UE to perform the establishment of PDU session on target non-3GPP access, but to avoid also to keep for a long time the two registrations, for example when the UE does not establish PDU session on target access for some unexpected reason. The usage of a timer is not necessary for SMF.\nFor option 2:\n-\tIt is not required since PS is completed during registration.\nMaintenance of N2 sessions\nFor option 1:\n-\tThe UE registers in new non-3GPP access while the UE is still registered in the old non-3GPP access. The AMF maintains two non-3GPP access registrations (and possibly a 3GPP access registration) while a PDU Session Establishment procedure is performed. The AMF thus needs to maintain two non-3GPP N2 sessions across several procedures.\nFor option 2:\n-\tThe path switch takes place during a single procedure (Registration). In order to allow the old user plane to be available while the new user plane is being established, the AMF can establish a N2 session in new non-3GPP access before releasing the N2 session in old non-3GPP access. The AMF thus needs to maintain two non-3GPP N2 sessions within the Registration procedure. Alternatively, the AMF can release the old N2 session before establishing the new N2 session, and in that case, AMF always has only a single N2 session for non-3GPP access.\nATSSS rules update:\n-\tWhen UE completes user-plane resources establishment on target non-3GPP access, two non-3GPP accesses paths can be available before that the user-plane resource of source non-3GPP access would be released. If UE has UL traffic to be transmitted, the UE may select either the target or the source non-3GPP access.\nFor option 1:\n-\tIf source non-3GPP access is selected, the service over non-3GPP access would be interrupted when user-plane resource of source non-3GPP access is released afterward. Enhancements on ATSSS rule with indication of the RAT type (Trusted or Untrusted N3GPP) to be used would solve the issue and improve the service continuity. Thus, updated ATSSS rule with the indication of RAT-type to be used is required.\nFor option 2:\n-\tThe UE switches the UL to the new non-3GPP access when the new non-3GPP access user plane connectivity is available. There is no need to modify the ATSSS rules due to the path switch.\nN4 rules update:\n-\tSince the AN tunnel info changes after switching which is allocated by the target N3GPP access node (e.g. N3IWF or TNGF), the N4 rules including the target AN tunnel info need to be updated to UPF.\nPS for SA PDU session:\nFor option 1 & 2:\n-\tAll existing solutions can support PS for single access PDU session between Trusted and Untrusted network, i.e. with change of RAT type.\nPS for same RAT type:\nFor option 1 & 2:\n-\tThe Trusted and Untrusted N3GPP access mandates the support of MOBIKE (RFC 4555 [35]) which enables the mobility of one peer end points (but not of both end point at the same time). For example, in TS 23502 [3] for Trusted N3GPP is defined the following:\n-\t\"In step 13c, the TNGF provides to UE (a) an \"inner\" IP address, (b) a NAS_IP_ADDRESS and a TCP port number and (c) a DSCP value. After this step, an IPsec SA is established between the UE and TNGF. This is referred to as the \"signalling IPsec SA\" and operates in Tunnel mode. Operation in Tunnel mode enables the use of MOBIKE [40] for re-establishing the IPsec SAs when the IP address of the UE changes during mobility events. All IP packets exchanged between the UE and TNGF via the \"signalling IPsec SA\" shall be marked with the above DSCP value. The UE and the TNAP may map the DSCP value to a QoS level (e.g. to an EDCA Access Class [48]) supported by the underlying non-3GPP Access Network. The mapping of a DSCP value to a QoS level of the non-3GPP Access Network is outside the scope of 3GPP\n-\tTherefore, mobility of UE between different access network without changing of anchor Access node, as shown in figure 1, is currently supported.\n-\tThe mobility of UE between the same access network type (RAT-type) with changing of anchor Access node, as shown in figure 2, is not supported by MOBIKE (see RFC 4555 [35]) hence it would be good if the solution selected for support PS for SA PDU session between Trusted and Untrusted N3GPP access supports to the scenario of PS for SA PDU session without changing of RAT type.\nFigure 7.3-1 illustrates the seamless mobility of a User Equipment (UE) between two Non-3GPP Access Networks (ANs) without the need for changing the access node. The figure showcases the UE's transition from one network to another, highlighting the efficient handover process that ensures uninterrupted connectivity. Key components include the home and visited ANs, as well as the signaling and control mechanisms that enable a smooth handover. The figure emphasizes the importance of such seamless mobility in providing a high-quality user experience across different network environments.\nFigure 7.3-1: Mobility of UE between 2 N3GPP access networks without changing of access node\nFigure 7.3-2 illustrates the mobility of a User Equipment (UE) between two Non-3GPP Access Networks (ANs) as it changes its Access Node (AN) from N3IWF to another AN. The figure depicts the UE's movement across the two networks, highlighting the seamless handover process that ensures uninterrupted connectivity. The figure showcases the coordination between the ANs, including the involvement of the Home Node Group (HNG) and the Inter-AN Mobility Management (IAM) procedures. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of efficient handover mechanisms in maintaining high-quality communication services for mobile users transitioning between different network infrastructures.\nFigure 7.3-2: Mobility of UE between 2 N3GPP access networks with changing of AN node (e.g. N3IWF)\nThe following table lists evaluation aspects of existing proposed solutions.\nTable 7.3-1: Evaluation aspects of solutions\n\nAdditional evaluation aspects for the KI#5 solutions are considered below. In particular, the following key aspects are considered:\n-\tNew registration type = \"non-3GPP path switch\" or registration type = \"initial\" + new IE or registration type = \"mobility\" + new IE.\n-\tCapability exchange between UE and network:\n-\t5G Session Management (5GSM) capability exchange.\n-\t5G Mobility Management (5GMM) capability exchange.\n-\tPDU Session Establishment in the new non-3GPP access without requiring UE initiated PDU Session Establishment/Modification signalling.\n-\tAMF update of RAT Type in UDM after user plane resources establishment in the new non-3GPP access.\n-\tTimer related to de-registration of new non-3GPP access.\n-\tImpacts on existing Nodes and Functionality.\nTables 7.3-2 & 7.3-3 compare several key aspects where they differ or are align.\nTable 7.3-2: Comparison of Solutions to Evaluation Items\n\nTable 7.3-3: Comparison of Solutions to Impacts on existing Nodes and Functionality\n\n",
